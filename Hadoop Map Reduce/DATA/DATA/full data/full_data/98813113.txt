farewell                                    chapter lxxix     volume i  chapter i  the commencement of the great orley farm case   it is not true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet were it true i should call this story the great orley farm case but who would ask for the ninth number of a serial work burthened with so very uncouth an appellation thence and thereforeorley farm  i say so much at commencing in order that i may have an opportunity of explaining that this book of mine will not be devoted in any special way to rural delights the name might lead to the idea that new precepts were to be given in the pleasant guise of a novel as to creamcheeses pigs with small bones wheat sown in drills or artificial manure no such aspirations are mine i make no attempts in that line and declare at once that agriculturists will gain nothing from my present performance orley farm my readers will be our scene during a portion of our present sojourn together but the name has been chosen as having been intimately connected with certain legal questions which made a considerable stir in our courts of law  it was twenty years before the date at which this story will be supposed to commence that the name of orley farm first became known to the wearers of the long robe at that time had died an old gentleman sir joseph mason who left behind him a landed estate in yorkshire of considerable extent and value this he bequeathed in a proper way to his eldest son the joseph mason esq of our date sir joseph had been a london merchant had made his own money having commenced the world no doubt with half a crown had become in turn alderman mayor and knight and in the fulness of time was gathered to his fathers he had purchased this estate in yorkshire late in lifewe may as well become acquainted with the name groby parkand his eldest son had lived there with such enjoyment of the privileges of an english country gentleman as he had been able to master for himself sir joseph had also had three daughters full sisters of joseph of groby whom he endowed sufficiently and gave over to three respective loving husbands and then shortly before his death three years or so sir joseph had married a second wife a lady fortyfive years his junior and by her he also left one son an infant only two years old when he died  for many years this prosperous gentleman had lived at a small country house some fiveandtwenty miles from london called orley farm this had been his first purchase of land and he had never given up his residence there although his wealth would have entitled him to the enjoyment of a larger establishment on the birth of his youngest son at which time his eldest was nearly forty years old he made certain moderate provision for the infant as he had already made moderate provision for his young wife but it was then clearly understood by the eldest son that orley farm was to go with the groby park estate to him as the heir when however sir joseph died a codicil to his will executed with due legal formalities bequeathed orley farm to his youngest son little lucius mason  then commenced those legal proceedings which at last developed themselves into the great orley farm case the eldest son contested the validity of the codicil and indeed there were some grounds on which it appeared feasible that he should do so this codicil not only left orley farm away from him to baby lucius but also interfered in another respect with the previous will it devised a sum of two thousand pounds to a certain miriam usbech the daughter of one jonathan usbech who was himself the attorney who had attended upon sir joseph for the making out of this very will and also of this very codicil this sum of two thousand pounds was not it is true left away from the surviving joseph but was to be produced out of certain personal property which had been left by the first will to the widow and then old jonathan usbech had died while sir joseph mason was still living  all the circumstances of the trial need not be detailed here it was clearly proved that sir joseph had during his whole life expressed his intention of leaving orley farm to his eldest son that he was a man void of mystery and not given to secrets in his money matters and one very little likely to change his opinion on such subjects it was proved that old jonathan usbech at the time in which the will was made was in very bad circumstances both as regards money and health his business had once not been bad but he had eaten and drunk it and at this period was feeble and penniless overwhelmed both by gout and debt he had for many years been much employed by sir joseph in money matters and it was known that he was so employed almost up to the day of his death the question was whether he had been employed to make this codicil  the body of the will was in the handwriting of the widow as was also the codicil it was stated by her at the trial that the words were dictated to her by usbech in her husbands hearing and that the document was then signed by her husband in the presence of them both and also in the presence of two other personsa young man employed by her husband as a clerk and by a servantmaid these two last together with mr usbech were the three witnesses whose names appeared in the codicil there had been no secrets between lady mason and her husband as to his will she had always she said endeavoured to induce him to leave orley farm to her child from the day of the childs birth and had at last succeeded in agreeing to this sir joseph had explained to her somewhat angrily that he wished to provide for usbechs daughter and that now he would do so out of moneys previously intended for her the widow and not out of the estate which would go to his eldest son to this she had assented without a word and had written the codicil in accordance with the lawyers dictation he the lawyer suffering at the time from gout in his hand among other things lady mason proved that on the date of the signatures mr usbech had been with sir joseph for sundry hours  then the young clerk was examined he had he said witnessed in his time four ten twenty and under pressure he confessed to as many as a hundred and twenty business signatures on the part of his employer sir joseph he thought he had witnessed a hundred and twenty but would take his oath he had not witnessed a hundred and twentyone he did remember witnessing a signature of his master about the time specified by the date of the codicil and he remembered the maidservant also signing at the same time mr usbech was then present but he did not remember mr usbech having the pen in his hand mr usbech he knew could not write at that time because of the gout but he might no doubt have written as much as his own name he swore to both the signatureshis own and his masters and in crossexamination swore that he thought it probable that they might be forgeries on reexamination he was confident that his own name as there appearing had been written by himself but on recrossexamination he felt sure that there was something wrong it ended in the judge informing him that his word was worth nothing which was hard enough on the poor young man seeing that he had done his best to tell all that he remembered then the servantgirl came into the witnessbox she was sure it was her own handwriting she remembered being called in to write her name and seeing the master write his it had all been explained to her at the time but she admitted that she had not understood the explanation she had also seen the clerk write his name but she was not sure that she had seen mr usbech write mr usbech had had a pen in his hand she was sure of that  the last witness was miriam usbech then a very pretty simple girl of seventeen her father had told her once that he hoped sir joseph would make provision for her this had been shortly before her fathers death at her fathers death she had been sent for to orley farm and had remained there till sir joseph died she had always regarded sir joseph and lady mason as her best friends she had known sir joseph all her life and did not think it unnatural that he should provide for her she had heard her father say more than once that lady mason would never rest till the old gentleman had settled orley farm upon her son  not half the evidence taken has been given here but enough probably for our purposes the will and codicil were confirmed and lady mason continued to live at the farm her evidence was supposed to have been excellently given and to have been conclusive she had seen the signature and written the codicil and could explain the motive she was a woman of high character of great talent and of repute in the neighbourhood and as the judge remarked there could be no possible reason for doubting her word nothing also could be simpler or prettier than the evidence of miriam usbech as to whose fate and destiny people at the time expressed much sympathy that stupid young clerk was responsible for the only weak part of the matter but if he proved nothing on one side neither did he prove anything on the other  this was the commencement of the great orley farm case and having been then decided in favour of the infant it was allowed to slumber for nearly twenty years the codicil was confirmed and lady mason remained undisturbed in possession of the house acting as guardian for her child till he came of age and indeed for some time beyond that epoch in the course of a page or two i shall beg my readers to allow me to introduce this lady to their acquaintance  miriam usbech of whom also we shall see something remained at the farm under lady masons care till she married a young attorney who in process of time succeeded to such business as her father left behind him she suffered some troubles in life before she settled down in the neighbouring country town as mrs dockwrath for she had had another lover the stupid young clerk who had so villainously broken down in his evidence and to this other lover whom she had been unable to bring herself to accept lady mason had given her favour and assistance poor miriam was at that time a soft mildeyed girl easy to be led one would have said but in this matter lady mason could not lead her it was in vain to tell her that the character of young dockwrath did not stand high and that young kenneby the clerk should be promoted to all manner of good things soft and mildeyed as miriam was love was still the lord of all in this matter she would not be persuaded and eventually she gave her two thousand pounds to samuel dockwrath the young attorney with the questionable character  this led to no breach between her and her patroness lady mason wishing to do the best for her young friend had favoured john kenneby but she was not a woman at all likely to quarrel on such a ground as this well miriam she had said you must judge for yourself of course in such a matter as this you know my regard for you  oh yes maam said miriam eagerly  and i shall always be glad to promote your welfare as mrs dockwrath if possible i can only say that i should have had more satisfaction in attempting to do so for you as mrs kenneby but in spite of the seeming coldness of these words lady mason had been constant to her friend for many years and had attended to her with more or less active kindness in all the sorrows arising from an annual baby and two sets of twinsa progeny which before the commencement of my tale reached the serious number of sixteen all living  among other solid benefits conferred by lady mason had been the letting to mr dockwrath of certain two fields lying at the extremity of the farm property and quite adjacent to the town of hamworth in which old mr usbech had resided these had been let by the year at a rent not considered to be too high at that period and which had certainly become much lower in proportion to the value of the land as the town of hamworth had increased on these fields mr dockwrath expended some money though probably not so much as he averred and when noticed to give them up at the period of young masons coming of age expressed himself terribly aggrieved  surely mr dockwrath you are very ungrateful lady mason had said to him but he had answered her with disrespectful words and hence had arisen an actual breach between her and poor miriams husband i must say miriam that mr dockwrath is unreasonable lady mason had said and what could a poor wife answer oh lady mason pray let it bide a time till it all comes right but it never did come right and the affair of those two fields created the great orley farm case which it will be our business to unravel  and now a word or two as to this orley farm in the first place let it be understood that the estate consisted of two farms one called the old farm was let to an old farmer named greenwood and had been let to him and to his father for many years antecedent to the days of the masons mr greenwood held about three hundred acres of land paying with admirable punctuality over four hundred a year in rent and was regarded by all the orley people as an institution on the property then there was the farmhouse and the land attached to it this was the residence in which sir joseph had lived keeping in his own hands this portion of the property when first inhabited by him the house was not fitted for more than the requirements of an ordinary farmer but he had gradually added to it and ornamented it till it was commodious irregular picturesque and straggling when he died and during the occupation of his widow it consisted of three buildings of various heights attached to each other and standing in a row the lower contained a large kitchen which had been the livingroom of the farmhouse and was surrounded by bakehouse laundry dairy and servants room all of fair dimensions it was two stories high but the rooms were low and the roof steep and covered with tiles the next portion had been added by sir joseph then mr mason when he first thought of living at the place this also was tiled and the rooms were nearly as low but there were three stories and the building therefore was considerably higher for fiveandtwenty years the farmhouse so arranged had sufficed for the common wants of sir joseph and his family but when he determined to give up his establishment in the city he added on another step to the house at orley farm on this occasion he built a good diningroom with a drawingroom over it and bedroom over that and this portion of the edifice was slated  the whole stood in one line fronting on to a large lawn which fell steeply away from the house into an orchard at the bottom this lawn was cut in terraces and here and there upon it there stood appletrees of ancient growth for here had been the garden of the old farmhouse they were large straggling trees such as do not delight the eyes of modern gardeners but they produced fruit by the bushel very sweet to the palate though probably not so perfectly round and large and handsome as those which the horticultural skill of the present day requires the face of the house from one end to the other was covered with vines and passionflowers for the aspect was due south and as the whole of the later addition was faced by a verandah which also as regarded the groundfloor ran along the middle building the place in summer was pretty enough as i have said before it was irregular and straggling but at the same time roomy and picturesque such was orley farmhouse  there were about two hundred acres of land attached to it together with a large oldfashioned farmyard standing not so far from the house as most gentlemen farmers might perhaps desire the farm buildings however were well hidden for sir joseph though he would at no time go to the expense of constructing all anew had spent more money than such a proceeding would have cost him doctoring existing evils and ornamenting the standing edifices in doing this he had extended the walls of a brewhouse and covered them with creepers so as to shut out from the hall door the approach to the farmyard and had put up a quarter of a mile of high ornamental paling for the same purpose he had planted an extensive shrubbery along the brow of the hill at one side of the house had built summerhouses and sunk a haha fence below the orchard and had contrived to give to the place the unmistakable appearance of an english gentlemans countryhouse nevertheless sir joseph had never bestowed upon his estate nor had it ever deserved a more grandiloquent name than that which it had possessed of old  orley farmhouse itself is somewhat more than a mile distant from the town of hamworth but the land runs in the direction of the town not skirting the high road but stretching behind the cottages which stand along the pathway and it terminates in those two fields respecting which mr dockwrath the attorney became so irrationally angry at the period of which we are now immediately about to treat these fields lie on the steep slope of hamworth hill and through them runs the public path from the hamlet of roxeth up to hamworth church for as all the world knows hamworth church stands high and is a landmark to the world for miles and miles around  within a circuit of thirty miles from london no land lies more beautifully circumstanced with regard to scenery than the country about hamworth and its most perfect loveliness commences just beyond the slopes of orley farm there is a little village called coldharbour consisting of some halfdozen cottages situated immediately outside lady masons gateand it may as well be stated here that this gate is but three hundred yards from the house and is guarded by no lodge this village stands at the foot of cleeve hill the land hereabouts ceases to be fertile and breaks away into heath and common ground round the foot of the hill there are extensive woods all of which belong to sir peregrine orme the lord of the manor sir peregrine is not a rich man not rich that is it being borne in mind that he is a baronet that he represented his county in parliament for three or four sessions and that his ancestors have owned the cleeve estate for the last four hundred years but he is by general repute the greatest man in these parts we may expect to hear more of him also as the story makes its way  i know many spots in england and in other lands worldfamous in regard to scenery which to my eyes are hardly equal to cleeve hill from the top of it you are told that you may see into seven counties but to me that privilege never possessed any value i should not care to see into seventeen counties unless the country which spread itself before my view was fair and lovely the country which is so seen from cleeve hill is exquisitely fair and lovelyvery fair with glorious fields of unsurpassed fertility and lovely with oak woods and brown open heaths which stretch away hill after hill down towards the southern coast i could greedily fill a long chapter with the wellloved glories of cleeve hill but it may be that we must press its heather with our feet more than once in the course of our present task and if so it will be well to leave something for those coming visits  ungrateful ill let her know whether i owe her any gratitude havent i paid her her rent every halfyear as it came due what more would she have ungrateful indeed she is one of those women who think that you ought to go down on your knees to them if they only speak civilly to you ill let her know whether im ungrateful  these words were spoken by angry mr samuel dockwrath to his wife as he stood up before his parlourfire after breakfast and the woman to whom he referred was lady mason mr samuel dockwrath was very angry as he so spoke or at any rate he seemed to be so there are men who take a delight in abusing those special friends whom their wives best love and mr dockwrath was one of these he had never given his cordial consent to the intercourse which had hitherto existed between the lady of orley farm and his household although he had not declined the substantial benefits which had accompanied it his pride had rebelled against the feeling of patronage though his interest had submitted to the advantages thence derived a family of sixteen children is a heavy burden for a country attorney with a small practice even though his wife may have had a fortune of two thousand pounds and thus mr dockwrath though he had never himself loved lady mason had permitted his wife to accept all those numberless kindnesses which a lady with comfortable means and no children is always able to bestow on a favoured neighbour who has few means and many children indeed he himself had accepted a great favour with reference to the holding of those two fields and had acknowledged as much when first he took them into his hands some sixteen or seventeen years back but all that was forgotten now and having held them for so long a period he bitterly felt the loss and resolved that it would ill become him as a man and an attorney to allow so deep an injury to pass unnoticed it may be moreover that mr dockwrath was now doing somewhat better in the world than formerly and that he could afford to give up lady mason and to demand also that his wife should give her up those trumpery presents from orley farm were very well while he was struggling for bare bread but now now that he had turned the cornernow that by his divine art and mystery of law he had managed to become master of that beautiful result of british perseverance a balance at his bankers he could afford to indulge his natural antipathy to a lady who had endeavoured in early life to divert from him the little fortune which had started him in the world  miriam dockwrath as she sat on this morning listening to her husbands anger with a sick little girl on her knee and four or five others clustering round her half covered with their matutinal bread and milk was mildeyed and soft as ever hers was a nature in which softness would ever prevailsoftness and that tenderness of heart always leaning and sometimes almost crouching of which a mild eye is the outward sign but her comeliness and prettiness were gone female beauty of the sterner grander sort may support the burden of sixteen children all livingand still survive i have known it to do so and to survive with much of its youthful glory but that mildeyed soft round plumpy prettiness gives way beneath such a weight as that years alone tell on it quickly but children and limited means combined with years leave to it hardly a chance  im sure im very sorry said the poor woman worn with her many cares  sorry yes and ill make her sorry the proud minx theres an old saying that those who live in glass houses shouldnt throw stones  but samuel i dont think she means to be doing you any harm you know she always did say dont bessy how can you put your fingers into the basin in that way  sam has taken my spoon away mamma  ill let her know whether shes doing any harm or no and what signifies what was said sixteen years ago has she anything to show in writing as far as i know nothing of the kind was said  oh i remember it samuel i do indeed  let me tell you then that you had better not try to remember anything about it if you aint quiet bob ill make you pretty quick dye hear that the fact is your memory is not worth a curse where are you to get milk for all those children do you think when the fields are gone  im sure im very sorry samuel  sorry yes and somebody else shall be sorry too and look here miriam i wont have you going up to orley farm on any pretence whatever do you hear that and then having given that imperative command to his wife and slave the lord and master of that establishment walked forth into his office  on the whole miriam usbech might have done better had she followed the advice of her patroness in early life and married the stupid clerk     chapter ii  lady mason and her son   i trust that it is already perceived by all persistent novel readers that very much of the interest of this tale will be centred in the person of lady mason such educated persons however will probably be aware that she is not intended to be the heroine the heroine so called must by a certain fixed law be young and marriageable some such heroine in some future number shall be forthcoming with as much of the heroic about her as may be found convenient but for the present let it be understood that the person and character of lady mason is as important to us as can be those of any young lady let her be ever so gracious or ever so beautiful  in giving the details of her history i do not know that i need go back beyond her grandfather and grandmother who were thoroughly respectable people in the hardware line i speak of those relatives by the fathers side her own parents had risen in the worldhad risen from retail to wholesale and considered themselves for a long period of years to be good representatives of the commercial energy and prosperity of great britain but a fall had come upon themas a fall does come very often to our excellent commercial representativesand mr johnson was in the gazette it would be long to tell how old sir joseph mason was concerned in these affairs how he acted as the principal assignee and how ultimately he took to his bosom as his portion of the assets of the estate young mary johnson and made her his wife and mistress of orley farm of the family of the johnsons there were but three others the father the mother and a brother the father did not survive the disgrace of his bankruptcy and the mother in process of time settled herself with her son in one of the lancashire manufacturing towns where john johnson raised his head in business to some moderate altitude sir joseph having afforded much valuable assistance there for the present we will leave them  i do not think that sir joseph ever repented of the perilous deed he did in marrying that young wife his home for many years had been desolate and solitary his children had gone from him and did not come to visit him very frequently in his poor home at the farm they had become grander people than him had been gifted with aspiring minds and in every turn and twist which they took looked to do something towards washing themselves clean from the dirt of the countinghouse this was specially the case with sir josephs son to whom the father had made over lands and money sufficient to enable him to come before the world as a country gentleman with a coat of arms on his coachpanel it would be inconvenient for us to run off to groby park at the present moment and i will therefore say no more just now as to joseph junior but will explain that joseph senior was not made angry by this neglect he was a grave quiet rational man not however devoid of some folly as indeed what rational man is so devoid he was burdened with an ambition to establish a family as the result of his success in life and having put forth his son into the world with these views was content that that son should act upon them persistently joseph mason esq of groby park in yorkshire was now a county magistrate and had made some way towards a footing in the county society around him with these hopes and ambition such as this it was probably not expedient that he should spend much of his time at orley farm the three daughters were circumstanced much in the same way they had all married gentlemen and were bent on rising in the world moreover the steadfast resolution of purpose which characterised their father was known by them alland by their husbands they had received their fortunes with some settled contingencies to be forthcoming on their fathers demise why then trouble the old gentleman at orley farm  under such circumstances the old gentleman married his young wifeto the great disgust of his four children they of course declared to each other corresponding among themselves by letter that the old gentleman had positively disgraced himself it was impossible that they should make any visits whatever to orley farm while such a mistress of the house was thereand the daughters did make no such visits joseph the son whose monetary connection with his father was as yet by no means fixed and settled in its nature did make one such visit and then received his fathers assuranceso at least he afterwards said and sworethat this marriage should by no means interfere with the expected inheritance of the orley farm acres but at that time no young son had been bornnor probably was any such young son expected  the farmhouse became a much brighter abode for the old man for the few years which were left to him after he had brought his young wife home she was quiet sensible clever and unremitting in her attention she burthened him with no requests for gay society and took his home as she found it making the best of it for herself and making it for him much better than he had ever hitherto known it his own children had always looked down upon him regarding him merely as a coffer from whence money might be had and he though he had never resented this contempt had in a certain measure been aware of it but there was no such feeling shown by his wife she took the benefits which he gave her graciously and thankfully and gave back to him in return certainly her care and time and apparently her love for herself in the way of wealth and money she never asked for anything  and then the baby had come young lucius mason and there was of course great joy at orley farm the old father felt that the world had begun again for him very delightfully and was more than ever satisfied with his wisdom in regard to that marriage but the very genteel progeny of his early youth were more than ever dissatisfied and in their letters among themselves dealt forth harder and still harder words upon poor sir joseph what terrible things might he not be expected to do now that his dotage was coming on those three married ladies had no selfish fearsso at least they declared but they united in imploring their brother to look after his interests at orley farm how dreadfully would the young heir of groby be curtailed in his dignities and seignories if it should be found at the last day that orley farm was not to be written in his rentroll  and then while they were yet bethinking themselves how they might best bestir themselves news arrived that sir joseph had suddenly died sir joseph was dead and the will when read contained a codicil by which that young brat was made the heir to the orley farm estate i have said that lady mason during her married life had never asked of her husband anything for herself but in the law proceedings which were consequent upon sir josephs death it became abundantly evident that she had asked him for much for her sonand that she had been specific in her requests urging him to make a second heir and to settle orley farm upon her own boy lucius she herself stated that she had never done this except in the presence of a third person she had often done so in the presence of mr usbech the attorneyas to which mr usbech was not alive to testify and she had also done so more than once in the presence of mr furnival a barristeras to which mr furnival being alive did testifyvery strongly  as to that contest nothing further need now be said it resulted in the favour of young lucius mason and therefore also in the favour of the widowin the favour moreover of miriam usbech and thus ultimately in the favour of mr samuel dockwrath who is now showing himself to be so signally ungrateful joseph mason however retired from the battle nothing convinced his father he said had been an old fool an ass an idiot a vulgar ignorant fool but he was not a man to break his word that signature to the codicil might be his or might not if his it had been obtained by fraud what could be easier than to cheat an old doting fool many men agreed with joseph mason thinking that usbech the attorney had perpetrated this villainy on behalf of his daughter but joseph mason would believe or say that he believeda belief in which none but his sisters joined himthat lady mason herself had been the villain he was minded to press the case on to a court of appeal up even to the house of lords but he was advised that in doing so he would spend more money than orley farm was worth and that he would almost to a certainty spend it in vain under this advice he cursed the laws of his country and withdrew to groby park  lady mason had earned the respect of all those around her by the way in which she bore herself in the painful days of the trial and also in those of her successespecially also by the manner in which she gave her evidence and thus though she had not been much noticed by her neighbours during the short period of her married life she was visited as a widow by many of the more respectable people round hamworth in all this she showed no feeling of triumph she never abused her husbands relatives or spoke much of the harsh manner in which she had been used indeed she was not given to talk about her own personal affairs and although as i have said many of her neighbours visited her she did not lay herself out for society she accepted and returned their attention but for the most part seemed to be willing that the matter should so rest the people around by degrees came to know her ways they spoke to her when they met her and occasionally went through the ceremony of a morning call but did not ask her to their teaparties and did not expect to see her at picnic and archery meetings  among those who took her by the hand in the time of her great trouble was sir peregrine orme of the cleevefor such was the name which had belonged time out of mind to his old mansion and park sir peregrine was a gentleman now over seventy years of age whose family consisted of the widow of his only son and the only son of that widow who was of course the heir to his estate and title sir peregrine was an excellent old man as i trust may hereafter be acknowledged but his regard for lady mason was perhaps in the first instance fostered by his extreme dislike to her stepson joseph mason of groby mr joseph mason of groby was quite as rich a man as sir peregrine and owned an estate which was nearly as large as the cleeve property but sir peregrine would not allow that he was a gentleman or that he could by any possible transformation become one he had not probably ever said so in direct words to any of the mason family but his opinion on the matter had in some way worked its way down to yorkshire and therefore there was no love to spare between these two county magistrates there had been a slight acquaintance between sir peregrine and sir joseph but the ladies of the two families had never met till after the death of the latter then while that trial was still pending mrs orme had come forward at the instigation of her fatherinlaw and by degrees there had grown up an intimacy between the two widows when the first offers of assistance were made and accepted sir peregrine no doubt did not at all dream of any such result as this his family pride and especially the pride which he took in his widowed daughterinlaw would probably have been shocked by such a surmise but nevertheless he had seen the friendship grow and increase without alarm he himself had become attached to lady mason and had gradually learned to excuse in her that want of gentle blood and early breeding which as a rule he regarded as necessary to a gentleman and from which alone as he thought could spring many of those excellences which go to form the character of a lady  it may therefore be asserted that lady masons widowed life was successful that it was prudent and well conducted no one could doubt her neighbours of course did say of her that she would not drink tea with mrs arkwright of mount pleasant villa because she was allowed the privilege of entering sir peregrines drawingroom but such little scandal as this was a matter of course let one live according to any possible or impossible rule yet some offence will be given in some quarter those who knew anything of lady masons private life were aware that she did not encroach on sir peregrines hospitality she was not at the cleeve as much as circumstances would have justified and at one time by no means so much as mrs orme would have desired  in person she was tall and comely when sir joseph had brought her to his house she had been very fairtall slight fair and very quietnot possessing that loveliness which is generally most attractive to men because the beauty of which she might boast depended on form rather than on the brightness of her eye or the softness of her cheek and lips her face too even at that age seldom betrayed emotion and never showed signs either of anger or of joy her forehead was high and though somewhat narrow nevertheless gave evidence of considerable mental faculties nor was the evidence false for those who came to know lady mason well were always ready to acknowledge that she was a woman of no ordinary power her eyes were large and well formed but somewhat cold her nose was long and regular her mouth also was very regular and her teeth perfectly beautiful but her lips were straight and thin it would sometimes seem that she was all teeth and yet it is certain that she never made an effort to show them the great fault of her face was in her chin which was too small and sharp thus giving on occasions something of meanness to her countenance she was now fortyseven years of age and had a son who had reached mans estate and yet perhaps she had more of womans beauty at this present time than when she stood at the altar with sir joseph mason the quietness and repose of her manner suited her years and her position age had given fulness to her tall form and the habitual sadness of her countenance was in fair accordance with her condition and character and yet she was not really sadat least so said those who knew her the melancholy was in her face rather than in her character which was full of energyif energy may be quiet as well as assured and constant  of course she had been accused a dozen times of matrimonial prospects what handsome widow is not so accused the world of hamworth had been very certain at one time that she was intent on marrying sir peregrine orme but she had not married and i think i may say on her behalf that she had never thought of marrying indeed one cannot see how such a woman could make any effort in that line it was impossible to conceive that a lady so staid in her manner should be guilty of flirting nor was there any man within ten miles of hamworth who would have dared to make the attempt women for the most part are prone to lovemakingas nature has intended that they should be but there are women from whom all such follies seem to be as distant as skittles and beer are distant from the dignity of the lord chancellor such a woman was lady mason  at this timethe time which is about to exist for us as the period at which our narrative will beginlucius mason was over twentytwo years old and was living at the farm he had spent the last three or four years of his life in germany where his mother had visited him every year and had now come home intending to be the master of his own destiny his mothers care for him during his boyhood and up to the time at which he became of age had been almost elaborate in its thoughtfulness she had consulted sir peregrine as to his school and sir peregrine looking to the fact of the lads own property and also to the fact known by him of lady masons means for such a purpose had recommended harrow but the mother had hesitated had gently discussed the matter and had at last persuaded the baronet that such a step would be injudicious the boy was sent to a private school of a high character and sir peregrine was sure that he had been so sent at his own advice looking at the peculiar position of his mother said sir peregrine to his young daughterinlaw at her very peculiar position and that of his relatives i think it will be better that he should not appear to assume anything early in life nothing can be better conducted than mr crabfields establishment and after much consideration i have had no hesitation in recommending her to send her son to him and thus lucius mason had been sent to mr crabfield but i do not think that the idea originated with sir peregrine  and perhaps it will be as well added the baronet that he and perry should not be together at school though i have no objection to their meeting in the holidays mr crabfields vacations are always timed to suit the harrow holidays the perry here mentioned was the grandson of sir peregrinethe young peregrine who in coming days was to be the future lord of the cleeve when lucius mason was modestly sent to mr crabfields establishment at great marlow young peregrine orme with his prouder hopes commenced his career at the public school  mr crabfield did his duty by lucius mason and sent him home at seventeen a handsome wellmannered lad tall and comely to the eye with soft brown whiskers sprouting on his cheek well grounded in greek latin and euclid grounded also in french and italian and possessing many more acquirements than he would have learned at harrow but added to these or rather consequent on them was a conceit which publicschool education would not have created when their mothers compared them in the holidays not openly with outspoken words but silently in their hearts lucius mason was found by each to be the superior both in manners and knowledge but each acknowledged also that there was more of ingenuous boyhood about peregrine orme  peregrine orme was a year the younger and therefore his comparative deficiencies were not the cause of any intense sorrow at the cleeve but his grandfather would probably have been better satisfiedand perhaps also so would his motherhad he been less addicted to the catching of rats and better inclined towards miss edgeworths novels and shakespeares plays which were earnestly recommended to him by the lady and the gentleman but boys generally are fond of rats and very frequently are not fond of reading and therefore all this having been duly considered there was not much deep sorrow in those days at the cleeve as to the boyhood of the heir  but there was great pride at orley farm although that pride was shown openly to no one lady mason in her visits at the cleeve said but little as to her sons present excellences as to his future career in life she did say much both to sir peregrine and to mrs orme asking the council of the one and expressing her fears to the other and then sir peregrine having given his consent she sent the lad to germany  he was allowed to come of age without any special signs of manhood or aught of the glory of property although in his case that coming of age did put him into absolute possession of his inheritance on that day had he been so minded he could have turned his mother out of the farmhouse and taken exclusive possession of the estate but he did in fact remain in germany for a year beyond this period and returned to orley farm only in time to be present at the celebration of the twentyfirst birthday of his friend peregrine orme this ceremony as may be surmised was by no means slurred over without due rejoicing the heir at the time was at christchurch but at such a period a slight interruption to his studies was not to be lamented there had been sir peregrine ormes in those parts ever since the days of james i and indeed in days long antecedent to those there had been knights bearing that name some of whom had been honourably beheaded for treason others imprisoned for heresy and one made away with on account of a supposed royal amourto the great glorification of all his descendants looking to the antecedents of the family it was only proper that the coming of age of the heir should be duly celebrated but lucius mason had had no antecedents no greatgreatgrandfather of his had knelt at the feet of an improper princess and therefore lady mason though she had been at the cleeve had not mentioned the fact that on that very day her son had become a man but when peregrine orme became a manthough still in his manhood too much devoted to ratsshe gloried greatly in her quiet way and whispered a hope into the baronets ear that the young heir would not imitate the ambition of his ancestor no by jove it would not do now at all said sir peregrine by no means displeased at the allusion  and then that question as to the future life of lucius mason became one of great importance and it was necessary to consult not only sir peregrine orme but the young man himself his mother had suggested to him first the law the great mr furnival formerly of the home circuit but now practising only in london was her very special friend and would give her and her son all possible aid in this direction and what living man could give better aid than the great mr furnival but lucius mason would have none of the law this resolve he pronounced very clearly while yet in germany whither his mother visited him bearing with her a long letter written by the great mr furnival himself but nevertheless young mason would have none of the law i have an idea he said that lawyers are all liars whereupon his mother rebuked him for his conceited ignorance and want of charity but she did not gain her point  she had however another string to her bow as he objected to be a lawyer he might become a civil engineer circumstances had made sir peregrine orme very intimate with the great mr brown indeed mr brown was under great obligations to sir peregrine and sir peregrine had promised to use his influence but lucius mason said that civil engineers were only tradesmen of an upper class tradesmen with intellects and he he said wished to use his intellect but he did not choose to be a tradesman his mother rebuked him again as well he deserved that she shouldand then asked him of what profession he himself had thought philology said he or as a profession perhaps literature i shall devote myself to philology and the races of man nothing considerable has been done with them as a combined pursuit and with these views he returned homewhile peregrine orme at oxford was still addicted to the hunting of rats  but with philology and the races of man he consented to combine the pursuit of agriculture when his mother found that he wished to take up his abode in his own house she by no means opposed him and suggested that as such was his intention he himself should farm his own land he was very ready to do this and had she not represented that such a step was in every way impolitic he would willingly have requested mr greenwood of the old farm to look elsewhere and have spread himself and his energies over the whole domain as it was he contented himself with desiring that mr dockwrath would vacate his small holding and as he was imperative as to that his mother gave way without making it the cause of a battle she would willingly have left mr dockwrath in possession and did say a word or two as to the milk necessary for those sixteen children but lucius mason was ducal in his ideas and intimated an opinion that he had a right to do what he liked with his own had not mr dockwrath been told when the fields were surrendered to him as a favour that he would only have them in possession till the heir should come of age mr dockwrath had been so told but tellings such as these are easily forgotten by men with sixteen children and thus mr mason became an agriculturist with special scientific views as to chemistry and a philologist with the object of making that pursuit bear upon his studies with reference to the races of man he was convinced that by certain admixtures of ammonia and earths he could produce cereal results hitherto unknown to the farming world and that by tracing out the roots of words he could trace also the wanderings of man since the expulsion of adam from the garden as to the latter question his mother was not inclined to contradict him seeing that he would sit at the feet neither of mr furnival nor of mr brown she had no objection to the races of man she could endure to be talked to about the oceanic mongolidae and the iapetidae of the indogermanic class and had perhaps her own ideas that such matters though somewhat foggy were better than rats but when he came to the other subject and informed her that the properly plentiful feeding of the world was only kept waiting for the chemists she certainly did have her fears chemical agriculture is expensive and though the results may possibly be remunerative still while we are thus kept waiting by the backwardness of the chemists there must be much risk in making any serious expenditure with such views  mother he said when he had now been at home about three months and when the fiat for the expulsion of samuel dockwrath had already gone forth i shall go to liverpool tomorrow  to liverpool lucius  yes that guano which i got from walker is adulterated i have analyzed it and find that it does not contain above thirtytwo and a half hundredths ofof that which it ought to hold in a proportion of seventyfive per cent of the whole  does it not  no and it is impossible to obtain results while one is working with such fictitious materials look at that bit of grass at the bottom of greenwoods hill  the fifteenacre field why lucius we always had the heaviest crops of hay in the parish off that meadow  thats all very well mother but you have never triednobody about here ever has tried what the land can really produce i will throw that and the three fields beyond it into one i will get greenwood to let me have that bit of the hillside giving him compensation of course  and then dockwrath would want compensation  dockwrath is an impertinent rascal and i shall take an opportunity of telling him so but as i was saying i will throw those seventy acres together and then i will try what will be the relative effects of guano and the patent blood but i must have real guano and so i shall go to liverpool  i think i would wait a little lucius it is almost too late for any change of that kind this year  wait yes and what has come of waiting we dont wait at all in doubling our population every thirtythree years but when we come to the feeding of them we are always for waiting it is that waiting which has reduced the intellectual development of one half of the human race to its present terribly low stateor rather prevented its rising in a degree proportionate to the increase of the population no more waiting for me mother if i can help it  but lucius should not such new attempts as that be made by men with large capital said the mother  capital is a bugbear said the son speaking on this matter quite ex cathedrâ as no doubt he was entitled to do by his extensive reading at a german universitycapital is a bugbear the capital that is really wanting is thought mind combination knowledge  but lucius  yes i know what you are going to say mother i dont boast that i possess all these things but i do say that i will endeavour to obtain them  i have no doubt you will but should not that come first  that is waiting again we all know as much as this that good manure will give good crops if the sun be allowed full play upon the land and nothing but the crop be allowed to grow that is what i shall attempt at first and there can be no great danger in that and so he went to liverpool  lady mason during his absence began to regret that she had not left him in the undisturbed and inexpensive possession of the mongolidae and the iapetidae his rent from the estate including that which she would have paid him as tenant of the smaller farm would have enabled him to live with all comfort and if such had been his taste he might have become a philosophical student and lived respectably without adding anything to his income by the sweat of his brow but now the matter was likely to become serious enough for a gentleman farmer determined to wait no longer for the chemists whatever might be the results an immediate profitable return per acre could not be expected as one of them any rent from that smaller farm would now be out of the question and it would be well if the payments made so punctually by old mr greenwood were not also swallowed up in the search after unadulterated guano who could tell whether in the pursuit of science he might not insist on chartering a vessel himself for the peruvian coast     chapter iii  the cleeve   i have said that sir peregrine orme was not a rich man meaning thereby that he was not a rich man considering his acknowledged position in the county such men not uncommonly have their tens twelves and twenty thousands a year but sir peregrines estate did not give him above three or four he was lord of the manor of hamworth and possessed seignorial rights or rather the skeleton and remembrance of such rights with reference to a very large district of country but his actual propertythat from which he still received the substantial benefits of ownershipwas not so large as those of some of his neighbours there was however no place within the county which was so beautifully situated as the cleeve or which had about it so many of the attractions of age the house itself had been built at two periodsa new set of rooms having been added to the remains of the old elizabethan structure in the time of charles ii it had not about it anything that was peculiarly grand or imposing nor were the rooms large or even commodious but everything was old venerable and picturesque both the diningroom and the library were panelled with black wainscoating and though the drawingrooms were papered the tall elaboratelyworked wooden chimneypieces still stood in them and a wooden band or belt round the rooms showed that the panels were still there although hidden by the modern paper  but it was for the beauty and wildness of its grounds that the cleeve was remarkable the land fell here and there into narrow wild ravines and woody crevices the soil of the park was not rich and could give but little assistance to the chemists in supplying the plentiful food expected by mr mason for the coming multitudes of the world it produced in some parts heather instead of grass and was as wild and unprofitable as cleeve common which stretched for miles outside the park palings but it seemed admirably adapted for deer and for the maintenance of halfdecayed venerable oaks young timber also throve well about the place and in this respect sir peregrine was a careful landlord there ran a river through the parkthe river cleeve from which the place and parish are said to have taken their namesa river or rather a stream very narrow and inconsiderable as to its volume of water but which passed for some two miles through so narrow a passage as to give to it the appearance of a cleft or fissure in the rocks the water tumbled over stones through this entire course making it seem to be fordable almost everywhere without danger of wet feet but in truth there was hardly a spot at which it could be crossed without a bold leap from rock to rock narrow as was the aperture through which the water had cut its way nevertheless a path had been contrived now on one side of the stream and now on the other crossing it here and there by slight hanging wooden bridges the air here was always damp with spray and the rocks on both sides were covered with long mosses as were also the overhanging boughs of the old trees this place was the glory of the cleeve and as far as picturesque beauty goes it was very glorious there was a spot in the river from whence a steep path led down from the park to the water and at this spot the deer would come to drink i know nothing more beautiful than this sight when three or four of them could be so seen from one of the wooden bridges towards the hour of sunset in the autumn  sir peregrine himself at this time was an old man having passed his seventieth year he was a fine handsome english gentleman with white hair keen gray eyes a nose slightly aquiline and lips now too closely pressed together in consequence of the havoc which time had made among his teeth he was tall but had lost something of his height from stoopingwas slight in his form but well made and vain of the smallness of his feet and the whiteness of his hands he was generous quick tempered and opinionated generally very mild to those who would agree with him and submit to him but intolerant of contradiction and conceited as to his experience of the world and the wisdom which he had thence derived to those who were manifestly his inferiors he was affable to his recognised equals he was courteous to women he was almost always gentlebut to men who claimed an equality which he would not acknowledge he could make himself particularly disagreeable in judging the position which a man should hold in the world sir peregrine was very resolute in ignoring all claims made by wealth alone even property in land could not in his eyes create a gentleman a gentleman according to his ideas should at any rate have greatgrandfathers capable of being traced in the worlds history and the greater the number of such and the more easily traceable they might be on the worlds surface the more unquestionable would be the status of the claimant in question such being the case it may be imagined that joseph mason esq of groby park did not rank high in the estimation of sir peregrine orme  i have said that sir peregrine was fond of his own opinion but nevertheless he was a man whom it was by no means difficult to lead in the first place he was singularly devoid of suspicion the word of a man or of a woman was to him always credible until full proof had come home to him that it was utterly unworthy of credit after that such a man or woman might as well spare all speech as regards the hope of any effect on the mind of sir peregrine orme he did not easily believe a fellowcreature to be a liar but a liar to him once was a liar always and then he was amenable to flattery and few that are so are proof against the leadingstrings of their flatterers all this was well understood of sir peregrine by those about him his gardener his groom and his woodman all knew his foibles they all loved him respected him and worked for him faithfully but each of them had his own way in his own branch  and there was another person at the cleeve who took into her own hands a considerable share of the management and leading of sir peregrine though in truth she made no efforts in that direction this was mrs orme the widow of his only child and the mother of his heir mrs orme was a younger woman than mrs mason of orley farm by nearly five years though her son was but twelve months junior to lucius mason she had been the daughter of a brother baronet whose family was nearly as old as that of the ormes and therefore though she had come penniless to her husband sir peregrine had considered that his son had married well she had been a great beauty very small in size and delicate of limb fair haired with soft blue wondering eyes and a dimpled cheek such she had been when young peregrine orme brought her home to the cleeve and the bride at once became the darling of her fatherinlaw one year she had owned of married joy and then all the happiness of the family had been utterly destroyed and for the few following years there had been no sadder household in all the countryside than that of sir peregrine orme his son his only son the pride of all who knew him the hope of his political party in the county the brightest among the bright ones of the day for whom the world was just opening her richest treasures fell from his horse as he was crossing into a road and his lifeless body was brought home to the cleeve  all this happened now twenty years since but the widow still wears the colours of mourning of her also the world of course said that she would soon console herself with a second love but she too has given the world the lie from that day to the present she has never left the house of her fatherinlaw she has been a true child to him and she has enjoyed all a childs privileges there has been but little favour for any one at the cleeve who has been considered by the baronet to disregard the wishes of the mistress of the establishment any word from her has been law to him and he has of course expected also that her word should be law to others he has yielded to her in all things and attended to her will as though she were a little queen recognizing in her feminine weakness a sovereign power as some men can and do and having thus for years indulged himself in a quixotic gallantry to the lady of his household he has demanded of others that they also should bow the knee  during the last twenty years the cleeve has not been a gay house during the last ten those living there have been contented and in the main happy but there has seldom been many guests in the old hall and sir peregrine has not been fond of going to other mens feasts he inherited the property very early in life and then there were on it some few encumbrances while yet a young man he added something to these and now since his own sons death he has been setting his house in order that his grandson should receive the family acres intact every shilling due on the property has been paid off and it is well that this should be so for there is reason to fear that the heir will want a helping hand out of some of youths difficultiesperhaps once or twice before his passion for rats gives place to a good english gentlemanlike resolve to hunt twice a week look after his timber and live well within his means  the chief fault in the character of young peregrine orme was that he was so young there are men who are old at oneandtwentyare quite fit for parliament the magistrates bench the care of a wife and even for that much sterner duty the care of a balance at the bankers but there are others who at that age are still boyswhose inner persons and characters have not begun to clothe themselves with the toga virilis i am not sure that those whose boyhoods are so protracted have the worst of it if in this hurrying and competitive age they can be saved from being absolutely trampled in the dust before they are able to do a little trampling on their own account fruit that grows ripe the quickest is not the sweetest nor when housed and garnered will it keep the longest for young peregrine there was no need of competitive struggles the days have not yet come though they are no doubt coming when detur digniori shall be the rule of succession to all titles honours and privileges whatsoever only think what a life it would give to the education of the country in general if any lad from seventeen to twentyone could go in for a vacant dukedom and if a goodly inheritance could be made absolutely incompatible with incorrect spelling and doubtful proficiency in rule of three  luckily for peregrine junior these days are not yet at hand or i fear that there would be little chance for him while lucius mason was beginning to think that the chemists might be hurried and that agriculture might be beneficially added to philology our friend peregrine had just been rusticated and the head of his college had intimated to the baronet that it would be well to take the young mans name off the college books this accordingly had been done and the heir of the cleeve was at present at home with his mother and grandfather what special act of grace had led to this severity we need not inquire but we may be sure that the frolics of which he had been guilty had been essentially young in their nature he had assisted in driving a farmers sow into the mans best parlour or had daubed the top of the tutors cap with white paint or had perhaps given liberty to a bag full of rats in the college hall at dinnertime such were the youths academical amusements and as they were pursued with unremitting energy it was thought well that he should be removed from oxford  then had come the terrible question of his university bills one after another half a score of them reached sir peregrine and then took place that terrible interviewsuch as most young men have had to undergo at least oncein which he was asked how he intended to absolve himself from the pecuniary liabilities which he had incurred  i am sure i dont know said young orme sadly  but i shall be glad sir if you will favour me with your intentions said sir peregrine with severity a gentleman does not i presume send his orders to a tradesman without having some intention of paying him for his goods  illustration sir peregrine and his heir  i intended that they should all be paid of course  and how sir by whom  well siri suppose i intended that you should pay them and the scapegrace as he spoke looked full up into the baronets face with his bright blue eyesnot impudently as though defying his grandfather but with a bold confidence which at once softened the old mans heart  sir peregrine turned away and walked twice the length of the library then returning to the spot where the other stood he put his hand on his grandsons shoulder well peregrine i will pay them he said i have no doubt that you did so intend when you incurred themand that was perhaps natural i will pay them but for your own sake and for your dear mothers sake i hope that they are not very heavy can you give me a list of all that you owe  young peregrine said that he thought he could and sitting down at once he made a clean breast of it with all his foibles follies and youthful ignorances in two respects he stood on good ground he was neither false nor a coward he continued to scrawl down items as long as there were any of which he could think and then handed over the list in order that his grandfather might add them up it was the last he ever heard of the matter and when he revisited oxford some twelve months afterwards the tradesmen whom he had honoured with his custom bowed to him as low as though he had already inherited twenty thousand a year  peregrine orme was short in stature as was his mother and he also had his mothers wonderfully bright blue eyes but in other respects he was very like his father and grandfathervery like all the ormes who had lived for ages past his hair was light his forehead was not large but well formed and somewhat prominent his nose had something though not much of the eagles beak his mouth was handsome in its curve and his teeth were good and his chin was divided by a deep dimple his figure was not only short but stouter than that of the ormes in general he was very strong on his legs he could wrestle and box and use the singlestick with a quickness and precision that was the terror of all the freshmen who had come in his way  mrs orme his mother no doubt thought that he was perfect looking at the reflex of her own eyes in his and seeing in his face so sweet a portraiture of the nose and mouth and forehead of him whom she had loved so dearly and lost so soon she could not but think him perfect when she was told that the master of lazarus had desired that her son should be removed from his college she had accused the tyrant of unrelenting persecuting tyranny and the gentle arguments of sir peregrine had no effect towards changing her ideas on that disagreeable matter of the bills little or nothing was said to her indeed money was a subject with which she was never troubled sir peregrine conceived that money was a mans business and that the softness of a womans character should be preserved by a total absence of all pecuniary thoughts and cares  and then there arose at the cleeve a question as to what should immediately be done with the heir he himself was by no means so well prepared with an answer as had been his friend lucius mason when consulted by his grandfather he said that he did not know he would do anything that sir peregrine wished would sir peregrine think it well that he should prepare himself for the arduous duties of a master of hounds sir peregrine did not think this at all well but it did not appear that he himself was prepared with any immediate proposition then peregrine discussed the matter with his mother explaining that he had hoped at any rate to get the next winters hunting with the hhwhich letters have represented the hamworth fox hunt among sporting men for many years past to this his mother made no objection expressing a hope however that he would go abroad in the spring homestaying youths have ever homely wits she said to him smiling on him ever so sweetly  thats quite true mother he said and thats why i should like to go to leicestershire this winter but going to leicestershire this winter was out of the question     chapter iv  the perils of youth   going to leicestershire was quite out of the question for young orme at this period of his life but going to london unfortunately was not so he had become acquainted at oxford with a gentleman of great skill in his peculiar line of life whose usual residence was in the metropolis and so great had been the attraction found in the character and pursuits of this skilful gentleman that our hero had not been long at the cleeve after his retirement from the university before he visited his friend cowcross street smithfield was the site of this professors residence the destruction of rats in a barrel was his profession and his name was carroty bob it is not my intention to introduce the reader to carroty bob in person as circumstances occurred about this time which brought his intimacy with mr orme to an abrupt conclusion it would be needless to tell how our hero was induced to back a certain terrier presumed to be the pride of smithfield how a great match came off second only in importance to a contest for the belt of england how money was lost and quarrels arose and how peregrine orme thrashed one sporting gent within an inch of his life and fought his way out of carroty bobs house at twelve oclock at night the tale of the row got into the newspapers and of course reached the cleeve sir peregrine sent for his grandson into his study and insisted on knowing everythinghow much money there was to pay and what chance there might be of an action and damages of an action and damages there did not seem to be any chance and the amount of money claimed was not large rats have this advantage that they usually come cheaper than racehorses but then as sir peregrine felt sorely they do not sound so well  do you know sir that you are breaking your mothers heart said sir peregrine looking very sternly at the young manas sternly as he was able to look let him do his worst  peregrine the younger had a very strong idea that he was not doing anything of the kind he had left her only a quarter of an hour since and though she had wept during the interview she had forgiven him with many caresses and had expressed her opinion that the chief fault had lain with carroty bob and those other wretched people who had lured her dear child into their villainous den she had altogether failed to conceal her pride at his having fought his way out from among them and had ended by supplying his pocket out of her own immediate resources i hope not sir said peregrine the younger thinking over some of these things  but you will sir if you go on with this shameless career i do not speak of myself i do not expect you to sacrifice your tastes for me but i did think that you loved your mother  so i doand you too  i am not speaking about myself sir when i think what your father was at your agehow nobly and then the baronet was stopped in his speech and wiped his eyes with his handkerchief do you think that your father sir followed such pursuits as these do you think that he spent his time in the pursuit ofrats  well i dont know i dont think he did but i have heard you say sir that you sometimes went to cockfights when you were young  to cockfights well yes but let me tell you sir that i always went in the company of gentlementhat is when i did go which was very seldom the baronet in some afterdinner halfhour had allowed this secret of his youth to escape from him imprudently  and i went to the house in cowcross street with lord john fitzjoly  the last man in all london with whom you ought to associate but i am not going to argue with you sir if you think and will continue to think that the slaughtering of vermin is a proper pursuit  but sir foxes are vermin also  hold your tongue sir and listen to me you know very well what i mean sir if you think thatrats are a proper pursuit for a gentleman in your sphere of life and if all that i can say has no effect in changing your opinioni shall have done i have not many years of life before me and when i shall be no more you can squander the property in any vile pursuits that may be pleasing to you but sir you shall not do it while i am living nor if i can help it shall you rob your mother of such peace of mind as is left for her in this world i have only one alternative for you sir sir peregrine did not stop to explain what might be the other branch of this alternative will you give me your word of honour as a gentleman that you will never again concern yourself in this disgusting pursuit  never grandfather said peregrine solemnly  sir peregrine before he answered bethought himself that any pledge given for a whole lifetime must be foolish and he bethought himself also that if he could wean his heir from rats for a year or so the taste would perish from lack of nourishment i will say for two years said sir peregrine still maintaining his austere look  for two years repeated peregrine the younger and this is the fourth of october  yes sir for two years said the baronet more angry than ever at the young mans pertinacity and yet almost amused at his grandsons already formed resolve to go back to his occupation at the first opportunity allowed  couldnt you date it from the end of august sir the best of the matches always come off in september  no sir i will not date it from any other time than the present will you give me your word of honour as a gentleman for two years  peregrine thought over the proposition for a minute or two in sad anticipation of all that he was to lose and then slowly gave his adhesion to the terms very well sirfor two years and then he took out his pocketbook and wrote in it slowly  it was at any rate manifest that he intended to keep his word and that was much so sir peregrine accepted the promise for what it was worth and now said he if you have got nothing better to do we will ride down to crutchley wood  i should like it of all things said his grandson  samson wants me to cut a new bridlepath through from the larches at the top of the hill down to crutchley bottom but i dont think ill have it done tell jacob to let us have the nags ill ride the gray pony and ask your mother if shell ride with us  it was the manner of sir peregrine to forgive altogether when he did forgive and to commence his forgiveness in all its integrity from the first moment of the pardon there was nothing he disliked so much as being on bad terms with those around him and with none more so than with his grandson peregrine well knew how to make himself pleasant to the old man and when duly encouraged would always do so and thus the family party as they rode on this occasion through the woods of the cleeve discussed oaks and larches beech and birches as though there were no such animal as a rat in existence and no such place known as cowcross street  well perry as you and samson are both of one mind i suppose the path must be made said sir peregrine as he got off his horse at the entrance of the stableyard and prepared to give his feeble aid to mrs orme  shortly after this the following note was brought up to the cleeve by a messenger from orley farm      my dear sir peregrine     if you are quite disengaged at twelve oclock tomorrow i    will walk over to the cleeve at that hour or if it would    suit you better to call here as you are riding i would    remain within till you come i want your kind advice on a    certain matter     most sincerely yours     mary mason     thursday   lady mason when she wrote this note was well aware that it would not be necessary for her to go to the cleeve sir peregrines courtesy would not permit him to impose any trouble on a lady when the alternative of taking that trouble on himself was given to him moreover he liked to have some object for his daily ride he liked to be consulted on certain matters and he especially liked being so consulted by lady mason so he sent word back that he would be at the farm at twelve on the following day and exactly at that hour his gray pony or cob might have been seen slowly walking up the avenue to the farmhouse  the cleeve was not distant from orley farm more than two miles by the nearest walkingpath although it could not be driven much under five with any sort of carriage one was obliged to come from the cleeve house down to the lodge on the hamworth and alston road and then to drive through the town of hamworth and so back to the farm but in walking one would take the path along the river for nearly a mile thence rise up the hill to the top of crutchley wood descend through the wood to crutchley bottom and passing along the valley come out at the foot of cleeve hill just opposite to orley farm gate the distance for a horseman was somewhat greater seeing that there was not as yet any bridleway through crutchley wood under these circumstances the journey between the two houses was very frequently made on foot and for those walking from the cleeve house to hamworth the nearest way was by lady masons gate  lady masons drawingroom was very pretty though it was by no means fashionably furnished indeed she eschewed fashion in all things and made no pretence of coming out before the world as a great lady she had never kept any kind of carriage though her means combined with her sons income would certainly have justified her in a ponychaise since lucius had become master of the house he had presented her with such a vehicle and also with the pony and harness complete but as yet she had never used it being afraid as she said to him with a smile of appearing ambitious before the stern citizens of hamworth nonsense mother he had replied with a considerable amount of young dignity in his face we are all entitled to those comforts for which we can afford to pay without injury to any one i shall take it ill of you if i do not see you using it  oh sir peregrine this is so kind of you said lady mason coming forward to meet her friend she was plainly dressed without any full exuberance of costume and yet everything about her was neat and pretty and everything had been the object of feminine care a very plain dress may occasion as much study as the most elaborateand may be quite as worthy of the study it has caused lady mason i am inclined to think was by no means indifferent to the subject but then to her belonged the great art of hiding her artifice  not at all not at all said sir peregrine taking her hand and pressing it as he always did what is the use of neighbours if they are not neighbourly this was all very well from sir peregrine in the existing case but he was not a man who by any means recognised the necessity of being civil to all who lived near him to the great and to the poor he was neighbourly but it may be doubted whether he would have thought much of lady mason if she had been less good looking or less clever  ah i know how good you always are to me but ill tell you why i am troubling you now lucius went off two days since to liverpool  my grandson told me that he had left home  he is an excellent young man and i am sure that i have every reason to be thankful sir peregrine remembering the affair in cowcross street and certain other affairs of a somewhat similar nature thought that she had but for all that he would not have exchanged his own brighteyed lad for lucius mason with all his virtues and all his learning  and indeed i am thankful continued the widow nothing can be better than his conduct and mode of life but  i hope he has no attraction at liverpool of which you disapprove  no no there is nothing of that kind his attraction is but perhaps i had better explain the whole matter lucius you know has taken to farming  he has taken up the land which you held yourself has he not  yes and a little more and he is anxious to add even to that he is very energetic about it sir peregrine  well the life of a gentleman farmer is not a bad one though in his special circumstances i would certainly have recommended a profession  acting upon your advice i did urge him to go to the bar but he has a will of his own and a mind altogether made up as to the line of life which he thinks will suit him best what i fear now is that he will spend more money upon experiments than he can afford  experimental farming is an expensive amusement said sir peregrine with a very serious shake of his head  i am afraid it is and now he has gone to liverpool to buyguano said the widow feeling some little shame in coming to so inconsiderable a conclusion after her somewhat stately prologue  to buy guano why could he not get his guano from walker as my man symonds does  he says it is not good he analyzed it and  fiddlestick why didnt he order it in london if he didnt like walkers gone to liverpool for guano ill tell you what it is lady mason if he intends to farm his land in that way he should have a very considerable capital at his back it will be a long time before he sees his money again sir peregrine had been farming all his life and had his own ideas on the subject he knew very well that no gentleman let him set to work as he might with his own land could do as well with it as a farmer who must make a living out of his farming besides paying the rentwho must do that or else have no living and he knew also that such operations as those which his young friend was now about to attempt was an amusement fitted only for the rich it may be also that he was a little oldfashioned and therefore prejudiced against new combinations between agriculture and chemistry he must put a stop to that kind of work very soon lady mason he must indeed or he will bring himself to ruinand you with him  lady masons face became very grave and serious but what can i say to him sir peregrine in such a matter as that i am afraid that he would not mind me if you would not object to speaking to him  sir peregrine was graciously pleased to say that he would not object it was a disagreeable task he said that of giving advice to a young man who was bound by no tie either to take it or even to receive it with respect  you will not find him at all disrespectful i think i can promise that said the frightened mother and that matter was ended by a promise on the part of the baronet to take the case in hand and to see lucius immediately on his return from liverpool he had better come and dine at the cleeve said sir peregrine and we will have it out after dinner all of which made lady mason very grateful     chapter v  sir peregrine makes a second promise   we left lady mason very grateful at the end of the last chapter for the promise made to her by sir peregrine with reference to her son but there was still a weight on lady masons mind they say that the pith of a ladys letter is in the postscript and it may be that that which remained for lady mason to say was after all the matter as to which she was most anxious for assistance as you are here she said to the baronet would you let me mention another subject  surely said he again putting down his hat and ridingstick  sir peregrine was not given to close observation of those around him or he might have seen by the heightened colour of the ladys face and by the slight nervous hesitation with which she began to speak that she was much in earnest as to this other matter and had he been clever in his powers of observation he might have seen also that she was anxious to hide this feeling you remember the circumstances of that terrible lawsuit she said at last  what as to sir josephs will yes i remember them well  i know that i shall never forget all the kindness that you showed me said she i dont know how i should have lived through it without you and dear mrs orme  but what about it now  i fear i am going to have further trouble  do you mean that the man at groby park is going to try the case again it is not possible after such a lapse of time i am no lawyer but i do not think that he can do it  i do not knowi do not know what he intends or whether he intends anything but i am sure of thisthat he will give me trouble if he can but i will tell you the whole story sir peregrine it is not much and perhaps after all may not be worth attention you know the attorney in hamworth who married miriam usbech  what samuel dockwrath oh yes i know him well enough and to tell the truth i do not think very well of him is he not a tenant of yours  not at present and then lady mason explained the manner in which the two fields had been taken out of the lawyers hands by her sons order  ah he was wrong there said the baronet when a man has held land so long it should not be taken away from him except under pressing circumstances that is if he pays his rent  mr dockwrath did pay his rent certainly and now i fear he is determined to do all he can to injure us  but what injury can mr dockwrath do you  i do not know but he has gone down to yorkshireto mr masons place i know that and he was searching through some papers of old mr usbechs before he went indeed i may say that i know as a fact that he has gone to mr mason with the hope that these law proceedings may be brought on again  you know it as a fact  i think i may say so  but dear lady mason may i ask you how you know this as a fact  his wife was with me yesterday she said with some feeling of shame as she disclosed the source from whence she had obtained her information  and did she tell the tale against her own husband  not as meaning to say anything against him sir peregrine you must not think so badly of her as that nor must you think that i would willingly obtain information in such a manner but you must understand that i have always been her friend and when she found that mr dockwrath had left home on a matter in which i am so nearly concerned i cannot but think it natural that she should let me know  to this sir peregrine made no direct answer he could not quite say that he thought it was natural nor could he give any expressed approval of any such intercourse between lady mason and the attorneys wife he thought it would be better that mr dockwrath should be allowed to do his worst if he had any intention of doing evil and that lady mason should pass it by without condescending to notice the circumstance but he made allowances for her weakness and did not give utterance to his disapproval in words  i know you think that i have done wrong she then said appealing to him and there was a tone of sorrow in her voice which went to his heart  no not wrong i cannot say that you have done wrong it may be a question whether you have done wisely  ah if you only condemn my folly i will not despair it is probable i may not have done wisely seeing that i had not you to direct me but what shall i do now oh sir peregrine say that you will not desert me if all this trouble is coming on me again  no i will not desert you lady mason you may be sure of that  dearest friend  but i would advise you to take no notice whatever of mr dockwrath and his proceedings i regard him as a person entirely beneath your notice and if i were you i should not move at all in this matter unless i received some legal summons which made it necessary for me to do so i have not the honour of any personal acquaintance with mr mason of groby park it was in this way that sir peregrine always designated his friends stepsonbut if i understand the motives by which he may probably be actuated in this or in any other matter i do not think it likely that he will expend money on so very unpromising a case  he would do anything for vengeance  i doubt if he would throw away his money even for that unless he were very sure of his prey and in this matter what can he possibly do he has the decision of the jury against him and at the time he was afraid to carry the case up to a court of appeal  but sir peregrine it is impossible to know what documents he may have obtained since that  what documents can do you any harmunless indeed there should turn out to be a will subsequent to that under which your son inherits the property  oh no there was no subsequent will  of course there was not and therefore you need not frighten yourself it is just possible that some attempt may be made now that your son is of age but i regard even that as improbable  and you would not advise me then to say anything to mr furnival  no certainly notunless you receive some legal notice which may make it necessary for you to consult a lawyer do nothing and if mrs dockwrath comes to you again tell her that you are not disposed to take any notice of her information mrs dockwrath is i am sure a very good sort of woman indeed i have always heard so but if i were you i dont think that i should feel inclined to have much conversation with her about my private affairs what you tell her you tell also to her husband and then the baronet having thus spoken words of wisdom sat silent in his armchair and lady mason still looking into his face remained silent also for a few minutes  i am so glad i asked you to come she then said  i am delighted if i have been of any service to you  of any service oh sir peregrine you cannot understand what it is to live alone as i dofor of course i cannot trouble lucius with these matters nor can a man gifted as you are comprehend how a woman can tremble at the very idea that those law proceedings may possibly be repeated  sir peregrine could not but remember as he looked at her that during all those law proceedings when an attack was made not only on her income but on her honesty she had never seemed to tremble she had always been constant to herself even when things appeared to be going against her but years passing over her head since that time had perhaps told upon her courage  but i will fear nothing now as you have promised that you will still be my friend  you may be very sure of that lady mason i believe that i may fairly boast that i do not easily abandon those whom i have once regarded with esteem and affection among whom lady mason will i am sure allow me to say that she is reckoned as by no means the least and then taking her hand the old gentleman bowed over it and kissed it  my dearest dearest friend said she and lifting sir peregrines beautifully white hand to her lips she also kissed that it will be remembered that the gentleman was over seventy and that this pretty scene could therefore be enacted without impropriety on either side sir peregrine then went and as he passed out of the door lady mason smiled on him very sweetly it is quite true that he was over seventy but nevertheless the smile of a pretty woman still had charms for him more especially if there was a tear in her eye the whilefor sir peregrine orme had a soft heart  as soon as the door was closed behind him lady mason seated herself in her accustomed chair and all trace of the smile vanished from her face she was alone now and could allow her countenance to be a true index of her mind if such was the case her heart surely was very sad she sat there perfectly still for nearly an hour and during the whole of that time there was the same look of agony on her brow once or twice she rubbed her hands across her forehead brushing back her hair and showing had there been any one by to see it that there was many a gray lock there mixed with the brown hairs had there been any one by she would it may be surmised have been more careful  there was no smile in her face now neither was there any tear in her eye the one and the other emblem were equally alien to her present mood but there was sorrow at her heart and deep thought in her mind she knew that her enemies were conspiring against heragainst her and against her son and what steps might she best take in order that she might baffle them  illustration there was sorrow in her heart and deep thought in her mind  i have got that woman on the hip now those were the words which mr dockwrath had uttered into his wifes ears after two days spent in searching through her fathers papers the poor woman had once thought of burning all those papersin old days before she had become mrs dockwrath her friend lady mason had counselled her to do so pointing out to her that they were troublesome and could by no possibility lead to profit but she had consulted her lover and he had counselled her to burn nothing would that she had been guided by her friend she now said to herself with regard to that old trunk and perhaps occasionally with regard to some other things  i have got that woman on the hip at last and there had been a gleam of satisfaction in samuels eye as he uttered the words which had convinced his wife that it was not an idle threat she knew nothing of what the box had contained and now even if it had not been kept safe from her under samuels private key the contents which were of interest had of course gone i have business in the north and shall be away for about a week mr dockwrath had said to her on the following morning  oh very well then ill put up your things she had answered in her usual mild sad whining household voice her voice at home was always sad and whining for she was overworked and had too many cares and her lord was a tyrant to her rather than a husband  yes i must see mr mason immediately and look here miriam i positively insist that you do not go to orley farm or hold any intercourse whatever with lady mason dye hear  mrs dockwrath said that she did hear and promised obedience mr dockwrath probably guessed that the moment his back was turned all would be told at the farm and probably also had no real objection to her doing so had he in truth wished to keep his proceedings secret from lady mason he would not have divulged them to his wife and then mr dockwrath did start for the north bearing certain documents with him and soon after his departure mrs dockwrath did pay a visit to orley farm  lady mason sat there perfectly still for about an hour thinking what she would do she had asked sir peregrine and had the advantage of his advice but that did not weigh much with her what she wanted from sir peregrine was countenance and absolute assistance in the day of troublenot advice she had desired to renew his interest in her favour and to receive from him his assurance that he would not desert her and that she had obtained it was of course also necessary that she should consult him but in turning over within her own mind this and that line of conduct she did not consciously attach any weight to sir peregrines opinion the great question for her to decide was thisshould she put herself and her case into the hands of her friend mr furnival now at once or should she wait till she had received some certain symptom of hostile proceedings if she did see mr furnival what could she tell him only this that mr dockwrath had found some document among the papers of old mr usbech and had gone off with the same to groby park in yorkshire what that document might be she was as ignorant as the attorneys wife  when the hour was ended she had made up her mind that she would do nothing more in the matter at any rate on that day     chapter vi  the commercial room bull inn leeds   mr samuel dockwrath was a little man with sandy hair a pale face and stoneblue eyes in judging of him by appearance only and not by the ear one would be inclined to doubt that he could be a very sharp attorney abroad and a very persistent tyrant at home but when mr dockwrath began to talk ones respect for him began to grow he talked well and to the point and with a tone of voice that could command where command was possible persuade where persuasion was required mystify when mystification was needed and express with accuracy the tone of an obedient humble servant when servility was thought to be expedient we will now accompany him on his little tour into yorkshire  groby park is about seven miles from leeds and as mr dockwrath had in the first instance to travel from hamworth up to london he did not reach leeds till late in the evening it was a nasty cold drizzling night so that the beauties and marvels of the large manufacturing town offered him no attraction and at nine oclock he had seated himself before the fire in the commercial room at the bull had called for a pair of public slippers and was about to solace all his cares with a glass of mahoganycoloured brandy and water and a cigar the room had no present occupant but himself and therefore he was able to make the most of all its comforts he had taken the solitary armchair and had so placed himself that the gas would fall direct from behind his head on to that days leeds and halifax chronicle as soon as he should choose to devote himself to local politics  the waiter had looked at him with doubtful eyes when he asked to be shown into the commercial room feeling all but confident that such a guest had no right to be there he had no bulky bundles of samples nor any of those outward characteristics of a commercial gent with which all men conversant with the rail and road are acquainted and which the accustomed eye of a waiter recognises at a glance and here it may be well to explain that ordinary travellers are in this respect badly treated by the customs of england or rather by the hotelkeepers all innkeepers have commercial rooms as certainly as they have taps and bars but all of them do not have commercial rooms in the properly exclusive sense a stranger therefore who has asked for and obtained his muttonchop in the commercial room of the dolphin the bear and the george not unnaturally asks to be shown into the same chamber at the kings head but the kings head does a business with real commercials and the stranger finds himselfout of his element  mercial sir said the waiter at the bull inn leeds to mr dockwrath in that tone of doubt which seemed to carry an answer to his own question but mr dockwrath was not a man to be put down by a waiter yes said he didnt you hear me say so and then the waiter gave way none of those lords of the road were in the house at the moment and it might be that none would come that night  mr dockwrath had arrived by the 822 pm down but the 845 pm up from the north followed quick upon his heels and he had hardly put his brandy and water to his mouth before a rush and a sound of many voices were heard in the hall there is a great difference between the entrance into an inn of men who are not known there and of men who are known the men who are not known are shy diffident doubtful and anxious to propitiate the chambermaid by great courtesy the men who are known are loud jocular and assuredor else in case of deficient accommodation loud angry and full of threats the guests who had now arrived were well known and seemed at present to be in the former mood well mary my dear whats the time of day with you said a rough bass voice within the hearing of mr dockwrath much about the old tune mr moulder said the girl at the bar time to look alive and keep moving will you have them boxes up stairs mr kantwise and then there were a few words about the luggage and two real commercial gentlemen walked into the room  mr dockwrath resolved to stand upon his rights so he did not move his chair but looked up over his shoulder at the new comers the first man who entered was short and very fatso fat that he could not have seen his own knees for some considerable time past his face rolled with fat as also did all his limbs his eyes were large and bloodshot he wore no beard and therefore showed plainly the triple bagging of his fat chin in spite of his overwhelming fatness there was something in his face that was masterful and almost vicious his body had been overcome by eating but not as yet his spiritone would be inclined to say this was mr moulder well known on the road as being in the grocery and spirit line a pushing man who understood his business and was well trusted by his firm in spite of his habitual intemperance what did the firm care whether or no he killed himself by eating and drinking he sold his goods collected his money and made his remittances if he got drunk at night that was nothing to them seeing that he always did his quota of work the next day but mr moulder did not get drunk his brandy and water went into his blood and into his eyes and into his feet and into his handsbut not into his brain  the other was a little square man in the hardware line of the name of kantwise he disposed of fireirons grates ovens and kettles and was at the present moment heavily engaged in the sale of certain newlyinvented metallic tables and chairs lately brought out by the patent steel furniture company for which mr kantwise did business he looked as though a skin rather too small for the purpose had been drawn over his head and face so that his forehead and cheeks and chin were tight and shiny his eyes were small and green always moving about in his head and were seldom used by mr kantwise in the ordinary way at whatever he looked he looked sideways it was not that he did not look you in the face but he always looked at you with a sidelong glance never choosing to have you straight in front of him and the more eager he was in conversationthe more anxious he might be to gain his point the more he averted his face and looked askance so that sometimes he would prefer to have his antagonist almost behind his shoulder and then as he did this he would thrust forward his chin and having looked at you round the corner till his eyes were nearly out of his head he would close them both and suck in his lips and shake his head with rapid little shakes as though he were saying to himself ah sir youre a bad un a very bad un his nosefor i should do mr kantwise injustice if i did not mention this featureseemed to have been compressed almost into nothing by that skinsqueezing operation it was long enough taking the measurement down the bridge and projected sufficiently counting the distance from the upper lip but it had all the properties of a line it possessed length without breadth there was nothing in it from side to side if you essayed to pull it your fingers would meet when i shall have also said that the hair on mr kantwises head stood up erect all round to the height of two inches and that it was very red i shall have been accurate enough in his personal description  that mr moulder represented a firm good business doing tea coffee and british brandy on a wellestablished basis of capital and profit the travelling commercial world in the north of england was well aware no one entertained any doubt about his employers hubbles and grease of houndsditch hubbles and grease were all right as they had been any time for the last twenty years but i cannot say that there was quite so strong a confidence felt in the patent steel furniture company generally or in the individual operations of mr kantwise in particular the world in yorkshire and lancashire was doubtful about metallic tables and it was thought that mr kantwise was too eloquent in their praise  mr moulder when he had entered the room stood still to enable the waiter to peel off from him his greatcoat and the large shawl with which his neck was enveloped and mr kantwise performed the same operation for himself carefully folding up the articles of clothing as he took them off then mr moulder fixed his eyes on mr dockwrath and stared at him very hard whos the party james he said to the waiter speaking in a whisper that was plainly heard by the attorney  genelman by the 822 down said james  commercial asked mr moulder with angry frown  he says so himself anyways said the waiter  gammon replied mr moulder who knew all the bearings of a commercial man thoroughly and could have put one together if he were only supplied with a little bitsay the mouth as professor owen always does with the dodoes mr moulder now began to be angry for he was a stickler for the rights and privileges of his class and had an idea that the world was not so conservative in that respect as it should be mr dockwrath however was not to be frightened so he drew his chair a thought nearer to the fire took a sup of brandy and water and prepared himself for war if war should be necessary  cold evening sir for the time of year said mr moulder walking up to the fireplace and rolling the lumps of his forehead about in his attempt at a frown in spite of his terrible burden of flesh mr moulder could look angry on occasions but he could only do so when he was angry he was not gifted with a command of his facial muscles  yes said mr dockwrath not taking his eyes from off the leeds and halifax chronicle it is coldish waiter bring me a cigar  this was very provoking as must be confessed mr moulder had not been prepared to take any step towards turning the gentleman out though doubtless he might have done so had he chosen to exercise his prerogative but he did expect that the gentleman would have acknowledged the weakness of his footing by moving himself a little towards one side of the fire and he did not expect that he would have presumed to smoke without asking whether the practice was held to be objectionable by the legal possessors of the room mr dockwrath was free of any such pusillanimity waiter he said again bring me a cigar dye hear  the great heart of moulder could not stand this unmoved he had been an accustomed visitor to that room for fifteen years and had always done his best to preserve the commercial code unsullied he was now so well known that no one else ever presumed to take the chair at the four oclock commercial dinner if he were present it was incumbent on him to stand forward and make a fight more especially in the presence of kantwise who was by no means stanch to his order kantwise would at all times have been glad to have outsiders in the room in order that he might puff his tables and if possible effect a salea mode of proceeding held in much aversion by the upright oldfashioned commercial mind  sir said mr moulder having become very red about the cheeks and chin i and this gentleman are going to have a bit of supper and it aint accustomed to smoke in commercial rooms during meals you know the rules no doubt if youre commercial yourselfas i suppose you are seeing you in this room  now mr moulder was wrong in his law as he himself was very well aware smoking is allowed in all commercial rooms when the dinner has been some hour or so off the table but then it was necessary that he should hit the stranger in some way and the chances were that the stranger would know nothing about commercial law nor did he so he merely looked mr moulder hard in the face but mr kantwise knew the laws well enough and as he saw before him a possible purchaser of metallic tables he came to the assistance of the attorney  i think you are a little wrong there mr moulder eh aint you said he  wrong about what said moulder turning very sharply upon his baseminded compatriot  well as to smoking its nine oclock and if the gentleman  i dont care a brass farthing about the clock said the other but when im going to have a bit of steak with my tea in my own room i chooses to have it comfortable  goodness me mr moulder how many times have i seen you sitting there with a pipe in your mouth and half a dozen gents eating their teas the while in this very room the rule of the case i take it to be this when  bother your rules  well it was you spoke of them  the question i take to be this said moulder now emboldened by the opposition he had received has the gentleman any right to be in this room at all or has he not is he commercial or is hemiscellaneous thats the chat as i take it  youre on the square there i must allow said kantwise  james said moulder appealing with authority to the waiter who had remained in the room during the controversyand now mr moulder was determined to do his duty and vindicate his profession let the consequences be what they might james is that gentleman commercial or is he not  it was clearly necessary now that mr dockwrath himself should take his own part and fight his own battle sir said he turning to mr moulder i think youll find it extremely difficult to define that wordextremely difficult in this enterprising country all men are more or less commercial  hear hear said mr kantwise  thats gammon said mr moulder  gammon it may be said mr dockwrath but nevertheless its right in law taking the word in its broadest strictest and most intelligible sense i am a commercial gentleman and as such i do maintain that i have a full right to the accommodation of this public room  thats very well put said mr kantwise  waiter thundered out mr moulder as though he imagined that that functionary was down the yard at the taproom instead of standing within three feet of his elbow is this gent a commercial or is he not because if notthen ill trouble you to send mr crump here my compliments to mr crump and i wish to see him now mr crump was the landlord of the bull inn  masters just stepped out down the street said james  why dont you answer my question sir said moulder becoming redder and still more red about his shirtcollars  the gent said as how he was mercial said the poor man was i to go to contradict a gent and tell him he wasnt when he said as how he was  if you please said mr dockwrath we will not bring the waiter into this discussion i asked for the commercial room and he did his duty in showing me to the door of it the fact i take to be this in the south of england the rules to which you refer are not kept so strictly as in these more mercantile localities  ive always observed that said kantwise  i travelled for three years in devonshire somersetshire and wiltshire said moulder and the commercial rooms were as well kept there as any i ever see  i alluded to surrey and kent said mr dockwrath  theyre uncommonly miscellaneous in surrey and kent said kantwise theres no doubt in the world about that  if the gentleman means to say that hes come in here because he didnt know the custom of the country ive no more to say of course said moulder and in that case i for one shall be very happy if the gentleman cam make himself comfortable in this room as a stranger and i may say guestpaying his own shot of course  and as for me i shall be delighted said kantwise i never did like too much exclusiveness whats the use of bottling oneself up thats what i always say besides theres no charity in it we gents as are always on the road should show a little charity to them as aint so well accustomed to the work  at this allusion to charity mr moulder snuffled through his nose to show his great disgust but he made no further answer mr dockwrath who was determined not to yield but who had nothing to gain by further fighting bowed his head and declared that he felt very much obliged whether or no there was any touch of irony in his tone mr moulders ears were not fine enough to discover so they now sat round the fire together the attorney still keeping his seat in the middle and then mr moulder ordered his little bit of steak with his tea with the gravy in it james he said solemnly and a bit of fat and a few slices of onion thin mind put on raw not with all the taste fried out and tell the cook if she dont do it as it should be done ill be down into the kitchen and do it myself youll join me kantwise eh  well i think not i dined at three you know  dined at three what of that a dinner at three wont last a man for ever you might as well join me  no i think not have you got such a thing as a nice red herring in the house james  get one round the corner sir  do theres a good fellow and ill take it for a relish with my tea im not so fond of your solids three times a day they heat the blood too much  bother grunted moulder and then they went to their evening meal over which we will not disturb them the steak we may presume was cooked aright as mr moulder did not visit the kitchen and mr kantwise no doubt made good play with his unsubstantial dainty as he spoke no further till his meal was altogether finished  did you ever hear anything of that mr mason who lives near bradford asked mr kantwise addressing himself to mr moulder as soon as the things had been cleared from the table and that latter gentleman had been furnished with a pipe and a supply of cold without  i remember his father when i was a boy said moulder not troubling himself to take his pipe from his mouth mason and martock in the old jewry very good people they were too  hes decently well off now i suppose isnt he said kantwise turning away his face and looking at his companion out of the corners of his eyes  i suppose he is that place there by the roadside is all his own i take it have you been at him with some of your rusty rickety tables and chairs  mr moulder you forget that there is a gentleman here who wont understand that youre at your jokes i was doing business at groby park but i found the party uncommon hard to deal with  didnt complete the transaction  well no not exactly but i intend to call again hes close enough himself is mr mason but his lady mrs m lord love you mr moulder that is a woman  she is is she as for me i never have none of these private dealings it dont suit my book at all nor it aint what ive been accustomed to if a mans wholesale let him be wholesale and then having enunciated this excellent opinion with much energy he took a long pull at his brandy and water  very old fashioned mr moulder said kantwise looking round the corner then shutting his eyes and shaking his head  may be said moulder and yet none the worse for that i call it hawking and peddling that going round the country with your goods on your back it aint trade and then there was a lull in the conversation mr kantwise who was a very religious gentleman having closed his eyes and being occupied with some internal anathema against mr moulder  begging your pardon sir i think you were talking about one mr mason who lives in these parts said dockwrath  exactly joseph mason esq of groby park said mr kantwise now turning his face upon the attorney  i suppose i shall be likely to find him at home tomorrow if i call  certainly sir certainly leastwise i should say so any personal acquaintance with mr mason sir if so i meant nothing offensive by my allusion to the lady sir nothing at all i can assure you  the ladys nothing to me sir nor the gentleman eitheronly that i have a little business with him  shall be very happy to join you in a gig sir tomorrow as far as groby park or fly if more convenient i shall only take a few patterns with me and theyre no weight at allnone in the least sir they go on behind and you wouldnt know it sir to this however mr dockwrath would not assent as he wanted to see mr mason very specially he should go early and preferred going by himself  no offence i hope said mr kantwise  none in the least said mr dockwrath  and if you would allow me sir to have the pleasure of showing you a few of my patterns im sure i should be delighted this he said observing that mr moulder was sitting over his empty glass with the pipe in his hand and his eyes fast closed i think sir i could show you an article that would please you very much you see sir that new ideas are coming in every day and wood sir is altogether going outaltogether going out as regards furniture in another twenty years sir there wont be such a thing as a wooden table in the country unless with some poor person that cant afford to refurnish believe me sir irons the thing nowadays  and indianrubber said dockwrath  yes indianrubbers wonderful too are you in that line sir  well no not exactly  its not like iron sir you cant make a dinnertable for fourteen people out of indianrubber that will shut up into a box 36 by 24 deep and 26 broad why sir i can let you have a set of drawingroom furniture for fifteen ten that youve never seen equalled in wood for three times the moneyornamented in the tastiest way sir and fit for any ladys drawingroom or boodoor the ladies of quality are all getting them now for their boodoors theres three tables eight chairs easy rockingchair musicstand stool to match and pair of standup screens all gilt in real louey catorse and it goes in three boxes 42 by 21 and 23 think of that sir for fifteen ten and the boxes in then there was a pause after which mr kantwise addedif ready money the carriage paid and then he turned his head very much away and looked back very hard at his expected customer  im afraid the articles are not in my line said mr dockwrath  its the tastiest present for a gentleman to make to his lady that has come out sincesince those sort of things have come out at all youll let me show you the articles sir it will give me the sincerest pleasure and mr kantwise proposed to leave the room in order that he might introduce the three boxes in question  they would not be at all in my way said mr dockwrath  the trouble would be nothing said mr kantwise and it gives me the greatest pleasure to make them known when i find any one who can appreciate such undoubted luxuries and so saying mr kantwise skipped out of the room and soon returned with james and boots each of the three bearing on his shoulder a deal box nearly as big as a coffin all of which were deposited in different parts of the room mr moulder in the meantime snored heavily his head falling on to his breast every now and again but nevertheless he held fast by his pipe  mr kantwise skipped about the room with wonderful agility unfastening the boxes and taking out the contents while joe the boots and james the waiter stood by assisting they had never yet seen the glories of these chairs and tables and were therefore not unwilling to be present it was singular to see how ready mr kantwise was at the work how recklessly he threw aside the whiteybrown paper in which the various pieces of painted iron were enveloped and with what a practised hand he put together one article after another first there was a round lootable not quite so large in its circumference as some people might think desirable but nevertheless a round lootable the pedestal with its three claws was all together with a knowing touch mr kantwise separated the bottom of what looked like a yellow stick and lo there were three legs which he placed carefully on the ground then a small bar was screwed on to the top and over the bar was screwed the leaf or table itself which consisted of three pieces unfolding with hinges these when the screw had been duly fastened in the centre opened out upon the bar and there was the table complete  it was certainly a tasty article and the pride with which mr kantwise glanced back at it was quite delightful the top of the table was blue with a red bird of paradise in the middle and the edges of the table to the breadth of a couple of inches were yellow the pillar also was yellow as were the three legs its the real louey catorse said mr kantwise stooping down to go on with table number two which was as he described it a chess having the proper number of blue and lightpink squares marked upon it but this also had been made louey catorse with reference to its legs and edges the third table was a sofa of proper shape but rather small in size then one after another he brought forth and screwed up the chairs stools and sundry screens and within a quarter of an hour he had put up the whole set complete the red bird of paradise and the blue ground appeared on all as did also the yellow legs and edgings which gave to them their peculiarly fashionable character there said mr kantwise looking at them with fond admiration i dont mind giving a personal guarantee that theres nothing equal to that for the money either in england or in france  they are very nice said mr dockwrath when a man has had produced before him for his own and sole delectation any article or articles how can he avoid eulogium mr dockwrath found himself obliged to pause and almost feared that he should find himself obliged to buy  nice i should rather think they are said mr kantwise becoming triumphantand for fifteen ten delivered boxes included theres nothing like iron sir nothing you may take my word for that theyre so strong you know look here sir and then mr kantwise taking two of the pieces of whiteybrown paper which had been laid aside carefully spread one on the centre of the round table and the other on the seat of one of the chairs then lightly poising himself on his toe he stepped on to the chair and from thence on to the table in that position he skillfully brought his feet together so that his weight was directly on the leg and gracefully waved his hands over his head james and boots stood by admiring with open mouths and mr dockwrath with his hands in his pockets was meditating whether he could not give the order without complying with the terms as to ready money  illustration there is nothing like iron sir nothing  look at that for strength said mr kantwise from his exalted position i dont think any lady of your acquaintance sir would allow you to stand on her rosewood or mahogany lootable and if she did you would not like to adventure it yourself but look at this for strength and he waved his arms abroad still keeping his feet skilfully together in the same exact position  at that moment mr moulder awoke so youve got your iron traps out have you said he what youre there are you upon my word id sooner you than me  i certainly should not like to see you up here mr moulder i doubt whether even this table would bear fiveandtwenty stone joe lend me your shoulder theres a good fellow and then mr kantwise bearing very lightly on the chair descended to the ground without accident  now thats what i call gammon said moulder  what is gammon mr moulder said the other beginning to be angry  its all gammon the chairs and tables is gammon and so is the stools and the screens  mr moulder i didnt call your tea and coffee and brandy gammon  you cant and you wouldnt do any harm if you did hubbles and grease are too well known in yorkshire for you to hurt them but as for all that showoff and gimcrackwork i tell you fairly it aint what i call trade and it aint fit for a commercial room its gammon gammon gammon james give me a bedcandle and so mr moulder took himself off to bed  i think ill go too said mr dockwrath  youll let me put you up the set eh said mr kantwise  well ill think about it said the attorney ill not just give you an answer tonight good night sir im very much obliged to you and he too went leaving mr kantwise to repack his chairs and tables with the assistance of james the waiter     chapter vii  the masons of groby park   groby park is about seven miles from leeds in the direction of bradford and thither on the morning after the scene described in the last chapter mr dockwrath was driven in one of the gigs belonging to the bull inn the park itself is spacious but is flat and uninteresting being surrounded by a thin belt of newlooking firtrees and containing but very little old or handsome timber there are on the high road two very important lodges between which is a large ornamented gate and from thence an excellent road leads to the mansion situated in the very middle of the domain the house is greek in its style of architectureat least so the owner says and if a portico with a pediment and seven ionic columns makes a house greek the house in groby park undoubtedly is greek  here lived mr and mrs mason the three misses mason and occasionally the two young messrs mason for the master of groby park was blessed with five children he himself was a big broad heavybrowed man in whose composition there was nothing of tenderness nothing of poetry and nothing of taste but i cannot say that he was on the whole a bad man he was just in his dealings or at any rate endeavoured to be so he strove hard to do his duty as a county magistrate against very adverse circumstances he endeavoured to enable his tenants and labourers to live he was severe to his children and was not loved by them but nevertheless they were dear to him and he endeavoured to do his duty by them the wife of his bosom was not a pleasant woman but nevertheless he did his duty by her that is he neither deserted her nor beat her nor locked her up i am not sure that he would not have been justified in doing one of these three things or even all the three for mrs mason of groby park was not a pleasant woman  but yet he was a bad man in that he could never forget and never forgive his mind and heart were equally harsh and hard and inflexible he was a man who considered that it behoved him as a man to resent all injuries and to have his pound of flesh in all cases in his inner thoughts he had ever boasted to himself that he had paid all men all that he owed he had so he thought injured no one in any of the relations of life his tradesmen got their money regularly he answered every mans letter he exacted nothing from any man for which he did not pay he never illused a servant either by bad language or by overwork he never amused himself but devoted his whole time to duties he would fain even have been hospitable could he have gotten his neighbours to come to him and have induced his wife to put upon the table sufficient food for them to eat  such being his virtues what right had any one to injure him when he got from his grocer adulterated coffeehe analyzed the coffee as his halfbrother had done the guanohe would have flayed the man alive if the law would have allowed him had he not paid the man monthly giving him the best price as though for the best article when he was taken in with a warranty for a horse he pursued the culprit to the uttermost maidservants who would not come from their bedrooms at six oclock he would himself disturb while enjoying their stolen slumbers from his children he exacted all titles of respect because he had a right to them he wanted nothing that belonged to any one else but he could not endure that aught should be kept from him which he believed to be his own it may be imagined therefore in what light he esteemed lady mason and her son and how he regarded their residence at orley farm seeing that he firmly believed that orley farm was his own if all the truth were known  i have already hinted that mrs mason was not a delightful woman she had been a beauty and still imagined that she had not lost all pretension to be so considered she spent therefore a considerable portion of her day in her dressingroom spent a great deal of money for clothes and gave herself sundry airs she was a little woman with long eyes and regular eyelashes with a straight nose and thin lips and regular teeth her face was oval and her hair was brown it had at least once been all brown and that which was now seen was brown also but nevertheless although she was possessed of all these charms you might look at her for ten days together and on the eleventh you would not know her if you met her in the streets  but the appearance of mrs mason was not her forte she had been a beauty but if it had been her lot to be known in history it was not as a beauty that she would have been famous parsimony was her great virtue and a power of saving her strong point i have said that she spent much money in dress and some people will perhaps think that the two points of character are not compatible such people know nothing of a true spirit of parsimony it is from the backs and bellies of other people that savings are made with the greatest constancy and the most satisfactory results  the parsimony of a mistress of a household is best displayed on matters eatableon matters eatable and drinkable for there is a fine scope for domestic savings in tea beer and milk and in such matters chiefly did mrs mason operate going as far as she dared towards starving even her husband but nevertheless she would feed herself in the middle of the day having a roast fowl with bread sauce in her own room the miser who starves himself and dies without an ounce of flesh on his bones while his skinny head lies on a bag of gold is after all respectable there has been a grand passion in his life and that grandest work of man selfdenial you cannot altogether despise one who has clothed himself with rags and fed himself with bonescrapings while broadcloth and ortolans were within his easy reach but there are women wives and mothers of families who would give the bonescrapings to their husbands and the bones to their servants while they hide the ortolans for themselves and would dress children in rags while they cram chests drawers and boxes with silks and satins for their own backs such a woman one can thoroughly despise and even hate and such a woman was mrs mason of groby park  i shall not trouble the reader at present with much description of the young masons the eldest son was in the army and the younger at cambridge both spending much more money than their father allowed them not that he in this respect was specially closefisted he ascertained what was sufficientamply sufficient as he was told by the colonel of the regiment and the tutor of the collegeand that amount he allowed assuring both joseph and john that if they spent more they would themselves have to pay for it out of the moneys which should enrich them in future years but how could the sons of such a mother be other than spendthrifts of course they were extravagant of course they spent more than they should have done and their father resolved that he would keep his word with them religiously  the daughters were much less fortunate having no possible means of extravagance allowed to them both the father and mother decided that they should go out into the county society and therefore their clothing was not absolutely of rags but any young lady who does go into society whether it be of county or town will fully understand the difference between a liberal and a stingy wardrobe girls with slender provisions of millinery may be fit to go outquite fit in their fathers eyes and yet all such going out may be matter of intense pain it is all very well for the world to say that a girl should be happy without reference to her clothes show me such a girl and i will show you one whom i should be very sorry that a boy of mine should choose as his sweetheart  the three misses mason as they always were called by the groby park people had been christened diana creusa and penelope their mother having a passion for classic literature which she indulged by a use of lemprières dictionary they were not especially pretty nor were they especially plain they were well grown and healthy and quite capable of enjoying themselves in any of the amusements customary to young ladiesif only the opportunities were afforded them  mr dockwrath had thought it well to write to mr mason acquainting that gentleman with his intended visit mr mason he said to himself would recognise his name and know whence he came and under such circumstances would be sure to see him although the express purpose of the proposed interview should not have been explained to him such in result was exactly the case mr mason did remember the name of dockwrath though he had never hitherto seen the bearer of it and as the letter was dated from hamworth he felt sufficient interest in the matter to await at home the coming of his visitor  i know your name mr mason sir and have known it long said mr dockwrath seating himself in the chair which was offered to him in the magistrates study though i never had the pleasure of seeing you beforeto my knowledge my name is dockwrath sir and i am a solicitor i live at hamworth and i married the daughter of old mr usbech sir whom you will remember  mr mason listened attentively as these details were uttered before him so clearly but he said nothing merely bowing his head at each separate statement he knew all about old usbechs daughter nearly as well as mr dockwrath did himself but he was a man who knew how to be silent upon occasions  i was too young sir continued dockwrath when you had that trial about orley farm to have anything to do with the matter myself but nevertheless i remember all the circumstances as though it was yesterday i suppose sir you remember them also  yes mr dockwrath i remember them very well  well sir my impression has always been that and then the attorney stopped it was quite his intention to speak out plainly before mr mason but he was anxious that that gentleman should speak out too at any rate it might be well that he should be induced to express some little interest in the matter  your impression you say has always been said mr mason repeating the words of his companion and looking as ponderous and grave as ever his countenance however expressed nothing but his usual ponderous solemnity  my impression always wasthat there was something that had not been as yet found out  what sort of thing mr dockwrath  well some secret i dont think that your lawyers managed the matter well mr mason  you think you would have done it better mr dockwrath  i dont say that mr mason i was only a lad at the time and could not have managed it at all but they didnt ferret about enough mr mason theres a deal better evidence than any that is given by word of mouth a clever counsel can turn a witness pretty nearly any way he likes but he cant do that with little facts he hasnt the time you see to get round them your lawyers sir didnt get up the little facts as they should have done  and you have got them up since mr dockwrath  i dont say that mr mason you see all my interest lies in maintaining the codicil my wifes fortune came to her under that deed to be sure thats gone and spent long since and the lord chancellor with all the judges couldnt enforce restitution but nevertheless i wouldnt wish that any one should have a claim against me on that account  perhaps you will not object to say what it is that you do wish  i wish to see right done mr mason thats all i dont think that lady mason or her son have any right to the possession of that place i dont think that that codicil was a correct instrument and in that case of mason versus mason i dont think that you and your friends got to the bottom of it and then mr dockwrath leaned back in his chair with an inward determination to say nothing more until mr mason should make some sign  that gentleman however still remained ponderous and heavy and therefore there was a short period of silenceand have you got to the bottom of it since mr dockwrath at last he said  i dont say that i have said the attorney  might i ask then what it is you propose to effect by the visit with which you have honoured me of course you are aware that these are very private matters and although i should feel myself under an obligation to you or to any man who might assist me to arrive at any true facts which have hitherto been concealed i am not disposed to discuss the affair with a stranger on grounds of mere suspicion  i shouldnt have come here mr mason at very great expense and personal inconvenience to myself in my profession if i had not some good reason for doing so i dont think that you ever got to the bottom of that matter and i cant say that i have done so now i havent even tried but i tell you what mr mason if you wish it i think i could put you in the way oftrying  my lawyers are messrs round and crook of bedford row will it not be better that you should go to them mr dockwrath  no mr mason i dont think it will be better that i should go to them i know round and crook well and dont mean to say a word against them but if i go any farther into this affair i must do it with the principal i am not going to cut my own throat for the sake of mending any mans little finger i have a family of sixteen children mr mason and i have to look about very sharpvery sharp indeed then there was another pause and mr dockwrath began to perceive that mr mason was not by nature an open demonstrative or communicative man if anything further was to be done he himself must open out a little the fact is mr mason that i have come across documents which you should have had at that trial round and crook ought to have had them only they werent half sharp why sir mr usbech had been your fathers man of business for years upon years and yet they didnt half go through his papers they turned em over and looked at em but never thought of seeing what little facts might be proved  and these documents are with you now here  no mr mason i am not so soft as that i never carry about original documents unless when ordered to prove copies of one or two items i have made not regular copies mr mason but just a line or two to refresh my memory and mr dockwrath took a small lettercase out of his breast coat pocket  by this time mr masons curiosity had been roused and he began to think it possible that his visitor had discovered information which might be of importance to him are you going to show me any document said he  thats as may be said the attorney i dont know as yet whether you care to see it i have come a long way to do you a service and it seems to me you are rather shy of coming forward to meet me as i said before ive a very heavy family and im not going to cut the nose off my own face to put money into any other mans pocket what do you think my journey down here will cost me including loss of time and interruption to my business  look here mr dockwrath if you are really able to put me into possession of any facts regarding the orley farm estate which i ought to know i will see that you are compensated for your time and trouble messrs round and crook  ill have nothing to do with round and crook so thats settled mr mason  then mr dockwrath  half a minute mr mason ill have nothing to do with round and crook but as i know you to be a gentleman and a man of honour ill put you in possession of what ive discovered and leave it to you afterwards to do what you think right about my expenses time and services you wont forget that it is a long way from hamworth to groby park and if you should succeed  if i am to look at this document i must do so without pledging myself to anything said mr mason still with much solemnity he had great doubts as to his new acquaintance and much feared that he was derogating from his dignity as a county magistrate and owner of groby park in holding any personal intercourse with him but nevertheless he could not resist the temptation he most firmly believed that that codicil had not expressed the genuine last will and fair disposition of property made by his father and it might certainly be the case that proof of all that he believed was to be found among the papers of the old lawyer he hated lady mason with all his power of hatred and if there did even yet exist for him a chance of upsetting her claims and ruining her before the world he was not the man to forego that chance  well sir you shall see it said mr dockwrath or rather hear it for there is not much to see and so saying he extracted from his pocketbook a very small bit of paper  i should prefer to read it if its all the same to you mr dockwrath i shall understand it much better in that way  as you like mr mason said the attorney handing him the small bit of paper you will understand sir that its no real copy but only a few dates and particulars just jotted down to assist my own memory the document supported by which mr dockwrath had come down to yorkshire consisted of half a sheet of note paper and the writing upon this covered hardly the half of it the words which mr mason read were as follows      date of codicil 14th july 18     witnesses to the instrument john kenneby bridget    bolster jonathan usbech nb jonathan usbech died before    the testator     mason and martock deed of separation dated 14th july    18     executed at orley farm     witnesses john kenneby and bridget bolster deed was    prepared in the office of jonathan usbech and probably    executed in his presence   that was all that was written on the paper and mr mason read the words to himself three times before he looked up or said anything concerning them he was not a man quick at receiving new ideas into his mind or of understanding new points but that which had once become intelligible to him and been made his own remained so always well said he when he read the above words for the third time  you dont see it sir said mr dockwrath  see what said mr mason still looking at the scrap of paper  why the dates to begin with  i see that the dates are the samethe 14th of july in the same year  well said mr dockwrath looking very keenly into the magistrates face  well said mr mason looking over the paper at his boot  john kenneby and bridget bolster were witnesses to both the instruments said the attorney  so i see said the magistrate  but i dont remember that it came out in evidence that either of them recollected having been called on for two signatures on the same day  no there was nothing of that came outor was even hinted at  no nothing even hinted at mr masonas you justly observe that is what i mean by saying that round and crooks people didnt get up their little facts believe me sir there are men in the profession out of london who know quite as much as round and crook they ought to have had those facts seeing that the very copy of the document was turned over by their hands and mr dockwrath hit the table heavily in the warmth of his indignation against his professional brethren earlier in the interview mr mason would have been made very angry by such freedom but he was not angry now  yes they ought to have known it said he but he did not even yet see the point he merely saw that there was a point worth seeing  known it of course they ought to have known it look here mr mason if i had it on my mind that id thrown over a client of mine by such carelessness as that idid strike my own name off the rolls i would indeed i never could look a counsel in the face again if id neglected to brief him with such facts as those i suppose it was carelessness eh mr mason  oh yes im afraid so said mr mason still rather in the dark  they could have had no object in keeping it back i should say  no none in life but let us see mr dockwrath how does it bear upon us the dates are the same and the witnesses the same  the deed of separation is genuine there is no doubt about that  oh youre sure of that  quite certain i found it entered in the old office books it was the last of a lot of such documents executed between mason and martock after the old man gave up the business you see she was always with him and knew all about it  about the partnership deed  of course she did shes a clever woman mr mason very clever and its almost a pity that she should come to grief she has carried it on so well hasnt she  mr masons face now became very black why said he if what you seem to allege be true she must be aaa what do you mean sir by pity  mr dockwrath shrugged his shoulders it is very blue said he uncommon blue  she must be a swindler a common swindler nay worse than that  oh yes a deal worse than that mr mason and as for commonaccording to my way of thinking theres nothing at all common about it i look upon it as about the best gotup plant i ever remember to have heard of i do indeed mr mason the attorney during the last ten minutes of the conversation had quite altered his tone understanding that he had already achieved a great part of his object but mr mason in his intense anxiety did not observe this had mr dockwrath in commencing the conversation talked about plants and blue mr mason would probably have rung his bell for the servant if its anything its forgery said mr dockwrath looking his companion full in the face  i always felt sure that my father never intended to sign such a codicil as that  he never did sign it mr mason  andand the witnesses said mr mason still not enlightened as to the true extent of the attorneys suspicion  they signed the other deed that is two of them did there is no doubt about thaton that very day they certainly did witness a signature made by the old gentleman in his own room on that 14th of july the original of that document with the date and their names will be forthcoming soon enough  well said mr mason  but they did not witness two signatures  you think not eh  im sure of it the girl bolster would have remembered it and would have said so she was sharp enough  who wrote all the names then at the foot of the will said mr mason  ah thats the question who did write them we know very well mr mason you and i that is who did not and having come to that i think we may give a very good guess who did  and then they both sat silent for some three or four minutes mr dockwrath was quite at his ease rubbing his chin with his hand playing with a paperknife which he had taken from the study table and waiting till it should please mr mason to renew the conversation mr mason was not at his ease though all idea of affecting any reserve before the attorney had left him he was thinking how best he might confound and destroy the woman who had robbed him for so many years who had defied him got the better of him and put him to terrible cost who had vexed his spirit through his whole life deprived him of content and had been to him as a thorn ever present in a festering sore he had always believed that she had defrauded him but this belief had been qualified by the unbelief of others it might have been he had half thought that the old man had signed the codicil in his dotage having been cheated and bullied into it by the woman there had been no day in her life on which he would not have ruined her had it been in his power to do so but nownow new and grander ideas were breaking in upon his mind could it be possible that he might live to see her not merely deprived of her illgained money but standing in the dock as a felon to receive sentence for her terrible misdeeds if that might be so would he not receive great compensation for all that he had suffered would it not be sweet to his sense of justice that both of them should thus at last have their own he did not even yet understand all that mr dockwrath suspected he did not fully perceive why the woman was supposed to have chosen as the date of her forgery the date of that other genuine deed but he did understand he did perceiveat least so he thoughtthat new and perhaps conclusive evidence of her villainy was at last within his reach  and what shall we do now mr dockwrath he said at last  well am i to understand that you do me the honour of asking my advice upon that question as being your lawyer  this question immediately brought mr mason back to business that he did understand a man in my position cannot very well change his legal advisers at a moments notice you must be very well aware of that mr dockwrath messrs round and crook  messrs round and crook sir have neglected your business in a most shameful manner let me tell you that sir  well thats as may be ill tell you what ill do mr dockwrath ill think over this matter in quiet and then ill come up to town perhaps when there i may expect the honour of a further visit from you  and you wont mention the matter to round and crook  i cant undertake to say that mr dockwrath i think it will perhaps be better that i should mention it and then see you afterwards  and how about my expenses down here  just at this moment there came a light tap at the study door and before the master of the house could give or withhold permission the mistress of the house entered the room my dear she said i didnt know that you were engaged  yes i am engaged said the gentleman  oh im sure i beg pardon perhaps this is the gentleman from hamworth  yes maam said mr dockwrath i am the gentleman from hamworth i hope i have the pleasure of seeing you very well maam and getting up from his chair he bowed politely  mr dockwrath mrs mason said the ladys husband introducing them and then mrs mason curtsied to the stranger she too was very anxious to know what might be the news from hamworth  mr dockwrath will lunch with us my dear said mr mason and then the lady on hospitable cares intent left them again to themselves     chapter viii  mrs masons hot luncheon   though mr dockwrath was somewhat elated by this invitation to lunch he was also somewhat abashed by it he had been far from expecting that mr mason of groby park would do him any such honour and was made aware by it of the great hold which he must have made upon the attention of his host but nevertheless he immediately felt that his hands were to a certain degree tied he having been invited to sit down at mr masons table with mrs m and the familyhaving been treated as though he were a gentleman and thus being for the time being put on a footing of equality with the county magistrate could not repeat that last important question how about my expenses down here nor could he immediately go on with the grand subject in any frame of mind which would tend to further his own interests having been invited to lunch he could not haggle with due persistency for his share of the business in crushing lady mason nor stipulate that the whole concern should not be trusted to the management of round and crook as a source of pride this invitation to eat was pleasant to him but he was forced to acknowledge to himself that it interfered with business  nor did mr mason feel himself ready to go on with the conversation in the manner in which it had been hitherto conducted his mind was full of orley farm and his wrongs and he could bring himself to think of nothing else but he could no longer talk about it to the attorney sitting there in his study will you take a turn about the place while the lunch is getting ready he said so they took their hats and went out into the garden  it is dreadful to think of said mr mason after they had twice walked in silence the length of a broad gravel terrace  what about her ladyship said the attorney  quite dreadful and mr mason shuddered i dont think i ever heard of anything so shocking in my life for twenty years mr dockwrath think of that twenty years and his face as he spoke became almost black with horror  it is very shocking said mr dockwrath very shocking what on earth will be her fate if it be proved against her she has brought it on herself that is all that one can say of her  d her d her exclaimed the other gnashing his teeth with concentrated wrath no punishment will be bad enough for her hanging would not be bad enough  they cant hang her mr mason said mr dockwrath almost frightened by the violence of his companion  no they have altered the laws giving every encouragement to forgers villains and perjurers but they can give her penal servitude for life they must do it  she is not convicted yet you know  d her repeated the owner of groby park again as he thought of his twenty years of loss eight hundred a year for twenty years had been taken away from him and he had been worsted before the world after a hard fight d her he continued to growl between his teeth mr dockwrath when he had first heard his companion say how horrid and dreadful the affair was had thought that mr mason was alluding to the condition in which the lady had placed herself by her assumed guilt but it was of his own condition that he was speaking the idea which shocked him was the thought of the treatment which he himself had undergone the dreadful thing at which he shuddered was his own ill usage as for herpity for her did a man ever pity a rat that had eaten into his choicest dainties  the lunch is on the table sir said the groby park footman in the groby park livery under the present household arrangement of groby park all the servants lived on board wages mrs mason did not like this system though it had about it certain circumstances of economy which recommended it to her it interfered greatly with the stringent aptitudes of her character and the warmest passion of her heart it took away from her the delicious power of serving out the servants food of locking up the scraps of meat and of charging the maids with voracity but to tell the truth mr mason had been driven by sheer necessity to take this step as it had been found impossible to induce his wife to give out sufficient food to enable the servants to live and work she knew that in not doing so she injured herself but she could not do it the knife in passing through the loaf would make the portion to be parted with less by one third than the portion to be retained half a pound of salt butter would reduce itself to a quarter of a pound portions of meat would become infinitesimal when standing with viands before her she had not free will over her hands she could not bring herself to part with victuals though she might ruin herself by retaining them therefore by the order of the master were the servants placed on board wages  mr dockwrath soon found himself in the diningroom where the three young ladies with their mamma were already seated at the table it was a handsome room and the furniture was handsome but nevertheless it was a heavy room and the furniture was heavy the table was large enough for a party of twelve and might have borne a noble banquet as it was the promise was not bad for there were three large plated covers concealing hot viands and in some houses lunch means only bread and cheese  mr mason went through the form of introduction between mr dockwrath and his daughters that is miss mason that miss creusa mason and this miss penelope john remove the covers and the covers were removed john taking them from the table with a magnificent action of his arm which i am inclined to think was not innocent of irony on the dish before the master of the housea large dish which must i fancy have been selected by the cook with some similar attempt at sarcasmthere reposed three scraps as to the nature of which mr dockwrath though he looked hard at them was unable to enlighten himself but mr mason knew them well as he now placed his eyes on them for the third time they were old enemies of his and his brow again became black as he looked at them the scraps in fact consisted of two drumsticks of a fowl and some indescribable bone out of the back of the same the original bird had no doubt first revealed all its glories to human eyespresuming the eyes of the cook to be inhumanin mrs masons boodoor then on the dish before the lady there were three other morsels blacklooking and very suspicious to the eye which in the course of conversation were proclaimed to be hambroiled ham mrs mason would never allow a ham in its proper shape to come into the room because it is an article upon which the guests are themselves supposed to operate with the carvingknife lastly on the dish before miss creusa there reposed three potatoes  the face of mr mason became very black as he looked at the banquet which was spread upon his board and mrs mason eyeing him across the table saw that it was so she was not a lady who despised such symptoms in her lord or disregarded in her valour the violence of marital storms she had quailed more than once or twice under rebuke occasioned by her great domestic virtue and knew that her husband though he might put up with much as regarded his own comfort and that of his children could be very angry at injuries done to his household honour and character as a hospitable english country gentleman  consequently the lady smiled and tried to look selfsatisfied as she invited her guest to eat this is ham said she with a little simper broiled ham mr dockwrath and there is chicken at the other end i think they call itdevilled  shall i assist the young ladies to anything first said the attorney wishing to be polite  nothing thank you said miss penelope with a very stiff bow she also knew that mr dockwrath was an attorney from hamworth and considered herself by no means bound to hold any sort of conversation with him  my daughters only eat bread and butter in the middle of the day said the lady creusa my dear will you give mr dockwrath a potato mr mason mr dockwrath will probably take a bit of that chicken  i would recommend him to follow the girls example and confine himself to the bread and butter said the master of the house pushing about the scraps with his knife and fork there is nothing here for him to eat  my dear exclaimed mrs mason  there is nothing here for him to eat repeated mr mason and as far as i can see there is nothing there either what is it you pretend to have in that dish  my dear again exclaimed mrs mason  what is it repeated the lord of the house in an angry tone  broiled ham mr mason  then let the ham be brought in said he diana ring the bell  but the ham is not cooked mr mason said the lady broiled ham is always better when it has not been first boiled  is there no cold meat in the house he asked  i am afraid not she replied now trembling a little in anticipation of what might be coming after the stranger should have gone you never like large joints yourself mr mason and for ourselves we dont eat meat at luncheon  nor anybody else either here said mr mason in his anger  pray dont mind me mr mason said the attorney pray dont mr mason i am a very poor fist at lunch i am indeed  i am sure i am very sorry very sorry mr mason continued the lady if i had known that an early dinner was required it should have been providedalthough the notice given was so very short  i never dine early said mr dockwrath thinking that some imputation of a low way of living was conveyed in this supposition that he required a dinner under the pseudonym of a lunch i never do upon my wordwe are quite regular at home at halfpast five and all i ever take in the middle of the day is a biscuit and a glass of sherryor perhaps a bite of bread and cheese dont be uneasy about me mrs mason  the three young ladies having now finished their repast got up from the table and retired following each other out of the room in a line mrs mason remained for a minute or two longer and then she also went the carriage has been ordered at three mr m she said shall we have the pleasure of your company no growled the husband and then the lady went sweeping a low curtsy to mr dockwrath as she passed out of the room  there was again a silence between the host and his guest for some two or three minutes during which mr mason was endeavouring to get the lunch out of his head and to redirect his whole mind to lady mason and his hopes of vengeance there is nothing perhaps so generally consoling to a man as a wellestablished grievance a feeling of having been injured on which his mind can brood from hour to hour allowing him to plead his own cause in his own court within his own heartand always to plead it successfully at last mr mason succeeded and he could think of his enemys fraud and forget his wifes meanness i suppose i may as well order my gig now said mr dockwrath as soon as his host had arrived at this happy frame of mind  your gig ah well yes i do not know that i need detain you any longer i can assure you that i am much obliged to you mr dockwrath and i shall hope to see you in london very shortly  you are determined to go to round and crook i suppose  oh certainly  you are wrong sir theyll throw you over again as sure as your name is mason  mr dockwrath you must if you please allow me to judge of that myself  oh of course sir of course but im sure that a gentleman like you mr mason will understand  i shall understand that i cannot expect your services mr dockwrathyour valuable time and serviceswithout remunerating you for them that shall be fully explained to messrs round and crook  very well sir very well as long as i am paid for what i do i am content a professional gentleman of course expects that how is he to get along else particular with sixteen children and then mr dockwrath got into the gig and was driven back to the bull at leeds     chapter ix  a convivial meeting   on the whole mr dockwrath was satisfied with the results of his trip to groby park and was in a contented frame of mind as he was driven back to leeds no doubt it would have been better could he have persuaded mr mason to throw over messrs round and crook and put himself altogether into the hands of his new adviser but this had been too much to expect he had not expected it and had made the suggestion as the surest means of getting the best terms in his power rather than with a hope of securing the actual advantage named he had done much towards impressing mr mason with an idea of his own sharpness and perhaps something also towards breaking the prestige which surrounded the names of the great london firm he would now go to that firm and make his terms with them they would probably be quite as ready to acquiesce in the importance of his information as had been mr mason  before leaving the inn after breakfast he had agreed to join the dinner in the commercial room at five oclock and mr masons hot lunch had by no means induced him to alter his purpose i shall dine here he had said when mr moulder was discussing with the waiter the allimportant subject of dinner at the commercial table sir the waiter had asked doubtingly mr dockwrath had answered boldly in the affirmative whereat mr moulder had growled but mr kantwise had expressed satisfaction we shall be extremely happy to enjoy your company mr kantwise had said with a graceful bow making up by his excessive courtesy for the want of any courtesy on the part of his brothertraveller with reference to all this mr moulder said nothing the stranger had been admitted into the room to a certain extent even with his own consent and he could not now be turned out but he resolved within his own mind that for the future he would be more firm in maintaining the ordinances and institutes of his profession  on his road home mr dockwrath had encountered mr kantwise going to groby park intent on his sale of a drawingroom set of the metallic furniture and when he again met him in the commercial room he asked after his success a wonderful woman that mr dockwrath said mr kantwise a really wonderful woman no particular friend of yours i think you say  none in the least mr kantwise  then i may make bold to assert that for persevering sharpness she beats all that i ever met even in yorkshire and mr kantwise looked at his new friend over his shoulder and shook his head as though lost in wonder and admiration what do you think shes done now  she didnt give you much to eat i take it  much to eat ill tell you what it is mr dockwrath my belief is that woman would have an absolute pleasure in starving a christian i do indeed ill tell you what she has done she has made me put her up a set of them things at twelve seventeen six i neednt tell you that they were never made for the money  why then did you part with them at a loss  well thats the question i was soft i suppose she got round me badgering me till i didnt know where i was she wanted them as a present for the curates wife she said whatever should induce her to make a present  she got them for twelve seventeen six did she said dockwrath thinking that it might be as well to remember this if he should feel inclined to make a purchase himself  but they was strained mr dockwrath i must admit they was strainedparticularly the loo  you had gone through your gymnastics on it a little too often asked the attorney but this mr kantwise would not acknowledge the strength of that table was such that he could stand on it for ever without injury to it but nevertheless in some other way it had become strained and therefore he had sold the set to mrs mason for £12 17s 6d that lady being minded to make a costly present to the wife of the curate of groby  when dinnertime came mr dockwrath found that the party was swelled to the number of eight five other undoubted commercials having brought themselves to anchor at the bull inn during the day to all of these mr kantwise introduced him mr gape mr dockwrath said he gracefully moving towards them the palm of his hand and eyeing them over his shoulder mr gape is in the stationery line he added in a whisper to the attorney and does for cumming and jibber of st pauls churchyard mr johnson mr dockwrath mr j is from sheffield mr snengkeld mr dockwrath and then he imparted in another whisper the necessary information as to mr snengkeld soft goods for brown brothers of snow hill and so on through the whole fraternity each member bowed as his name was mentioned but they did not do so very graciously as mr kantwise was not a great man among them had the stranger been introduced to them by mouldermoulder the patriarchhis reception among them would have been much warmer and then they sat down to dinner mr moulder taking the chair as president and mr kantwise sitting opposite to him as being the longest sojourner at the inn mr dockwrath sat at the right hand of kantwise discreetly avoiding the neighbourhood of moulder and the others ranged themselves according to fancy at the table come up along side of me old fellow moulder said to snengkeld it aint the first time that you and i have smacked our lips together over the same bit of roast beef nor wont i hope be the last by a long chalk mr moulder said snengkeld speaking with a deep hoarse voice which seemed to ascend from some region of his body far below his chest moulder and snengkeld were congenial spirits but the latter though the older man was not endowed with so large a volume of body or so highly dominant a spirit brown brothers of snow hill were substantial people and mr snengkeld travelled in strict accordance with the good old rules of trade which moulder loved so well  the politeness and general good manners of the company were something very pretty to witness mr dockwrath as a stranger was helped first and every courtesy was shown to him even mr moulder carved the beef for him with a loving hand and mr kantwise was almost subservient in his attention mr dockwrath thought that he had certainly done right in coming to the commercial table and resolved on doing so on all occasions of future journeys so far all was good the commercial dinner as he had ascertained would cost him only two shillings and a much inferior repast eaten by himself elsewhere would have stood in his bill for three so far all was good but the test by which he was to be tried was now approaching him  when the dinner was just half overmr moulder well knew how to mark the timethat gentleman called for the waiter and whispered an important order into that functionarys ears the functionary bowed retired from the room and reappeared again in two minutes bearing a bottle of sherry in each hand one of these he deposited at the right hand of mr moulder and the other at the right hand of mr kantwise  sir said mr moulder addressing himself with great ceremony to mr dockwrath the honour of a glass of wine with you sir and the president to give more importance to the occasion put down his knife and fork leaned back in his chair and put both his hands upon his waistcoat looking intently at the attorney out of his little eyes  mr dockwrath was immediately aware that a crisis had come upon him which demanded an instant decision if he complied with the presidents invitation he would have to pay his proportion of all the wine bill that might be incurred that evening by the seven commercial gentlemen at the table and he knew well that commercial gentlemen do sometimes call for bottle after bottle with a reckless disregard of expense but to him with his sixteen children wine at an hotel was terrible a pint of beer and a glass of brandy and water were the luxuries which he had promised himself and with manly fortitude he resolved that he would not be coerced into extravagance by any president or any moulder  sir said he im obliged by the honour but i dont drink wine to my dinner whereupon mr moulder bowed his head very solemnly winked at snengkeld and then drank wine with that gentleman  its the rule of the room whispered mr kantwise into mr dockwraths ear but mr dockwrath pretended not to hear him and the matter was allowed to pass by for the time  but mr snengkeld asked him for the honour as also did mr gape who sat at moulders left hand and then mr dockwrath began to wax angry i think i remarked before that i dont drink wine to my dinner he said and then the three at the presidents end of the table all looked at each other very solemnly and they all winked and after that there was very little conversation during the remainder of the meal for men knew that the goddess of discord was in the air  the cheese came and with that a bottle of port wine which was handed round mr dockwrath of course refusing to join in the conviviality and then the cloth was drawn and the decanters were put before the president james bring me a little brandyandwater said the attorney striving to put a bold face on the matter but yet speaking with diminished voice  half a moment if you please sir said moulder and then he exclaimed with stentorian voice james the dinner bill yes sir said the waiter and disappeared without any thought towards the requisition for brandyandwater from mr dockwrath  for the next five minutes they all remained silent except that mr moulder gave the queens health as he filled his glass and pushed the bottles from him gentlemen the queen and then he lifted his glass of port up to the light shut one eye as he looked at it and immediately swallowed the contents as though he were taking a dose of physic im afraid theyll charge you for the wine said mr kantwise again whispering to his neighbour but mr dockwrath paid no apparent attention to what was said to him he was concentrating his energies with a view to the battle  james the waiter soon returned he also knew well what was about to happen and he trembled as he handed in the document to the president lets have it james said moulder with much pleasantry as he took the paper in his hand the old ticket i suppose five bob a head and then he read out the bill the total of which wine and beer included came to forty shillings five shillings a head gentlemen as i said you and i can make a pretty good guess as to the figure eh snengkeld and then he put down his two halfcrowns on the waiter as also did mr snengkeld and then mr gape and so on till it came to mr kantwise  i think you and i will leave it and settle at the bar said kantwise appealing to dockwrath and intending peace if peace were still possible  no shouted moulder from the other end of the table let the man have his money now and then his troubles will be over if theres to be any fuss about it lets have it out i like to see the dinner bill settled as soon as the dinner is eaten then one gets an appetite for ones supper  i dont think i have the change said kantwise still putting off the evil day  ill lend it you said moulder putting his hand into his trouserspockets but the money was forthcoming out of mr kantwises own proper repositories and with slow motion he put down the five shillings one after the other  and then the waiter came to mr dockwrath whats this said the attorney taking up the bill and looking at it the whole matter had been sufficiently explained to him but nevertheless mr moulder explained it again in commercial rooms sir as no doubt you must be well aware seeing that you have done us the honour of joining us here the dinner bill is divided equally among all the gentlemen as sit down its the rule of the room sir you has what you like and you calls for what you like and conwiviality is thereby encouraged the figure generally comes to five shillings and you afterwards gives what you like to the waiter thats about it aint it james  thats the rule sir in all commercial rooms as i ever see said the waiter  the matter had been so extremely well put by mr moulder and that gentlemans words had carried with them so much conviction that dockwrath felt himself almost tempted to put down the money as far as his sixteen children and general ideas of economy were concerned he would have done so but his legal mind could not bear to be beaten the spirit of litigation within him told him that the point was to be carried moulder gape and snengkeld together could not make him pay for wine he had neither ordered nor swallowed his pocket was guarded by the law of the land and not by the laws of any special room in which he might chance to find himself i shall pay two shillings for my dinner said he and sixpence for my beer and then he deposited the halfcrown  do you mean us to understand said moulder that after forcing your way into this room and sitting down along with gentlemen at this table you refuse to abide by the rules of the room and mr moulder spoke and looked as though he thought that such treachery must certainly lead to most disastrous results the disastrous result which a stranger might have expected at the moment would be a fit of apoplexy on the part of the worthy president  i neither ordered that wine nor did i drink it said mr dockwrath compressing his lips leaning back in his chair and looking up into one corner of the ceiling  the gentleman certainly did not drink the wine said kantwise i must acknowledge that and as for ordering it why that was done by the president in course  gammon said mr moulder and he fixed his eyes steadfastly upon his vice kantwise thats gammon the most of what you says is gammon  mr moulder i dont exactly know what you mean by that word gammon but its objectionable to my feelings its very objectionable i say that the gentleman did not drink the wine and i appeal to the gentleman who sits at the gentlemans right whether what i say is not correct if what i say is correct it cant begammon mr busby did that gentleman drink the wine or did he not  not as i see said mr busby somewhat nervous at being thus brought into the controversy he was a young man just commencing his travels and stood in awe of the great moulder  gammon shouted moulder with a very red face everybody at the table knows he didnt drink the wine everybody saw that he declined the honour when proposed which i dont know that i ever saw a gentleman do at a commercial table till this day barring that he was a teetotaller which is gammon too but its pp here as every commercial gentleman knows kantwise as well as the best of us  pp thats the rule growled snengkeld almost from under the table  in commercial rooms as the gentleman must be aware the rule is as stated by my friend on my right said mr gape the wine is ordered by the president or chairman and is paid for in equal proportions by the company or guests and in his oratory mr gape laid great stress on the word or the gentleman will easily perceive that such a rule as this is necessary in such a society and unless  but mr gape was apt to make long speeches and therefore mr moulder interrupted him you had better pay your five shillings sir and have no jaw about it the man is standing idle there  its not the value of the money said dockwrath but i must decline to acknowledge that i am amenable to the jurisdiction  there has clearly been a mistake said johnson from sheffield and we had better settle it among us anything is better than a row johnson from sheffield was a man somewhat inclined to dispute the supremacy of moulder from houndsditch  no johnson said the president anything is not better than a row a premeditated infraction of our rules is not better than a row  did you say premeditated said kantwise i think not premeditated  i did say premeditated and i say it again  it looks uncommon like it said snengkeld  when a gentleman said gape who does not belong to a society  its no good having more talk said moulder and well soon bring this to an end mr i havent the honour of knowing the gentlemans name  my name is dockwrath and i am a solicitor  oh a solicitor are you and you said last night you was commercial will you be good enough to tell us mr solicitorfor i didnt just catch your name except that it begins with a dockand thats where most of your clients are to be found i suppose  order order order said kantwise holding up both his hands  its the chair as is speaking said mr gape who had a true englishmans notion that the chair itself could not be called to order  you shouldnt insult the gentleman because he has his own ideas said johnson  i dont want to insult no one continued moulder and those who know me best among whom i cant as yet count mr johnson though hopes i shall some day wont say it of me hearhearhear from both snengkeld and gape to which kantwise added a little hearhear of his own of which mr moulder did not quite approve mr snengkeld and mr gape theyre my old friends and they knows me and they knows the way of a commercial roomwhich some gentlemen dont seem as though they do i dont want to insult no one but as chairman here at this conwivial meeting i asks that gentleman who says he is a solicitor whether he means to pay his dinner bill according to the rules of the room or whether he dont  ive paid for what ive had already said dockwrath and i dont mean to pay for what ive not had  james exclaimed moulderand all the chairman was in his voice as he spokemy compliments to mr crump and i will request his attendance for five minutes and then james left the room and there was silence for a while during which the bottles made their round of the table  hadnt we better send back the pint of wine which mr dockwrath hasnt used suggested kantwise  im d if we do replied moulder with much energy and the general silence was not again broken till mr crump made his appearance but the chairman whispered a private word or two to his friend snengkeld i never sent back ordered liquor to the bar yet unless it was bad and im not going to begin now  and then mr crump came in mr crump was a very cleanlooking person without any beard and dressed from head to foot in black he was about fifty with grizzly gray hair which stood upright on his head and his face at the present moment wore on it an innkeepers smile but it could also assume an innkeepers frown and on occasions did sowhen bills were disputed or unreasonable strangers thought that they knew the distance in posting miles round the neighbourhood of leeds better than did he mr crump who had lived at the bull inn all his life but mr crump rarely frowned on commercial gentlemen from whom was derived the main stay of his business and the main prop of his house  mr crump began moulder here has occurred a very unpleasant transaction  i know all about it gentlemen said mr crump the waiter has acquainted me and i can assure you gentlemen that i am extremely sorry that anything should have arisen to disturb the harmony of your dinnertable  we must now call upon you mr crump began mr moulder who was about to demand that dockwrath should be turned bodily out of the room  if youll allow me one moment mr moulder continued mr crump and ill tell you what is my suggestion the gentleman here who i understand is a lawyer does not wish to comply with the rules of the commercial room  i certainly dont wish or intend to pay for drink that i didnt order and havent had said dockwrath  exactly said mr crump and therefore gentlemen to get out of the difficulty well presume if you please that the bill is paid  the lawyer as you call him will have to leave the room said moulder  perhaps he will not object to step over to the coffeeroom on the other side suggested the landlord  i cant think of leaving my seat here under such circumstances said dockwrath  you cant said moulder then you must be made as i take it  let me see the man that will make me said dockwrath  mr crump looked very apologetic and not very comfortable there is a difficulty gentlemen there is a difficulty indeed he said the fact is the gentleman should not have been showed into the room at all and he looked very angrily at his own servant james  he said he was mercial said james so he did now he says as how hes a lawyer whats a poor man to do  im a commercial lawyer said dockwrath  he must leave the room or i shall leave the house said moulder  gentlemen gentlemen said crump this kind of thing does not happen often and on this occasion i must try your kind patience if mr moulder would allow me to suggest that the commercial gentlemen should take their wine in the large drawingroom up stairs this evening mrs c will do her best to make it comfortable for them in five minutes there of course they can be private  there was something in the idea of leaving mr dockwrath alone in his glory which appeased the spirit of the great moulder he had known crump moreover for many years and was aware that it would be a dangerous and probably an expensive proceeding to thrust out the attorney by violence if the other gentlemen are agreeable i am said he the other gentlemen were agreeable and with the exception of kantwise they all rose from their chairs  i must say i think you ought to leave the room as you dont choose to abide by the rules said johnson addressing himself to dockwrath  thats your opinion said dockwrath  yes it is said johnson thats my opinion  my own happens to be different said dockwrath and so he kept his chair  there mr crump said moulder taking half a crown from his pocket and throwing it on the table i shant see you at a loss  thank you sir said mr crump and he very humbly took up the money  i keep a little account for charity at home said moulder  it dont run very high do it asked snengkeld jocosely  not out of the way it dont but now i shall have the pleasure of writing down in it that i paid half a crown for a lawyer who couldnt afford to settle his own dinner bill sir we have the pleasure of wishing you a good night  i hope youll find the large drawingroom up stairs quite comfortable said dockwrath  and then they all marched out of the room each with his own glass mr moulder leading the way with stately step it was pleasant to see them as they all followed their leader across the open passage of the gateway in by the bar and so up the chief staircase mr moulder walked slowly bearing the bottle of port and his own glass and mr snengkeld and mr gape followed in line bearing also their own glasses and maintaining the dignity of their profession under circumstances of some difficulty  illustration and then they all marched out of the room each with his own glass  gentlemen i really am sorry for this little accident said mr crump as they were passing the bar but a lawyer you know  and such a lawyer eh crump said moulder  it might be fiveandtwenty pound to me to lay a hand on him said the landlord  when the time came for mr kantwise to move he considered the matter well the chances however as he calculated them were against any profitable business being done with the attorney so he also left the room good night sir he said as he went i wish you a very good night  take care of yourself said dockwrath and then the attorney spent the rest of the evening alone     chapter x  mr mrs and miss furnival   i will now ask my readers to come with me up to london in order that i may introduce them to the family of the furnivals we shall see much of the furnivals before we reach the end of our present undertaking and it will be well that we should commence our acquaintance with them as early as may be done  mr furnival was a lawyeri mean a barristerbelonging to lincolns inn and living at the time at which our story is supposed to commence in harley street but he had not been long a resident in harley street having left the less fashionable neighbourhood of russell square only two or three years before that period on his marriage he had located himself in a small house in keppel street and had there remained till professional success long waited for enabled him to move further west and indulge himself with the comforts of larger rooms and more servants at the time of which i am now speaking mr furnival was known and well known as a successful man but he had struggled long and hard before that success had come to him and during the earliest years of his married life had found the work of keeping the wolf from the door to be almost more than enough for his energies  mr furnival practised at the common law bar and early in life had attached himself to the home circuit i cannot say why he obtained no great success till he was nearer fifty than forty years of age at that time i fancy that barristers did not come to their prime till a period of life at which other men are supposed to be in their decadence nevertheless he had married on nothing and had kept the wolf from the door to do this he had been constant at his work in season and out of season during the long hours of day and the long hours of night throughout his term times he had toiled in court and during the vacations he had toiled out of court he had reported volumes of cases having been himself his own shorthand writeras it is well known to most young lawyers who as a rule always fill an upper shelf in their law libraries with furnival and staples seventeen volumes in calf he had worked for the booksellers and for the newspapers and for the attorneysalways working however with reference to the law and though he had worked for years with the lowest pay no man had heard him complain that no woman had heard him do so i will not say as it is more than probable that into the sympathising ears of mrs furnival he did pour forth plaints as to the small wages which the legal world meted out to him in return for his labours he was a constant hard patient man and at last there came to him the full reward of all his industry what was the special case by which mr furnival obtained his great success no man could say in all probability there was no special case gradually it began to be understood that he was a safe man understanding his trade true to his clients and very damaging as an opponent legal gentlemen are i believe quite as often bought off as bought up sir richard and mr furnival could not both be required on the same side seeing what a tower of strength each was in himself but then sir richard would be absolutely neutralized if mr furnival were employed on the other side this is a system well understood by attorneys and has been found to be extremely lucrative by gentlemen leading at the bar  mr furnival was now fiftyfive years of age and was beginning to show in his face some traces of his hard work not that he was becoming old or weak or worn but his eye had lost its fireexcept the fire peculiar to his profession and there were wrinkles in his forehead and cheeks and his upper lip except when he was speaking hung heavily over the lower and the loose skin below his eye was forming into saucers and his hair had become grizzled and on his shoulders except when in court there was a slight stoop as seen in his wig and gown he was a man of commanding presenceand for ten men in london who knew him in this garb hardly one knew him without it he was nearly six feet high and stood forth prominently with square broad shoulders and a large body his head also was large his forehead was high and marked strongly by signs of intellect his nose was long and straight his eyes were very gray and capable to an extraordinary degree both of direct severity and of concealed sarcasm witnesses have been heard to say that they could endure all that mr furnival could say to them and continue in some sort to answer all his questions if only he would refrain from looking at them but he would never refrain and therefore it was now well understood how great a thing it was to secure the services of mr furnival sir an attorney would say to an unfortunate client doubtful as to the expenditure your witnesses will not be able to stand in the box if we allow mr furnival to be engaged on the other side i am inclined to think that mr furnival owed to this power of his eyes his almost unequalled perfection in that peculiar branch of his profession his voice was powerful and not unpleasant when used within the precincts of a court though it grated somewhat harshly on the ears in the smaller compass of a private room his flow of words was free and good and seemed to come from him without the slightest effort such at least was always the case with him when standing wigged and gowned before a judge latterly however he had tried his eloquence on another arena and not altogether with equal success he was now in parliament sitting as member for the essex marshes and he had not as yet carried either the country or the house with him although he had been frequently on his legs some men said that with a little practice he would yet become very serviceable as an honourable and learned member but others expressed a fear that he had come too late in life to these new duties  i have spoken of mr furnivals great success in that branch of his profession which required from him the examination of evidence but i would not have it thought that he was great only in this or even mainly in this there are gentlemen at the bar among whom i may perhaps notice my old friend mr chaffanbrass as the most conspicuous who have confined their talents to the browbeating of witnessesgreatly to their own profit and no doubt to the advantage of society but i would have it understood that mr furnival was by no means one of these he had been no old bailey lawyer devoting himself to the manumission of murderers or the security of the swindling world in general he had been employed on abstruse points of law had been great in will cases very learned as to the rights of railways peculiarly apt in enforcing the dowries of married women and successful above all things in separating husbands and wives whose lives had not been passed in accordance with the recognised rules of hymen indeed there is no branch of the common law in which he was not regarded as great and powerful though perhaps his proficiency in damaging the general characters of his opponents has been recognised as his especial forte under these circumstances i should grieve to have him confounded with such men as mr chaffanbrass who is hardly known by the profession beyond the precincts of his own peculiar court in the city mr furnivals reputation has spread itself wherever stuff gowns and horsehair wigs are held in estimation  mr furnival when clothed in his forensic habiliments certainly possessed a solemn and severe dignity which had its weight even with the judges those who scrutinised his appearance critically might have said that it was in some respects pretentious but the ordinary jurymen of this country are not critical scrutinisers of appearance and by them he was never held in light estimation when in his addresses to them appealing to their intelligence education and enlightened justice he would declare that the property of his clients was perfectly safe in their hands he looked to be such an advocate as a litigant would fain possess when dreading the soundness of his own cause any cause was sound to him when once he had been feed for its support and he carried in his countenance his assurance of this soundnessand the assurance of unsoundness in the cause of his opponent even he did not always win but on the occasion of his losing those of the uninitiated who had heard the pleadings would express their astonishment that he should not have been successful  when he was divested of his wig his appearance was not so perfect there was then a hard long straightness about his head and face giving to his countenance the form of a parallelogram to which there belonged a certain meanness of expression he wanted the roundness of forehead the short lines and the graceful curves of face which are necessary to unadorned manly comeliness his whiskers were small grizzled and ill grown and required the ample relief of his wig in no guise did he look other than a clever man but in his dress as a simple citizen he would perhaps be taken as a clever man in whose tenderness of heart and cordiality of feeling one would not at first sight place implicit trust  as a poor man mr furnival had done his duty well by his wife and familyfor as a poor man he had been blessed with four children three of these had died as they were becoming men and women and now as a rich man he was left with one daughter an only child as a poor man mr furnival had been an excellent husband going forth in the morning to his work struggling through the day and then returning to his meagre dinner and his long evenings of unremitting drudgery the bodily strength which had supported him through his work in those days must have been immense for he had allowed himself no holidays and then success and money had comeand mrs furnival sometimes found herself not quite so happy as she had been when watching beside him in the days of their poverty  the equal mindas mortal delius was bidden to remember and as mr furnival might also have remembered had time been allowed him to cultivate the classicsthe equal mind should be as sedulously maintained when things run well as well as when they run hardly and perhaps the maintenance of such equal mind is more difficult in the former than in the latter stage of life be that as it may mr furnival could now be very cross on certain domestic occasions and could also be very unjust and there was worse than thismuch worse behind he who in the heyday of his youth would spend night after night poring over his books copying out reports and never asking to see a female habiliment brighter or more attractive than his wifes sunday gown he at the age of fiftyfive was now running after strange goddesses the member for the essex marshes in these his latter days was obtaining for himself among other successes the character of a lothario and mrs furnival sitting at home in her genteel drawingroom near cavendish square would remember with regret the small dingy parlour in keppel street  mrs furnival in discussing her grievances would attribute them mainly to port wine in his early days mr furnival had been essentially an abstemious man young men who work fifteen hours a day must be so but now he had a strong opinion about certain portuguese vintages was convinced that there was no port wine in london equal to the contents of his own bin saving always a certain green cork appertaining to his own club which was to be extracted at the rate of thirty shillings a cork and mrs furnival attributed to these latter studies not only a certain purple hue which was suffusing his nose and cheeks but also that unevenness of character and those supposed domestic improprieties to which allusion has been made it may however be as well to explain that mrs ball the old family cook and housekeeper who had ascended with the furnivals in the world opined that madedishes did the mischief he dined out too often and was a deal too particular about his dinner when he dined at home if providence would see fit to visit him with a sharp attack of the gout it wouldso thought mrs ballbe better for all parties  whether or no it may have been that mrs furnival at fiftyfivefor she and her lord were of the same agewas not herself as attractive in her husbands eyes as she had been at thirty i will not pretend to say there can have been no just reason for any such change in feeling seeing that the two had grown old together she poor woman would have been quite content with the attentions of mr furnival though his hair was grizzled and his nose was blue nor did she ever think of attracting to herself the admiration of any swain whose general comeliness might be more free from all taint of age why then should he wander afieldat the age of fiftyfive that he did wander afield poor mrs furnival felt in her agony convinced and among those ladies whom on this account she most thoroughly detested was our friend lady mason of orley farm lady mason and the lawyer had first become acquainted in the days of the trial now long gone by on which occasion mr furnival had been employed as the junior counsel and that acquaintance had ripened into friendship and now flourished in full vigourto mrs furnivals great sorrow and disturbance  mrs furnival herself was a stout solid woman sensible on most points but better adapted perhaps to the life in keppel street than that to which she had now been promoted as kitty blacker she had possessed feminine charms which would have been famous had they been better known mr furnival had fetched her from farther eastfrom the region of great ormond street and the neighbourhood of southampton buildings her cherry cheeks and her round eye and her full bust and her fresh lip had conquered the hardtasked lawyer and so they had gone forth to fight the world together her eye was still round and her cheek red and her bust fullthere had certainly been no falling off there nor will i say that her lip had lost its freshness but the bloom of her charms had passed away and she was now a solid stout motherly woman not bright in converse but by no means deficient in motherwit recognizing well the duties which she owed to others but recognizing equally well those which others owed to her all the charms of her youthhad they not been given to him and also all her solicitude all her anxious fighting with the hard world when they had been poor together had she not patched and turned and twisted sitting silently by his side into the long nights because she would not ask him for the price of a new dress and yet now now that they were rich mrs furnival when she put such questions within her own mind could hardly answer this latter one with patience others might be afraid of the great mr furnival in his wig and gown others might be struck dumb by his power of eye and mouth but she she the wife of his bosom she could catch him without his armour she would so catch him and let him know what she thought of all her wrongs so she said to herself many a day and yet the great deed in all its explosiveness had never yet been done small attacks of words there had been many but hitherto the courage to speak out her griefs openly had been wanting to her  i can now allow myself but a small space to say a few words of sophia furnival and yet in that small space must be confined all the direct description which can be given of one of the principal personages of this story at nineteen miss furnival was in all respects a young woman she was forward in acquirements in manner in general intelligence and in powers of conversation she was a handsome tall girl with expressive gray eyes and darkbrown hair her mouth and hair and a certain motion of her neck and turn of her head had come to her from her mother but her eyes were those of her father they were less sharp perhaps less eager after their prey but they were bright as his had been bright and sometimes had in them more of absolute command than he was ever able to throw into his own  their golden days had come on them at a period of her life which enabled her to make a better use of them than her mother could do she never felt herself to be struck dumb by rank or fashion nor did she in the drawingrooms of the great ever show signs of an eastern origin she could adapt herself without an effort to the manners of cavendish squareay and if need were to the ways of more glorious squares even than that therefore was her father never ashamed to be seen with her on his arm in the houses of his new friends though on such occasions he was willing enough to go out without disturbing the repose of his wife no mother could have loved her children with a warmer affection than that which had warmed the heart of poor mrs furnival but under such circumstances as these was it singular that she should occasionally become jealous of her own daughter  sophia furnival was as i have said a clever attractive girl handsome wellread able to hold her own with the old as well as with the young capable of hiding her vanity if she had any mild and gentle to girls less gifted animated in conversation and yet possessing an eye that could fall softly to the ground as a womans eye always should fall upon occasions  nevertheless she was not altogether charming i dont feel quite sure that she is real mrs orme had said of her when on a certain occasion miss furnival had spent a day and a night at the cleeve     chapter xi  mrs furnival at home   lucius mason on his road to liverpool had passed through london and had found a moment to call in harley street since his return from germany he had met miss furnival both at home at his mothers houseor rather his ownand at the cleeve miss furnival had been in the neighbourhood and had spent two days with the great people at the cleeve and one day with the little people at orley farm lucius mason had found that she was a sensible girl capable of discussing great subjects with him and had possibly found some other charms in her therefore he had called in harley street  on that occasion he could only call as he passed through london without delay but he received such encouragement as induced him to spend a night in town on his return in order that he might accept an invitation to drink tea with the furnivals we shall be very happy to see you mrs furnival had said backing the proposition which had come from her daughter without any very great fervour but i fear mr furnival will not be at home mr furnival very seldom is at home now young mason did not much care for fervour on the part of sophias mother and therefore had accepted the invitation though he was obliged by so doing to curtail by some hours his sojourn among the guano stores of liverpool  it was the time of year at which few people are at home in london being the middle of october but mrs furnival was a lady of whom at such periods it was not very easy to dispose she could have made herself as happy as a queen even at margate if it could have suited furnival and sophia to be happy at margate with her but this did not suit furnival or sophia as regards money any or almost all other autumnal resorts were open to her but she could be contented at none of them because mr furnival always pleaded that businesslaw business or political businesstook him elsewhere now mrs furnival was a woman who did not like to be deserted and who could not in the absence of those social joys which providence had vouchsafed to her as her own make herself happy with the society of other women such as herself furnival was her husband and she wanted him to carve for her to sit opposite to her at the breakfast table to tell her the news of the day and to walk to church with her on sundays they had been made one flesh and one bone for better and worse thirty years since and now in her latter days she could not put up with disseveration and dislocation  she had gone down to brighton in august soon after the house broke up and there found that very handsome apartments had been taken for herrooms that would have made glad the heart of many a lawyers wife she had too the command of a fly done up to look like a private brougham a servant in livery the run of the public assemblyrooms a sitting in the centre of the most fashionable church in brightonall that the heart of woman could desire all but the one thing was there but that one thing being absent she came moodily back to town at the end of september she would have exchanged them all with a happy heart for very moderate accommodation at margate could she have seen mr furnivals blue nose on the other side of the table every morning and evening as she sat over her shrimps and tea  men who had risen in the world as mr furnival had done do find it sometimes difficult to dispose of their wives it is not that the ladies are in themselves more unfit for rising than their lords or that if occasion demanded they would not as readily adapt themselves to new spheres but they do not rise and occasion does not demand it a man elevates his wife to his own rank and when mr brown on becoming solicitorgeneral becomes sir jacob mrs brown also becomes my lady but the whole set among whom brown must be more or less thrown do not want her ladyship on browns promotion she did not become part of the bargain brown must henceforth have two existencesa public and a private existence and it will be well for lady brown and well also for sir jacob if the latter be not allowed to dwindle down to a minimum  if lady b can raise herself also if she can make her own occasionif she be handsome and can flirt if she be impudent and can force her way if she have a daring mind and can commit great expenditure if she be clever and can make poetry if she can in any way create a separate glory for herself then indeed sir jacob with his blue nose may follow his own path and all will be well sir jacobs blue nose seated opposite to her will not be her summum bonum  but worthy mrs furnivaland she was worthyhad created for herself no such separate glory nor did she dream of creating it and therefore she had as it were no footing left to her on this occasion she had gone to brighton and had returned from it sulky and wretched bringing her daughter back to london at the period of londons greatest desolation sophia had returned uncomplaining remembering that good things were in store for her she had been asked to spend her christmas with the staveleys at noningsbythe family of judge staveley who lives near alston at a very pretty country place so called mr furnival had been for many years acquainted with judge staveleyhad known the judge when he was a leading counsel and now that mr furnival was a rising man and now that he had a pretty daughter it was natural that the young staveleys and sophia furnival should know each other but poor mrs furnival was too ponderous for this mounting late in life and she had not been asked to noningsby she was much too good a mother to repine at her daughters promised gaiety sophia was welcome to go but by all the laws of god and man it would behove her lord and husband to eat his mincepie at home  mr furnival was to be back in town this evening the lady said as though apologizing to young mason for her husbands absence when he entered the drawingroom but he has not come and i dare say will not come now  mason did not care a straw for mr furnival oh wont he said he i suppose business keeps him  papa is very busy about politics just at present said sophia wishing to make matters smooth in her mothers mind he was obliged to be at romford in the beginning of the week and then he went down to birmingham there is some congress going on there is there not  all that must take a great deal of time said lucius  yes and it is a terrible bore said sophia i know papa finds it so  your papa likes it i believe said mrs furnival who would not hide even her grievances under a bushel  i dont think he likes being so much from home mamma of course he likes excitement and success all men do do they not mr mason  they all ought to do so and women also  ah but women have no sphere mr mason  they have minds equal to those of men said lucius gallantly and ought to be able to make for themselves careers as brilliant  women ought not to have any spheres said mrs furnival  i dont know that i quite agree with you there mamma  the world is becoming a great deal too fond of what you call excitement and success of course it is a good thing for a man to make money by his profession and a very hard thing when he cant do it added mrs furnival thinking of the olden days but if success in life means rampaging about and never knowing what it is to sit quiet over his own fireside i for one would as soon manage to do without it  but mamma i dont see why success should always be rampageous  literary women who have achieved a name bear their honours quietly said lucius  i dont know said mrs furnival i am told that some of them are as fond of gadding as the men as regards the old maids i dont care so much about it people who are not married may do what they like with themselves and nobody has anything to say to them but it is very different for married people they have no business to be enticed away from their homes by any success  mamma is all for a darby and joan life said sophia laughing  no i am not my dear and you should not say so i dont advocate anything that is absurd but i do say that life should be lived at home that is the best part of it what is the meaning of home if it isnt that  poor mrs furnival she had no idea that she was complaining to a stranger of her husband had any one told her so she would have declared that she was discussing worldwide topics but lucius mason young as he was knew that the marital shoe was pinching the ladys domestic corn and he made haste to change the subject  you know my mother mrs furnival  mrs furnival said that she had the honour of acquaintance with lady mason but on this occasion also she exhibited but little fervour  i shall meet her up in town tomorrow said lucius she is coming up for some shopping  oh indeed said mrs furnival  and then we go down home together i am to meet her at the chymists at the top of chancery lane  now this was a very unnecessary communication on the part of young mason and also an unfortunate one oh indeed said mrs furnival again throwing her head a little back poor woman she could not conceal what was in her mind and her daughter knew all about it immediately the truth was this mr furnival had been for some days on the move at birmingham and elsewhere and had now sent up sudden notice that he should probably be at home that very night he should probably be at home that night but in such case would be compelled to return to his friends at birmingham on the following afternoon now if it were an ascertained fact that he was coming to london merely with the view of meeting lady mason the wife of his bosom would not think it necessary to provide for him the warmest welcome this of course was not an ascertained fact but were there not terrible grounds of suspicion mr furnivals law chambers were in old square lincolns inn close to chancery lane and lady mason had made her appointment with her son within five minutes walk of that locality and was it not in itself a strange coincidence that lady mason who came to town so seldom should now do so on the very day of mr furnivals sudden return she felt sure that they were to meet on the morrow but yet she could not declare even to herself that it was an ascertained fact  oh indeed she said and sophia understood all about it though lucius did not  then mrs furnival sank into silence and we need not follow word for word the conversation between the young lady and the young gentleman mr mason thought that miss furnival was a very nice girl and was not at all ill pleased to have an opportunity of passing an evening in her company and miss furnival thought what she thought or what young ladies may think generally about young gentlemen is not to be spoken openly but it seemed as though she also were employed to her own satisfaction while her mother sat moody in her own armchair in the course of the evening the footman in livery brought in tea handing it round on a big silver salver which also added to mrs furnivals unhappiness she would have liked to sit behind her teatray as she used to do in the good old hardworking days with a small pile of buttered toast on the slopbowl kept warm by hot water below in those dear old hardworking days buttered toast had been a muchloved delicacy with furnival and she kind woman had never begrudged her eyes as she sat making it for him over the parlour fire nor would she have begrudged them now neither her eyes nor the work of her hands nor all the thoughts of her heart if he would have consented to accept of her handiwork but in these days mr furnival had learned a relish for other delicacies  she also had liked buttered toast always however taking the pieces with the upper crust in order that the more luscious morsels might be left for him and she had liked to prepare her own tea leisurely putting in slowly the sugar and creamskimmed milk it had used to be dropped for herself with a sparing hand in order that his large breakfastcup might be whitened to his liking but though the milk had been skimmed and scanty and though the tea itself had been put in with a sparing hand she had then been mistress of the occasion she had had her own way and in stinting herself had found her own reward but nowthe tea had no flavour now that it was made in the kitchen and brought to her cold and vapid by a man in livery whom she half feared to keep waiting while she ministered to her own wants  and so she sat moody in her armchair cross and sulky as her daughter thought but yet there was a vein of poetry in her heart as she sat there little like a sibyl as she looked dear old days in which her cares and solicitude were valued in which she could do something for the joint benefit of the firm into which she had been taken as a partner how happy she had been in her struggles how piteously had her heart yearned towards him when she thought that he was struggling too fiercely how brave and constant he had been and how she had loved him as he sat steady as a rock at his grinding work now had come the great success of which they had both dreamed together of which they had talked as arm in arm they were taking the exercise that was so needful to him walking quickly round russell square quickly round bloomsbury square and bedford square and so back to the grinding work in keppel street it had come nowall of which they had dreamed and more than all they had dared to hope but of what good was it was he happy no he was fretful bilious and worn with toil which was hard to him because he ate and drank too much he was ill at ease in public only half understanding the political life which he was obliged to assume in his new ambition and he was sick in his conscienceshe was sure that must be so he could not thus neglect her his loving constant wife without some pangs of remorse and was she happy she might have revelled in silks and satins if silks and satins would have done her old heart good but they would do her no good how she had joyed in a new dress when it had been so hard to come by so slow in coming and when he would go with her to the choosing of it but her gowns now were hardly of more interest to her than the joints of meat which the butcher brought to the door with the utmost regularity it behoved the butcher to send good beef and the milliner to send good silk and there was an end of it  not but what she could have been ecstatic about a full skirt on a smart body if he would have cared to look at it in truth she was still soft and young enough within though stout and solid and somewhat aged without though she looked cross and surly that night there was soft poetry within her heart if providence who had bountifully given would now by chance mercifully take away those gifts would she not then forgive everything and toil for him again with the same happiness as before ah yes she could forgive everything anything if he would only return and be contented to sit opposite to her once again o mortal delius dearest lord and husband she exclaimed within her own breast in language somewhat differing from that of the roman poet why hast thou not remembered to maintain a mind equal in prosperity as it was always equal and well poised in adversity oh my delius since prosperity has been too much for thee may the lord bless thee once more with the adversity which thou canst bearwhich thou canst bear and i with thee thus did she sing sadly within her own bosomsadly but with true poetic cadence while sophia and lucius mason sitting by when for a moment they turned their eyes upon her gave her credit only for the cross solemnity supposed to be incidental to obese and declining years  and then there came a ring at the bell and a knock at the door and a rush along the nether passages and the lady knew that he of whom she had been thinking had arrived in olden days she had ever met him in the narrow passage and indifferent to the maid she had hung about his neck and kissed him in the hall but now she did not stir from the chair she could forgive him all and run again at the sound of his footstep but she must first know that such forgiveness and such running would be welcome  thats papa said sophia  dont forget that i have not met him since i have been home from germany said lucius you must introduce me  in a minute or two mr furnival opened the door and walked into the room men when they arrive from their travels nowadays have no strippings of greatcoats no deposits to make of thick shawls and double gloves no absolutely necessary changes of raiment such had been the case when he had used to come back cold and weary from the circuits but now he had left birmingham since dinner by the late express and enjoyed his nap in the train for two hours or so and walked into his own drawingroom as he might have done had he dined in his own diningroom  how are you kitty he said to his wife handing to her the forefinger of his right hand by way of greeting well sophy my love and he kissed his daughter oh lucius mason i am very glad to see you i cant say i should have remembered you unless i had been told you are very welcome in harley street and i hope you will often be here  illustration mr furnivals welcome home  its not very often hed find you at home mr furnival said the aggrieved wife  not so often as i could wish just at present but things will be more settled i hope before very long hows your mother lucius  shes pretty well thank you sir ive to meet her in town tomorrow and go down home with her  there was then silence in the room for a few seconds during which mrs furnival looked very sharply at her husband oh shes to be in town is she said mr furnival after a moments consideration he was angry with lady mason at the moment for having put him into this position why had she told her son that she was to be up in london thus producing conversation and tittletattle which made deceit on his part absolutely necessary lady masons business in london was of a nature which would not bear much open talking she herself in her earnest letter summoning mr furnival up from birmingham had besought him that her visit to his chambers might not be made matter of discussion new troubles might be coming on her but also they might not and she was very anxious that no one should know that she was seeking a lawyers advice on the matter to all this mr furnival had given in his adhesion and yet she had put it into her sons power to come to his drawingroom and chatter there of her whereabouts for a moment or two he doubted but at the expiration of those moments he saw that the deceit was necessary shes to be in town is she said he the reader will of course observe that this deceit was practised not as between husband and wife with reference to an assignation with a lady but between the lawyer and the outer world with reference to a private meeting with a client but then it is sometimes so difficult to make wives look at such matters in the right light  shes coming up for some shopping said lucius  oh indeed said mrs furnival she would not have spoken if she could have helped it but she could not help it and then there was silence in the room for a minute or two which lucius vainly endeavoured to break by a few indifferent observations to miss furnival the words however which he uttered would not take the guise of indifferent observations but fell flatly on their ears and at the same time solemnly as though spoken with the sole purpose of creating sound  i hope you have been enjoying yourself at birmingham said mrs furnival  enjoyed myself i did not exactly go there for enjoyment  or at romford where you were before  women seem to think that men have no purpose but amusement when they go about their daily work said mr furnival and then he threw himself back in his armchair and took up the last quarterly  lucius mason soon perceived that all the harmony of the evening had in some way been marred by the return of the master of the house and that he might be in the way if he remained he therefore took his leave  i shall want breakfast punctually at halfpast eight tomorrow morning said mr furnival as soon as the stranger had withdrawn i must be in chambers before ten and then he took his candle and withdrew to his own room  sophia rang the bell and gave the servant the order but mrs furnival took no trouble in the matter whatever in the olden days she would have bustled down before she went to bed and have seen herself that everything was ready so that the master of the house might not be kept waiting but all this was nothing to her now     chapter xii  mr furnivals chambers   mr furnivals chambers were on the first floor in a very dingy edifice in old square lincolns inn this square was always dingy even when it was comparatively open and served as the approach from chancery lane to the lord chancellors court but now it has been built up with new shops for the vicechancellor and to my eyes it seems more dingy than ever  he there occupied three rooms all of them sufficiently spacious for the purposes required but which were made oppressive by their general dinginess and by a smell of old leather which pervaded them in one of them sat at his desk mr crabwitz a gentleman who had now been with mr furnival for the last fifteen years and who considered that no inconsiderable portion of the barristers success had been attributable to his own energy and genius mr crabwitz was a genteellooking man somewhat over forty years of age very careful as to his gloves hat and umbrella and not a little particular as to his associates as he was unmarried fond of ladies society and presumed to be a warm man in money matters he had his social successes and looked down from a considerable altitude on some men who from their professional rank might have been considered as his superiors he had a small bachelors box down at barnes and not unfrequently went abroad in the vacations the door opening into the room of mr crabwitz was in the corner fronting you on the lefthand side as you entered the chambers immediately on your left was a large waitingroom in which an additional clerk usually sat at an ordinary table he was not an authorised part of the establishment being kept only from week to week but nevertheless for the last two or three years he had been always there and mr crabwitz intended that he should remain for he acted as fag to mr crabwitz this waitingroom was very dingy much more so than the clerks room and boasted of no furniture but eight old leathern chairs and two old tables it was surrounded by shelves which were laden with books and dust which by no chance were ever disturbed but to my ideas the most dingy of the three rooms was that large one in which the great man himself sat the door of which directly fronted you as you entered the furniture was probably better than that in the other chambers and the place had certainly the appearance of warmth and life which comes from frequent use but nevertheless of all the rooms in which i ever sat i think it was the most gloomy there were heavy curtains to the windows which had once been ruby but were now brown and the ceiling was brown and the thick carpet was brown and the books which covered every portion of the wall were brown and the painted woodwork of the doors and windows was of a dark brown here on the morning with which we have now to deal sat mr furnival over his papers from ten to twelve at which latter hour lady mason was to come to him the holidays of mr crabwitz had this year been cut short in consequence of his patrons attendance at the great congress which was now sitting and although all london was a desert as he had piteously complained to a lady of his acquaintance whom he had left at boulogne he was there in the midst of the desert and on this morning was sitting in attendance at his usual desk  why mr furnival should have breakfasted by himself at halfpast eight in order that he might be at his chambers at ten seeing that the engagement for which he had come to town was timed for twelve i will not pretend to say he did not ask his wife to join him and consequently she did not come down till her usual time mr furnival breakfasted by himself and at ten oclock he was in his chambers though alone for two hours he was not idle and exactly at twelve mr crabwitz opened his door and announced lady mason  when we last parted with her after her interview with sir peregrine orme she had resolved not to communicate with her friend the lawyerat any rate not to do so immediately thinking on that resolve she had tried to sleep that night but her mind was altogether disturbed and she could get no rest what if after twenty years of tranquillity all her troubles must now be recommenced what if the battle were again to be foughtwith such termination as the chances might send to her why was it that she was so much greater a coward now than she had been then then she had expected defeat for her friends had bade her not to be sanguine but in spite of that she had borne up and gone gallantly through the ordeal but now she felt that if orley farm were hers to give she would sooner abandon it than renew the contest then at that former period of her life she had prepared her mind to do or die in the cause she had wrought herself up for the work and had carried it through but having done that work having accomplished her terrible task she had hoped that rest might be in store for her  as she rose from her bed on the morning after her interview with sir peregrine she determined that she would seek counsel from him in whose counsel she could trust sir peregrines friendship was more valuable to her than that of mr furnival but a word of advice from mr furnival was worth all the spoken wisdom of the baronet ten times over therefore she wrote her letter and proposed an appointment and mr furnival tempted as i have said by some evil spirit to stray after strange goddesses in these his bluenosed days had left his learned brethren at their congress in birmingham and had hurried up to town to assist the widow he had left that congress though the wisest rustums of the law from all the civilised countries of europe were there assembled with boanerges at their head that great old valiant learned british rustum inquiring with energy solemnity and caution with much shaking of ponderous heads and many sarcasms from those which were not ponderous whether any and what changes might be made in the modes of answering that great question guilty or not guilty and that other equally great question is it meum or is it tuum to answer which question justly should be the end and object of every lawyers work there were great men there from paris very capable the ulpians tribonians and papinians of the new empire armed with the purest sentiments expressed in antithetical and magniloquent phrases ravishing to the ears and armed also with a code which taken in its integrity would necessarily as the logical consequence of its clauses drive all injustice from the face of the earth and there were great practitioners from germany men very skilled in the use of questions who profess that the tongue of man if adequately skilful may always prevail on guilt to disclose itself who believe in the power of their own craft to produce truth as our forefathers believed in torture and sometimes with the same result and of course all that was great on the british bench and all that was famous at the british bar was theremen very unlike their german brethren men who thought that guilt never should be asked to tell of itselfmen who were customarily but unconsciously shocked whenever unwary guilt did tell of itself men these were mostly of high and noble feeling born and bred to live with upright hearts and clean hands but taught by the peculiar tenets of their profession to think that that which was high and noble in their private intercourse with the world need not also be so esteemed in their legal practice and there were italians there goodhumoured joking easy fellows who would laugh their clients in and out of their difficulties and spaniards very grave and serious who doubted much in their minds whether justice might not best be bought and sold and our brethren from the united states were present also very eager to show that in this country law and justice also were clouded and nearly buried beneath their wig and gown  all these and all this did mr furnival desert for the space of twentyfour hours in order that he might comply with the request of lady mason had she known what it was that she was calling on him to leave no doubt she would have borne her troubles for another weekfor another fortnight till those rustums at birmingham had brought their labours to a close she would not have robbed the english bar of one of the warmest supporters of its present mode of practice even for a day had she known how much that support was needed at the present moment but she had not known and mr furnival moved by her womans plea had not been hard enough in his heart to refuse her  when she entered the room she was dressed very plainly as was her custom and a thick veil covered her face but still she was dressed with care there was nothing of the dowdiness of the lone lorn woman about her none of that lanky washedout appearance which sorrow and trouble so often give to females had she given way to dowdiness or suffered herself to be as it were washed out mr furnival we may say would not have been there to meet herof which fact lady mason was perhaps aware  i am so grateful to you for this trouble she said as she raised her veil and while he pressed her hand between both his own i can only ask you to believe that i would not have troubled you unless i had been greatly troubled myself  mr furnival as he placed her in an armchair by the fireside declared his sorrow that she should be in grief and then he took the other armchair himself opposite to her or rather close to hermuch closer to her than he ever now seated himself to mrs f dont speak of my trouble said he it is nothing if i can do anything to relieve you but though he was so tender he did not omit to tell her of her folly in having informed her son that she was to be in london and have you seen him asked lady mason  he was in harley street with the ladies last night but it does not matter it is only for your sake that i speak as i know that you wish to keep this matter private and now let us hear what it is i cannot think that there can be anything which need really cause you trouble and he again took her handthat he might encourage her lady mason let him keep her hand for a minute or so as though she did not notice it and yet as she turned her eyes to him it might appear that his tenderness had encouraged her  sitting there thus with her hand in hiswith her hand in his during the first portion of the taleshe told him all that she wished to tell something more she told now to him than she had done to sir peregrine i learned from her she said speaking about mrs dockwrath and her husband that he had found out something about dates which the lawyers did not find out before  something about dates said mr furnival looking with all his eyes into the fire you do not know what about dates  no only this that he said that the lawyers in bedford row  round and crook  yes he said that they were idiots not to have found it out before and then he went off to groby park he came back last night but of course i have not seen her since  by this time mr furnival had dropped the hand and was sitting still meditating looking earnestly at the fire while lady mason was looking earnestly at him she was trying to gather from his face whether he had seen signs of danger and he was trying to gather from her words whether there might really be cause to apprehend danger how was he to know what was really inside her mind what were her actual thoughts and inward reasonings on this subject what private knowledge she might have which was still kept back from him in the ordinary intercourse of the world when one man seeks advice from another he who is consulted demands in the first place that he shall be put in possession of all the circumstances of the case how else will it be possible that he should give advice but in matters of law it is different if i having committed a crime were to confess my criminality to the gentleman engaged to defend me might he not be called on to say then o my friend confess it also to the judge and so let justice be done ruat coelum and the rest of it but who would pay a lawyer for counsel such as that  in this case there was no question of payment the advice to be given was to a widowed woman from an experienced man of the world but nevertheless he could only make his calculations as to her peculiar case in the way in which he ordinarily calculated could it be possible that anything had been kept back from him were there facts unknown to him but known to her which would be terrible fatal damning to his sweet friend if proved before all the world he could not bring himself to ask her but yet it was so material that he should know twenty years ago at the time of the trial he had at one time thoughtit hardly matters to tell what but those thoughts had not been favourable to her cause then his mind had altered and he had learnedas lawyers do learnto believe in his own case and when the day of triumph had come he had triumphed loudly commiserating his dear friend for the unjust suffering to which she had been subjected and speaking in no low or modified tone as to the grasping greedy cruelty of that man of groby park nevertheless through it all he had felt that round and crook had not made the most of their case  and now he sat thinking not so much whether or no she had been in any way guilty with reference to that will as whether the counsel he should give her ought in any way to be based on the possibility of her having been thus guilty nothing might be so damning to her cause as that he should make sure of her innocence if she were not innocent and yet he would not ask her the question if innocent why was it that she was now so much moved after twenty years of quiet possession  it was a pity he said at last that lucius should have disturbed that fellow in the possession of his fields  it was it was she said but i did not think it possible that miriams husband should turn against me would it be wise do you think to let him have the land again  no i do not think that it would be telling him and telling others also that you are afraid of him if he have obtained any information that may be considered of value by joseph mason he can sell it at a higher price than the holding of these fields is worth  would it be well she was asking a question and then checked herself  would what be well  i am so harassed that i hardly know what i am saying would it be wise do you think if i were to pay him anything so as to keep him quiet  what buy him off you mean  well yesif you call it so give him some sum of money in compensation for his land and on the understanding you know and then she paused  that depends on what he may have to sell said mr furnival hardly daring to look at her  ah yes said the widow and then there was another pause  i do not think that that would be at all discreet said mr furnival after all the chances are that it is all moonshine  you think so  yes i cannot but think so what can that man possibly have found among the old attorneys papers that may be injurious to your interests  ah i do not know i understand so little of these things at the time they told meyou told me that the law might possibly go against my boys rights it would have been bad then but it would be ten times more dreadful now  but there were many questions capable of doubt then which were definitely settled at the trial as to your husbands intellect on that day for instance  there could be no doubt as to that  no so it has been proved and they will not raise that point again could he have possibly have made a later will  no i am sure he did not had he done so it could not have been found among mr usbechs papers for as far as i remember the poor man never attended to any business after that day  what day  the 14th of july the day on which he was with sir joseph  it was singular thought the barrister with how much precision she remembered the dates and circumstances that the circumstances of the trial should be fresh on her memory was not wonderful but how was it that she knew so accurately things which had occurred before the trialwhen no trial could have been expected but as to this he said nothing  and you are sure he went to groby park  oh yes i have no doubt of it i am quite sure  i do not know that we can do anything but wait have you mentioned this to sir peregrine it immediately occurred to lady masons mind that it would be by no means expedient even if it were possible to keep mr furnival in ignorance of anything that she really did and therefore explained that she had seen sir peregrine i was so troubled at the first moment that i hardly knew where to turn she said  you were quite right to go to sir peregrine  i am so glad you are not angry with me as to that  and did he say anythinganything particular  he promised that he would not desert me should there be any new difficulty  that is well it is always good to have the countenance of such a neighbour as he is  and the advice of such a friend as you are and she again put out her hand to him  well yes it is my trade you know to give advice and he smiled as he took it  how should i live through such troubles without you  we lawyers are very much abused nowadays said mr furnival thinking of what was going on down at birmingham at that very moment but i hardly know how the world would get on without us  ah but all lawyers are not like you  some perhaps worse and a great many much better but as i was saying i do not think i would take any steps at present the man dockwrath is a vulgar lowminded revengeful fellow and i would endeavour to forget him  ah if i could  and why not what can he possibly have learned to your injury and then as it seemed to lady mason that mr furnival expected some reply to this question she forced herself to give him one i suppose that he cannot know anything  i tell you what i might do said mr furnival who was still musing round himself is not a bad fellow and i am acquainted with him he was the junior partner in that house at the time of the trial and i know that he persuaded joseph mason not to appeal to the lords i will contrive if possible to see him i shall be able to learn from him at any rate whether anything is being done  and then if i hear that there is not i shall be comforted  of course of course  but if there is  i think there will be nothing of the sort said mr furnival leaving his seat as he spoke  but if there isi shall have your aid and she slowly rose from her chair as she spoke  mr furnival gave her a promise of this as sir peregrine had done before and then with her handkerchief to her eyes she thanked him her tears were not false as mr furnival well saw and seeing that she wept and seeing that she was beautiful and feeling that in her grief and in her beauty she had come to him for aid his heart was softened towards her and he put out his arms as though he would take her to his heartas a daughter dearest friend he said trust me that no harm shall come to you  i will trust you she said gently stopping the motion of his arm i will trust you altogether and when you have seen mr round shall i hear from you  at this moment as they were standing close together the door opened and mr crabwitz introduced another ladywho indeed had advanced so quickly towards the door of mr furnivals room that the clerk had been hardly able to reach it before her  mrs furnival if you please sir said mr crabwitz     chapter xiii  guilty or not guilty   unfortunately for mr furnival the intruder was mrs furnivalwhether he pleased or whether he did not please there she was in his law chamber present in the flesh a sight pleasing neither to her husband nor to her husbands client she had knocked at the outside door which in the absence of the fag had been opened by mr crabwitz and had immediately walked across the passage towards her husbands room expressing her knowledge that mr furnival was within mr crabwitz had all the will in the world to stop her progress but he found that he lacked the power to stay it for a moment  the advantages of matrimony are many and greatso many and so great that all men doubtless ought to marry but even matrimony may have its drawbacks among which unconcealed and undeserved jealousy on the part of the wife is perhaps as disagreeable as any what is a man to do when he is accused before the worldbefore any small fraction of the world of making love to some lady of his acquaintance what is he to say what way is he to look my love i didnt i never did and wouldnt think of it for worlds i say it with my hand on my heart there is mrs jones herself and i appeal to her he is reduced to that but should any innocent man be so reduced by the wife of his bosom  i am speaking of undeserved jealousy and it may therefore be thought that my remarks do not apply to mrs furnival they do apply to her as much as to any woman that general idea as to the strange goddesses was on her part no more than a suspicion and all women who so torment themselves and their husbands may plead as much as she could and for this peculiar idea as to lady mason she had no ground whatever lady mason may have had her faults but a propensity to rob mrs furnival of her husbands affections had not hitherto been one of them mr furnival was a clever lawyer and she had great need of his assistance therefore she had come to his chambers and therefore she had placed her hand in his that mr furnival liked his client because she was good looking may be true i like my horse my picture the view from my study window for the same reason i am inclined to think that there was nothing more in it than that  my dear said mr furnival stepping back a little and letting his hands fall to his sides lady mason also took a step backwards and then with considerable presence of mind recovered herself and put out her hand to greet mrs furnival  how do you do lady mason said mrs furnival without any presence of mind at all i hope i have the pleasure of seeing you very well i did hear that you were to be in townshopping but i did not for a moment expect thegratification of finding you here and every word that the dear good heartsore woman spoke told the tale of her jealousy as plainly as though she had flown at lady masons cap with all the bold demonstrative energy of spitalfields or st giles  i came up on purpose to see mr furnival about some unfortunate law business said lady mason  oh indeed your son lucius did sayshopping  illustration your son lucius did sayshopping  yes i told him so when a lady is unfortunate enough to be driven to a lawyer for advice she does not wish to make it known i should be very sorry if my dear boy were to guess that i had this new trouble or indeed if any one were to know it i am sure that i shall be as safe with you dear mrs furnival as i am with your husband and she stepped up to the angry matron looking earnestly into her face  to a true tale of womans sorrow mrs furnivals heart could be as snow under the noonday sun had lady mason gone to her and told her all her fears and all her troubles sought counsel and aid from her and appealed to her motherly feelings mrs furnival would have been urgent night and day in persuading her husband to take up the widows case she would have bade him work his very best without fee or reward and would herself have shown lady mason the way to old square lincolns inn she would have been discreet too speaking no word of idle gossip to any one when he in their happy days had told his legal secrets to her she had never gossipedhad never spoken an idle word concerning them and she would have been constant to her friend giving great consolation in the time of trouble as one woman can console another the thought that all this might be so did come across her for a moment for there was innocence written in lady masons eyes but then she looked at her husbands face and as she found no innocence there her heart was again hardened the womans face could liethe faces of such women are all lies mrs furnival said to herselfbut in her presence his face had been compelled to speak the truth  oh dear no i shall say nothing of course she said i am quite sorry that i intruded mr furnival as i happened to be in holbornat mudies for some booksi thought i would come down and ask whether you intend to dine at home today you said nothing about it either last night or this morning and nowadays one really does not know how to manage in such matters  i told you that i should return to birmingham this afternoon i shall dine there said mr furnival very sulkily  oh very well i certainly knew that you were going out of town i did not at all expect that you would remain at home but i thought that you might perhaps like to have your dinner before you went good morning lady mason i hope you may be successful in yourlawsuit and then curtsying to her husbands client she prepared to withdraw  i believe that i have said all that i need say mr furnival said lady mason so that if mrs furnival wishes and she also gathered herself up as though she were ready to leave the room  i hardly know what mrs furnival wishes said the husband  my wishes are nothing said the wife and i really am quite sorry that i came in and then she did go leaving her husband and the woman of whom she was jealous once more alone together upon the whole i think that mr furnival was right in not going home that day to his dinner  as the door closed somewhat loudly behind the angry ladymr crabwitz having rushed out hardly in time to moderate the violence of the slamlady mason and her imputed lover were left looking at each other it was certainly hard upon lady mason and so she felt it mr furnival was fiftyfive and endowed with a bluish nose and she was over forty and had lived for twenty years as a widow without incurring a breath of scandal  i hope i have not been to blame said lady mason in a soft sad voice but perhaps mrs furnival specially wished to find you alone  no no not at all  i shall be so unhappy if i think that i have been in the way if mrs furnival wished to speak to you on business i am not surprised that she should be angry for i know that barristers do not usually allow themselves to be troubled by their clients in their own chambers  nor by their wives mr furnival might have added but he did not  do not mind it he said it is nothing she is the besttempered woman in the world but at times it is impossible to answer even for the besttempered  i will trust you to make my peace with her  yes of course she will not think of it after today nor must you lady mason  oh no except that i would not for the world be the cause of annoyance to my friends sometimes i am almost inclined to think that i will never trouble any one again with my sorrows but let things come and go as they may were it not for poor lucius i should do so  mr furnival looking into her face perceived that her eyes were full of tears there could be no doubt as to their reality her eyes were full of genuine tears brimming over and running down and the lawyers heart was melted i do not know why you should say so he said i do not think your friends begrudge any little trouble they may take for you i am sure at least that i may so say for myself  you are too kind to me but i do not on that account the less know how much it is i ask of you  the labour we delight in physics pain said mr furnival gallantly but to tell the truth lady mason i cannot understand why you should be so much out of heart i remember well how brave and constant you were twenty years ago when there really was cause for trembling  ah i was younger then  so the almanac tells us but if the almanac did not tell us i should never know we are all older of course twenty years does not go by without leaving its marks as i can feel myself  men do not grow old as women do who live alone and gather rust as they feed on their own thoughts  i know no one whom time has touched so lightly as yourself lady mason but if i may speak to you as a friend  if you may not mr furnival who may  i should tell you that you are weak to be so despondent or rather so unhappy  another lawsuit would kill me i think you say that i was brave and constant before but you cannot understand what i suffered i nerved myself to bear it telling myself that it was the first duty that i owed to the babe that was lying on my bosom and when standing there in the court with that terrible array around me with the eyes of all men on me the eyes of men who thought that i had been guilty of so terrible a crime for the sake of that child who was so weak i could be brave but it nearly killed me mr furnival i could not go through that again no not even for his sake if you can save me from that even though it be by the buying off of that ungrateful man  you must not think of that  must i not ah me  will you tell lucius all this and let him come to me  no not for worlds he would defy every one and glory in the fight but after all it is i that must bear the brunt no he shall not know itunless it becomes so public that he must know it  and then with some further pressing of the hand and further words of encouragement which were partly tender as from the man and partly forensic as from the lawyer mr furnival permitted her to go and she found her son at the chemists shop in holborn as she had appointed there were no traces of tears or of sorrow in her face as she smiled on lucius while giving him her hand and then when they were in a cab together she asked him as to his success at liverpool  i am very glad that i went said he very glad indeed i saw the merchants there who are the real importers of the article and i have made arrangements with them  will it be cheaper so lucius  cheaper not what women generally call cheaper if there be anything on earth that i hate it is a bargain a man who looks for bargains must be a dupe or a cheat and is probably both  both lucius then he is doubly unfortunate  he is a cheat because he wants things for less than their value and a dupe because as a matter of course he does not get what he wants i made no bargain at liverpoolat least no cheap bargain but i have made arrangements for a sufficient supply of a firstrate unadulterated article at its proper market price and i do not fear but the results will be remunerative and then as they went home in the railway carriage the mother talked to her son about his farming as though she had forgotten her other trouble and she explained to him how he was to dine with sir peregrine  i shall be delighted to dine with sir peregrine said lucius and very well pleased to have an opportunity of talking to him about his own way of managing his land but mother i will not promise to be guided by so very oldfashioned a professor  mr furnival when he was left alone sat thinking over the interview that had passed at first as was most natural he bethought himself of his wife and i regret to say that the love which he bore to her and the gratitude which he owed to her and the memory of all that they had suffered and enjoyed together did not fill his heart with thoughts towards her as tender as they should have done a black frown came across his brow as he meditated on her late intrusion and he made some sort of resolve that that kind of thing should be prevented for the future he did not make up his mind how he would prevent ita point which husbands sometimes overlook in their marital resolutions and then instead of counting up her virtues he counted up his own had he not given her everything a house such as she had not dreamed of in her younger days servants carriages money comforts and luxuries of all sorts he had begrudged her nothing had let her have her full share of all his hardearned gains and yet she could be ungrateful for all this and allow her head to be filled with whims and fancies as though she were a young girlto his great annoyance and confusion he would let her know that his chambers his law chambers should be private even from her he would not allow himself to become a laughingstock to his own clerks and his own brethren through the impertinent folly of a woman who owed to him everythingand so on i regret to say that he never once thought of those lonely evenings in harley street of those long days which the poor woman was doomed to pass without the only companionship which was valuable to her he never thought of that vow which they had both made at the altar which she had kept so loyally and which required of him a cherishing comforting enduring love it never occurred to him that in denying her this he as much broke his promise to her as though he had taken to himself in very truth some strange goddess leaving his wedded wife with a cold ceremony of alimony or suchlike he had been openhanded to her as regards money and therefore she ought not to be troublesome he had done his duty by her and therefore he would not permit her to be troublesome such i regret to say were his thoughts and resolutions as he sat thinking and resolving about mrs furnival  and then by degrees his mind turned away to that other lady and they became much more tender lady mason was certainly both interesting and comely in her grief her colour could still come and go her hand was still soft and small her hair was still brown and smooth there were no wrinkles in her brow though care had passed over it her step could still fall lightly though it had borne a heavy weight of sorrow i fear that he made a wicked comparisona comparison that was wicked although it was made unconsciously  but by degrees he ceased to think of the woman and began to think of the client as he was in duty bound to do what was the real truth of all this was it possible that she should be alarmed in that way because a small country attorney had told his wife that he had found some old paper and because the man had then gone off to yorkshire nothing could be more natural than her anxiety supposing her to be aware of some secret which would condemn her if discoveredbut nothing more unnatural if there were no such secret and she must know in her bosom if in no other must exist the knowledge whether or no that will were just if that will were just was it possible that she should now tremble so violently seeing that its justice had been substantially proved in various courts of law but if it were not justif it were a forgery a forgery made by her or with her cognizanceand that now this truth was to be made known how terrible would that be but terrible is not the word which best describes the idea as it entered mr furnivals mind how wonderful would it be how wonderful would it all have been by whose hand in such case had those signatures been traced could it be possible that she soft beautiful graceful as she was now all but a girl as she had then been could have done it unaidedby herselfthat she could have sat down in the still hour of the night with that old man on one side and her baby in his cradle on the other and forged that will signatures and all in such a manner as to have carried her point for twenty yearsso skilfully as to have baffled lawyers and jurymen and resisted the eager greed of her cheated kinsman if so was it not all wonderful had not she been a woman worthy of wonder  and then mr furnivals mind keen and almost unerring at seizing legal points went eagerly to work considering what new evidence might now be forthcoming he remembered at once the circumstances of those two chief witnesses the clerk who had been so muddleheaded and the servantgirl who had been so clear they had certainly witnessed some deed and they had done so on that special day if there had been a fraud if there had been a forgery it had been so clever as almost to merit protection but if there had been such fraud the nature of the means by which it might be detected became plain to the mind of the barristerplainer to him without knowledge of any circumstances than it had done to mr mason after many of such circumstances had been explained to him  but it was impossible so said mr furnival to himself out loudspeaking out loud in order that he might convince himself it was impossible he said again but he did not convince himself should he ask her no it was not on the cards that he should do that and perhaps if a further trial were forthcoming it might be better for her sake that he should be ignorant and then having declared again that it was impossible he rang his bell crabwitz said he without looking at the man just step over to bedford row with my compliments and learn what is mr rounds present addressold mr round you know  mr crabwitz stood for a moment or two with the door in his hand and mr furnival going back to his own thoughts was expecting the mans departure well he said looking up and seeing that his myrmidon still stood there  mr crabwitz was not in a very good humour and had almost made up his mind to let his master know that such was the case looking at his own general importance in the legal world and the inestimable services which he had rendered to mr furnival he did not think that that gentleman was treating him well he had been summoned back to his dingy chamber almost without an excuse and now that he was in london was not permitted to join even for a day the other wise men of the law who were assembled at the great congress for the last four days his heart had been yearning to go to birmingham but had yearned in vain and now his master was sending him about town as though he were an errandlad  shall i step across to the lodge and send the porters boy to round and crooks asked mr crabwitz  the porters boy no go yourself you are not busy why should i send the porters boy on my business the fact probably was that mr furnival forgot his clerks age and standing crabwitz had been ready to run anywhere when his employer had first known him and mr furnival did not perceive the change  very well sir certainly i will go if you wish iton this occasion that is but i hope sir you will excuse my saying  saying what  that i am not exactly a messenger sir of course ill go now as the other clerk is not in  oh youre too great a man to walk across to bedford row are you give me my hat and ill go  oh no mr furnival i did not mean that ill step over to bedford row of courseonly i did think  think what  that perhaps i was entitled to a little more respect mr furnival its for your sake as much as my own that i speak sir but if the gentlemen in the lane see me sent about like a lad of twenty sir theyll think  what will they think  i hardly know what theyll think but i know it will be very disagreeable sirvery disagreeable to my feelings i did think sir that perhaps  ill tell you what it is crabwitz if your situation here does not suit you you may leave it tomorrow i shall have no difficulty in finding another man to take your place  i am sorry to hear you speak in that way mr furnival very sorryafter fifteen years sir  you find yourself too grand to walk to bedford row  oh no ill go now of course mr furnival and then mr crabwitz did go meditating as he went many things to himself he knew his own value or thought that he knew it and might it not be possible to find some patron who would appreciate his services more justly than did mr furnival     chapter xiv  dinner at the cleeve   lady mason on her return from london found a note from mrs orme asking both her and her son to dine at the cleeve on the following day as it had been already settled between her and sir peregrine that lucius should dine there in order that he might be talked to respecting his mania for guano the invitation could not be refused but as for lady mason herself she would much have preferred to remain at home  indeed her uneasiness on that guano matter had been so outweighed by worse uneasiness from another source that she had become if not indifferent at any rate tranquil on the subject it might be well that sir peregrine should preach his sermon and well that lucius should hear it but for herself it would she thought have been more comfortable for her to eat her dinner alone she felt however that she could not do so any amount of tedium would be better than the danger of offering a slight to sir peregrine and therefore she wrote a pretty little note to say that both of them would be at the cleeve at seven  lucius my dear i want you to do me a great favour she said as she sat by her son in the hamworth fly  a great favour mother of course i will do anything for you that i can  it is that you will bear with sir peregrine tonight  bear with him i do not know exactly what you mean of course i will remember that he is an old man and not answer him as i would one of my own age  i am sure of that lucius because you are a gentleman as much forbearance as that a young man if he be a gentleman will always show to an old man but what i ask is something more than that sir peregrine has been farming all his life  yes and see what are the results he has three or four hundred acres of uncultivated land on his estate all of which would grow wheat  i know nothing about that said lady mason  ah but thats the question my trade is to be that of a farmer and you are sending me to school then comes the question of what sort is the schoolmaster  i am not talking about farming now lucius  but he will talk of it  and cannot you listen to him without contradicting himfor my sake it is of the greatest consequence to meof the very greatest lucius that i should have the benefit of sir peregrines friendship  if he would quarrel with you because i chanced to disagree with him about the management of land his friendship would not be worth having  i do not say that he will do so but i am sure you can understand that an old man may be tender on such points at any rate i ask it from you as a favour you cannot guess how important it is to me to be on good terms with such a neighbour  it is always so in england said lucius after pausing for a while sir peregrine is a man of family and a baronet of course all the world the world of hamworth that is should bow down at his feet and i too must worship the golden image which nebuchadnezzar the king of fashion has set up  lucius you are unkind to me  no mother not unkind but like all men i would fain act in such matters as my own judgment may direct me  my friendship with sir peregrine orme has nothing to do with his rank but it is of importance to me that both you and i should stand well in his sight there was nothing more said on the matter and then they got down at the front door and were ushered through the low wide hall into the drawingroom  the three generations of the family were theresir peregrine his daughterinlaw and the heir lucius mason had been at the cleeve two or three times since his return from germany and on going there had always declared to himself that it was the same to him as though he were going into the house of mrs arkwright the doctors widow at hamworthor even into the kitchen of farmer greenwood he rejoiced to call himself a democrat and would boast that rank could have no effect on him but his boast was an untrue boast and he could not carry himself at the cleeve as he would have done and did in mrs arkwrights little drawingroom there was a majesty in the manner of sir peregrine which did awe him there were tokens of birth and a certain grace of manner about mrs orme which kept down his assumption and even with young peregrine he found that though he might be equal he could by no means be more than equal he had learned more than peregrine orme had ten times more knowledge in his head had read books of which peregrine did not even know the names and probably never would know them but on his side also young orme possessed something which the other wanted what that something might be lucius mason did not at all understand  mrs orme got up from her corner on the sofa to greet her friend and with a soft smile and two or three all but whispered words led her forward to the fire mrs orme was not a woman given to much speech or endowed with outward warmth of manners but she could make her few words go very far and then the pressure of her hand when it was given told more than a whole embrace from some other women there are ladies who always kiss their female friends and always call them dear in such cases one cannot but pity her who is so bekissed mrs orme did not kiss lady mason nor did she call her dear but she smiled sweetly as she uttered her greeting and looked kindness out of her marvellously blue eyes and lucius mason looking on over his mothers shoulders thought that he would like to have her for his friend in spite of her rank if mrs orme would give him a lecture on farming it might be possible to listen to it without contradiction but there was no chance for him in that respect mrs orme never gave lectures to any one on any subject  so master lucius you have been to liverpool i hear said sir peregrine  yes siri returned yesterday  and what is the world doing at liverpool  the world is wide awake there sir  oh no doubt when the world has to make money it is always wide awake but men sometimes may be wide awake and yet make no moneymay be wide awake or at any rate think that they are so  better that sir peregrine than wilfully go to sleep when there is so much work to be done  a man when hes asleep does no harm said sir peregrine  what a comfortable doctrine to think of when the servant comes with the hot water at eight oclock in the morning said his grandson  it is one that you study very constantly i fear said the old man who at this time was on excellent terms with his heir there had been no apparent hankering after rats since that last compact had been made and peregrine had been doing great things with the h h winning golden opinions from all sorts of sportsmen and earning a great reputation for a certain young mare which had been bred by sir peregrine himself foxes are vermin as well as rats as perry in his wickedness had remarked but a young man who can break an old ones heart by a predilection for ratcatching may win it as absolutely and irretrievably by prowess after a fox sir peregrine had told to four different neighbours how a fox had been run into in the open near alston after twelve desperate miles and how on that occasion peregrine had been in at the death with the huntsman and only one other and the mare you know is only four years old and hardly half trained said sir peregrine with great exultation the young scamp to have ridden her in that way it may be doubted whether he would have been a prouder man or said more about it if his grandson had taken honours  and then the gong sounded and sir peregrine led lady mason into the diningroom lucius who as we know thought no more of the ormes than of the joneses and smiths paused in his awe before he gave his arm to mrs orme and when he did so he led her away in perfect silence though he would have given anything to be able to talk to her as he went but he bethought himself that unfortunately he could find nothing to say and when he sat down it was not much better he had not dined at the cleeve before and i am not sure whether the butler in plain clothes and the two men in livery did not help to create his confusionin spite of his welldigested democratic ideas  the conversation during dinner was not very bright sir peregrine said a few words now and again to lady mason and she replied with a few others on subjects which did not absolutely appertain to the dinner she perhaps was the greatest talker but even she did not say much mrs orme as a rule never spoke unless she were spoken to in any company consisting of more than herself and one other and young peregrine seemed to imagine that carving at the top of the table asking people if they would take stewed beef and eating his own dinner were occupations quite sufficient for his energies have a bit more beef mason do if you will i will so far he went in conversation but no farther while his work was still before him  when the servants were gone it was a little better but not much mason do you mean to hunt this season peregrine asked  no said the other  well i would if i were you you will never know the fellows about here unless you do  in the first place i cant afford the time said lucius and in the next place i cant afford the money this was plucky on his part and it was felt to be so by everybody in the room but perhaps had he spoken all the truth he would have said also that he was not accustomed to horsemanship  to a fellow who has a place of his own as you have it costs nothing said peregrine  oh does it not said the baronet i used to think differently  well not so much i mean as if you had everything to buy besides i look upon mason as a sort of croesus what on earth has he got to do with his money and then as to timeupon my word i dont understand what a man means when he says he has not got time for hunting  lucius intends to be a farmer said his mother  so do i said peregrine by jove i should think so if i had two hundred acres of land in my own hand i should not want anything else in the world and would never ask any one for a shilling  if that be so i might make the best bargain at once that ever a man made said the baronet if i might take you at your word master perry  pray dont talk of it sir said mrs orme  you may be quite sure of this my dearthat i shall not do more than talk of it then sir peregrine asked lady mason if she would take any more wine after which the ladies withdrew and the lecture commenced  but we will in the first place accompany the ladies into the drawingroom for a few minutes it was hinted in one of the first chapters of this story that lady mason might have become more intimate than she had done with mrs orme had she so pleased it and by this it will of course be presumed that she had not so pleased all this is perfectly true mrs orme had now been living at the cleeve the greater portion of her life and had never while there made one really wellloved friend she had a sister of her own and dear old friends of her childhood who lived far away from her in the northern counties occasionally she did see them and was then very happy but this was not frequent with her her sister who was married to a peer might stay at the cleeve for a fortnight perhaps once in the year but mrs orme herself seldom left her own home she thought and certainly not without cause that sir peregrine was not happy in her absence and therefore she never left him then living there so much alone was it not natural that her heart should desire a friend  but lady mason had been living much more alone she had no sister to come to her even though it were but once a year she had no intimate female friend none to whom she could really speak with the full freedom of friendship and it would have been delightful to have bound to her by ties of love so sweet a creature as mrs orme a widow like herselfand like herself a widow with one only son but she warily picking her steps through life had learned the necessity of being cautious in all things the countenance of sir peregrine had been invaluable to her and might it not be possible that she should lose that countenance a word or two spoken now and then again a look not intended to be noticed an altered tone or perhaps a change in the pressure of the old mans hand had taught lady mason to think that he might disapprove such intimacy probably at the moment she was right for she was quick at reading such small signs it behoved her to be very careful and to indulge in no pleasure which might be costly and therefore she had denied herself in this matteras in so many others  but now it had occurred to her that it might be well to change her conduct either she felt that sir peregrines friendship for her was too confirmed to be shaken or perhaps she fancied that she might strengthen it by means of his daughterinlaw at any rate she resolved to accept the offer which had once been tacitly made to her if it were still open to her to do so  how little changed your boy is she said when they were seated near to each other with their coffeecups between them  no he does not change quickly and as you say he is a boy still in many things i do not know whether it may not be better that it should be so  i did not mean to call him a boy in that sense said lady mason  but you might now your son is quite a man  poor lucius yes in his position it is necessary his little bit of property is already his own and then he has no one like sir peregrine to look out for him necessity makes him manly  he will be marrying soon i dare say suggested mrs orme  oh i hope not do you think that early marriages are good for young men  yes i think so why not said mrs orme thinking of her own year of married happiness would you not wish to see lucius marry  i fancy not i should be afraid lest i should become as nothing to him and yet i would not have you think that i am selfish  i am sure that you are not that i am sure that you love him better than all the world besides i can feel what that is myself  but you are not alone with your boy as i am if he were to send me from him there would be nothing left for me in this world  send you from him ah because orley farm belongs to him but he would not do that i am sure he would not  he would do nothing unkind but how could he help it if his wife wished it but nevertheless i would not keep him single for that reasonno nor for any reason if i knew that he wished to marry but it would be a blow to me  i sincerely trust that peregrine may marry early said mrs orme perhaps thinking that babies were preferable either to rats or foxes  yes it would be well i am sure because you have ample means and the house is large and you would have his wife to love  if she were nice it would be so sweet to have her for a daughter i also am very much alone though perhaps not so much as you are lady mason  i hope notfor i am sometimes very lonely  i have often thought that  but i should be wicked beyond everything if i were to complain seeing that providence has given me so much that i had no right to expect what should i have done in my loneliness if sir peregrines hand and door had never been opened to me and then for the next halfhour the two ladies held sweet converse together during which we will go back to the gentlemen over their wine  illustration over their wine  are you drinking claret said sir peregrine arranging himself and his bottles in the way that was usual to him he had ever been a moderate man himself but nevertheless he had a businesslike way of going to work after dinner as though there was a good deal to be done before the drawingroom could be visited  no more wine for me sir said lucius  no wine said sir peregrine the elder  why mason youll never get on if thats the way with you said peregrine the younger  ill try at any rate said the other  waterdrinker moody thinker and peregrine sang a word or two from an old drinkingsong  i am not quite sure of that we englishmen i suppose are the moodiest thinkers in all the world and yet we are not so much given to waterdrinking as our lively neighbours across the channel  sir peregrine said nothing more on the subject but he probably thought that his young friend would not be a very comfortable neighbour his present task however was by no means that of teaching him to drink and he struck off at once upon the business he had undertaken so your mother tells me that you are going to devote all your energies to farming  hardly that i hope there is the land and i mean to see what i can do with it it is not much and i intend to combine some other occupation with it  you will find that two hundred acres of land will give you a good deal to dothat is if you mean to make money by it  i certainly hope to do thatin the long run  it seems to me the easiest thing in the world said peregrine  youll find out your mistake some day but with lucius mason it is very important that he should make no mistake at the commencement for a country gentleman i know no prettier amusement than experimental farmingbut then a man must give up all idea of making his rent out of the land  i cant afford that said lucius  no and that is why i take the liberty of speaking to you i hope that the great friendship which i feel for your mother will be allowed to stand as my excuse  i am very much obliged by your kindness sir i am indeed  the truth is i think you are beginning wrong you have now been to liverpool to buy guano i believe  yes that and some few other things there is a man there who has taken out a patent  my dear fellow if you lay out your money in that way you will never see it back again have you considered in the first place what your journey to liverpool has cost you  exactly nine and sixpence per cent on the money that i laid out there now that is not much more than a penny in the pound on the sum expended and is not for a moment to be taken into consideration in comparison with the advantage of an improved market  there was more in this than sir peregrine had expected to encounter he did not for a moment doubt the truth of his own experience or the folly and the danger of the young mans proceedings but he did doubt his own power of proving either the one or the other to one who so accurately computed his expenses by percentages on his outlay peregrine opened his eyes and sat by wondering in silence what on earth did mason mean by an improved market  i am afraid then said the baronet that you must have laid out a large sum of money  a man cant do any good sir peregrine by hoarding his capital i dont think very much of capital myself  dont you  not of the theory of capitalnot so much as some people do but if a man has got it of course it should be expended on the trade to which it is to be applied  but some little knowledgesome experience is perhaps desirable before any great outlay is made  yes some little knowledge is necessaryand some great knowledge would be desirable if it were accessiblebut it is not as i take it  long years perhaps devoted to such pursuits  yes sir peregrine i know what you are going to say experience no doubt will teach something a man who has walked thirty miles a day for thirty years will probably know what sort of shoes will best suit his feet and perhaps also the kind of food that will best support him through such exertion but there is very little chance of his inventing any quicker mode of travelling  but he will have earned his wages honestly said sir peregrine almost angrily in his heart he was very angry for he did not love to be interrupted  oh yes and if that were sufficient we might all walk our thirty miles a day but some of us must earn wages for other people or the world will make no progress civilization as i take it consists in efforts made not for oneself but for others  if you wont take any more wine we will join the ladies said the baronet  he has not taken any at all said peregrine filling his own glass for the last time and emptying it  that young man is the most conceited puppy it was ever my misfortune to meet said sir peregrine to mrs orme when she came to kiss him and take his blessing as she always did before leaving him for the night  i am sorry for that said she for i like his mother so much  i also like her said sir peregrine but i cannot say that i shall ever be very fond of her son  ill tell you what mamma said young peregrine the same evening in his mothers dressingroom lucius mason was too many for the governor this evening  i hope he did not tease your grandfather  he talked him down regularly and it was plain that the governor did not like it  and then the day was over     chapter xv  a morning call at mount pleasant villa   on the following day lady mason made two visits using her new vehicle for the first time she would fain have walked had she dared but she would have given terrible offence to her son by doing so he had explained to her and with some truth that as their joint income was now a thousand a year she was quite entitled to such a luxury and then he went on to say that as he had bought it for her he should be much hurt if she would not use it she had put it off from day to day and now she could put it off no longer  her first visit was by appointment at the cleeve she had promised mrs orme that she would come up some special purpose having been namedbut with the real idea at any rate on the part of the latter that they might both be more comfortable together than alone the walk across from orley farm to the cleeve had always been very dear to lady mason every step of it was over beautiful ground and a delight in scenery was one of the few pleasures which her lot in life had permitted her to enjoy but today she could not allow herself the walk her pleasure and delight must be postponed to her sons wishes but then she was used to that  she found mrs orme alone and sat with her for an hour i do not know that anything was said between them which deserves to be specially chronicled mrs orme though she told her many things did not tell her what sir peregrine had said as he was going up to his bedroom on the preceding evening nor did lady mason say much about her sons farming she had managed to gather from lucius that he had not been deeply impressed by anything that had fallen from sir peregrine on the subject and therefore thought it as well to hold her tongue she soon perceived also from the fact of mrs orme saying nothing about lucius that he had not left behind him any very favourable impression this was to her cause of additional sorrow but she knew that it must be borne nothing that she could say would induce lucius to make himself acceptable to sir peregrine  when the hour was over she went down again to her little carriage mrs orme coming with her to look at it and in the hall they met sir peregrine  why does not lady mason stop for lunch said he it is past halfpast one i never knew anything so inhospitable as turning her out at this moment  i did ask her to stay said mrs orme  but i command her to stay said sir peregrine knocking his stick upon the stone floor of the hall and let me see who will dare to disobey me john let lady masons carriage and pony stand in the open coachhouse till she is ready so lady mason went back and did remain for lunch she was painfully anxious to maintain the best possible footing in that house but still more anxious not to have it thought that she was intruding she had feared that lucius by his offence might have estranged sir peregrine against herself but that at any rate was not the case  after lunch she drove herself to hamworth and made her second visit on this occasion she called on one mrs arkwright who was a very old acquaintance though hardly to be called an intimate friend the late mr arkwrightdr arkwright as he used to be styled in hamworthhad been sir josephs medical attendant for many years and therefore there had been room for an intimacy no real friendship that is no friendship of confidence had sprung up but nevertheless the doctors wife had known enough of lady mason in her younger days to justify her in speaking of things which would not have been mentioned between merely ordinary acquaintance i am glad to see you have got promotion said the old lady looking out at lady masons little phaeton on the gravel sweep which divided mrs arkwrights house from the street for mrs arkwrights house was mount pleasant villa and therefore was entitled to a sweep  it was a present from lucius said the other and as such must be used but i shall never feel myself at home in my own carriage  it is quite proper my dear lady mason quite proper with his income and with yours i do not wonder that he insists upon it it is quite proper and just at the present moment peculiarly so  lady mason did not understand this but she would probably have passed it by without understanding it had she not thought that there was some expression more than ordinary in mrs arkwrights face why peculiarly so at the present moment she said  because it shows that this foolish report which is going about has no foundation people wont believe it for a moment when they see you out and about and happylike  what rumour mrs arkwright and lady masons heart sunk within her as she asked the question she felt at once to what it must allude though she had conceived no idea as yet that there was any rumour on the subject indeed during the last fortyeight hours since she had left the chambers of mr furnival she had been more at ease within herself than during the previous days which had elapsed subsequent to the illomened visit made to her by miriam dockwrath it had seemed to her that mr furnival anticipated no danger and his manner and words had almost given her confidence but nownow that a public rumour was spoken of her heart was as low again as ever  sure havent you heard said mrs arkwright well i wouldnt be the first to tell you only that i know that there is no truth in it  you might as well tell me now as i shall be apt to believe worse than the truth after what you have said  and then mrs arkwright told her people have been saying that mr mason is again going to begin those law proceedings about the farm but i for one dont believe it  people have said so lady mason repeated she meant nothing it was nothing to her who the people were if one said it now all would soon be saying it but she uttered the words because she felt herself forced to say something and the power of thinking what she might best say was almost taken away from her  i am sure i dont know where it came from said mrs arkwright but i would not have alluded to it if i had not thought that of course you had heard it i am very sorry if my saying it has vexed you  oh no said lady mason trying to smile  as i said before we all know that there is nothing in it and your having the pony chaise just at this time will make everybody see that you are quite comfortable yourself  thank you yes goodbye mrs arkwright and then she made a great effort feeling aware that she was betraying herself and that it behoved her to say something which might remove the suspicion which her emotion must have created the very name of that lawsuit is so dreadful to me that i can hardly bear it the memory of it is so terrible to me that even my enemies would hardly wish that it should commence again  of course it is merely a report said mrs arkwright almost trembling at what she had done  that is allat least i believe so i had heard myself that some such threat had been made but i did not think that any tidings of it had got abroad  it was mrs whiting told me she is a great busybody you know mrs whiting was the wife of the present doctor  dear mrs arkwright it does not matter in the least of course i do not expect that people should hold their tongue on my account goodbye mrs arkwright and then she got into the little carriage and did contrive to drive herself home to orley farm  dear dear dear dear said mrs arkwright to herself when she was left alone only to think of that that she should be knocked in a heap by a few wordsin a moment as we may say and then she began to consider of the matter i wonder what there is in it there must be something or she would never have looked so like a ghost what will they do if orley farm is taken away from them after all and then mrs arkwright hurried out on her daily little toddle through the town that she might talk about and be talked to on the same subject she was by no means an illnatured woman nor was she at all inclined to direct against lady mason any slight amount of venom which might alloy her disposition but then the matter was of such importance the people of hamworth had hardly yet ceased to talk of the last orley farm trial and would it not be necessary that they should talk much more if a new trial were really pending looking at the matter in that light would not such a trial be a godsend to the people of hamworth therefore i beg that it may not be imputed to mrs arkwright as a fault that she toddled out and sought eagerly for her gossips  lady mason did manage to drive herself home but her success in the matter was more owing to the good faith and propriety of her pony than to any skilful workmanship on her own part her first desire had been to get away from mrs arkwright and having made that effort she was now for a time hardly able to make any other it was fast coming upon her now let sir peregrine say what comforting words he might let mr furnival assure her that she was safe with ever so much confidence nevertheless she could not but believe could not but feel inwardly convinced that that which she so dreaded was to happen it was written in the book of her destiny that there should be a new trial  and now from this very moment the misery would again begin people would point at her and talk of her her success in obtaining orley farm for her own child would again be canvassed at every house in hamworth and not only her success but the means also by which that success had been obtained the old people would remember and the young people would inquire and for her tranquillity repose and that retirement of life which had been so valuable to her were all gone  there could be no doubt that dockwrath had spread the report immediately on his return from yorkshire and had she well thought of the matter she might have taken some comfort from this of course he would tell the story which he did tell his confidence in being able again to drag the case before the courts would by no means argue that others believed as he believed in fact the enemies now arraigned against her were only those whom she already knew to be so arraigned but she had not sufficient command of her thoughts to be able at first to take comfort from such a reflection as this she felt as she was being carried home that the world was going from her and that it would be well for her were it possible that she should die  but she was stronger when she reached her own door than she had been at mrs arkwrights there was still within her a great power of selfmaintenance if only time were allowed to her to look about and consider how best she might support herself many women are in this respect as she was with forethought and summoned patience they can endure great agonies but a sudden pang unexpected overwhelms them she got out of the pony carriage with her ordinary placid face and walked up to her own room without having given any sign that she was uneasy and then she had to determine how she should bear herself before her son it had been with her a great object that both sir peregrine and mr furnival should first hear of the tidings from her and that they should both promise her their aid when they had heard the story as she would tell it in this she had been successful and it now seemed to her that prudence would require her to act in the same way towards lucius had it been possible to keep this matter from him altogether she would have given much to do so but now it would not be possible it was clear that mr dockwrath had chosen to make the matter public acting no doubt with forethought in doing so and lucius would be sure to hear words which would become common in hamworth difficult as the task would be to her it would be best that she should prepare him so she sat alone till dinnertime planning how she would do this she had sat alone for hours in the same way planning how she would tell her story to sir peregrine and again as to her second story for mr furnival those whose withers are unwrung can hardly guess how absolutely a sore under the collar will embitter every hour for the poor jade who is so tormented  but she met him at dinner with a smiling face he loved to see her smile and often told her so almost upbraiding her when she would look sad why should she be sad seeing that she had everything that a woman could desire her mind was burdened with no heavy thoughts as to feeding coming multitudes she had no contests to wage with the desultory chemists of the age his purpose was to work hard during the hours of the dayhard also during many hours of the night and it was becoming that his mother should greet him softly during his few intervals of idleness he told her so in some words not badly chosen for such telling and she loving mother that she was strove valiantly to obey him  during dinner she could not speak to him nor immediately after dinner the evil moment she put off from halfhour to halfhour still looking as though all were quiet within her bosom as she sat beside him with her book in her hand he was again at work before she began her story he thought at least that he was at work for he had before him on the table both prichard and latham and was occupied in making copies from some drawings of skulls which purposed to represent the cerebral development of certain of our more distant asiatic brethren  is it not singular said be that the jaws of men born and bred in a hunter state should be differently formed from those of the agricultural tribes  are they said lady mason  oh yes the maxillary profile is quite different you will see this especially with the mongolians among the tartar tribes it seems to me to be very much the same difference as that between a man and a sheep but prichard makes no such remark look here at this fellow he must have been intended to eat nothing but flesh and that raw and without any knife or fork  i dont suppose they had many knives or forks  by close observation i do not doubt that one could tell from a single tooth not only what food the owner of it had been accustomed to eat but what language he had spoken i say close observation you know it could not be done in a day  i suppose not and then the student again bent over his drawing you see it would have been impossible for the owner of such a jaw as that to have ground a grain of corn between his teeth or to have masticated even a cabbage  lucius said lady mason becoming courageous on the spur of the moment i want you to leave that for a moment and speak to me  well said he putting down his pencil and turning round here i am  you have heard of the lawsuit which i had with your brother when you were an infant  of course i have heard of it but i wish you would not call that man my brother he would not own me as such and i most certainly would not own him as far as i can learn he is one of the most detestable human beings that ever existed  you have heard of him from an unfavourable side lucius you should remember that he is a hard man i believe but i do not know that he would do anything which he thought to be unjust  why then did he try to rob me of my property  because he thought that it should have been his own i cannot see into his breast but i presume that it was so  i do not presume anything of the kind and never shall i was an infant and you were a womana woman at that time without many friends and he thought that he could rob us under cover of the law had he been commonly honest it would have been enough for him to know what had been my fathers wishes even if the will had not been rigidly formal i look upon him as a robber and a thief  i am sorry for that lucius because i differ from you what i wish to tell you now is thisthat he is thinking of trying the question again  whatthinking of another trial now and lucius mason pushed his drawings and books from him with a vengeance  so i am told  and who told you i cannot believe it if he intended anything of the kind i must have been the first person to hear of it it would be my business now and you may be sure that he would have taken care to let me know his purpose  and then by degrees she explained to him that the man himself mr mason of groby had as yet declared no such purpose she had intended to omit all mention of the name of mr dockwrath but she was unable to do so without seeming to make a mystery with her son when she came to explain how the rumour had arisen and why she had thought it necessary to tell him this she was obliged to say that it had all arisen from the wrath of the attorney he has been to groby park she said and now that he has returned he is spreading this report  i shall go to him tomorrow said lucius very sternly  no no you must not do that you must promise me that you will not do that  but i shall you cannot suppose that i shall allow such a man as that to tamper with my name without noticing it it is my business now  no lucius the attack will be against me rather than youthat is if an attack be made i have told you because i do not like to have a secret from you  of course you have told me if you are attacked who should defend you if i do not  the best defence indeed the only defence till they take some active step will be silence most probably they will not do anything and then we can afford to live down such reports as these you can understand lucius that the matter is grievous enough to me and i am sure that for my sake you will not make it worse by a personal quarrel with such a man as that  i shall go to mr furnival said he and ask his advice  i have done that already lucius i thought it best to do so when first i heard that mr dockwrath was moving in the matter it was for that that i went up to town  and why did you not tell me  i then thought that you might be spared the pain of knowing anything of the matter i tell you now because i hear today in hamworth that people are talking on the subject you might be annoyed as i was just now if the first tidings had reached you from some stranger  he sat silent for a while turning his pencil in his hand and looking as though he were going to settle the matter off hand by his own thoughts i tell you what it is mother i shall not let the burden of this fall on your shoulders you carried on the battle before but i must do so now if i can trace any word of scandal to that fellow dockwrath i shall indict him for a libel  oh lucius  i shall and no mistake  what would he have said had he known that his mother had absolutely proposed to mr furnival to buy off mr dockwraths animosity almost at any price     chapter xvi  mr dockwrath in bedford row   mr dockwrath as he left leeds and proceeded to join the bosom of his family was not discontented with what he had done it might not improbably have been the case that mr mason would altogether refuse to see him and having seen him mr mason might altogether have declined his assistance he might have been forced as a witness to disclose his secret of which he could make so much better a profit as a legal adviser as it was mr mason had promised to pay him for his services and would no doubt be induced to go so far as to give him a legal claim for payment mr mason had promised to come up to town and had instructed the hamworth attorney to meet him there and under such circumstances the hamworth attorney had but little doubt that time would produce a considerable bill of costs in his favour  and then he thought that he saw his way to a great success i should be painting the devil too black were i to say that revenge was his chief incentive in that which he was doing all our motives are mixed and his wicked desire to do evil to lady mason in return for the evil which she had done to him was mingled with professional energy and an ambition to win a cause that ought to be wonespecially a cause which others had failed to win he said to himself on finding those names and dates among old mr usbechs papers that there was still an opportunity of doing something considerable in this orley farm case and he had made up his mind to do it professional energy revenge and money considerations would work hand in hand in this matter and therefore as he left leeds in the secondclass railway carriage for london he thought over the result of his visit with considerable satisfaction  he had left leeds at ten and mr moulder had come down in the same omnibus to the station and was travelling in the same train in a firstclass carriage mr moulder was a man who despised the secondclass and was not slow to say so before other commercials who travelled at a cheaper rate than he did hubbles and grease he said allowed him respectably in order that he might go about their business respectable and he wasnt going to give the firm a bad name by being seen in a secondclass carriage although the difference would go into his own pocket that wasnt the way he had begun and that wasnt the way he was going to end he said nothing to mr dockwrath in the morning merely bowing in answer to that gentlemans salutation hope you were comfortable last night in the back drawingroom said mr dockwrath but mr moulder in reply only looked at him  at the mansfield station mr kantwise with his huge wooden boxes appeared on the platform and he got into the same carriage with mr dockwrath he had come on by a night train and had been doing a stroke of business that morning well kantwise moulder holloaed out from his warm wellpadded seat doing it cheap and nasty eh  not at all nasty mr moulder said the other and i find myself among as respectable a class of society in the secondclass as you do in the first quite soand perhaps a little better mr kantwise added as he took his seat immediately opposite to mr dockwrath i hope i have the pleasure of seeing you pretty bobbish this morning sir and he shook hands cordially with the attorney  tidy thank you said dockwrath my company last night did not do me any harm you may swear to that  ha ha ha i was so delighted that you got the better of moulder a domineering party isnt he quite terrible for myself i cant put up with him sometimes  i didnt have to put up with him last night  no no it was very good wasnt it now very capital indeed all the same i wish youd heard busby give us beautiful venice city of song a charming voice has busby quite charming and there was a pause for a minute or so after which mr kantwise resumed the conversation youll allow me to put you up one of those drawingroom sets he said  well i am afraid not i dont think they are strong enough where there are children  dear dear dear dear to hear you say so mr dockwrath why they are made for strength they are the very things for children because they dont break you know  but theyd bend terribly  by no means theyre so elastic that they always recovers themselves i didnt show you that but you might turn the backs of them chairs nearly down to the ground and they will come straight again you let me send you a set for your wife to look at if shes not charmed with them illillill eat them  women are charmed with anything said mr dockwrath a new bonnet does that  they know what they are about pretty well as i dare say you have found out ill send express to sheffield and have a completely new set put up for you  for twelve seventeen six of course  oh dear no mr dockwrath the lowest figure for ready money delivered free is fifteen ten  i couldnt think of paying more than mrs mason  ah but that was a damaged set it was indeed and she merely wanted it as a present for the curates wife the table was quite sprung and the musicstool wouldnt twist  but youll send them to me new  new from the manufactory upon my word we will  a table that you have never acted uponhave never shown off on standing in the middle you know  yes upon my honour you shall have them direct from the workshop and sent at once you shall find them in your drawingroom on tuesday next  well say thirteen ten  i couldnt do it mr dockwrath and so they went on bargaining half the way up to town till at last they came to terms for fourteen eleven and a very superior article your lady will find them mr kantwise said as he shook hands with his new friend at parting  one day mr dockwrath remained at home in the bosom of his family saying all manner of spiteful things against lady mason and on the next day he went up to town and called on round and crook that one day he waited in order that mr mason might have time to write but mr mason had written on the very day of the visit to groby park and mr round junior was quite ready for mr dockwrath when that gentleman called  mr dockwrath when at home had again cautioned his wife to have no intercourse whatever with that swindler at orley farm wishing thereby the more thoroughly to imbue poor miriam with a conviction that lady mason had committed some fraud with reference to the will you had better say nothing about the matter anywhere dyou hear people will talk all the world will be talking about it before long but that is nothing to you if people ask you say that you believe that i am engaged in the case professionally but that you know nothing further as to all which miriam of course promised the most exact obedience but mr dockwrath though he only remained one day in hamworth before he went to london took care that the curiosity of his neighbours should be sufficiently excited  mr dockwrath felt some little trepidation at the heart as he walked into the office of messrs round and crook in bedford row messrs round and crook stood high in the profession and were men who in the ordinary way of business would have had no personal dealings with such a man as mr dockwrath had any such intercourse become necessary on commonplace subjects messrs round and crooks confidential clerk might have seen mr dockwrath but even he would have looked down upon the hamworth attorney as from a great moral height but now in the matter of the orley farm case mr dockwrath had determined that he would transact business only on equal terms with the bedford row people the secret was hisof his finding he knew the strength of his own position and he would use it but nevertheless he did tremble inwardly as he asked whether mr round was withinor if not mr round then mr crook  there were at present three members in the firm though the old name remained unaltered the mr round and the mr crook of former days were still working partnersthe very round and the very crook who had carried on the battle on the part of mr mason of groby twenty years ago but to them had been added another mr round a son of old round who though his name did not absolutely appear in the nomenclature of the firm was as a working man the most important person in it old mr round might now be said to be ornamental and communicative he was a hale man of nearly seventy who thought a great deal of his peaches up at isleworth who came to the office five times a weeknot doing very much hard work and who took the largest share in the profits mr round senior had enjoyed the reputation of being a sound honourable man but was now considered by some to be not quite sharp enough for the practice of the present day  mr crook had usually done the dirty work of the firm having been originally a managing clerk and he still did the samein a small way he had been the man to exact penalties look after costs and attend to any criminal business or business partly criminal in its nature which might chance find its way to them but latterly in all great matters mr round junior mr matthew roundhis father was richardwas the member of the firm on whom the world in general placed the greatest dependence mr masons letter had in the ordinary way of business come to him although it had been addressed to his father and he had resolved on acting on it himself  when mr dockwrath called mr round senior was at birmingham mr crook was taking his annual holiday and mr round junior was reigning alone in bedford row instructions had been given to the clerks that if mr dockwrath called he was to be shown in and therefore he found himself seated with much less trouble than he had expected in the private room of mr round junior he had expected to see an old man and was therefore somewhat confused not feeling quite sure that he was in company with one of the principals but nevertheless looking at the room and especially at the armchair and carpet he was aware that the legal gentleman who motioned him to a seat could be no ordinary clerk  the manner of this legal gentleman was not as mr dockwrath thought quite so ceremoniously civil as it might be considering the important nature of the business to be transacted between them mr dockwrath intended to treat on equal terms and so intending would have been glad to have shaken hands with his new ally at the commencement of their joint operations but the man before hima man younger than himself toodid not even rise from his chair ah mr dockwrath he said taking up a letter from the table will you have the goodness to sit down and mr matthew round wheeled his own armchair towards the fire stretching out his legs comfortably and pointing to a somewhat distant seat as that intended for the accommodation of his visitor mr dockwrath seated himself in the somewhat distant seat and deposited his hat upon the floor not being as yet quite at home in his position but he made up his mind as he did so that he would be at home before he left the room  i find that you have been down in yorkshire with a client of ours mr dockwrath said mr matthew round  yes i have said he of hamworth  ah well you are in the profession yourself i believe  yes i am an attorney  would it not have been well to have come to us first  no i think not i have not the pleasure of knowing your name sir  my name is roundmatthew round  i beg your pardon sir i did not know said mr dockwrath bowing it was a satisfaction to him to learn that he was closeted with a mr round even if it were not the mr round no mr round i cant say that i should have thought of that in the first place i didnt know whether mr mason employed any lawyer and in the next  well well it does not matter it is usual among the profession but it does not in the least signify mr mason has written to us and he says that you have found out something about that orley farm business  yes i have found out something at least i rather think so  well what is it mr dockwrath  ah thats the question its rather a ticklish business mr round a family affair as i may say  whose family  to a certain extent my family and to a certain extent mr masons family i dont know how far i should be justified in laying all the facts before youwonderful facts they are tooin an offhand way like that these matters have to be considered a great deal it is not only the extent of the property there is much more than that in it mr round  if you dont tell me what there is in it i dont see what we are to do i am sure you did not give yourself the trouble of coming up here from hamworth merely with the object of telling us that you are going to hold your tongue  certainly not mr round  then what did you come to say  may i ask you mr round what mr mason has told you with reference to my interview with him  yes i will read you a part of his lettermr dockwrath is of opinion that the will under which the estate is now enjoyed is absolutely a forgery i presume you mean the codicil mr dockwrath  oh yes the codicil of course  and he has in his possession documents which i have not seen but which seem to me as described to go far to prove that this certainly must have been the case and then he goes on with a description of dates although it is clear that he does not understand the matter himselfindeed he says as much now of course we must see these documents before we can give our client any advice a certain small portion of mr masons letter mr round did then read but he did not read those portions in which mr mason expressed his firm determination to reopen the case against lady mason and even to prosecute her for forgery if it were found that he had anything like a fair chance of success in doing so i know that you were convinced he had said addressing himself personally to mr round senior that lady mason was acting in good faith i was always convinced of the contrary and am more sure of it now than ever this last paragraph mr round junior had not thought it necessary to read to mr dockwrath  the documents to which i allude are in reference to my confidential family matters and i certainly shall not produce them without knowing on what ground i am standing  of course you are aware mr dockwrath that we could compel you  there mr round i must be allowed to differ  it wont come to that of course if you have anything worth showing youll show it and if we make use of you as a witness it must be as a willing witness  i dont think it probable that i shall be a witness in the matter at all  ah well perhaps not my own impression is that no case will be made out that there will be nothing to take before a jury  there again i must differ from you mr round  oh of course i suppose the real fact is that it is a matter of money you want to be paid for what information you have got that is about the long and the short of it eh mr dockwrath  i dont know what you call the long and the short of it mr round or what may be your way of doing business as a professional man of course i expect to be paid for my workand i have no doubt that you expect the same  no doubt mr dockwrath butas you have made the comparison i hope you will excuse me for saying sowe always wait till our clients come to us  mr dockwrath drew himself up with some intention of becoming angry but he hardly knew how to carry it out and then it might be a question whether anger would serve his turn do you mean to say mr round if you had found documents such as these you would have done nothing about themthat you would have passed them by as worthless  i cant say that till i know what the documents are if i found papers concerning the client of another firm i should go to that firm if i thought that they demanded attention  i didnt know anything about the firmhow was i to know  well you know now mr dockwrath as i understand it our client has referred you to us if you have anything to say we are ready to hear it if you have anything to show we are ready to look at it if you have nothing to say and nothing to show  ah but i have only  only you want us to make it worth your while we might as well have the truth at once is not that about it  i want to see my way of course  exactly and now mr dockwrath i must make you understand that we dont do business in that way  then i shall see mr mason again myself  that you can do he will be in town next week and as i believe wishes to see you as regards your expenses if you can show us that you have any communication to make that is worth our clients attention we will see that you are paid what you are out of pocket and some fair remuneration for the time you may have lostnot as an attorney remember for in that light we cannot regard you  i am every bit as much an attorney as you are  no doubt but you are not mr masons attorney and as long as it suits him to honour us with his custom you cannot be so regarded  thats as he pleases  no it is not mr dockwrath it is as he pleases whether he employs you or us but it is not as he pleases whether he employs both on business of the same class he may give us his confidence or he may withdraw it  looking at the way the matter was managed before perhaps the latter may be the better for him  excuse me mr dockwrath for saying that that is a question i shall not discuss with you  upon this mr dockwrath jumped from his chair and took up his hat good morning to you sir said mr round without moving from his chair i will tell mr mason that you have declined making any communication to us he will probably know your addressif he should want it  mr dockwrath paused was he not about to sacrifice substantial advantage to momentary anger would it not be better that he should carry this impudent young london lawyer with him if it were possible sir said he i am quite willing to tell you all that i know of this matter at present if you will have the patience to hear it  patience mr dockwrath why i am made of patience sit down again mr dockwrath and think of it  mr dockwrath did sit down again and did think of it and it ended in his telling to mr round all that he had told to mr mason as he did so he looked closely at mr rounds face but there he could read nothing exactly said mr round the fourteenth of july is the date of both i have taken a memorandum of that a final deed for closing partnership was it i have got that down john kenneby and bridget bolster i remember the nameswitnesses to both deeds were they i understand nothing about this other deed was brought up at the trial i see the pointsuch as it is john kenneby and bridget bolsterboth believed to be living oh you can give their address can you decline to do so now very well it does not matter i think i understand it all now mr dockwrath and when we want you again you shall hear from us samuel dockwrath is it thank you good morning if mr mason wishes to see you he will write of course good day mr dockwrath  and so mr dockwrath went home not quite contented with his days work     chapter xvii  von bauhr   it will be remembered that mr crabwitz was sent across from lincolns inn to bedford row to ascertain the present address of old mr round mr round is at birmingham he said coming back every one connected with the profession is at birmingham except  the more fools they said mr furnival  i am thinking of going down myself this evening said mr crabwitz as you will be out of town sir i suppose i can be spared  you too  and why not me mr furnival when all the profession is meeting together why should not i be there as well as another i hope you do not deny me my right to feel an interest in the great subjects which are being discussed  not in the least mr crabwitz i do not deny you your right to be lord chief justice if you can accomplish it but you cannot be lord chief justice and my clerk at the same time nor can you be in my chambers if you are at birmingham i rather think i must trouble you to remain here as i cannot tell at what moment i may be in town again  then sir im afraid mr crabwitz began his speech and then faltered he was going to tell mr furnival that he must suit himself with another clerk when he remembered his fees and paused it would be very pleasant to him to quit mr furnival but where could he get such another place he knew that he himself was invaluable but then he was invaluable only to mr furnival mr furnival would be mad to part with him mr crabwitz thought but then would he not be almost more mad to part with mr furnival  eh well said mr furnival  oh of course if you desire it mr furnival i will remain but i must say i think it is rather hard  look here mr crabwitz if you think my service is too hard upon you you had better leave it but if you take upon yourself to tell me so again you must leave it remember that mr furnival possessed the master mind of the two and mr crabwitz felt this as he slunk back to his own room  so mr round also was at birmingham and could be seen there this was so far well and mr furnival having again with ruthless malice sent mr crabwitz for a cab at once started for the euston square station he could master mr crabwitz and felt a certain pleasure in having done so but could he master mrs f that lady had on one or two late occasions shown her anger at the existing state of her domestic affairs and had once previously gone so far as to make her lord understand that she was jealous of his proceedings with reference to other goddesses but she had never before done this in the presence of other peopleshe had never allowed any special goddess to see that she was the special object of such jealousy now she had not only committed herself in this way but had also committed him making him feel himself to be ridiculous and it was highly necessary that some steps should be takenif he only knew what step all which kept his mind active as he journeyed in the cab  at the station he found three or four other lawyers all bound for birmingham indeed during this fortnight the whole line had been alive with learned gentlemen going to and fro discussing weighty points as they rattled along the iron road and shaking their ponderous heads at the new ideas which were being ventilated mr furnival with many othersindeed with most of those who were so far advanced in the world as to be making bread by their professionwas of opinion that all this palaver that was going on in the various tongues of babel would end as it beganin words vox et præterea nihil to practical englishmen most of these international congresses seem to arrive at nothing else men will not be talked out of the convictions of their lives no living orator would convince a grocer that coffee should be sold without chicory and no amount of eloquence will make an english lawyer think that loyalty to truth should come before loyalty to his client and therefore our own pundits though on this occasion they went to birmingham summoned by the greatness of the occasion by the dignity of foreign names by interest in the question and by the influence of such men as lord boanerges went there without any doubt on their minds as to the rectitude of their own practice and fortified with strong resolves to resist all idea of change  and indeed one cannot understand how the bent of any mans mind should be altered by the sayings and doings of such a congress  well johnson what have you all been doing today asked mr furnival of a special friend whom he chanced to meet at the club which had been extemporized at birmingham  we have had a paper read by von bauhr it lasted three hours  three hours heavens von bauhr is i think from berlin  yes he and dr slotacher slotacher is to read his paper the day after tomorrow  then i think i shall go to london again but what did von bauhr say to you during those three hours  of course it was all in german and i dont suppose that any one understood himunless it was boanerges but i believe it was the old story going to show that the same man might be judge advocate and jury  no doubtif men were machines and if you could find such machines perfect at all points in their machinery  and if the machines had no hearts  machines dont have hearts said mr furnival especially those in germany and what did boanerges say his answer did not take three hours more i hope  about twenty minutes but what he did say was lost on von bauhr who understands as much english as i do german he said that the practice of the prussian courts had always been to him a subject of intense interest and that the general justice of their verdicts could not be impugned  nor ought it seeing that a single trial for murder will occupy a court for three weeks he should have asked von bauhr how much work he usually got through in the course of a sessions i dont seem to have lost much by being away bytheby do you happen to know whether round is here  what old round i saw him in the hall today yawning as though he would burst and then mr furnival strolled off to look for the attorney among the various purlieus frequented by the learned strangers  furnival said another barrister accosting himan elderly man small with sharp eyes and bushy eyebrows dirty in his attire and poor in his general appearance have you seen judge staveley this was mr chaffanbrass great at the old bailey a man well able to hold his own in spite of the meanness of his appearance at such a meeting as this the english bar generally could have had no better representative than mr chaffanbrass  no is he here  he must be here he is the only man they could find who knows enough italian to understand what that fat fellow from florence will say tomorrow  were to have the italian tomorrow are we  yes and staveley afterwards its as good as a play only like all plays its three times too long i wonder whether anybody here believes in it  yes felix graham does  he believes everythingunless it is the bible he is one of those young men who look for an instant millennium and who regard themselves not only as the prophets who foretell it but as the preachers who will produce it for myself i am too old for a new gospel with felix graham as an apostle  they say that boanerges thinks a great deal of him  that cant be true for boanerges never thought much of any one but himself well im off to bed for i find a day here ten times more fatiguing than the old bailey in july  on the whole the meeting was rather dull as such meetings usually are it must not be supposed that any lawyer could get up at will as the spirit moved him and utter his own ideas or that all members of the congress could speak if only they could catch the speakers eye had this been so a man might have been supported by the hope of having some finger in the pie sooner or later but in such case the congress would have lasted for ever as it was the names of those who were invited to address the meeting were arranged and of course men from each country were selected who were best known in their own special walks of their profession but then these bestknown men took an unfair advantage of their position and were ruthless in the lengthy cruelty of their addresses von bauhr at berlin was no doubt a great lawyer but he should not have felt so confident that the legal proceedings of england and of the civilised world in general could be reformed by his reading that book of his from the rostrum in the hall at birmingham the civilised world in general as there represented had been disgusted and it was surmised that poor dr slotacher would find but a meagre audience when his turn came  at last mr furnival succeeded in hunting up mr round and found him recruiting outraged nature with a glass of brandy and water and a cigar looking for me have you well here i am that is to say what is left of me were you in the hall today  no i was up in town  ah that accounts for your being so fresh i wish i had been there do you ever do anything in this way and mr round touched the outside of his glass of toddy with his spoon mr furnival said that he never did do anything in that way which was true port wine was his way and it may be doubted whether on the whole it is not the more dangerous way of the two but mr furnival though he would not drink brandy and water or smoke cigars sat down opposite to mr round and had soon broached the subject which was on his mind  yes said the attorney it is quite true that i had a letter on the subject from mr mason the lady is not wrong in supposing that some one is moving in the matter  and your client wishes you to take up the case again  no doubt he does he was not a man that i ever greatly liked mr furnival though i believe he means well he thinks that he has been ill used and perhaps he was ill usedby his father  but that can be no possible reason for badgering the life out of his fathers widow twenty years after his fathers death  of course he thinks that he has some new evidence i cant say i looked into the matter much myself i did read the letter but that was all and then i handed it to my son as far as i remember mr mason said that some attorney at hamworth had been to him  exactly a low fellow whom you would be ashamed to see in your office he fancies that young mason has injured him and though he has received numberless benefits from lady mason this is the way in which he chooses to be revenged on her son  we should have nothing to do with such a matter as that you know its not our line  no of course it is not i am well aware of that and i am equally well aware that nothing mr mason can do can shake lady masons title or rather her sons title to the property but mr round if he be encouraged to gratify his malice  if who be encouraged  your client mr mason of grobythere can be no doubt that he might harass this unfortunate lady till he brought her nearly to the grave  that would be a pity for i believe shes still an uncommon pretty woman and the attorney indulged in a little fat inward chuckle for in these days mr furnivals taste with reference to strange goddesses was beginning to be understood by the profession  she is a very old friend of mine said mr furnival gravely a very old friend indeed and if i were to desert her now she would have no one to whom she could look  oh ah yes im sure youre very kind and mr round altered his face and tone so that they might be in conformity with those of his companion anything i can do of course i shall be very happy i should be slow myself to advise my client to try the matter again but to tell the truth anything of this kind would go to my son now i did read mr masons letter but i immediately handed it to matthew  i will tell you how you can oblige me mr round  do tell me i am sure i shall be very happy  look into this matter yourself and talk it over with mr mason before you allow anything to be done it is not that i doubt your sons discretion indeed we all know what an exceedingly good man of business he is  matthew is sharp enough said the prosperous father  but then young men are apt to be too sharp i dont know whether you remember the case about that orley farm mr round  as well as if it were yesterday said the attorney  then you must recollect how thoroughly you were convinced that your client had not a leg to stand upon  it was i that insisted that he should not carry it before the chancellor crook had the general management of those cases then and would have gone on but i said no i would not see my clients money wasted in such a wildgoose chase in the first place the property was not worth it and in the next place there was nothing to impugn the will if i remember right it all turned on whether an old man who had signed as witness was well enough to write his name  that was the point  and i think it was shown that he had himself signed a receipt on that very dayor the day after or the day before it was something of that kind  exactly those were the facts as regards the result of a new trial no sane man i fancy could have any doubt you know as well as any one living how great is the strength of twenty years of possession  it would be very strong on her side certainly  he would not have a chance of course not but mr round he might make that poor woman so wretched that death would be a relief to her now it may be possible that something looking like fresh evidence may have been discovered something of this kind probably has been found or this man would not be moving he would not have gone to the expense of a journey to yorkshire had he not got hold of some new story  he has something in his head you may be sure of that  dont let your son be run away with by this or advise your client to incur the terrible expense of a new trial without knowing what you are about i tell you fairly that i do dread such a trial on this poor ladys account reflect what it would be mr round to any lady of your own family  i dont think mrs round would mind it much that is if she were sure of her case  she is a strongminded woman but poor lady mason  she was strongminded enough too if i remember right at the last trial i shall never forget how composed she was when old bennett tried to shake her evidence do you remember how bothered he was  he was an excellent lawyerwas bennett there are few better men at the bar nowadays  you wouldnt have found him down here mr furnival listening to a german lecture three hours long i dont know how it is but i think we all used to work harder in those days than the young men do now and then these eulogists of past days went back to the memories of their youths declaring how in the old glorious years now gone no congress such as this would have had a chance of success men had mens work to do then and were not wont to play the fool first at one provincial town and then at another but stuck to their oars and made their fortunes it seems to me mr furnival said mr round that this is all childs play and to tell the truth i am half ashamed of myself for being here  and youll look into that matter yourself mr round  yes i will certainly  i shall take it as a great favour of course you will advise your client in accordance with any new facts which may be brought before you but as i feel certain that no case against young mason can have any merits i do hope that you will be able to suggest to mr mason of groby that the matter should be allowed to rest and then mr furnival took his leave still thinking how far it might be possible that the enemys side of the question might be supported by real merits mr round was a goodnatured old fellow and if the case could be inveigled out of his sons hands and into his own it might be possible that even real merits should avail nothing  i confess i am getting rather tired of it said felix graham that evening to his friend young staveley as he stood outside his bedroom door at the top of a narrow flight of stairs in the back part of a large hotel at birmingham  tired of it i should think you are too  but nevertheless i am as sure as ever that good will come from it i am inclined to think that the same kind of thing must be endured before any improvement is made in anything  that all reformers have to undergo von bauhr  yes all of them that do any good von bauhrs words were very dry no doubt  you dont mean to say that you understood them  not many of them a few here and there for the first halfhour came trembling home to my dull comprehension and then  you went to sleep  the sounds became too difficult for my ears but dry and dull and hard as they were they will not absolutely fall to the ground he had a meaning in them and that meaning will reproduce itself in some shape  heaven forbid that it should ever do so in my presence all the iniquities of which the english bar may be guilty cannot be so intolerable to humanity as von bauhr  well goodnight old fellow your governor is to give us his ideas tomorrow and perhaps he will be as bad to the germans as your von bauhr was to us  then i can only say that my governor will be very cruel to the germans and so they two went to their dreams  in the mean time von bauhr was sitting alone looking back on the past hours with ideas and views very different from those of the many english lawyers who were at that time discussing his demerits to him the day had been one long triumph for his voice had sounded sweet in his own ears as period after period he had poured forth in full flowing language the gathered wisdom and experience of his life public men in england have so much to do that they cannot give time to the preparation of speeches for such meetings as these but von bauhr had been at work on his pamphlet for months nay taking it in the whole had he not been at work on it for years and now a kind providence had given him the opportunity of pouring it forth before the assembled pundits gathered from all the nations of the civilised world  as he sat there solitary in his bedroom his hands dropped down by his side his pipe hung from his mouth on to his breast and his eyes turned up to the ceiling were lighted almost with inspiration men there at the congress mr chaffanbrass young staveley felix graham and others had regarded him as an impersonation of dullness but through his mind and brain as he sat there wrapped in his old dressinggown there ran thoughts which seemed to lift him lightly from the earth into an elysium of justice and mercy and at the end of this elysium which was not wild in its beauty but trim and orderly in its gracefulnessas might be a beergarden at munichthere stood among flowers and vases a pedestal grand above all other pedestals in that garden and on this there was a bust with an inscriptionto von bauhr who reformed the laws of nations  it was a grand thought and though there was in it much of human conceit there was in it also much of human philanthropy if a reign of justice could be restored through his effortsthrough those efforts in which on this hallowed day he had been enabled to make so great a progresshow beautiful would it be and then as he sat there while the smoke still curled from his unconscious nostrils he felt that he loved all germans all englishmen even all frenchmen in his very heart of hearts and especially those who had travelled wearily to this english town that they might listen to the results of his wisdom he said to himself and said truly that he loved the world and that he would willingly spend himself in these great endeavours for the amelioration of its laws and the perfection of its judicial proceedings and then he betook himself to bed in a frame of mind that was not unenviable  illustration von bauhrs dream  i am inclined myself to agree with felix graham that such efforts are seldom absolutely wasted a man who strives honestly to do good will generally do good though seldom perhaps as much as he has himself anticipated let von bauhr have his pedestal among the flowers even though it be small and humble     chapter xviii  the english von bauhr   on the following morning before breakfast felix graham and augustus staveley prepared themselves for the labours of the coming day by a walk into the country for even at birmingham by perseverance a walk into the country may be attainedand very pretty country it is when reached these congress meetings did not begin before eleven so that for those who were active time for matutinal exercise was allowed  augustus staveley was the only son of the judge who on that day was to defend the laws of england from such attacks as might be made on them by a very fat advocate from florence of judge staveley himself much need not be said now except that he lived at noningsby near alston distant from the cleeve about nine miles and that at his house sophia furnival had been invited to pass the coming christmas his son was a handsome clever fellow who had nearly succeeded in getting the newdegate and was now a member of the middle temple he was destined to follow the steps of his father and become a light at the common law bar but hitherto he had not made much essential progress the world had been too pleasant to him to allow of his giving many of his hours to work his father was one of the best men in the world revered on the bench and loved by all men but he had not sufficient parental sternness to admit of his driving his son well into harness he himself had begun the world with little or nothing and had therefore succeeded but his son was already possessed of almost everything that he could want and therefore his success seemed doubtful his chambers were luxuriously furnished he had his horse in piccadilly his fathers house at noningsby was always open to him and the society of london spread out for him all its allurements under such circumstances how could it be expected that he should work nevertheless he did talk of working and had some idea in his head of the manner in which he would do so to a certain extent he had worked and he could talk fluently of the little that he knew the idea of a far niente life would have been intolerable to him but there were many among his friends who began to think that such a life would nevertheless be his ultimate destiny nor did it much matter they said for the judge was known to have made money  but his friend felix graham was rowing in a very different boat and of him also many prophesied that he would hardly be able to push his craft up against the strength of the stream not that he was an idle man but that he would not work at his oars in the only approved method of making progress for his boat he also had been at oxford but he had done little there except talk at a debating society and make himself notorious by certain ideas on religious subjects which were not popular at the university he had left without taking a degree in consequence as it was believed of some such notions and had now been called to the bar with a fixed resolve to open the oyster with such weapons offensive and defensive as nature had given to him but here as at oxford he would not labour on the same terms with other men or make himself subject to the same conventional rules and therefore it seemed only too probable that he might win no prize he had ideas of his own that men should pursue their labours without special conventional regulations but should be guided in their work by the general great rules of the worldsuch for instance as those given in the commandmentsthou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not steal and others his notions no doubt were great and perhaps were good but hitherto they had not led him to much pecuniary success in his profession a sort of a name he had obtained but it was not a name sweet in the ears of practising attorneys  and yet it behoved felix graham to make money for none was coming to him ready made from any father father or mother he had none nor uncles and aunts likely to be of service to him he had begun the world with some small sum which had grown smaller and smaller till now there was left to him hardly enough to create an infinitesimal dividend but he was not a man to become downhearted on that account a living of some kind he could pick up and did now procure for himself from the press of the day he wrote poetry for the periodicals and politics for the penny papers with considerable success and sufficient pecuniary results he would sooner do this he often boasted than abandon his great ideas or descend into the arena with other weapons than those which he regarded as fitting for an honest mans hand  augustus staveley who could be very prudent for his friend declared that marriage would set him right if felix would marry he would quietly slip his neck into the collar and work along with the team as useful a horse as ever was put at the wheel of a coach but felix did not seem inclined to marry he had notions about that also and was believed by one or two who knew him intimately to cherish an insane affection for some unknown damsel whose parentage education and future were not likely to assist his views in the outer world some said that he was educating this damsel for his wifemoulding her so that she might be made fit to suit his taste but augustus though he knew the secret of all this was of opinion that it would come right at last hell meet some girl in the world with a hatful of money a pretty face and a sharp tongue then hell bestow his moulded bride on a neighbouring baker with two hundred pounds for her fortuneand everybody will be happy  felix graham was by no means a handsome man he was tall and thin and his face had been slightly marked with the smallpox he stooped in his gait as he walked and was often awkward with his hands and legs but he was full of enthusiasm indomitable as far as pluck would make him so in contests of all kinds and when he talked on subjects which were near his heart there was a radiance about him which certainly might win the love of the pretty girl with the sharp tongue and the hatful of money staveley who really loved him had already selected the prize and she was no other than our friend sophia furnival the sharp tongue and the pretty face and the hatful of money would all be there but then sophia furnival was a girl who might perhaps expect in return for these things more than an ugly face which could occasionally become radiant with enthusiasm  the two men had got away from the thickness of the birmingham smoke and were seated on the top rung of a gate leading into a stubble field so far they had gone with mutual consent but further than this staveley refused to go he was seated with a cigar in his mouth graham also was smoking but he was accommodated with a short pipe  illustration the english von bauhr and his pupil  a walk before breakfast is all very well said staveley but i am not going on a pilgrimage we are four miles from the inn this minute  and for your energies that is a good deal only think that you should have been doing anything for two hours before you begin to feed  i wonder why matutinal labour should always be considered as so meritorious merely i take it because it is disagreeable  it proves that the man can make an effort  every prig who wishes to have it believed that he does more than his neighbours either burns the midnight lamp or gets up at four in the morning good wholesome work between breakfast and dinner never seems to count for anything  have you ever tried  yes i am trying now here at birmingham  not you  thats so like you graham you dont believe that anybody is attending to what is going on except yourself i mean today to take in the whole theory of italian jurisprudence  i have no doubt that you may do so with advantage i do not suppose that it is very good but it must at any rate be better than our own come let us go back to the town my pipe is finished  fill another theres a good fellow i cant afford to throw away my cigar and i hate walking and smoking you mean to assert that our whole system is bad and rotten and unjust  i mean to say that i think so  and yet we consider ourselves the greatest people in the worldor at any rate the honestest  i think we are but laws and their management have nothing to do with making people honest good laws wont make people honest nor bad laws dishonest  but a people who are dishonest in one trade will probably be dishonest in others now you go so far as to say that all english lawyers are rogues  i have never said so i believe your father to be as honest a man as ever breathed  thank you sir and staveley lifted his hat  and i would fain hope that i am an honest man myself  ah but you dont make money by it  what i do mean is this that from our love of precedent and ceremony and old usages we have retained a system which contains many of the barbarities of the feudal times and also many of its lies we try our culprit as we did in the old days of the ordeal if luck will carry him through the hot ploughshares we let him escape though we know him to be guilty we give him the advantage of every technicality and teach him to lie in his own defence if nature has not sufficiently so taught him already  you mean as to his plea of not guilty  no i dont that is little or nothing we ask him whether or no he confesses his guilt in a foolish way tending to induce him to deny it but that is not much guilt seldom will confess as long as a chance remains but we teach him to lie or rather we lie for him during the whole ceremony of his trial we think it merciful to give him chances of escape and hunt him as we do a fox in obedience to certain laws framed for his protection  and should he have no protection  none certainly as a guilty man none which may tend towards the concealing of his guilt till that be ascertained proclaimed and made apparent every mans hand should be against him  but if he is innocent  therefore let him be tried with every possible care i know you understand what i mean though you look as though you did not for the protection of his innocence let astute and good men work their best but for the concealing of his guilt let no astute or good man work at all  and you would leave the poor victim in the dock without defence  by no means let the poor victim as you call himwho in ninetynine cases out of a hundred is a rat who has been preying in our granarieslet him i say have his defenderthe defender of his possible innocence not the protector of his probable guilt it all resolves itself into this let every lawyer go into court with a mind resolved to make conspicuous to the light of day that which seems to him to be the truth a lawyer who does not do thatwho does the reverse of that has in my mind undertaken work which is unfit for a gentleman and impossible for an honest man  what a pity it is that you should not have an opportunity of rivalling von bauhr at the congress  i have no doubt that von bauhr said a great deal of the same nature and what von bauhr said will not wholly be wasted though it may not yet have reached our sublime understandings  perhaps he will vouchsafe to us a translation  it would be useless at present seeing that we cannot bring ourselves to believe it possible that a foreigner should in any respect be wiser than ourselves if any such point out to us our follies we at once claim those follies as the special evidences of our wisdom we are so selfsatisfied with our own customs that we hold up our hands with surprise at the fatuity of men who presume to point out to us their defects those practices in which we most widely depart from the broad and recognised morality of all civilised ages and countries are to us the palladiums of our jurisprudence modes of proceeding which if now first proposed to us would be thought to come direct from the devil have been made so sacred by time that they have lost all the horror of their falseness in the holiness of their age we cannot understand that other nations look upon such doings as we regard the human sacrifices of the brahmins but the fact is that we drive a juggernauts car through every assize town in the country three times a year and allow it to be dragged ruthlessly through the streets of the metropolis at all times and seasons now come back to breakfast for i wont wait here any longer seeing that these were the ideas of felix graham it is hardly a matter of wonder that such men as mr furnival and mr round should have regarded his success at the bar as doubtful  uncommon bad mutton chops these are said staveley as they sat at their meal in the coffeeroom of the imperial hotel  are they said graham they seem to me much the same as other mutton chops  they are uneatable and look at this for coffee waiter take this away and have some made fresh  yes sir said the waiter striving to escape without further comment  and waiter  yes sir and the poor overdriven functionary returned  ask them from me whether they know how to make coffee it does not consist of an unlimited supply of lukewarm water poured over an infinitesimal proportion of chicory that process timehonoured in the hotel line will not produce the beverage called coffee will you have the goodness to explain that in the bar as coming from me  yes sir said the waiter and then he was allowed to disappear  how can you give yourself so much trouble with no possible hope of an advantageous result said felix graham  thats what you weak men always say perseverance in such a course will produce results it is because we put up with bad things that hotelkeepers continue to give them to us three or four frenchmen were dining with my father yesterday at the kings head and i had to sit at the bottom of the table i declare to you that i literally blushed for my country i did indeed it was useless to say anything then but it was quite clear that there was nothing that one of them could eat at any hotel in france youll get a good dinner but were so proud that we are ashamed to take lessons and thus augustus staveley was quite as loud against his own country and as laudatory with regard to others as felix graham had been before breakfast  and so the congress went on at birmingham the fat italian from tuscany read his paper but as he though judge in his own country and reformer here in england was somewhat given to comedy this morning was not so dull as that which had been devoted to von bauhr after him judge staveley made a very elegant and some said a very eloquent speech and so that day was done many other days also wore themselves away in this process numerous addresses were read and answers made to them and the newspapers for the time were full of law the defence of our own system which was supposed to be the most remarkable for its pertinacity if not for its justice came from mr furnival who roused himself to a divine wrath for the occasion and then the famous congress at birmingham was brought to a close and all the foreigners returned to their own countries     chapter xix  the staveley family   the next two months passed by without any events which deserve our special notice unless it be that mr joseph mason and mr dockwrath had a meeting in the room of mr matthew round in bedford row mr dockwrath struggled hard to effect this without the presence of the london attorney but he struggled in vain mr round was not the man to allow any stranger to tamper with his client and mr dockwrath was forced to lower his flag before him the result was that the document or documents which had been discovered at hamworth were brought up to bedford row and dockwrath at last made up his mind that as he could not supplant matthew round he would consent to fight under him as his lieutenantor even as his sergeant or corporal if no higher position might be allowed to him  there is something in it certainly mr mason said young round but i cannot undertake to say as yet that we are in a position to prove the point  it will be proved said mr dockwrath  i confess it seems to me very clear said mr mason who by this time had been made to understand the bearings of the question it is evident that she chose that day for her date because those two persons had then been called upon to act as witnesses to that other deed  that of course is our allegation i only say that we may have some difficulty in proving it  the crafty thieving swindler exclaimed mr mason she has been sharp enough if it is as we think said round laughing and then there was nothing more done in the matter for some time to the great disgust both of mr dockwrath and mr mason old mr round had kept his promise to mr furnival or at least had done something towards keeping it he had not himself taken the matter into his own hands but he had begged his son to be cautious its not the sort of business that we care for mat said he and as for that fellow down in yorkshire i never liked him to this mat had answered that neither did he like mr mason but as the case had about it some very remarkable points it was necessary to look into it and then the matter was allowed to stand over till after christmas  we will now change the scene to noningsby the judges country seat near alston at which a party was assembled for the christmas holidays the judge was there of coursewithout his wig in which guise i am inclined to think that judges spend the more comfortable hours of their existence and there also was lady staveley her presence at home being altogether a matter of course inasmuch as she had no other home than noningsby for many years past ever since the happy day on which noningsby had been acquired she had repudiated london and the poor judge when called upon by his duties to reside there was compelled to live like a bachelor in lodgings lady staveley was a good motherly warmhearted woman who thought a great deal about her flowers and fruit believing that no one else had them so excellentmuch also about her butter and eggs which in other houses were in her opinion generally unfit to be eaten she thought also a great deal about her children who were all swansthough as she often observed with a happy sigh those of her neighbours were so uncommonly like geese but she thought most of all of her husband who in her eyes was the perfection of all manly virtues she had made up her mind that the position of a puisne judge in england was the highest which could fall to the lot of any mere mortal to become a lord chancellor or a lord chief justice or a chief baron a man must dabble with parliament politics and dirt but the benchfellows of these politicians were selected for their wisdom high conduct knowledge and discretion of all such selections that made by the late king when he chose her husband was the one which had done most honour to england and had been in all its results most beneficial to englishmen such was her creed with reference to domestic matters  the staveley young people at present were only two in number augustus namely and his sister madeline the eldest daughter was married and therefore though she spent these christmas holidays at noningsby must not be regarded as one of the noningsby family of augustus we have said enough but as i intend that madeline staveley shall to many of my readers be the most interesting personage in this story i must pause to say something of her i must say something of her and as with all women the outward and visible signs of grace and beauty are those which are thought of the most or at any rate spoken of the oftenest i will begin with her exterior attributes and that the muses may assist me in my endeavour teaching my rough hands to draw with some accuracy the delicate lines of female beauty i now make to them my humble but earnest prayer  madeline staveley was at this time about nineteen years of age that she was perfect in her beauty i cannot ask the muses to say but that she will some day become so i think the goddesses may be requested to prophesy at present she was very slight and appeared to be almost too tall for her form she was indeed above the average height of women and from her brother encountered some ridicule on this head but not the less were all her movements soft graceful and fawnlike as should be those of a young girl she was still at this time a child in heart and spirit and could have played as a child had not the instinct of a woman taught to her the expediency of a staid demeanour there is nothing among the wonders of womanhood more wonderful than this that the young mind and young hearthearts and minds young as youth can make them and in their natures as gaycan assume the gravity and discretion of threescore years and maintain it successfully before all comers and this is done not as a lesson that has been taught but as the result of an instinct implanted from the birth let us remember the mirth of our sisters in our homes and their altered demeanours when those homes were opened to strangers and remember also that this change had come from the inward working of their own feminine natures  but i am altogether departing from madeline staveleys external graces it was a pity almost that she should ever have become grave because with her it was her smile that was so lovely she smiled with her whole face there was at such moments a peculiar laughing light in her gray eyes which inspired one with an earnest desire to be in her confidence she smiled with her soft cheek the light tints of which would become a shade more pink from the excitement as they softly rippled into dimples she smiled with her forehead which would catch the light from her eyes and arch itself in its glory but above all she smiled with her mouth just showing but hardly showing the beauty of the pearls within i never saw the face of a woman whose mouth was equal in pure beauty in beauty that was expressive of feeling to that of madeline staveley many have i seen with a richer lip with a more luxurious curve much more tempting as baits to the villainy and rudeness of man but never one that told so much by its own mute eloquence of a womans happy heart and a womans happy beauty it was lovely as i have said in its mirth but if possible it was still more lovely in its woe for then the lips would separate and the breath would come and in the emotion of her suffering the life of her beauty would be unrestrained  her face was oval and some might say that it was almost too thin they might say so till they knew it well but would never say so when they did so know it her complexion was not clear though it would be wrong to call her a brunette her face and forehead were never brown but yet she could not boast the pure pink and the pearly white which go to the formation of a clear complexion for myself i am not sure that i love a clear complexion pink and white alone will not give that hue which seems best to denote light and life and to tell of a mind that thinks and of a heart that feels i can name no colour in describing the soft changing tints of madeline staveleys face but i will make bold to say that no man ever found it insipid or inexpressive  and now what remains for me to tell her nose was grecian but perhaps a little too wide at the nostril to be considered perfect in its chiselling her hair was soft and brownthat dark brown which by some lights is almost black but she was not a girl whose loveliness depended much upon her hair with some women it is their great charmneæras who love to sit half sleeping in the shadebut it is a charm that possesses no powerful eloquence all beauty of a high order should speak and madelines beauty was ever speaking and now that i have said that i believe that i have told all that may be necessary to place her outward form before the inward eyes of my readers  in commencing this description i said that i would begin with her exterior but it seems to me now that in speaking of these i have sufficiently noted also that which was within of her actual thoughts and deeds up to this period it is not necessary for our purposes that anything should be told but of that which she might probably think or might possibly do a fair guess may i hope be made from that which has been already written  such was the staveley family those of their guests whom it is necessary that i should now name have been already introduced to us miss furnival was there as was also her father he had not intended to make any prolonged stay at noningsbyat least so he had said in his own drawingroom but nevertheless he had now been there for a week and it seemed probable that he might stay over christmasday and felix graham was there he had been asked with a special purpose by his friend augustus as we already have heard in order namely that he might fall in love with sophia furnival and by the aid of her supposed hatful of money avoid the evils which would otherwise so probably be the consequence of his highly impracticable turn of mind the judge was not averse to felix graham but as he himself was a man essentially practical in all his views it often occurred that in his mild kindly way he ridiculed the young barrister and sir peregrine orme was there being absent from home as on a very rare occasion and with him of course were mrs orme and his grandson young perry was making or was prepared to make somewhat of a prolonged stay at noningsby he had a horse there with him for the hunting which was changed now and again his groom going backwards and forwards between that place and the cleeve sir peregrine however intended to return before christmas and mrs orme would go with him he had come for four days which for him had been a long absence from home and at the end of the four days he would be gone  they were all sitting in the diningroom round the luncheontable on a hopelessly wet morning listening to a lecture from the judge on the abomination of eating meat in the middle of the day when a servant came behind young ormes chair and told him that mr mason was in the breakfastparlour and wished to see him  who wishes to see you said the baronet in a tone of surprise he had caught the name and thought at the moment that it was the owner of groby park  lucius mason said peregrine getting up i wonder what he can want me for  oh lucius mason said the grandfather since the discourse about agriculture he was not personally much attached even to lucius but for his mothers sake he could be forgiven  pray ask him into lunch said lady staveley something had been said about lady mason since the ormes had been at noningsby and the staveley family were prepared to regard her with sympathy and if necessary with the right hand of fellowship  he is the great agriculturist is he not said augustus bring him in by all means there is no knowing how much we may not learn before dinner on such a day as this  he is an ally of mine and you must not laugh at him said miss furnival who was sitting next to augustus  but lucius mason did not come in young orme remained with him for about a quarter of an hour and then returned to the room declaring with rather a serious face that he must ride to hamworth and back before dinner  are you going with young mason asked his grandfather  yes sir he wishes me to do something for him at hamworth and i cannot well refuse him  you are not going to fight a duel said lady staveley holding up her hands in horror as the idea came across her brain  a duel screamed mrs orme oh peregrine  there can be nothing of the sort said the judge i should think that young mason is not so foolish and i am sure that peregrine orme is not  i have not heard of anything of the kind said peregrine laughing  promise me peregrine said his mother say that you promise me  my dearest mother i have no more thought of it than you haveindeed i may say not so much  you will be back to dinner said lady staveley  oh yes certainly  and tell mr mason said the judge that if he will return with you we shall be delighted to see him  the errand which took peregrine orme off to hamworth will be explained in the next chapter but his going led to a discussion among the gentlemen after dinner as to the position in which lady mason was now placed there was no longer any possibility of keeping the matter secret seeing that mr dockwrath had taken great care that every one in hamworth should hear of it he had openly declared that evidence would now be adduced to prove that sir joseph masons widow had herself forged the will and had said to many people that mr mason of groby had determined to indict her for forgery this had gone so far that lucius had declared as openly that he would prosecute the attorney for a libel and dockwrath had sent him word that he was quite welcome to do so if he pleased  it is a scandalous state of things said sir peregrine speaking with much enthusiasm and no little temper on the subject here is a question which was settled twenty years ago to the satisfaction of every one who knew anything of the case and now it is brought up again that two men may wreak their vengeance on a poor widow they are not men they are brutes  but why does she not bring an action against this attorney said young staveley  such actions do not easily lie said his father it may be quite true that dockwrath may have said all manner of evil things against this lady and yet it may be very difficult to obtain evidence of a libel it seems to me from what i have heard that the man himself wishes such an action to be brought  and think of the state of poor lady mason said mr furnival conceive the misery which it would occasion her if she were dragged forward to give evidence on such a matter  i believe it would kill her said sir peregrine  the best means of assisting her would be to give her some countenance said the judge and from all that i can hear of her she deserves it  she does deserve it said sir peregrine and she shall have it the people at hamworth shall see at any rate that my daughter regards her as a fit associate i am happy to say that she is coming to the cleeve on my return home and that she will remain there till after christmas  it is a very singular case said felix graham who had been thinking over the position of the lady hitherto in silence  indeed it is said the judge and it shows how careful men should be in all matters relating to their wills the will and the codicil as it appears are both in the handwriting of the widow who acted as an amanuensis not only for her husband but for the attorney that fact does not in my mind produce suspicion but i do not doubt that it has produced all this suspicion in the mind of the claimant the attorney who advised sir joseph should have known better  it is one of those cases continued graham in which the sufferer should be protected by the very fact of her own innocence no lawyer should consent to take up the cudgels against her  i am afraid that she will not escape persecution from any such professional chivalry said the judge  all that is moonshine said mr furnival  and moonshine is a very pretty thing if you were not too much afraid of the night air to go and look at it if the matter be as you all say i do think that any gentleman would disgrace himself by lending a hand against her  upon my word sir i fully agree with you said sir peregrine bowing to felix graham over his glass  i will take permission to think sir peregrine said mr furnival that you would not agree with mr graham if you had given to the matter much deep consideration  i have not had the advantage of a professional education said sir peregrine again bowing and on this occasion addressing himself to the lawyer but i cannot see how any amount of learning should alter my views on such a subject  truth and honour cannot be altered by any professional arrangements said graham and then the conversation turned away from lady mason and directed itself to those great corrections of legal reform which had been debated during the past autumn  the orley farm case though in other forms and different language was being discussed also in the drawingroom i have not seen much of her said sophia furnival who by some art had usurped the most prominent part in the conversation but what i did see i liked much she was at the cleeve when i was staying there if you remember mrs orme mrs orme said that she did remember  and we went over to orley farm poor lady i think everybody ought to notice her under such circumstances papa i know would move heaven and earth for her if he could  i cannot move the heaven or the earth either said lady staveley but if i thought that my calling on her would be any satisfaction to her  it would lady staveley said mrs orme it would be a great satisfaction to her i cannot tell you how warmly i regard her nor how perfectly sir peregrine esteems her  we will drive over there next week madeline  do mamma everybody says that she is very nice  it will be so kind of you lady staveley said sophia furnival  next week she will be staying with us said mrs orme and that would save you three miles you know and we should be so glad to see you  lady staveley declared that she would do both she would call at the cleeve and again at orley farm after lady masons return home she well understood though she could not herself then say so that the greater part of the advantage to be received from her kindness would be derived from its being known at hamworth that the staveley carriage had been driven up to lady masons door  her son is very clever is he not said madeline addressing herself to miss furnival  sophia shrugged her shoulders and put her head on one side with a pretty grace yes i believe so people say so but who is to tell whether a young man be clever or no  but some are so much more clever than others dont you think so  oh yes as some girls are so much prettier than others but if mr mason were to talk greek to you you would not think him clever  i should not understand him you know  of course not but you would understand that he was a blockhead to show off his learning in that way you dont want him to be clever you see you only want him to be agreeable  i dont know that i want either the one or the other  do you not i know i do i think that young men in society are bound to be agreeable and that they should not be there if they do not know how to talk pleasantly and to give something in return for all the trouble we take for them  i dont take any trouble for them said madeline laughing  surely you must if you only think of it all ladies do and so they ought but if in return for that a man merely talks greek to me i for my part do not think that the bargain is fairly carried out  i declare you will make me quite afraid of mr mason  oh he never talks greekat least he never has to me i rather like him but what i mean is this that i do not think a man a bit more likely to be agreeable because he has the reputation of being very clever for my part i rather think that i like stupid young men  oh do you then now i shall know what you think of augustus we think he is very clever but i do not know any man who makes himself more popular with young ladies  ah then he is a gay deceiver  he is gay enough but i am sure he is no deceiver a man may make himself nice to young ladies without deceiving any of them may he not  you must not take me au pied de la lettre miss staveley or i shall be lost of course he may but when young gentlemen are so very nice young ladies are so apt to  to what  not to fall in love with them exactly but to be ready to be fallen in love with and then if a man does do it he is a deceiver i declare it seems to me that we dont allow them a chance of going right  i think that augustus manages to steer through such difficulties very cleverly  he sails about in the open sea touching at all the most lovely capes and promontories and is never driven on shore by stress of weather what a happy sailor he must be  i think he is happy and that he makes others so  he ought to be made an admiral at once but we shall hear some day of his coming to a terrible shipwreck  oh i hope not  he will return home in desperate plight with only two planks left together with all his glory and beauty broken and crumpled to pieces against some rock that he has despised in his pride  why do you prophesy such terrible things for him  i mean that he will get married  get married of course he will thats just what we all want you dont call that a shipwreck do you  its the sort of shipwreck that these very gallant barks have to encounter  you dont mean that hell marry a disagreeable wife  oh no not in the least i only mean to say that like other sons of adam he will have to strike his colours i dare say if the truth were known he has done so already  i am sure he has not  i dont at all ask to know his secrets and i should look upon you as a very bad sister if you told them  but i am sure he has not got anyof that kind  would he tell you if he had  oh i hope so any serious secret i am sure he ought for i am always thinking about him  and would you tell him your secrets  i have none  but when you have will you do so  will i well yes i think so but a girl has no such secret she continued to say after pausing for a moment none generally at least which she tells even to herself till the time comes in which she tells it to all whom she really loves and then there was another pause for a moment  i am not quite so sure of that said miss furnival after which the gentlemen came into the drawingroom  augustus staveley had gone to work in a manner which he conceived to be quite systematic having before him the praiseworthy object of making a match between felix graham and sophia furnival by george graham he had said the finest girl in london is coming down to noningsby upon my word i think she is  and brought there expressly for your delectation i suppose  oh no not at all indeed she is not exactly in my style she is tootootooin point of fact too much of a girl for me she has lots of money and is very clever and all that kind of thing  i never knew you so humble before  i am not joking at all she is a daughter of old furnivals whom bytheby i hate as i do poison why my governor has him down at noningsby i cant guess but i tell you what old fellow he can give his daughter fiveandtwenty thousand pounds think of that master brook but felix graham was a man who could not bring himself to think much of such things on the spur of the moment and when he was introduced to sophia he did not seem to be taken with her in any wonderful way  augustus had asked his mother to help him but she had laughed at him it would be a splendid arrangement he had said with energy nonsense gus she had answered you should always let those things take their chance all i will ask of you is that you dont fall in love with her yourself i dont think her family would be nice enough for you  but felix graham certainly was ungrateful for the friendship spent upon him and so his friend felt it augustus had contrived to whisper into the ladys ear that mr graham was the cleverest young man now rising at the bar and as far as she was concerned some amount of intimacy might at any rate have been produced but he graham himself would not put himself forward i will pique him into it said augustus to himself and therefore when on this occasion they came into the drawingroom staveley immediately took a vacant seat beside miss furnival with the very friendly object which he had proposed to himself  there was great danger in this for miss furnival was certainly handsome and augustus staveley was very susceptible but what will not a man go through for his friend i hope we are to have the honour of your company as far as monkton grange the day we meet there he said the hounds were to meet at monkton grange some seven miles from noningsby and all the sportsmen from the house were to be there  i shall be delighted said sophia that is to say if a seat in the carriage can be spared for me  but well mount you i know that you are a horsewoman in answer to which miss furnival confessed that she was a horsewoman and owned also to having brought a habit and hat with her  that will be delightful madeline will ride also and you will meet the miss tristrams they are the famous horsewomen of this part of the country  you dont mean that they go after the dogs across the hedges  indeed they do  and does miss staveley do that  oh nomadeline is not good at a fivebarred gate and would make but a very bad hand at a double ditch if you are inclined to remain among the tame people she will be true to your side  i shall certainly be one of the tame people mr staveley  i rather think i shall be with you myself i have only one horse that will jump well and graham will ride him bytheby miss furnival what do you think of my friend graham  think of him am i bound to have thought anything about him by this time  of course you areor at any rate of course you have i have no doubt that you have composed in your own mind an essay on the character of everybody here people who think at all always do  do they my essay upon him then is a very short one  but perhaps not the less correct on that account you must allow me to read it  like all my other essays of that kind mr staveley it has been composed solely for my own use and will be kept quite private  i am so sorry for that for i intended to propose a bargain to you if you would have shown me some of your essays i would have been equally liberal with some of mine and in this way before the evening was over augustus staveley and miss furnival became very good friends  upon my word she is a very clever girl he said afterwards as young orme and graham were sitting with him in an outside room which had been fitted up for smoking  and uncommonly handsome said peregrine  and they say shell have lots of money said graham after all staveley perhaps you could not do better  shes not my style at all said he but of course a man is obliged to be civil to girls in his own house and then they all went to bed     chapter xx  mr dockwrath in his own office   in the conversation which had taken place after dinner at noningsby with regard to the masons peregrine orme took no part but his silence had not arisen from any want of interest on the subject he had been over to hamworth that day on a very special mission regarding it and as he was not inclined to speak of what he had then seen and done he held his tongue altogether  i want you to do me a great favour lucius had said to him when the two were together in the breakfastparlour at noningsby but i am afraid it will give you some trouble  i shant mind that said peregrine if thats all  you have heard of this row about joseph mason and my mother it has been so talked of that i fear you must have heard it  about the lawsuit oh yes it has certainly been spoken of at the cleeve  of course it has all the world is talking of it now there is a man named dockwrath in hamworth and then he went on to explain how it had reached him from various quarters that mr dockwrath was accusing his mother of the crime of forgery how he had endeavoured to persuade his mother to indict the man for libel how his mother had pleaded to him with tears in her eyes that she found it impossible to go through such an ordeal and how he therefore had resolved to go himself to mr dockwrath but said he i must have some one with me some gentleman whom i can trust and therefore i have ridden over to ask you to accompany me as far as hamworth  i suppose he is not a man that you can kick said peregrine  i am afraid not said lucius hes over forty years old and has dozens of children  and then he is such a low beast said peregrine  i have no idea of kicking him but i think it would be wrong to allow him to go on saying these frightful things of my mother without showing him that we are not afraid of him upon this the two young men got on horseback and riding into hamworth put their horses up at the inn  and now i suppose we might as well go at once said peregrine with a very serious face  yes said the other theres nothing to delay us i cannot tell you how much obliged i am to you for coming with me  oh dont say anything about that of course im only too happy but all the same he felt that his heart was beating and that he was a little nervous had he been called upon to go in and thrash somebody he would have been quite at home but he did not feel at his ease in making an inimical visit to an attorneys office  it would have been wise perhaps if in this matter lucius had submitted himself to lady masons wishes on the previous evening they had talked the matter over with much serious energy lucius had been told in the streets of hamworth by an intermeddling little busybody of an apothecary that it behoved him to do something as mr dockwrath was making grievous accusations against his mother lucius had replied haughtily that he and his mother would know how to protect themselves and the apothecary had retreated resolving to spread the report everywhere lucius on his return home had declared to the unfortunate lady that she had now no alternative left to her she must bring an action against the man or at any rate put the matter into the hands of a lawyer with a view of ascertaining whether she could do so with any chance of success if she could not she must then make known her reason for remaining quiet in answer to this lady mason had begun by praying her son to allow the matter to pass by  but it will not pass by lucius had said  yes dearest if we leave it it willin a month or two we can do nothing by interference remember the old saying you cannot touch pitch without being defiled  but lucius had replied almost with anger that the pitch had already touched him and that he was defiled i cannot consent to hold the property he had said unless something be done and then his mother had bowed her head as she sat and had covered her face with her hands  i shall go to the man myself lucius had declared with energy  as your mother lucius i implore you not to do so she had said to him through her tears  i must either do that or leave the country it is impossible that i should live here hearing such things said of you and doing nothing to clear your name to this she had made no actual reply and now he was standing at the attorneys door about to do that which he had threatened  they found mr dockwrath sitting at his desk at the other side of which was seated his clerk he had not yet promoted himself to the dignity of a private office but generally used his parlour as such when he was desirous of seeing his clients without disturbance on this occasion however when he saw young mason enter he made no offer to withdraw his hat was on his head as he sat on his stool and he did not even take it off as he returned the stiff salutation of his visitor keep your hat on your head mr orme he said as peregrine was about to take his off well gentlemen what can i do for you  lucius looked at the clerk and felt that there would be great difficulty in talking about his mother before such a witness we wish to see you in private mr dockwrath for a few minutesif it be convenient  is not this private enough said dockwrath there is no one here but my confidential clerk  if you could make it convenient began lucius  well then mr mason i cannot make it convenient and there is the long and the short of it you have brought mr orme with you to hear what youve got to say and i choose that my clerk shall remain by to hear it also seeing the position in which you stand there is no knowing what may come of such an interview as this  in what position do i stand sir  if you dont know mr mason i am not going to tell you i feel for you i do upon my word i feel for you and i pity you mr dockwrath as he thus expressed his commiseration was sitting with his high chair tilted back with his knees against the edge of his desk with his hat almost down upon his nose as he looked at his visitors from under it and he amused himself by cutting up a quill pen into small pieces with his penknife it was not pleasant to be pitied by such a man as that and so peregrine orme conceived  sir that is nonsense said lucius i require no pity from you or from any man  i dont suppose there is one in all hamworth that does not feel for you said dockwrath  he means to be impudent said peregrine you had better come to the point with him at once  no i dont mean to be impudent young gentleman a man may speak his own mind in his own house i suppose without any impudence you wouldnt stand cap in hand to me if i were to go down to you at the cleeve  i have come here to ask of you said lucius whether it be true that you are spreading these reports about the town with reference to lady mason if you are a man you will tell me the truth  well i rather think i am a man  it is necessary that lady mason should be protected from such infamous falsehoods and it may be necessary to bring the matter into a court of law  you may be quite easy about that mr mason it will be necessary  as it may be necessary i wish to know whether you will acknowledge that these reports have come from you  you want me to give evidence against myself well for once in a way i dont mind if i do the reports have come from me now is that manly and mr dockwrath as he spoke pushed his hat somewhat off his nose and looked steadily across into the face of his opponent  lucius mason was too young for the task which he had undertaken and allowed himself to be disconcerted he had expected that the lawyer would deny the charge and was prepared for what he would say and do in such a case but now he was not prepared  how on earth could you bring yourself to be guilty of such villainy said young orme  hightytighty what are you talking about young man the fact is you do not know what you are talking about but as i have a respect for your grandfather and for your mother i will give you and them a piece of advice gratis dont let them be too thick with lady mason till they see how this matter goes  mr dockwrath said lucius you are a mean low vile scoundrel  very well sir adams just take a note of that dont mind what mr orme said i can easily excuse him hell know the truth before long and then hell beg my pardon  ill take my oath i look upon you as the greatest miscreant that ever i met said peregrine who was of course bound to support his friend  youll change your mind mr orme before long and then youll find that you have met a worse miscreant than i am did you put down those words adams  them as mr mason spoke yes ive got them down  read them said the master  and the clerk read them mr dockwrath you are a mean low vile scoundrel  and now young gentlemen if you have got nothing else to observe as i am rather busy perhaps you will allow me to wish you good morning  very well mr dockwrath said mason you may be sure that you will hear further from me  we shall be sure to hear of each other there is no doubt in the world about that said the attorney and then the two young men withdrew with an unexpressed feeling in the mind of each of them that they had not so completely got the better of their antagonist as the justice of their case demanded  they then remounted their horses and orme accompanied his friend as far as orley farm from whence he got into the alston road through the cleeve grounds and what do you intend to do now said peregrine as soon as they were mounted  i shall employ a lawyer said he on my own footing not my mothers lawyer but some one else then i suppose i shall be guided by his advice had he done this before he made his visit to mr dockwrath perhaps it might have been better all this sat very heavily on poor peregrines mind and therefore as the company were talking about lady mason after dinner he remained silent listening but not joining in the conversation  the whole of that evening lucius and his mother sat together saying nothing there was not absolutely any quarrel between them but on this terrible subject there was an utter want of accordance and almost of sympathy it was not that lucius had ever for a moment suspected his mother of aught that was wrong had he done so he might perhaps have been more gentle towards her in his thoughts and words he not only fully trusted her but he was quite fixed in his confidence that nothing could shake either her or him in their rights but under these circumstances he could not understand how she could consent to endure without resistance the indignities which were put upon her she should combat them for my sake if not for her own he said to himself over and over again and he had said so also to her but his words had had no effect  she on the other hand felt that he was cruel to her she was weighed down almost to the ground by these sufferings which had fallen on her and yet he would not be gentle and soft to her she could have borne it all she thought if he would have borne with her she still hoped that if she remained quiet no further trial would take place at any rate this might be so that it would be so she had the assurance of mr furnival and yet all this evil which she dreaded worse than death was to be precipitated on her by her son so they sat through the long evening speechless each seated with the pretence of reading but neither of them capable of the attention which a book requires  he did not tell her then that he had been with mr dockwrath but she knew by his manner that he had taken some terrible step she waited patiently the whole evening hoping that he would tell her but when the hour came for her to go up to her room he had told her nothing if he now were to turn against her that would be worse than all she went up to her room and sat herself down to think all that passed through her brain on that night i may not now tell but the grief which pressed on her at this moment with peculiar weight was the selfwill and obstinacy of her boy she said to herself that she would be willing now to dieto give back her life at once if such might be gods pleasure but that her son should bring down her hairs with shame and sorrow to the grave in that thought there was a bitterness of agony which she knew not how to endure  the next morning at breakfast he still remained silent and his brow was still black lucius she said did you do anything in that matter yesterday  yes mother i saw mr dockwrath  well  i took peregrine orme with me that i might have a witness and i then asked him whether he had spread these reports he acknowledged that he had done so and i told him that he was a villain  upon hearing this she uttered a long low sigh but she said nothing what use could there now be in her saying aught her look of agony went to the young mans heart but he still thought that he had been right mother he continued to say i am very sorry to grieve you in this wayvery sorry but i could not hold up my head in hamworthi could not hold up my head anywhere if i heard these things said of you and did not resent it  ah lucius if you knew the weakness of a woman  and therefore you should let me bear it all there is nothing i would not suffer no cost i would not undergo rather than you should endure all this if you would only say that you would leave it to me  but it cannot be left to you i have gone to a lawyer to mr furnival why will you not permit that i should act in it as he thinks best can you not believe that that will be the best for both of us  if you wish it i will see mr furnival  lady mason did not wish that but she was obliged so far to yield as to say that he might do so if he would her wish was that he should bear it all and say nothing it was not that she was indifferent to good repute among her neighbours or that she was careless as to what the apothecaries and attorneys said of her but it was easier for her to bear the evil than to combat it the ormes and the furnivals would support her they and suchlike persons would acknowledge her weakness and would know that from her would not be expected such loud outbursting indignation as might be expected from a man she had calculated the strength of her own weakness and thought that she might still be supported by thatif only her son would so permit  it was two days after this that lucius was allowed the honour of a conference by appointment with the great lawyer and at the expiration of an hours delay he was shown into the room by mr crabwitz and crabwitz said the barrister before he addressed himself to his young friend just run your eye over those papers and let mr bideawhile have them tomorrow morning and crabwitz  yes sir  that opinion of sir richards in the ahatualpaca mining companyi have not seen it have i  its all ready mr furnival  i will look at it in five minutes and now my young friend what can i do for you  it was quite clear from mr furnivals tone and manner that he did not mean to devote much time to lucius mason and that he was not generally anxious to hold any conversation with him on the subject in question such indeed was the case mr furnival was determined to pull lady mason out of the sea of trouble into which she had fallen let the effort cost him what it might but he did not wish to do so by the instrumentality or even with the aid of her son  mr furnival began mason i want to ask your advice about these dreadful reports which are being spread on every side in hamworth about my mother  if you will allow me then to say so i think that the course which you should pursue is very simple indeed there is i think only one course which you can pursue with proper deference to your mothers feelings  and what is that mr furnival  do nothing and say nothing i fear from what i have heard that you have already done and said much more than was prudent  but how am i to hear such things as these spoken of my own mother  that depends on the people by whom the things are spoken in this world if we meet a chimneysweep in the path we do not hustle with him for the right of way your mother is going next week to the cleeve it was only yesterday that i heard that the noningsby people are going to call on her you can hardly i suppose desire for your mother better friends than such as these and can you not understand why such people gather to her at this moment if you can understand it you will not trouble yourself to interfere much more with mr dockwrath  there was a rebuke in this which lucius mason was forced to endure but nevertheless as he retreated disconcerted from the barristers chambers he could not bring himself to think it right that such calumny should be borne without resistance he knew but little as yet of the ordinary life of gentlemen in england but he did knowso at least he thoughtthat it was the duty of a son to shield his mother from insult and libel     chapter xxi  christmas in harley street   it seems singular to me myself considering the idea which i have in my own mind of the character of lady staveley that i should be driven to declare that about this time she committed an unpardonable offence not only against good nature but also against the domestic proprieties but i am driven so to say although she herself was of all women the most goodnatured and most domestic for she asked mr furnival to pass his christmasday at noningsby and i find it impossible to forgive her that offence against the poor wife whom in that case he must leave alone by her desolate hearth she knew that he was a married man as well as i do sophia who had a proper regard for the domestic peace of her parents and who could have been happy at noningsby without a fathers care not unfrequently spoke of her so that her existence in harley street might not be forgotten by the staveleysexplaining however as she did so that her dear mother never left her own fireside in winter so that no suspicion might be entertained that an invitation was desired for her also nevertheless in spite of all this on two separate occasions did lady staveley say to mr furnival that he might as well prolong his visit over christmas  and yet lady staveley was not attached to mr furnival with any peculiar warmth of friendship but she was one of those women whose foolish hearts will not allow themselves to be controlled in the exercise of their hospitality her nature demanded of her that she should ask a guest to stay she would not have allowed a dog to depart from her house at this season of the year without suggesting to him that he had better take his christmas bone in her yard it was for mr furnival to adjust all matters between himself and his wife he was not bound to accept the invitation because she gave it but she finding him there already present in the house did feel herself bound to give itfor which offence as i have said before i cannot bring myself to forgive her  at his sin in staying away from home or ratheras far as the story has yet carried usin thinking that he would do so i am by no means so much surprised an angry illpleased wife is no pleasant companion for a gentleman on a long evening for those who have managed that things shall run smoothly over the domestic rug there is no happier time of life than these long candlelight hours of home and silence no spoken content or uttered satisfaction is necessary the fact that is felt is enough for peace but when the fact is not felt when the fact is by no means there when the thoughts are running in a direction altogether different when bitter grievances from one to the other fill the heart rather than memories of mutual kindness then i say those long candlelight hours of home and silence are not easy of endurance mr furnival was a man who chose to be the master of his own destiny so at least to himself he boasted and therefore when he found himself encountered by black looks and occasionally by sullen words he declared to himself that he was illused and that he would not bear it since the domestic rose would no longer yield him honey he would seek his sweets from the stray honeysuckle on which there grew no thorns  mr furnival was no coward he was not one of those men who wrong their wives by their absence and then prolong their absence because they are afraid to meet their wives his resolve was to be free himself and to be free without complaint from her he would have it so that he might remain out of his own house for a month at the time and then return to it for a weekat any rate without outward bickerings i have known other men who have dreamed of such a state of things but at this moment i can remember none who have brought their dream to bear  mr furnival had written to his wifenot from noningsby but from some provincial town probably situated among the essex marshessaying various things and among others that he should not as he thought be at home at christmasday mrs furnival had remarked about a fortnight since that christmasday was nothing to her now and the base man for it was base had hung upon this poor sorehearted word an excuse for remaining away from home there are lawyers of repute staying at noningsby he had said with whom it is very expedient that i should remain at this present crisiswhen yet has there been no crisis present to a man who has wanted an excuseand therefore i may probably stayand so on who does not know the false mixture of excuse and defiance which such a letter is sure to maintain the crafty words which may be taken as adequate reason if the receiver be timid enough so to receive them or as a noisy gauntlet thrown to the ground if there be spirit there for the picking of it up such letter from his little borough in the essex marshes did mr furnival write to the partner of his cares and there was still sufficient spirit left for the picking up of the gauntlet i shall be home tomorrow the letter had gone on to say but i will not keep you waiting for dinner as my hours are always so uncertain i shall be at my chambers till late and will be with you before tea i will then return to alston on the following morning there was at any rate good courage in this on the part of mr furnivalgreat courage but with it coldness of heart dishonesty of purpose and black ingratitude had she not given everything to him  mrs furnival when she got the letter was not alone there said she throwing it over to a lady who sat on the other side of the fireplace handling a loose sprawling mass of not very clean crochetwork i knew he would stay away on christmasday i told you so  i didnt think it possible said miss biggs rolling up the big ball of soiled cotton that she might read mr furnivals letter at her leisure i didnt really think it possibleon christmasday surely mrs furnival he cant mean christmasday dear dear dear and then to throw it in your face in that way that you said you didnt care about it  of course i said so answered mrs furnival i was not going to ask him to come home as a favour  not to make a favour of it of course not this was miss biggs from  i am afraid if i tell the truth i must say that she came from red lion square and yet nothing could be more respectable than miss biggs her father had been a partner with an uncle of mrs furnivals and when kitty blacker had given herself and her young prettinesses to the hardworking lawyer martha biggs had stood at the altar with her then just seventeen years of age and had promised to her all manner of success for her coming life martha biggs had never not even then been pretty but she had been very faithful she had not been a favourite with mr furnival having neither wit nor grace to recommend her and therefore in the old happy days of keppel street she had been kept in the background but now in this present time of her adversity mrs furnival found the benefit of having a trusty friend  if he likes better to be with these people down at alston i am sure it is the same to me said the injured wife  but theres nobody special at alston is there asked miss biggs whose soul sighed for a tale more piquant than one of mere general neglect she knew that her friend had dreadful suspicions but mrs furnival had never as yet committed herself by uttering the name of any woman as her rival miss biggs thought that a time had now come in which the strength of their mutual confidence demanded that such name should be uttered it could not be expected that she should sympathise with generalities for ever she longed to hate to reprobate and to shudder at the actual name of the wretch who had robbed her friend of a husbands heart and therefore she asked the question theres nobody special at alston is there  now mrs furnival knew to a furlong the distance from noningsby to orley farm and knew also that the station at hamworth was only twentyfive minutes from that at alston she gave no immediate answer but threw up her head and shook her nostrils as though she were preparing for war and then miss martha biggs knew that there was somebody special at alston between such old friends why should not the name be mentioned  on the following day the two ladies dined at six and then waited tea patiently till ten had the thirst of a desert been raging within that drawingroom and had tea been within immediate call those ladies would have died ere they would have asked for it before his return he had said he would be home to tea and they would have waited for him had it been till four oclock in the morning let the female married victim ever make the most of such positive wrongs as providence may vouchsafe to her had mrs furnival ordered tea on this evening before her husbands return she would have been a woman blind to the advantages of her own position at ten the wheels of mr furnivals cab were heard and the faces of both the ladies prepared themselves for the encounter  well kitty how are you said mr furnival entering the room with his arms prepared for a premeditated embrace what miss biggs with you i did not know how do you do miss biggs and mr furnival extended his hand to the lady they both looked at him and they could tell from the brightness of his eye and from the colour of his nose that he had been dining at his club and that the bin with the precious cork had been visited on his behalf  yes my dear its rather lonely being here in this big room all by oneself so long so i asked martha biggs to come over to me i suppose theres no harm in that  oh if im in the way began miss biggs or if mr furnival is going to stay at home for long  you are not in the way and i am not going to stay at home for long said mr furnival speaking with a voice that was perhaps a little thickonly a very little thick no wife on good terms with her husband would have deigned to notice even in her own mind an amount of thickness of voice which was so very inconsiderable but mrs furnival at the present moment did notice it  oh i did not know said miss biggs  you know now said mr furnival whose ear at once appreciated the hostility of tone which had been assumed  you need not be rude to my friend after she has been waiting tea for you till near eleven oclock said mrs furnival it is nothing to me but you should remember that she is not used to it  i wasnt rude to your friend and who asked you to wait tea till near eleven oclock it is only just ten now if that signifies  you expressly desired me to wait tea mr furnival i have got your letter and will show it you if you wish it  nonsense i just said i should be home  of course you just said you would be home and so we waited and its not nonsense and i declare never mind martha dont mind me theres a good creature i shall get over it soon and then fat solid goodhumoured mrs furnival burst out into an hysterical fit of sobbing there was a welcome for a man on his return to his home after a days labour  miss biggs immediately got up and came round behind the drawingroom table to her friends head be calm mrs furnival she said do be calm and then you will be better soon here is the hartshorn  it doesnt matter martha never mind leave me alone sobbed the poor woman  may i be excused for asking what is really the matter said mr furnival for ill be whipped if i know miss biggs looked at him as if she thought that he ought to be whipped  i wonder you ever come near the place at all i do said mrs furnival  what place asked mr furnival  this house in which i am obliged to live by myself without a soul to speak to unless when martha biggs comes here  which would be much more frequent only that i know i am not welcome by everybody  i know that you hate it how can i help knowing itand you hate me too i know you doand i believe you would be glad if you need never come back here at all i do dont martha leave me alone i dont want all that fuss there i can bear it now whatever it is do you choose to have your tea mr furnival or do you wish to keep the servants waiting out of their beds all night  d the servants said mr furnival  oh laws exclaimed miss biggs jumping up out of her chair with her hands and fingers outstretched as though never never in her life before had her ears been wounded by such wicked words as those  mr furnival i am ashamed of you said his wife with gathered calmness of stern reproach  mr furnival was very wrong to swear doubly wrong to swear before his wife trebly wrong to swear before a lady visitor but it must be confessed that there was provocation that he was at this present period of his life behaving badly to his wife must be allowed but on this special evening he had intended to behave well the woman had sought a ground of quarrel against him and had driven him on till he had forgotten himself in his present afterdinner humour when a man is maintaining a whole household on his own shoulders and working hard to maintain it well it is not right that he should be brought to book because he keeps the servants up half an hour later than usual to wash the teathings it is very proper that the idle members of the establishment should conform to hours but these hours must give way to his requirements in those old days of which we have spoken so often he might have had his tea at twelve one two or three without a murmur though their staff of servants then was scanty enough there was never a difficulty then in supplying any such want for him if no other pair of hands could boil the kettle there was one pair of hands there which no amount of such work on his behalf could tire but now because he had come in for his tea at ten oclock he was asked if he intended to keep the servants out of their beds all night  oh laws said miss biggs jumping up from her chair as though she had been electrified  mr furnival did not think it consistent with his dignity to keep up any dispute in the presence of miss biggs and therefore sat himself down in his accustomed chair without further speech would you wish to have tea now mr furnival asked his wife again putting considerable stress upon the word now  i dont care about it said he  and i am sure i dont at this late hour said miss biggs but so tired as you are dear  never mind me martha as for myself i shall take nothing now and then they all sat without a word for the space of some five minutes if you like to go martha said mrs furnival dont mind waiting for me  oh very well and then miss biggs took her bedcandle and left the room was it not hard upon her that she should be forced to absent herself at this moment when the excitement of the battle was about to begin in earnest her footsteps lingered as she slowly retreated from the drawingroom door and for one instant she absolutely paused standing still with eager ears it was but for an instant and then she went on up stairs out of hearing and sitting herself down by her bedside allowed the battle to rage in her imagination  mr furnival would have sat there silent till his wife had gone also and so the matter would have terminated for that eveninghad she so willed it but she had been thinking of her miseries and having come to some sort of resolution to speak of them openly what time could she find more appropriate for doing so than the present tom she saidand as she spoke there was still a twinkle of the old love in her eye we are not going on together as well as we should donot lately would it not be well to make a change before it is too late  what change he asked not exactly in an ill humour but with a husky thick voice he would have preferred now that she should have followed her friend to bed  i do not want to dictate to you tom but oh tom if you knew how wretched i am  what makes you wretched  because you leave me all alone because you care more for other people than you do for me because you never like to be at home never if you can possibly help it you know you dont you are always away now upon some excuse or other you know you are i dont have you home to dinner not one day in the week through the year that cant be right and you know it is not oh tom you are breaking my heart and deceiving meyou are why did i go down and find that woman in your chamber with you when you were ashamed to own to me that she was coming to see you if it had been in the proper way of law business you wouldnt have been ashamed oh tom  the poor woman had begun her plaint in a manner that was not altogether devoid of a discreet eloquence if only she could have maintained that tone if she could have confined her words to the tale of her own grievances and have been contented to declare that she was unhappy only because he was not with her it might have been well she might have touched his heart or at any rate his conscience and there might have been some enduring result for good but her feelings had been too many for her and as her wrongs came to her mind and the words heaped themselves upon her tongue she could not keep herself from the one subject which she should have left untouched mr furnival was not the man to bear any interference such as this or to permit the privacy of lincolns inn to be invaded even by his wife his brow grew very black and his eyes became almost bloodshot the port wine which might have worked him to softness now worked him to anger and he thus burst forth with words of marital vigour  let me tell you once for ever kitty that i will admit of no interference with what i do or the people whom i may choose to see in my chambers in lincolns inn if you are such an infatuated simpleton as to believe  yes of course i am a simpleton of course i am a fool women always are  listen to me will you  listen yes its my business to listen would you like that i should give this house up for her and go into lodgings somewhere i shall have very little objection as matters are going now oh dear oh dear that things should ever have come to this  come to what  tom i could put up with a great dealmore i think than most women i could slave for you like a drudge and think nothing about it and now that you have got among grand people i could see you go out by yourself without thinking much about that either i am very lonely sometimesvery but i could bear that nobody has longed to see you rise in the world half so anxious as i have done but tom when i know what your goings on are with a nasty sly false woman like that i wont bear it and theres an end in saying which final words mrs furnival rose from her seat and thrice struck her hand by no means lightly on the loo table in the middle of the room  i did not think it possible that you should be so silly i did not indeed  oh yes silly very well women always are silly when they mind that kind of thing have you got anything else to say sir  yes i have i have this to say that i will not endure this sort of usage  nor i wont said mrs furnival so you may as well understand it at once as long as there was nothing absolutely wrong i would put up with it for the sake of appearances and because of sophia for myself i dont mind what loneliness i may have to bear if you had been called on to go out to the east indies or even to china i could have put up with it but this sort of thing i wont put up withnor i wont be blind to what i cant help seeing so now mr furnival you may know that i have made up my mind and then without waiting further parley having wisked herself in her energy near to the door she stalked out and went up with hurried steps to her own room  occurrences of a nature such as this are in all respects unpleasant in a household let the master be ever so much master what is he to do say that his wife is wrong from the beginning to the end of the quarrelthat in no way improves the matter his anxiety is that the world abroad shall not know he has ought amiss at home but she with her hot sense of injury and her loud revolt against supposed wrongs cares not who hears it hold your tongue madam the husband says but the wife bound though she be by an oath of obedience will not obey him but only screams the louder  all which as mr furnival sat there thinking of it disturbed his mind much that martha biggs would spread the tale through all bloomsbury and st pancras of course he was aware if she drives me to it it must be so he said to himself at last and then he also betook himself to his rest and so it was that preparations for christmas were made in harley street     chapter xxii  christmas at noningsby   the house at noningsby on christmasday was quite full and yet it was by no means a small house mrs arbuthnot the judges married daughter was there with her three children and mr furnival was there having got over those domestic difficulties in which we lately saw him as best he might and lucius mason was there having been especially asked by lady staveley when she heard that his mother was to be at the cleeve there could be no more comfortable countryhouse than noningsby and it was in its own way pretty though essentially different in all respects from the cleeve it was a new house from the cellar to the ceiling and as a house was no doubt the better for being so all the rooms were of the proper proportion and all the newest appliances for comfort had been attached to it but nevertheless it lacked that something in appearance rather than in fact which age alone can give to the residence of a gentleman in the country the gardens also were new and the grounds around them trim and square and orderly noningsby was a delightful house no one with money and taste at command could have created for himself one more delightful but then there are delights which cannot be created even by money and taste  it was a pleasant sight to see the long broad wellfilled breakfast table with all that company round it there were some eighteen or twenty gathered now at the table among whom the judge sat preeminent looming large in an armchair and having a double space allotted to himsome eighteen or twenty children included at the bottom of the table sat lady staveley who still chose to preside among her own tea cups as a lady should do and close to her assisting in the toils of that presidency sat her daughter madeline nearest to them were gathered the children and the rest had formed themselves into little parties each of which already well knew its own place at the board in how very short a time will come upon one that pleasant custom of sitting in an accustomed place but here at these noningsby breakfasts among other customs already established there was one by which augustus staveley was always privileged to sit by the side of sophia furnival no doubt his original object was still unchanged a match between that lady and his friend graham was still desirable and by perseverance he might pique felix graham to arouse himself but hitherto felix graham had not aroused himself in that direction and one or two people among the party were inclined to mistake young staveleys intentions  gus his sister had said to him the night before i declare i think you are going to make love to sophia furnival  do you he had replied as a rule i do not think there is any one in the world for whose discernment i have so much respect as i have for yours but in this respect even you are wrong  ah of course you say so  if you wont believe me ask her what more can i say  i certainly shant ask her for i dont know her well enough  shes a very clever girl let me tell you that whoever falls in love with her  im sure she is and she is handsome too very but for all that she is not good enough for our gus  of course she is not and therefore i am not thinking of her and now go to bed and dream that you have got the queen of the fortunate islands for your sisterinlaw  but although staveley was himself perfectly indifferent to all the charms of miss furnival nevertheless he could hardly restrain his dislike to lucius mason who as he thought was disposed to admire the lady in question in talking of lucius to his own family and to his special friend graham he had called him conceited pedantic uncouth unenglish and detestable his own family that is his mother and sister rarely contradicted him in anything but graham was by no means so cautious and usually contradicted him in everything indeed there was no sign of sterling worth so plainly marked in staveleys character as the full conviction which he entertained of the superiority of his friend felix  you are quite wrong about him felix had said he has not been at an english school or english university and therefore is not like other young men that you know but he is i think well educated and clever as for conceit what man will do any good who is not conceited nobody holds a good opinion of a man who has a low opinion of himself  all the same my dear fellow i do not like lucius mason  and some one else if you remember did not like dr fell  and now good people what are you all going to do about church said staveley while they were still engaged with their rolls and eggs  i shall walk said the judge  and i shall go in the carriage said the judges wife  that disposes of two and now it will take half an hour to settle for the rest miss furnival you no doubt will accompany my mother as i shall be among the walkers you will see how much i sacrifice by the suggestion  it was a mile to the church and miss furnival knew the advantage of appearing in her seat unfatigued and without subjection to wind mud or rain i must confess she said that under all the circumstances i shall prefer your mothers company to yours whereupon staveley in the completion of his arrangements assigned the other places in the carriage to the married ladies of the company  but i have taken your sister madelines seat in the carriage protested sophia with great dismay  my sister madeline generally walks  then of course i shall walk with her but when the time came miss furnival did go in the carriage whereas miss staveley went on foot  it so fell out as they started that graham found himself walking at miss staveleys side to the great disgust no doubt of half a dozen other aspirants for that honour i cannot help thinking he said as they stepped briskly over the crisp white frost that this christmasday of ours is a great mistake  oh mr graham she exclaimed  you need not regard me with horrorat least not with any special horror on this occasion  but what you say is very horrid  that i flatter myself seems so only because i have not yet said it that part of our christmasday which is made to be in any degree sacred is by no means a mistake  i am glad you think that  or rather it is not a mistake in as far as it is in any degree made sacred but the peculiar conviviality of the day is so ponderous its roastbeefiness oppresses one so thoroughly from the first moment of ones waking to the last ineffectual effort at a bit of fried pudding for supper  but you need not eat fried pudding for supper indeed here i am afraid you will not have any supper offered you at all  no not to me individually under that name i might also manage to guard my own self under any such offers but there is always the flavour of the sweetmeat in the airof all the sweetmeats edible and nonedible  you begrudge the children their snapdragon thats what it all means mr graham  no i deny it unpremeditated snapdragon is dear to my soul and i could expend myself in blindmans buff  you shall then after dinner for of course you know that we all dine early  but blindmans buff at three with snapdragon at a quarter to fourcharades at five with wine and sweet cake at halfpast six is ponderous and thats our mistake the big turkey would be very goodcapital fun to see a turkey twice as big as it ought to be but the big turkey and the mountain of beef and the pudding weighing a hundredweight oppress ones spirits by their combined gravity and then they impart a memory of indigestion a halo as it were of apoplexy even to the church services  i do not agree with you the least in the world  i ask you to answer me fairly is not additional eating an ordinary englishmans ordinary idea of christmasday  i am only an ordinary englishwoman and therefore cannot say it is not my idea  i believe that the ceremony as kept by us is perpetuated by the butchers and beersellers with a helping hand from the grocers it is essentially a material festival and i would not object to it even on that account if it were not so grievously overdone how the sun is moistening the frost on the ground as we come back the road will be quite wet  we shall be going home then and it will not signify remember mr graham i shall expect you to come forward in great strength for blindmans buff as he gave her the required promise he thought that even the sports of christmasday would be bearable if she also were to make one of the sportsmen and then they entered the church  illustration christmas at noningsbymorning  i do not know of anything more pleasant to the eye than a pretty country church decorated for christmasday the effect in a city is altogether different i will not say that churches there should not be decorated but comparatively it is a matter of indifference no one knows who does it the peculiar munificence of the squire who has sacrificed his holly bushes is not appreciated the work of the fingers that have been employed is not recognised the efforts made for hanging the pendent wreaths to each capital have been of no special interest to any large number of the worshippers it has been done by contract probably and even if well done has none of the grace of association but here at noningsby church the winter flowers had been cut by madeline and the gardener and the red berries had been grouped by her own hands she and the vicars wife had stood together with perilous audacity on the top of the clerks desk while they fixed the branches beneath the cushion of the oldfashioned turret from which the sermons were preached and all this had of course been talked about at the house and some of the party had gone over to see including sophia furnival who had declared that nothing could be so delightful though she had omitted to endanger her fingers by any participation in the work and the children had regarded the operation as a triumph of all that was wonderful in decoration and thus many of them had been made happy  on their return from church miss furnival insisted on walking in order as she said that miss staveley might not have all the fatigue but miss staveley would walk also and the carriage after a certain amount of expostulation and delay went off with its load incomplete  and now for the plumpudding part of the arrangement said felix graham  yes mr graham said madeline now for the plumpuddingand the blindmans buff  did you ever see anything more perfect than the church mr mason said sophia  anything more perfect no in that sort of way perhaps never i have seen the choir of cologne  come come thats not fair said graham dont import cologne in order to crush us here down in our little english villages you never saw the choir of cologne bright with holly berries  no but i have with cardinals stockings and bishops robes  i think i should prefer the holly said miss furnival and why should not our churches always look like that only changing the flowers and the foliage with the season it would make the service so attractive  it would hardly do at lent said madeline in a serious tone  no perhaps not at lent exactly  peregrine and augustus staveley were walking on in front not perhaps as well satisfied with the day as the rest of the party augustus on leaving the church had made a little effort to assume his place as usual by miss furnivals side but by some accident of war mason was there before him he had not cared to make one of a party of three and therefore had gone on in advance with young orme nor was peregrine himself much more happy he did not know why but he felt within his breast a growing aversion to felix graham graham was a puppy he thought and a fellow that talked too much and then he was such a confoundedly ugly dog andandandperegrine orme did not like him he was not a man to analyze his own feelings in such matters he did not ask himself why he should have been rejoiced to hear that instant business had taken felix graham off to hong kong but he knew that he would have rejoiced he knew also that madeline staveley was no he did not know what she was but when he was alone he carried on with her all manner of imaginary conversations though when he was in her company he had hardly a word to say to her under these circumstances he fraternized with her brother but even in that he could not receive much satisfaction seeing that he could not abuse graham to grahams special friend nor could he breathe a sigh as to madelines perfections into the ear of madelines brother  the childrenand there were three or four assembled there besides those belonging to mrs arbuthnot were by no means inclined to agree with mr grahams strictures as to the amusements of christmasday to them it appeared that they could not hurry fast enough into the vortex of its dissipations the dinner was a serious consideration especially with reference to certain illuminated mincepies which were the crowning glory of that banquet but time for these was almost begrudged in order that the fast handkerchief might be tied over the eyes of the first blindman  and now well go into the schoolroom said marian arbuthnot jumping up and leading the way come along mr felix and felix graham followed her  madeline had declared that felix graham should be blinded first and such was his doom now mind you catch me mr felix pray do said marian when she had got him seated in a corner of the room she was a beautiful fair little thing with long soft curls and lips red as a rose and large bright blue eyes all soft and happy and laughing loving the friends of her childhood with passionate love and fully expecting an equal devotion from them it is of such children that our wives and sweethearts should be made  but how am i to find you when my eyes are blinded  oh you can feel you know you can put your hand on the top of my head i mustnt speak you know but im sure i shall laugh and then you must guess that its marian that was her idea of playing blindmans buff according to the strict rigour of the game  and youll give me a big kiss said felix  yes when weve done playing she promised with great seriousness  and then a huge white silk handkerchief as big as a small sail was brought down from grandpapas dressingroom so that nobody should see the least bit in the world as marian had observed with great energy and the work of blinding was commenced i aint big enough to reach round said marian who had made an effort but in vain you do it aunt mad and she tendered the handkerchief to miss staveley who however did not appear very eager to undertake the task  ill be the executioner said grandmamma the more especially as i shall not take any other share in the ceremony this shall be the chair of doom come here mr graham and submit yourself to me and so the first victim was blinded mind you remember said marian whispering into his ear as he was led away green spirits and white blue spirits and gray and then he was twirled round in the room and left to commence his search as best he might  marian arbuthnot was not the only soft little laughing darling that wished to be caught and blinded so that there was great pulling at the blindmans tails and much grasping at his outstretched arms before the desired object was attained and he wandered round the room skilfully as though a thought were in his mind false to his treaty with marianas though he imagined for a moment that some other prize might be caught but if so the other prize evaded him carefully and in due progress of play marians soft curls were within his grasp im sure i didnt speak or say a word said she as she ran up to her grandmother to have the handkerchief put over her eyes did i grandmamma  there are more ways of speaking than one said lady staveley you and mr graham understand each other i think  oh i was caught quite fairly said marianand now lead me round and round to her at any rate the festivities of christmasday were not too ponderous for real enjoyment  and then at last somebody caught the judge i rather think it was madeline but his time in truth was come and he had no chance of escape the whole room was set upon his capture and though he barricaded himself with chairs and children he was duly apprehended and named thats papa i know by his watchchain for i made it  nonsense my dears said the judge i will do no such thing i should never catch anybody and should remain blind for ever  but grandpapa must said marian its the game that he should be blinded when hes caught  suppose the game was that we should be whipped when we are caught and i was to catch you said augustus  but i would not play that game said marian  oh papa you must said madeline doand you shall catch mr furnival  that would be a temptation said the judge ive never been able to do that yet though ive been trying it for some years  justice is blind said graham why should a judge be ashamed to follow the example of his own goddess and so at last the owner of the ermine submitted and the stern magistrate of the bench was led round with the due incantation of the spirits and dismissed into chaos to seek for a new victim  illustration christmas at noningsbyevening  one of the rules of blindmans buff at noningsby was this that it should not be played by candlelighta rule that is in every way judicious as thereby an end is secured for that which might otherwise be unending and therefore when it became so dark in the schoolroom that there was not much difference between the blind man and the others the handkerchief was smuggled away and the game was at an end  and now for snapdragon said marian  exactly as you predicted mr graham said madeline blindmans buff at a quarter past three and snapdragon at five  i revoke every word that i uttered for i was never more amused in my life  and you will be prepared to endure the wine and sweet cake when they come  prepared to endure anything and go through everything we shall be allowed candles now i suppose  oh no by no means snapdragon by candlelight who ever heard of such a thing it would wash all the dragon out of it and leave nothing but the snap it is a necessity of the game that it should be played in the darkor rather by its own lurid light  oh there is a lurid light is there  you shall see and then she turned away to make her preparations  to the game of snapdragon as played at noningsby a ghost was always necessary and aunt madeline had played the ghost ever since she had been an aunt and there had been any necessity for such a part but in previous years the spectators had been fewer in number and more closely connected with the family i think we must drop the ghost on this occasion she said coming up to her brother  youll disgust them all dreadfully if you do said he the young sebrights have come specially to see the ghost  well you can do ghost for them  i no i cant act a ghost miss furnival youd make a lovely ghost  i shall be most happy to be useful said sophia  oh aunt mad you must be ghost said marian following her  you foolish little thing you we are going to have a beautiful ghosta divine ghost said uncle gus  but we want madeline to be the ghost said a big miss sebright ten or eleven years old  shes always ghost said marian  to be sure it will be much better said miss furnival i only offered my poor services hoping to be useful no banquo that ever lived could leave a worse ghost behind him than i should prove  it ended in there being two ghosts it had become quite impossible to rob miss furnival of her promised part and madeline could not refuse to solve the difficulty in this way without making more of the matter than it deserved the idea of two ghosts was delightful to the children more especially as it entailed two large dishes full of raisins and two blue fires blazing up from burnt brandy so the girls went out not without proffered assistance from the gentlemen and after a painfully long interval of some fifteen or twenty minutesfor miss furnivals back hair would not come down and adjust itself into ghostlike lengths with as much readiness as that of her friendthey returned bearing the dishes before them on large trays in each of them the spirit was lighted as they entered the schoolroom door and thus as they walked in they were illuminated by the darkblue flames which they carried  oh is it not grand said marian appealing to felix graham  uncommonly grand he replied  and which ghost do you think is the grandest ill tell you which ghost i like the bestin a secret you know i like aunt mad the best and i think shes the grandest too  and ill tell you in a secret that i think the same to my mind she is the grandest ghost i ever saw in my life  is she indeed asked marian solemnly thinking probably that her new friends experience in ghosts must be extensive however that might be he thought that as far as his experience in women went he had never seen anything more lovely than madeline staveley dressed in a long white sheet with a long bit of white cambric pinned round her face  and it may be presumed that the dress altogether is not unbecoming when accompanied by blue flames for augustus staveley and lucius mason thought the same thing of miss furnival whereas peregrine orme did not know whether he was standing on his head or his feet as he looked at miss staveley miss furnival may possibly have had some inkling of this when she offered to undertake the task but i protest that such was not the case with madeline there was no second thought in her mind when she first declined the ghosting and afterwards undertook the part no wish to look beautiful in the eyes of felix graham had come to herat any rate as yet and as to peregrine orme she had hardly thought of his existence by heavens said peregrine to himself she is the most beautiful creature that i ever saw and then he began to speculate within his own mind how the idea might be received at the cleeve  but there was no such realised idea with felix graham he saw that madeline staveley was very beautiful and he felt in an unconscious manner that her character was very sweet he may have thought that he might have loved such a girl had such love been a thing permitted to him but this was far from being the case felix grahams lot in this life as regarded that share which his heart might have in it was already marked out for himmarked out for himself and by himself the future wife of his bosom had already been selected and was now in course of preparation for the duties of her future life he was one of those few wise men who have determined not to take a partner in life at hazard but to mould a young mind and character to those pursuits and modes of thought which may best fit a woman for the duties she will have to perform what little it may be necessary to know of the earlier years of mary snow shall be told hereafter here it will be only necessary to say that she was an orphan that as yet she was little more than a child and that she owed her maintenance and the advantage of her education to the charity and love of her destined husband therefore as i have said it was manifest that felix graham could not think of falling in love with miss staveley even had not his very low position in reference to worldly affairs made any such passion on his part quite hopeless but with peregrine orme the matter was different there could be no possible reason why peregrine orme should not win and wear the beautiful girl whom he so much admired  but the ghosts are kept standing over their flames the spirit is becoming exhausted and the raisins will be burnt at snapdragon too the ghosts here had something to do the law of the game is thisa law on which marian would have insisted had not the flames been so very hotthat the raisins shall become the prey of those audacious marauders only who dare to face the presence of the ghost and to plunge their hands into the burning dish as a rule the boys do this clawing out the raisins while the girls pick them up and eat them but here at noningsby the boys were too little to act thus as pioneers in the face of the enemy and the raisins might have remained till the flames were burnt out had not the beneficent ghost scattered abroad the richness of her own treasures  now marian said felix graham bringing her up in his arms  but it will burn mr felix look there see there are a great many at that end you do it  i must have another kiss then  very well yes if you get five and then felix dashed his hand in among the flames and brought forth a fistful of fruit which imparted to his fingers and wristband a smell of brandy for the rest of the evening  if you take so many at a time i shall rap your knuckles with the spoon said the ghost as she stirred up the flames to keep them alive  but the ghost shouldnt speak said marian who was evidently unacquainted with the best ghosts of tragedy  but the ghost must speak when such large hands invade the caldron and then another raid was effected and the threatened blow was given had any one told her in the morning that she would that day have rapped mr grahams knuckles with a kitchen spoon she would not have believed that person but it is thus that hearts are lost and won  and peregrine orme looked on from a distance thinking of it all that he should have been stricken dumb by the beauty of any girl was surprising even to himself for though young and almost boyish in his manners he had never yet feared to speak out in any presence the tutor at his college had thought him insolent beyond parallel and his grandfather though he loved him for his open face and plain outspoken words found them sometimes almost too much for him but now he stood there looking and longing and could not summon courage to go up and address a few words to this young girl even in the midst of their sports twice or thrice during the last few days he had essayed to speak to her but his words had been dull and vapid and to himself they had appeared childish he was quite conscious of his own weakness more than once during that period of the snapdragon did he say to himself that he would descend into the lists and break a lance in that tourney but still he did not descend and his lance remained inglorious in its rest  at the other end of the long table the ghost also had two attendant knights and neither of them refrained from the battle augustus staveley if he thought it worth his while to keep the lists at all would not be allowed to ride through them unopposed from any backwardness on the part of his rival lucius mason was not likely to become a timid silent longing lover to him it was not possible that he should fear the girl whom he loved he could not worship that which he wished to obtain for himself it may be doubted whether he had much faculty of worshipping anything in the truest meaning of that word one worships that which one feels through the inner and unexpressed conviction of the mind to be greater better higher than oneself but it was not probable that lucius mason should so think of any woman that he might meet  nor to give him his due was it probable that he should be in any way afraid of any man that he might encounter he would fear neither the talent nor the rank nor the money influence nor the dexterity of any such rival in any attempt that he might make on a womans heart he would regard his own chance as good against that of any other possible he augustus staveley was master here at noningsby and was a clever dashing handsome fashionable young fellow but lucius mason never dreamed of retreating before such forces as those he had words with which to speak as fair as those of any man and flattered himself that he as well knew how to use them  it was pretty to see with what admirable tact and judicious management of her smiles sophia received the homage of the two young men answering the compliments of both with ease and so conducting herself that neither could fairly accuse her of undue favour to the other but unfairly in his own mind augustus did so accuse her and why should he have been so venomous seeing that he entertained no regard for the lady himself his object was still plain enoughthat namely of making a match between his needy friend and the heiress  his needy friend in the mean time played on through the long evening in thoughtless happiness and peregrine orme looking at the game from a distance saw that rap given to the favoured knuckles with a bitterness of heart and an inner groaning of the spirit that will not be incomprehensible to many  i do so love that mr felix said marian as her aunt madeline kissed her in her little bed on wishing her good night dont you aunt mad  and so it was that christmasday was passed at noningsby     chapter xxiii  christmas at groby park   christmasday was always a time of very great trial to mrs mason of groby park it behoved her as the wife of an old english country gentleman to spread her board plenteously at that season and in some sort to make an open house of it but she could not bring herself to spread any board with plenty and the idea of an open house would almost break her heart unlimited eating there was something in the very sounds of such words which was appalling to the inner woman  and on this christmasday she was doomed to go through an ordeal of very peculiar severity it so happened that the cure of souls in the parish of groby had been intrusted for the last two or three years to a young energetic but not very opulent curate why the rector of groby should be altogether absent leaving the work in the hands of a curate whom he paid by the lease of a cottage and garden and fiftyfive pounds a yearthereby behaving as he imagined with extensive liberalityit is unnecessary here to inquire such was the case and the rev adolphus green with mrs a green and the four children managed to live with some difficulty on the produce of the garden and the allotted stipend but could not probably have lived at all in that position had not mrs adolphus green been blessed with some small fortune  it had so happened that mrs adolphus green had been instrumental in imparting some knowledge of singing to two of the miss masons and had continued her instructions over the last three years this had not been done in any preconcerted way but the lessons had grown by chance mrs mason the while had looked on with a satisfied eye at an arrangement that was so much to her taste  there are no regular lessons you know she had said to her husband when he suggested that some reward for so much work would be expedient mrs green finds it convenient to have the use of my drawingroom and would never see an instrument from years end to years end if she were not allowed to come up here depend upon it she gets a great deal more than she gives  but after two years of tuition mr mason had spoken a second time my dear he said i cannot allow the girls to accept so great a favour from mrs green without making her some compensation  i dont see that it is at all necessary mrs mason had answered but if you think so we could send her down a hamper of applesthat is a basketful now it happened that apples were very plentiful that year and that the curate and his wife were blessed with as many as they could judiciously consume  apples nonsense said mr mason  if you mean money my dear i couldnt do it i wouldnt so offend a lady for all the world  you could buy them something handsome in the way of furniture that little room of theirs that they call the drawingroom has nothing in it at all get jones from leeds to send them some things that will do for them and hence after many inner misgivings had arisen that purchase of a drawingroom set from mr kantwisethat set of metallic louey catorse furniture containing three tables eight chairs c c as to which it may be remembered that mrs mason made such an undoubted bargain getting them for less than cost price that they had been strained as mr kantwise himself admitted in discoursing on the subject to mr dockwrath was not matter of much moment they would do extremely well for a curates wife  and now on this christmasday the present was to be made over to the happy lady mr and mrs green were to dine at groby parkleaving their more fortunate children to the fuller festivities of the cottage and the intention was that before dinner the whole drawingroom set should be made over it was with grievous pangs of heart that mrs mason looked forward to such an operation her own house was plenteously furnished from the kitchens to the attics but still she would have loved to keep that metallic set of painted trumpery she knew that the table would not screw on she knew that the pivot of the music stool was bent she knew that there was no place in the house in which they could stand she must have known that in no possible way could they be of use to her or hersand yet she could not part with them without an agony her husband was infatuated in this matter of compensation for the use of mrs greens idle hours no compensation could be necessaryand then she paid another visit to the metallic furniture she knew in her heart of hearts that they could never be of use to anybody and yet she made up her mind to keep back two out of the eight chairs six chairs would be quite enough for mrs greens small room  as there was to be feasting at five real roast beef plumpudding and mincepiesmincepies and plumpudding together are vulgar my dear mrs mason had said to her husband but in spite of the vulgarity he had insistedthe breakfast was of course scanty mr mason liked a slice of cold meat in the morning or the leg of a fowl or a couple of fresh eggs as well as any man but the matter was not worth a continual fight as we are to dine an hour earlier today i did not think you would eat meat his wife said to him then there would be less expense in putting it on the table he had answered and after that there was nothing more said about it he always put off till some future day that great contest which he intended to wage and to win and by which he hoped to bring it about that plenty should henceforward be the law of the land at groby park and then they all went to church mrs mason would not on any account have missed church on christmasday or a sunday it was a cheap duty and therefore rigidly performed as she walked from her carriage up to the churchdoor she encountered mrs green and smiled sweetly as she wished that lady all the compliments of the season  we shall see you immediately after church said mrs mason  oh yes certainly said mrs green  and mr green with you  he intends to do himself the pleasure said the curates wife  mind he comes because we have a little ceremony to go through before we sit down to dinner and mrs mason smiled again ever so graciously did she think or did she not think that she was going to do a kindness to her neighbour most women would have sunk into their shoes as the hour grew nigh at which they were to show themselves guilty of so much meanness  she stayed for the sacrament and it may here be remarked that on that afternoon she rated both the footman and housemaid because they omitted to do so she thought we must presume that she was doing her duty and must imagine her to have been ignorant that she was cheating her husband and cheating her friend she took the sacrament with admirable propriety of demeanour and then on her return home withdrew another chair from the set there would still be six including the rocking chair and six would be quite enough for that little hole of a room  there was a large chamber up stairs at groby park which had been used for the childrens lessons but which now was generally deserted there was in it an old wornout pianoforteand though mrs mason had talked somewhat grandly of the use of her drawingroom it was here that the singing had been taught into this room the metallic furniture had been brought and up to that christmas morning it had remained here packed in its original boxes hither immediately after breakfast mrs mason had taken herself and had spent an hour in her efforts to set the things forth to view two of the chairs she then put aside into a cupboard and a third she added to her private store on her return to her work after church  but alas alas let her do what she would she could not get the top on to the table its all smashed maam said the girl whom she at last summoned to her aid nonsense you simpleton how can it be smashed when its new said the mistress and then she tried again and again declaring as she did do that she would have the law of the rogue who had sold her a damaged article nevertheless she had known that it was damaged and had bought it cheap on that account insisting in very urgent language that the table was in fact worth nothing because of its injuries  at about four mr and mrs green walked up to the house and were shown into the drawingroom here was mrs mason supported by penelope and creusa as diana was not musical and therefore under no compliment to mrs green she kept out of the way mr mason also was absent he knew that something very mean was about to be done and would not show his face till it was over he ought to have taken the matter in hand himself and would have done so had not his mind been full of other things he himself was a man terribly wronged and wickedly injured and could not therefore in these present months interfere much in the active doing of kindnesses his hours were spent in thinking how he might best obtain justicehow he might secure his pound of flesh he only wanted his own but that he would havehis own with due punishment on those who had for so many years robbed him of it he therefore did not attend at the presentation of the furniture  and now well go up stairs if you please said mrs mason with that gracious smile for which she was so famous mr green you must come too dear mrs green has been so very kind to my two girls and now i have got a few articlesthey are of the very newest fashion and i do hope that mrs green will like them and so they all went up into the schoolroom  theres a new fashion come up lately said mrs mason as she walked along the corridor quite newof metallic furniture i dont know whether you have seen any mrs green said she had not seen any as yet  the patent steel furniture company makes it and it has got very greatly into vogue for small rooms i thought that perhaps you would allow me to present you with a set for your drawingroom  im sure it is very kind of you to think of it said mrs green  uncommonly so said mr green but both mr green and mrs green knew the lady and their hopes did not run high  and then the door was opened and there stood the furniture to view there stood the furniture except the three subtracted chairs and the loo table the claw and leg of the table indeed were standing there but the top was folded up and lying on the floor beside it i hope youll like the pattern began mrs mason im told that it is the prettiest that has yet been brought out there has been some little accident about the screw of the table but the smith in the village will put that to rights in five minutes he lives so close to you that i didnt think it worth while to have him up here  its very nice said mrs green looking round her almost in dismay  very nice indeed said mr green wondering in his mind for what purpose such utter trash could have been manufactured and endeavouring to make up his mind as to what they might possibly do with it mr green knew what chairs and tables should be and was well aware that the things before him were absolutely useless for any of the ordinary purposes of furniture  and they are the most convenient things in the world said mrs mason for when you are going to change house you pack them all up again in those boxes wooden furniture takes up so much room and is so lumbersome  yes it is said mrs green  ill have them all put up again and sent down in the cart tomorrow  thank you that will be very kind said mr green and then the ceremony of the presentation was over on the following day the boxes were sent down and mrs mason might have abstracted even another chair without detection for the cases lay unheeded from month to month in the curates still unfurnished room the fact is they cannot afford a carpet mrs mason afterwards said to one of her daughters and with such things as those they are quite right to keep them up till they can be used with advantage i always gave mrs green credit for a good deal of prudence  and then when the show was over they descended again into the drawingroommr green and mrs mason went first and creusa followed penelope was thus so far behind as to be able to speak to her friend without being heard by the others  you know mamma she said with a shrug of her shoulders and a look of scorn in her eye  the things are very nice  no they are not and you know they are not they are worthless perfectly worthless  but we dont want anything  no and if there had been no pretence of a gift it would all have been very well what will mr green think  i rather think he likes iron chairs and then they were in the drawingroom  mr mason did not appear till dinnertime and came in only just in time to give his arm to mrs green he had had letters to writea letter to messrs round and crook very determined in its tone and a letter also to mr dockwrath for the little attorney had so crept on in the affair that he was now corresponding with the principal ill teach those fellows in bedford row to know who i am he had said to himself more than once sitting on his high stool at hamworth  and then came the groby park christmas dinner to speak the truth mr mason had himself gone to the neighbouring butcher and ordered the surloin of beef knowing that it would be useless to trust to orders conveyed through his wife he had seen the piece of meat put on one side for him and had afterwards traced it on to the kitchen dresser but nevertheless when it appeared at table it had been sadly mutilated a steak had been cut off the full breadth of ita monstrous cantle from out its fair proportions the lady had seen the jovial thick ample size of the goodly joint and her heart had been unable to spare it she had made an effort and turned away saying to herself that the responsibility was all with him but it was of no use there was that within her which could not do it your master will never be able to carve such a mountain of meat as that she had said turning back to the cook deed an its he that will maam said the irish mistress of the spit for irish cooks are cheaper than those bred and born in england but nevertheless the thing was done and it was by her own fair hands that the envious knife was used i couldnt do it maam the cook had said i couldnt railly  mr masons face became very black when he saw the raid that had been effected and when he looked up across the table his wifes eye was on him she knew what she had to expect and she knew also that it would not come now her eye steadily looked at his quivering with fear for mr mason could be savage enough in his anger and what had she gained one may as well ask what does the miser gain who hides away his gold in an old pot or what does that other madman gain who is locked up for long long years because he fancies himself the grandmother of the queen of england  but there was still enough beef on the table for all of them to eat and as mrs mason was not intrusted with the carving of it their plates were filled as far as a sufficiency of beef can make a good dinner mr and mrs green did have a good dinner on that christmasday beyond that their comfort was limited for no one was in a humour for happy conversation  and over and beyond the beef there was a plumpudding and three mincepies four mincepies had originally graced the dish but before dinner one had been conveyed away to some up stairs receptacle for such spoils the pudding also was small nor was it black and rich and laden with good things as a christmas pudding should be laden let us hope that what the guests so lost was made up to them on the following day by an absence of those ill effects which sometimes attend upon the consumption of rich viands  and now my dear well have a bit of bread and cheese and a glass of beer mr green said when he arrived at his own cottage and so it was that christmasday was passed at groby park     chapter xxiv  christmas in great st helens   we will now look in for a moment at the christmas doings of our fat friend mr moulder mr moulder was a married man living in lodgings over a winemerchants vaults in great st helens he was blessedor troubled with no children and prided himself greatly on the material comfort with which his humble home was surrounded his wife he often boasted never wanted for plenty of the best of eating and for linen and silks and suchlike she could show her drawers and her wardrobes with many a great lady from russell square and not be ashamed neither and then as for drinktipple as mr moulder sportively was accustomed to name it among his friends he opined that he was not altogether behind the mark in that respect he had got some brandyhe didnt care what anybody might say about cognac and eau de vie but the brandy which he had got from betts private establishment seventeen years ago for richness of flavour and fullness of strength would beat any french article that anybody in the city could show that at least was his idea if anybody didnt like it they neednt take it there was whisky that would make your hair stand on end so said mr moulder and i can believe him for it has made my hair stand on end merely to see other people drinking it  and if comforts of apparel comforts of eating and drinking and comforts of the featherbed and easychair kind can make a woman happy mrs moulder was no doubt a happy woman she had quite fallen in to the mode of life laid out for her she had a little bit of hot kidney for breakfast at about ten she dined at three having seen herself to the accurate cooking of her roast fowl or her bit of sweetbread and always had her pint of scotch ale she turned over all her clothes almost every day in the evening she read reynoldss miscellany had her tea and buttered muffins took a thimbleful of brandy and water at nine and then went to bed the work of her life consisted in sewing buttons on to moulders shirts and seeing that his things were properly got up when he was at home no doubt she would have done better as to the duties of the world had the worlds duties come to her as it was very few such had come in her direction her husband was away from home threefourths of the year and she had no children that required attention as for society some four or five times a year she would drink tea with mrs hubbles at clapham mrs hubbles was the wife of the senior partner in the firm and on such occasions mrs moulder dressed herself in her best and having travelled to clapham in an omnibus spent the evening in dull propriety on one corner of mrs hubbless sofa when i have added to this that moulder every year took her to broadstairs for a fortnight i think that i have described with sufficient accuracy the course of mrs moulders life  on the occasion of this present christmasday mr moulder entertained a small party and he delighted in such occasional entertainments taking extraordinary pains that the eatables should be of the very best and he would maintain an hospitable good humour to the lastunless anything went wrong in the cookery in which case he could make himself extremely unpleasant to mrs m indeed proper cooking for mr m and the proper starching of the bands of his shirts were almost the only trials that mrs moulder was doomed to suffer what the d are you for he would say almost throwing the displeasing viands at her head across the table or tearing the rough linen from off his throat it aint much i ask of you in return for your keep and then he would scowl at her with bloodshot eyes till she shook in her shoes but this did not happen often as experiences had made her careful  but on this present christmas festival all went swimmingly to the end now bear a hand old girl was the harshest word he said to her and he enjoyed himself like duncan shut up in measureless content he had three guests with him on this auspicious day there was his old friend snengkeld who had dined with him on every christmas since his marriage there was his wifes brother of whom we will say a word or two just nowand there was our old friend mr kantwise mr kantwise was not exactly the man whom moulder would have chosen as his guest for they were opposed to each other in all their modes of thought and action but he had come across the travelling agent of the patent metallic steel furniture company on the previous day and finding that he was to be alone in london on this general holiday he had asked him out of sheer good nature moulder could be very good natured and full of pity when the sorrow to be pitied arose from some such source as the want of a christmas dinner so mr kantwise had been asked and precisely at four oclock he made his appearance at great st helens  but now as to this brotherinlaw he was no other than that john kenneby whom miriam usbech did not marrywhom miriam usbech might perhaps have done well to marry john kenneby after one or two attempts in other spheres of life had at last got into the house of hubbles and grease and had risen to be their bookkeeper he had once been tried by them as a traveller but in that line he had failed he did not possess that rough ready selfconfident tone of mind which is almost necessary for a man who is destined to move about quickly from one circle of persons to another after a six months trial he had given that up but during the time mr moulder the senior traveller of the house had married his sister john kenneby was a good honest painstaking fellow and was believed by his friends to have put a few pounds together in spite of the timidity of his character  when snengkeld and kenneby were shown up into the room they found nobody there but kantwise that mrs moulder should be down stairs looking after the roast turkey was no more than natural but why should not moulder himself be there to receive his guests he soon appeared however coming up without his coat  well snengkeld how are you old fellow many happy returns and all that the same to you john ill tell you what my lads its a prime un i never saw such a bird in all my days  what the turkey said snengkeld  you didnt think itd be a ostrich did you  ha ha ha laughed snengkeld no i didnt expect nothing but a turkey here on christmasday  and nothing but a turkey youll have my boys can you eat turkey kantwise  mr kantwise declared that his only passion in the way of eating was for a turkey  as for john im sure of him ive seen him at the work before whereupon john grinned but said nothing  i never see such a bird in my life certainly  from norfolk i suppose said snengkeld with a great appearance of interest  oh you may swear to that it weighed twentyfour pounds for i put it into the scales myself and old gibbetts let me have it for a guinea the price marked on it was fiveandtwenty for i saw it hes had it hanging for a fortnight and ive been to see it wiped down with vinegar regular every morning and now my boys its done to a turn ive been in the kitchen most of the time myself and either i or mrs m has never left it for a single moment  how did you manage about divine service said kantwise and then when he had spoken closed his eyes and sucked his lips  mr moulder looked at him for a minute and then said gammon  ha ha ha laughed snengkeld and then mrs moulder appeared bringing the turkey with her for she would trust it to no hands less careful than her own  by george it is a bird said snengkeld standing over it and eyeing it minutely  uncommon nice it looks said kantwise  all the same i wouldnt eat none if i were you said moulder seeing what sinners have been a basting it and then they all sat down to dinner moulder having first resumed his coat  for the next three or four minutes moulder did not speak a word the turkey was on his mind with the stuffing the gravy the liver the breast the wings and the legs he stood up to carve it and while he was at the work he looked at it as though his two eyes were hardly sufficient he did not help first one person and then another so ending by himself but he cut up artistically as much as might probably be consumed and located the fragments in small heaps or shares in the hot gravy and then having made a partition of the spoils he served it out with unerring impartiality to have robbed any one of his or her fair slice of the breast would in his mind have been gross dishonesty in his heart he did not love kantwise but he dealt by him with the utmost justice in the great affair of the turkeys breast when he had done all this and his own plate was laden he gave a long sigh i shall never cut up such another bird as that the longest day that i have to live he said and then he took out his large red silk handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his brow  deary me m dont think of that now said the wife  whats the use said snengkeld care killed a cat  and perhaps you may said john kenneby trying to comfort him who knows  its all in the hands of providence said kantwise and we should look to him  and how does it taste asked moulder shaking the gloomy thoughts from his mind  uncommon said snengkeld with his mouth quite full i never eat such a turkey in all my life  like melted diamonds said mrs moulder who was not without a touch of poetry  ah theres nothing like hanging of em long enough and watching of em well its that vinegar as done it and then they went seriously to work and there was nothing more said of any importance until the eating was nearly over  and now mrs m had taken away the cloth and they were sitting cozily over their port wine the very apple of the eye of the evening had not arrived even yet that would not come till the pipes were brought out and the brandy was put on the table and the whisky was there that made the peoples hair stand on end it was then that the floodgates of convivial eloquence would be unloosed in the mean time it was necessary to sacrifice something to gentility and therefore they sat over their port wine  did you bring that letter with you john said his sister john replied that he had done so and that he had also received another letter that morning from another party on the same subject  do show it to moulder and ask him said mrs m  ive got em both on purpose said john and then he brought forth two letters and handed one of them to his brotherinlaw it contained a request very civilly worded from messrs round and crook begging him to call at their office in bedford row on the earliest possible day in order that they might have some conversation with him regarding the will of the late sir joseph mason who died in 18  why this is law business said moulder who liked no business of that description dont you go near them john if you aint obliged  and then kenneby gave his explanation on the matter telling how in former yearsmany years ago he had been a witness in a lawsuit and then as he told it he sighed remembering miriam usbech for whose sake he had remained unmarried even to this day and he went on to narrate how he had been bullied in the court though he had valiantly striven to tell the truth with exactness and as he spoke an opinion of his became manifest that old usbech had not signed the document in his presence the girl signed it certainly said he for i handed her the pen i recollect it as though it were yesterday  they are the very people we were talking of at leeds said moulder turning to kantwise mason and martock dont you remember how you went out to groby park to sell some of them iron gimcracks that was old masons son they are the same people  ah i shouldnt wonder said kantwise who was listening all the while he never allowed intelligence of this kind to pass by him idly  and whos the other letter from asked moulder but dash my wigs its past six oclock come old girl why dont you give us the tobacco and stuff  it aint far to fetch said mrs moulder and then she put the tobacco and stuff upon the table  the other letter is from an enemy of mine said john kenneby speaking very solemnly an enemy of mine named dockwrath who lives at hamworth hes an attorney too  dockwrath said moulder  mr kantwise said nothing but he looked round over his shoulder at kenneby and then shut his eyes  that was the name of the man whom we left in the commercial room at the bull said snengkeld  he went out to masons at groby park that same day said moulder  then its the same man said kenneby and there was as much solemnity in the tone of his voice as though the unravelment of all the mysteries of the iron mask was now about to take place mr kantwise still said nothing but he also perceived that it was the same man  let me tell you john kenneby said moulder with the air of one who understood well the subject that he was discussing if they two be the same man then the man who wrote that letter to you is as big a blackguard as there is from this to hisself and mr moulder in the excitement of the moment puffed hard at his pipe took a long pull at his drink and dragged open his waistcoat i dont know whether kantwise has anything to say upon that subject added moulder  not a word at present said kantwise mr kantwise was a very careful man and usually calculated with accuracy the value which he might extract from any circumstances with reference to his own main chance mr dockwrath had not as yet paid him for the set of metallic furniture and therefore he also might well have joined in that sweeping accusation but it might be that by a judicious use of what he now heard he might obtain the payment of that little billand perhaps other collateral advantages  and then the letter from dockwrath to kenneby was brought forth and read my dear john it beganfor the two had known each other when they were lads togetherand it went on to request kennebys attendance at hamworth for the short space of a few hoursi want to have a little conversation with you about a matter of considerable interest to both of us and as i cannot expect you to undertake expense i enclose a money order for thirty shillings  hes in earnest at any rate said mr moulder  no mistake about that said snengkeld  but mr kantwise spoke never a word  it was at last decided that john kenneby should go both to hamworth and to bedford row but that he should go to hamworth first moulder would have counselled him to have gone to neither but snengkeld remarked that there were too many at work to let the matter sleep and john himself observed that anyways he hadnt done anything to be ashamed of  then go said moulder at last only dont say more than you are obliged to  i does not like these business talkings on christmas night said mrs moulder when the matter was arranged  what can one do asked moulder  its a tempting of providence in my mind said kantwise as he replenished his glass and turned his eyes up to the ceiling  now thats gammon said moulder and then there arose among them a long and animated discussion on matters theological  ill tell you what my idea of death is said moulder after a while i aint a bit afeard of it my father was an honest man as did his duty by his employers and he died with a bottom of brandy before him and a pipe in his mouth i shant live long myself  gracious moulder dont said mrs m  no more i shant cause im fat as he was and i hope i may die as he did ive been honest to hubbles and grease theyve made thousands of pounds along of me and have never lost none who can say more than that when i took to the old girl there i insured my life so that she shouldnt want her wittles and drink  oh m dont  and i aint afeard to die snengkeld my old pal hand us the brandy  such is the modern philosophy of the moulders pigs out of the sty of epicurus and so it was they passed christmasday in great st helens     chapter xxv  mr furnival again at his chambers   the christmas doings at the cleeve were not very gay there was no visitor there except lady mason and it was known that she was in trouble it must not however be supposed that she constantly bewailed herself while there or made her friends miserable by a succession of hysterical tears by no means she made an effort to be serene and the effort was successfulas such efforts usually are on the morning of christmasday they duly attended church and lady mason was seen by all hamworth sitting in the cleeve pew in no way could the baronets friendship have been shown more plainly than in this nor could a more significant mark of intimacy have been givenall which sir peregrine well understood the people of hamworth had chosen to talk scandal about lady mason but he at any rate would show how little attention he paid to the falsehoods that there were circulated so he stood by her at the pew door as she entered with as much deference as though she had been a duchess and the people of hamworth looking on wondered which would be right mr dockwrath or sir peregrine  after dinner sir peregrine gave a toast lady mason we will drink the health of the absent boys god bless them i hope they are enjoying themselves  god bless them said mrs orme putting her handkerchief to her eyes  god bless them both said lady mason also putting her handkerchief to her eyes then the ladies left the room and that was the extent of their special festivity robert said sir peregrine immediately afterwards to his butler let them have what port wine they want in the servants hallwithin measure  yes sir peregrine  and robert i shall not want you again  thank you sir peregrine  from all which it may be imagined that the christmas doings at the cleeve were chiefly maintained below stairs  i do hope they are happy said mrs orme when the two ladies were together in the drawingroom they have a very nice party at noningsby  your boy will be happy im sure said lady mason  and why not lucius also  it was sweet in lady masons ear to hear her son called by his christian name all these increasing signs of interest and intimacy were sweet but especially any which signified some favour shown to her son this trouble weighs heavy on him she replied it is only natural that he should feel it  papa does not seem to think much of it said mrs orme if i were you i would strive to forget it  i do strive said the other and then she took the hand which mrs orme had stretched out to her and that lady got up and kissed her  dearest friend said mrs orme if we can comfort you we will and then they sobbed in each others arms  in the mean time sir peregrine was sitting alone thinking he sat thinking with his glass of claret untouched by his side and with the biscuit which he had taken lying untouched upon the table as he sat he had raised one leg upon the other placing his foot on his knee and he held it there with his hand upon his instep and so he sat without moving for some quarter of an hour trying to use all his mind on the subject which occupied it at last he roused himself almost with a start and leaving his chair walked three or four times the length of the room why should i not at last he said to himself stopping suddenly and placing his hand upon the table why should i not if it pleases me it shall not injure himnor her and then he walked again but i will ask edith he said still speaking to himself if she says that she disapproves of it i will not do it and then he left the room while the wine still remained untasted on the table  illustration why should i not  on the day following christmas mr furnival went up to town and mr round juniormat round as he was called in the professioncame to him at his chambers a promise had been made to the barrister by round and crook that no active steps should be taken against lady mason on the part of joseph mason of groby without notice being given to mr furnival and this visit by appointment was made in consequence of that promise  you see said matthew round when that visit was nearly brought to a close that we are pressed very hard to go on with this and if we do not somebody else will  nevertheless if i were you i should decline said mr furnival  youre looking to your client not to ours sir said the attorney the fact is that the whole case is very queer it was proved on the last trial that bolster and kenneby were witnesses to a deed on the 14th of july and that was all that was proved now we can prove that they were on that day witnesses to another deed were they witnesses to two  why should they not be  that is for us to see we have written to them both to come up to us and in order that we might be quite on the square i thought it right to tell you  thank you yes i cannot complain of you and what form do you think that your proceedings will take  joseph mason talks of indicting her forforgery said the attorney pausing a moment before he dared to pronounce the dread word  indict her for forgery said furnival with a start and yet the idea was one which had been for some days present to his minds eye  i do not say so said round i have as yet seen none of the witnesses myself if they are prepared to prove that they did sign two separate documents on that day the thing must pass off it was clear to mr furnival that even mr round junior would be glad that it should pass off and then he also sat thinking might it not be probable that with a little judicious exercise of their memory those two witnesses would remember that they had signed two documents or at any rate looking to the lapse of the time that they might be induced to forget altogether whether they had signed one two or three or even if they could be mystified so that nothing could be proved it would still be well with his client indeed no magistrate would commit such a person as lady mason especially after so long an interval and no grand jury would find a bill against her except upon evidence that was clear well defined and almost indubitable if any point of doubt could be shown she might be brought off without a trial if only she would be true to herself at the former trial there was the existing codicil and the fact also that the two surviving reputed witnesses would not deny their signatures these signaturesif they were genuine signatureshad been attached with all proper formality and the form used went to state that the testator had signed the instrument in the presence of them all they all being present together at the same time the survivors had both asserted that when they did affix their names the three were then present as was also sir joseph but there had been a terrible doubt even then as to the identity of the document and a doubt also as to there having been any signature made by one of the reputed witnessesby that one namely who at the time of that trial was dead now another document was forthcoming purporting to have been witnessed on the same day by these two surviving witnesses if that document were genuine and if these two survivors should be clear that they had written their names but once on that 14th of july in such case could it be possible to quash further public inquiry the criminal prosecution might not be possible as a first proceeding but if the estate were recovered at common law would not the criminal prosecution follow as a matter of course and then mr furnival thought it all over again and again  if this document were genuinethis new document which the man dockwrath stated that he had foundthis deed of separation of partnership which purported to have been executed on that 14th of july that was now the one important question if it were genuine and why should there not be as strong a question of the honesty of that document as of the other mr furnival well knew that no fraudulent deed would be forged and produced without a motive and that if he impugned this deed he must show the motive motive enough there was no doubt mason might have had it forged in order to get the property or dockwrath to gratify his revenge but in such case it would be a forgery of the present day there could have been no motive for such a forgery twenty years ago the paper the writing the attested signature of martock the other party to it would prove that it had not been got up and manufactured now dockwrath would not dare to bring forward such a forgery as that there was no hope of any such result  but might not he furnival if the matter were pushed before a jury make them think that the two documents stood balanced against each other and that lady masons respectability her long possession together with the vile malignity of her antagonists gave the greater probability of honesty to the disputed codicil mr furnival did think that he might induce a jury to acquit her but he terribly feared that he might not be able to induce the world to acquit her also as he thought of all the case he seemed to put himself apart from the world at large he did not question himself as to his own belief but seemed to feel that it would suffice for him if he could so bring it about that her other friends should think her innocent it would by no means suffice for him to secure for her son the property and for her a simple acquittal it was not that he dreaded the idea of thinking her guilty himself perhaps he did so think her nowhe half thought her so at any rate but he greatly dreaded the idea of others thinking so it might be well to buy up dockwrath if it were possible if it were possible but then it was not possible that he himself could have a hand in such a matter could crabwitz do it no he thought not and then at this moment he was not certain that he could depend on crabwitz  and why should he trouble himself in this way mr furnival was a man loyal to his friends at heart had lady mason been a man and had he pulled that man through great difficulties in early life he would have been loyally desirous of carrying him through the same or similar difficulties at any after period in that cause which he had once battled he was always ready to do battle without reference to any professional consideration of triumph or profit it was to this feeling of loyalty that he had owed much of his success in life and in such a case as this it may be supposed that that feeling would be strong but then such a feeling presumed a case in which he could sympathisein which he could believe would it be well that he should allow himself to feel the same interest in this case to maintain respecting it the same personal anxiety if he ceased to believe in it he did ask himself the question and he finally answered it in the affirmative he had beaten joseph mason once in a good standup fight and having done so having thus made the matter his own it was necessary to his comfort that he should beat him again if another fight were to be fought lady mason was his client and all the associations of his life taught him to be true to her as such  and as we are thus searching into his innermost heart we must say more than this mrs furnival perhaps had no sufficient grounds for those terrible fears of hers but nevertheless the mistress of orley farm was very comely in the eyes of the lawyer her eyes when full of tears were very bright and her hand as it lay in his was very soft he laid out for himself no scheme of wickedness with reference to her he purposely entertained no thoughts which he knew to be wrong but nevertheless he did feel that he liked to have her by him that he liked to be her adviser and friend that he liked to wipe the tears from those eyesnot by a material handkerchief from his pocket but by immaterial manly sympathy from his bosom and that he liked also to feel the pressure of that hand mrs furnival had become solid and heavy and red and though he himself was solid and heavy and red alsomore so indeed in proportion than his poor wife for his redness as i have said before had almost reached a purple hue nevertheless his eye loved to look upon the beauty of a lovely woman his ear loved to hear the tone of her voice and his hand loved to meet the soft ripeness of her touch it was very wrong that it should have been so but the case is not without a parallel  and therefore he made up his mind that he would not desert lady mason he would not desert her but how would he set about the fighting that would be necessary in her behalf he was well aware of this that if he fought at all he must fight now it would not do to let the matter go on till she should be summoned to defend herself steps which might now be available would be altogether unavailable in two or three months timewould be so perhaps if he allowed two or three weeks to pass idly by him mr round luckily was not disposed to hurry his proceedings nor as far as he was concerned was there any bitterness of antagonism but with both mason and dockwrath there would be hot haste and hotter malice from those who were really her enemies she could expect no quarter  he was to return on that evening to noningsby and on the following day he would go over to the cleeve he knew that lady mason was staying there but his object in making that visit would not be merely that he might see her but also that he might speak to sir peregrine and learn how far the baronet was inclined to support his neighbour in her coming tribulation he would soon be able to ascertain what sir peregrine really thoughtwhether he suspected the possibility of any guilt and he would ascertain also what was the general feeling in the neighbourhood of hamworth it would be a great thing if he could spread abroad a conviction that she was an injured woman it would be a great thing even if he could make it known that the great people of the neighbourhood so thought the jurymen of alston would be mortal men and it might be possible that they should be imbued with a favourable bias on the subject before they assembled in their box for its consideration  he wished that he knew the truth in the matter or rather he wished he could know whether or no she were innocent without knowing whether or no she were guilty the fight in his hands would be conducted on terms so much more glorious if he could feel sure of her innocence but then if he attempted that and she were not innocent all might be sacrificed by the audacity of his proceedings he could not venture that unless he were sure of his ground for a moment or two he thought that he would ask her the question he said to himself that he could forgive the fault that it had been repented ere this he did not doubt and it would be sweet to say to her that it was very grievous but that yet it might be forgiven it would be sweet to feel that she was in his hands and that he would treat her with mercy and kindness but then a hundred other thoughts forbade him to think more of this if she had been guiltyif she declared her guilt to himwould not restitution be necessary in that case her son must know it and all the world must know it such a confession would be incompatible with that innocence before the world which it was necessary that she should maintain moreover he must be able to proclaim aloud his belief in her innocence and how could he do that knowing her to be guiltyknowing that she also knew that he had such knowledge it was impossible that he should ask any such question or admit of any such confidence  it would be necessary if the case did come to a trial that she should employ some attorney the matter must come into the barristers hands in the usual way through a solicitors house and it would be well that the person employed should have a firm faith in his client what could he sayhe as a barristerif the attorney suggested to him that the lady might possibly be guilty as he thought of all these things he almost dreaded the difficulties before him  he rang the bell for crabwitzthe peculiar bell which crabwitz was bound to answerhaving first of all gone through a little ceremony with his chequebook crabwitz entered still sulky in his demeanour for as yet the old anger had not been appeased and it was still a doubtful matter in the clerks mind whether or no it might not be better for him to seek a master who would better appreciate his services a more lucrative position it might be difficult for him to find but money is not everything as crabwitz said to himself more than once  crabwitz said mr furnival looking with a pleasant face at his clerk i am leaving town this evening and i shall be absent for the next ten days if you like you can go away for a holiday  its rather late in the season now sir said crabwitz gloomily as though he were determined not to be pleased  it is a little late as you say but i really could not manage it earlier come crabwitz you and i should not quarrel your work has been a little hard but then so has mine also  i fancy you like it sir  ha ha like it indeed but so do you like itin its way come crabwitz you have been an excellent servant to me and i dont think that on the whole i have been a bad master to you  i am making no complaint sir  but youre cross because ive kept you in town a little too long come crabwitz you must forget all that you have worked very hard this year past here is a cheque for fifty pounds get out of town for a fortnight or so and amuse yourself  im sure im very much obliged sir said crabwitz putting out his hand and taking the cheque he felt that his master had got the better of him and he was still a little melancholy on that account he would have valued his grievance at that moment almost more than the fifty pounds especially as by the acceptance of it he surrendered all right to complain for some considerable time to come  bytheby crabwitz said mr furnival as the clerk was about to leave the room  yes sir said crabwitz  you have never chanced to hear of an attorney named dockwrath i suppose  what in london mr furnival  no i fancy he has no place of business in town he lives i know at hamworth  its he you mean sir that is meddling in this affair of lady masons  what you have heard of that have you  oh yes sir its being a good deal talked about in the profession messrs round and crooks leading young man was up here with me the other day and he did say a good deal about it hes a very decent young man considering his position is smart  and he knows dockwrath does he  well sir i cant say that he knows much of the man but dockwrath has been at their place of business pretty constant of late and he and mr matthew seem thick enough together  oh they do do they  so smart tells me i dont know how it is myself sir i dont suppose this dockwrath is a very  no no exactly i dare say not youve never seen him yourself crabwitz  who sir i sir no sir ive never set eyes on the man sir from all i hear its not very likely he should come here and im sure it is not at all likely that i should go to him  mr furnival sat thinking awhile and the clerk stood waiting opposite to him leaning with both his hands upon the table you dont know any one in the neighbourhood of hamworth i suppose mr furnival said at last  who sir i sir not a soul sir i never was there in my life  ill tell you why i ask i strongly suspect that that man dockwrath is at some very foul play and then he told to his clerk so much of the whole story of lady mason and her affairs as he chose that he should know it is plain enough that he may give lady mason a great deal of annoyance he ended by saying  theres no doubting that sir said crabwitz and to tell the truth i believe his mind is made up to do it  you dont think that anything could be done by seeing him of course lady mason has got nothing to compromise her sons estate is as safe as my hat but  the people at rounds think it isnt quite so safe sir  then the people at rounds know nothing about it but lady mason is so averse to legal proceedings that it would be worth her while to have matters settled you understand  yes sir i understand would not an attorney be the best person sir  not just at present crabwitz lady mason is a very dear friend of mine  yes sir we know that said crabwitz  if you could make any pretence for running down to hamworthchange of air you know for a week or so its a beautiful country just the place you like and you might find out whether anything could be done eh  mr crabwitz was well aware from the first that he did not get fifty pounds for nothing     chapter xxvi  why should i not   a day or two after his conversation with crabwitz as described in the last chapter mr furnival was driven up to the door of sir peregrine ormes house in a hamworth fly he had come over by train from alston on purpose to see the baronet whom he found seated in his library at that very moment he was again asking himself those questions which he had before asked as he was walking up and down his own diningroom why should i not he said to himselfunless indeed it will make her unhappy and then the barrister was shown into his room muffled up to his eyes in his winter clothing  sir peregrine and mr furnival were well known to each other and had always met as friends they had been interested on the same side in the first orley farm case and possessed a topic of sympathy in their mutual dislike to joseph mason of groby park sir peregrine therefore was courteous and when he learned the subject on which he was to be consulted he became almost more than courteous  oh yes shes staying here mr furnival would you like to see her  before i leave i shall be glad to see her sir peregrine but if i am justified in regarding you as specially her friend it may perhaps be well that i should first have some conversation with you sir peregrine in answer to this declared that mr furnival certainly would be so justified that he did regard himself as lady masons special friend and that he was ready to hear anything that the barrister might have to say to him  many of the points of this case have already been named so often and will i fear be necessarily named so often again that i will spare the repetition when it is possible mr furnival on this occasion told sir peregrinenot all that he had heard but all that he thought it necessary to tell and soon became fully aware that in the baronets mind there was not the slightest shadow of suspicion that lady mason could have been in any way to blame he the baronet was thoroughly convinced that mr mason was the great sinner in this matter and that he was prepared to harass an innocent and excellent lady from motives of disappointed cupidity and longsustained malice which made him seem in sir peregrines eyes a being almost too vile for humanity and of dockwrath he thought almost as badlyonly that dockwrath was below the level of his thinking of lady mason he spoke as an excellent and beautiful woman driven to misery by unworthy persecution and so spoke with an enthusiasm that was surprising to mr furnival it was very manifest that she would not want for friendly countenance if friendly countenance could carry her through her difficulties  there was no suspicion against lady mason in the mind of sir peregrine and mr furnival was careful not to arouse any such feeling when he found that the baronet spoke of her as being altogether pure and good he also spoke of her in the same tone but in doing so his game was very difficult let him do his worst mr furnival said sir peregrine and let her remain tranquil that is my advice to lady mason it is not possible that he can really injure her  it is possible that he can do nothingvery probable that he can do nothing but nevertheless sir peregrine  i would have no dealing with him or his i would utterly disregard them if he or they or any of them choose to take steps to annoy her let her attorney manage that in the usual way i am no lawyer myself mr furnival but that i think is the manner in which things of this kind should be arranged i do not know whether they have still the power of disputing the will but if so let them do it  gradually by very slow degrees mr furnival made sir peregrine understand that the legal doings now threatened were not of that naturethat mr mason did not now talk of proceeding at law for the recovery of the property but for the punishment of his fathers widow as a criminal and at last the dreadful word forgery dropped from his lips  who dares to make such a charge as that demanded the baronet while fire literally flashed from his eyes in his anger and when he was told that mr mason did make such a charge he called him a mean unmanly dastard i do not believe that he would dare to make it against a man said sir peregrine  but there was the fact of the chargethe fact that it had been placed in the hands of respectable attorneys with instructions to them to press it onand the fact also that the evidence by which that charge was to be supported possessed at any rate a primâ facie appearance of strength all that it was necessary to explain to sir peregrine as it would also be necessary to explain it to lady mason  am i to understand then that you also think began sir peregrine  you are not to understand that i think anything injurious to the lady but i do fear that she is in a position of much jeopardy and that great care will be necessary  good heavens do you mean to say that an innocent person can under such circumstances be in danger in this country  an innocent person sir peregrine may be in danger of very great annoyance and also of very great delay in proving that innocence innocent people have died under the weight of such charges we must remember that she is a woman and therefore weaker than you or i  yes yes but still you do not say that you think she can be in any real danger it seemed from the tone of the old mans voice as though he were almost angry with mr furnival for supposing that such could be the case and you intend to tell her all this he asked  i fear that as her friend neither you nor i will be warranted in keeping her altogether in the dark think what her feelings would be if she were summoned before a magistrate without any preparation  no magistrate would listen to such a charge said sir peregrine  in that he must be guided by the evidence  i would sooner throw up my commission than lend myself in any way to a proceeding so iniquitous  this was all very well and the existence of such a feeling showed great generosity and perhaps also poetic chivalry on the part of sir peregrine orme but it was not the way of the world and so mr furnival was obliged to explain magistrates would listen to the chargewould be forced to listen to the chargeif the evidence were apparently sound a refusal on the part of a magistrate to do so would not be an act of friendship to lady mason as mr furnival endeavoured to explain and you wish to see her sir peregrine asked at last  i think she should be told but as she is in your house i will of course do nothing in which you do not concur upon which sir peregrine rang the bell and desired the servant to take his compliments to lady mason and beg her attendance in the library if it were quite convenient tell her said sir peregrine that mr furnival is here  when the message was given to her she was seated with mrs orme and at the moment she summoned strength to say that she would obey the invitation without displaying any special emotion while the servant was in the room but when the door was shut her friend looked at her and saw that she was as pale as death she was pale and her limbs quivered and that look of agony which now so often marked her face was settled on her brow mrs orme had never yet seen her with such manifest signs of suffering as she wore at this instant  i suppose i must go to them she said slowly rising from her seat and it seemed to mrs orme that she was forced to hold by the table to support herself  mr furnival is a friend is he not  oh yes a kind friend but  they shall come in here if you like it better dear  oh no i will go to them it would not do that i should seem so weak what must you think of me to see me so  i do not wonder at it dear said mrs orme coming round to her such cruelty would kill me i wonder at your strength rather than your weakness and then she kissed her what was there about the woman that had made all those fond of her that came near her  mrs orme walked with her across the hall and left her only at the library door there she pressed her hand and again kissed her and then lady mason turned the handle of the door and entered the room mr furnival when he looked at her was startled by the pallor of her face but nevertheless he thought that she had never looked so beautiful dear lady mason said he i hope you are well  sir peregrine advanced to her and handed her over to his own armchair had she been a queen in distress she could not have been treated with more gentle deference but she never seemed to count upon this or in any way to assume it as her right i should accuse her of what i regard as a sin against all good taste were i to say that she was humble in her demeanour but there was a soft meekness about her an air of feminine dependence a proneness to lean and almost to cling as she leaned which might have been felt as irresistible by any man she was a woman to know in her deep sorrow rather than in her joy and happiness one with whom one would love to weep rather than to rejoice and indeed the present was a time with her for weeping not for rejoicing  sir peregrine looked as though he were her father as he took her hand and the barrister immediately comforted himself with the remembrance of the baronets great age it was natural too that lady mason should hang on him in his own house so mr furnival contented himself at the first moment with touching her hand and hoping that she was well she answered hardly a word to either of them but she attempted to smile as she sat down and murmured something about the trouble she was giving them  mr furnival thinks it best that you should be made aware of the steps which are being taken by mr mason of groby park began sir peregrine i am no lawyer myself and therefore of course i cannot put my advice against his  i am sure that both of you will tell me for the best she said  in such a matter as this it is right that you should be guided by him that he is as firmly your friend as i am there can be no doubt  i believe lady mason trusts me in that said the lawyer  indeed i do i would trust you both in anything she said  and there can be no doubt that he must be able to direct you for the best i say so much at the first because i myself so thoroughly despise that man in yorkshirei am so convinced that anything which his malice may prompt him to do must be futile that i could not myself have thought it needful to pain you by what must now be said  this was a dreadful commencement but she bore it and even was relieved by it indeed no tale that mr furnival could have to tell after such an exordium would be so bad as that which she had feared as the possible result of his visit he might have come there to let her know that she was at once to be carried awayimmediately to be taken to her trialperhaps to be locked up in gaol in her ignorance of the law she could only imagine what might or might not happen to her at any moment and therefore the words which sir peregrine had spoken relieved her rather than added to her fears  and then mr furnival began his tale and gradually put before her the facts of the matter this he did with a choice of language and a delicacy of phraseology which were admirable for he made her clearly understand the nature of the accusation which was brought against her without using any word which was in itself harsh in its bearing he said nothing about fraud or forgery or false evidence but he made it manifest to her that joseph mason had now instructed his lawyer to institute a criminal proceeding against her for having forged a codicil to her husbands will  i must bear it as best i may she said may the lord give me strength to bear it  it is terrible to think of said sir peregrine but nobody can doubt how it will end you are not to suppose that mr furnival intends to express any doubt as to your ultimate triumph what we fear for you is the pain you must endure before this triumph comes  ah if that were all as the baronet finished speaking she looked furtively into the lawyers face to see how far the meaning of these smooth words would be supported by what she might read there would he also think that a final triumph did certainly await her sir peregrines real opinion was easily to be learned either from his countenance or from his words but it was not so with mr furnival in mr furnivals face and from mr furnivals words could be learned only that which mr furnival wished to declare he saw that glance and fully understood it and he knew instinctively on the spur of the moment that he must now either assure her by a lie or break down all her hopes by the truth that final triumph was not certain to herwas very far from certain should he now be honest to his friend or dishonest one great object with him was to secure the support which sir peregrine could give by his weight in the county and therefore as sir peregrine was present it was needful that he should be dishonest arguing thus he looked the lie and lady mason derived more comfort from that look than from all sir peregrines words  and then those various details were explained to her which mr furnival understood that mr dockwrath had picked up they went into that matter of the partnership deed and questions were asked as to the man kenneby and the woman bolster they might both lady mason said have been witnesses to half a dozen deeds on that same day for aught she knew to the contrary she had been present with sir joseph as far as she could now remember during the whole of that morning in and out sir peregrine as you can understand sir peregrine said that he did understand perfectly she did know that mr usbech had been there for many hours that day probably from ten to two or three and no doubt therefore much business was transacted she herself remembered nothing but the affair of the will but then that was natural seeing that there was no other affair in which she had specially interested herself  no doubt these people did witness both the deeds said sir peregrine for myself i cannot conceive how that wretched man can be so silly as to spend his money on such a case as this  he would do anything for revenge said mr furnival  and then lady mason was allowed to go back to the drawingroom and what remained to be said was said between the two gentlemen alone sir peregrine was very anxious that his own attorneys should be employed and he named messrs slow and bideawhile than whom there were no more respectable men in the whole profession but then mr furnival feared that they were too respectable they might look at the matter in so straightforward a light as to fancy their client really guilty and what might happen then old slow would not conceal the truth for all the baronets in englandno nor for all the pretty women the touch of lady masons hand and the tear in her eye would be nothing to old slow mr furnival therefore was obliged to explain that slow and bideawhile did not undertake that sort of business  but i should wish it to be taken up through them there must be some expenditure mr furnival and i should prefer that they should arrange about that  mr furnival made no further immediate objection and consented at last to having an interview with one of the firm on the subject provided of course that that member of the firm came to him at his chambers and then he took his leave nothing positive had been done or even settled to be done on this morning but the persons most interested in the matter had been made to understand that the affair was taking an absolute palpable substance and that steps must be takenindeed would be taken almost immediately mr furnival as he left the house resolved to employ the attorneys whom he might think best adapted for the purpose he would settle that matter with slow and bideawhile afterwards  and then as he returned to noningsby he wondered at his persistence in the matter he believed that his client had been guilty he believed that this codicil was no real instrument made by sir joseph mason and so believing would it not be better for him to wash his hands of the whole affair others did not think so and would it not be better that such others should be her advisers was he not taking up for himself endless trouble and annoyance that could have no useful purpose so he argued with himself and yet by the time that he had reached noningsby he had determined that he would stand by lady mason to the last he hated that man mason as he declared to himself when providing himself with reasons for his resolve and regarded his bitter malicious justice as more criminal than any crime of which lady mason might have been guilty and then as he leaned back in the railway carriage he still saw her pale face before him still heard the soft tone of her voice and was still melted by the tear in her eye young man young friend of mine who art now filled to the overflowing of thy brain with poetry with chivalry and love thou seest seated opposite to thee there that grim old man with long snuffy nose with sharp piercing eyes with scanty frizzled hairs he is rich and cross has been three times married and has often quarrelled with his children he is fond of his wine and snores dreadfully after dinner to thy seeming he is a dry withered stick from which all the sap of sentiment has been squeezed by the rubbing and friction of years poetry the feeling if not the words of poetryis he not dead to it even as the pavement is dead over which his wheels trundle oh my young friend thou art ignorant in thisas in most other things he may not twitter of sentiment as thou doest nor may i trundle my hoop along the high road as do the little boys the fitness of things forbids it but that old mans heart is as soft as thine if thou couldst but read it the body dries up and withers away and the bones grow old the brain too becomes decrepit as do the sight the hearing and the soul but the heart that is tender once remains tender to the last  lady mason when she left the library walked across the hall towards the drawingroom and then she paused she would fain remain alone for a while if it were possible and therefore she turned aside into a small breakfast parlour which was used every morning but which was rarely visited afterwards during the day here she sat leaving the door slightly open so that she might know when mr furnival left the baronet here she sat for a full hour waitingwaitingwaiting there was no sofa or loungingchair in the room reclining in which she could remain there half sleeping sitting comfortably at her ease but she placed herself near the table and leaning there with her face upon her hand she waited patiently till mr furnival had gone that her mind was full of thoughts i need hardly say but yet the hour seemed very long to her at last she heard the library door open she heard sir peregrines voice as he stood in the hall and shook hands with his departing visitor she heard the sound of the wheels as the fly moved upon the gravel and then she heard sir peregrine again shut the library door behind him  she did not immediately get up from her chair she still waited awhile perhaps for another period of ten minutes and then she noiselessly left the room and moving quickly and silently across the hall she knocked at sir peregrines door this she did so gently that at first no answer was made to her then she knocked again hardly louder but with a repeated rap and sir peregrine summoned her to come in may i trouble you once morefor one moment she said  certainly certainly it is no trouble i am glad that you are here in the house at this time that you may see me at any moment that you may wish  i do not know why you should be so good to me  because you are in great grief in undeserved grief because lady mason my services are at your command i will act for you as i would for adaughter  you hear now of what it is that they accuse me  yes he said i do hear and as he spoke he came round so that he was standing near to her but with his back to the fireplace i do hear and i blush to think that there is a man in england holding the position of a county magistrate who can so forget all that is due to honesty to humanity and to selfrespect  you do not then think that i have been guilty of this thing  guiltyi think you guilty no nor does he think so it is impossible that he should think so i am no more sure of my own innocence than of yours and as he spoke he took both her hands and looked into her face and his eyes also were full of tears you may be sure of this that neither i nor edith will ever think you guilty  dearest edith she said she had never before called sir peregrines daughterinlaw by her christian name and as she now did so she almost felt that she had sinned but sir peregrine took it in good part she is dearest he said and be sure of this that she will be true to you through it all  and so they stood for a while without further speech he still held both her hands and the tears still stood in his eyes her eyes were turned to the ground and from them the tears were running fast at first they ran silently without audible sobbing and sir peregrine with his own old eyes full of salt water hardly knew that she was weeping but gradually the drops fell upon his hand one by one at first and then faster and faster and soon there came a low sob a sob all but suppressed but which at last forced itself forth and then her head fell upon his shoulder my dear he said himself hardly able to speak my poor dear my illused dear and as she withdrew one hand from his that she might press a handkerchief to her face his vacant arm passed itself round her waist my poor illused dear he said again as he pressed her to his old heart and leaning over her he kissed her lips  so she stood for some few seconds feeling that she was pressed close by the feeble pressure of his arm and then she gradually sank through from his embrace and fell upon her knees at his feet she knelt at his feet supporting herself with one arm upon the table and with the other hand she still held his hand over which her head was bowed my friend she said still sobbing and sobbing loudly now my friend that god has sent me in my trouble and then with words that were wholly inaudible she murmured some prayer on his behalf  i am better now she said raising herself quickly to her feet when a few seconds had passed i am better now and she stood erect before him by gods mercy i will endure it i think i can endure it now  if i can lighten the load  you have lightened itof half its weight but sir peregrine i will leave this  leave this go away from the cleeve  yes i will not destroy the comfort of your home by the wretchedness of my position i will not  lady mason my house is altogether at your service if you will be led by me in this matter you will not leave it till this cloud shall have passed by you you will be better to be alone now and then before she could answer him further he led her to the door she felt that it was better for her to be alone and she hastened up the stairs to her own chamber  and why should i not said sir peregrine to himself as he again walked the length of the library     chapter xxvii  commerce   lucius mason was still staying at noningsby when mr furnival made his visit to sir peregrine and on that afternoon he received a note from his mother indeed there were three notes passed between them on that afternoon for he wrote an answer to his mother and then received a reply to that answer lady mason told him that she did not intend to return home to the farm quite immediately and explained that her reason for not doing so was the necessity that she should have assistance and advice at this period of her trouble she did not say that she misdoubted the wisdom of her sons counsels but it appeared to him that she intended to signify to him that she did so and he answered her in words that were sore and almost bitter i am sorry he said that you and i cannot agree about a matter that is of such vital concern to both of us but as it is so we can only act as each thinks best you for yourself and i for myself i am sure however that you will believe that my only object is your happiness and your fair name which is dearer to me than anything else in the world in answer to this she had written again immediately filling her letter with sweet words of motherly love telling him that she was sure quite sure of his affection and kind spirit and excusing herself for not putting the matter altogether in his hands by saying that she was forced to lean on those who had supported her from the beginningthrough that former trial which had taken place when he lucius was yet a baby and dearest lucius you must not be angry with me she went on to say i am suffering much under this cruel persecution but my sufferings would be more than doubled if my own boy quarrelled with me lucius when he received this flung up his head quarrel with her he said to himself nothing on earth would make me quarrel with her but i cannot say that that is right which i think to be wrong his feelings were good and honest and kindly too in their way but tenderness of heart was not his weakness i should wrong him if i were to say that he was hardhearted but he flattered himself that he was justhearted which sometimes is nearly the sameas had been the case with his father before him and was now the case with his halfbrother joseph  the day after this was his last at noningsby he had told lady staveley that he intended to go and though she had pressed his further stay remarking that none of the young people intended to move till after twelfthnight nevertheless he persisted with the young people of the house themselves he had not much advanced himself and altogether he did not find himself thoroughly happy in the judges house they were more thoughtless than heas he thought they did not understand him and therefore he would leave them besides there was a great day of hunting coming on at which everybody was to take a part and as he did not hunt that gave him another reason for going they have nothing to do but amuse themselves he said to himself but i have a mans work before me and a mans misfortunes i will go home and face both  in all this there was much of conceit much of pride much of deficient educationdeficiency in that special branch of education which england has imparted to the best of her sons but which is now becoming out of fashion he had never learned to measure himself against othersi do not mean his knowledge or his bookacquirements but the everyday conduct of his lifeand to perceive that that which is insignificant in others must be insignificant in himself also to those around him at noningsby his extensive reading respecting the iapetidæ recommended him not at all nor did his agricultural ambitionsnot even to felix graham as a companion though felix graham could see further into his character than did the others he was not such as they were he had not the unpretentious selfcontrolling humour perfectly free from all conceit which was common to them life did not come easy to him and the effort which he was ever making was always visible all men should ever be making efforts no doubt but those efforts should not be conspicuous but yet lucius mason was not a bad fellow and young staveley showed much want of discernment when he called him emptyheaded and selfish those epithets were by no means applicable to him that he was not emptyheaded is certain and he was moreover capable of a great selfsacrifice  that his talents and good qualities were appreciated by one person in the house seemed evident to lady staveley and the other married ladies of the party miss furnival as they all thought had not found him emptyheaded and indeed it may be doubted whether lady staveley would have pressed his stay at noningsby had miss furnival been less gracious dear lady staveley was always living in a fever lest her only son the light of her eyes should fall irrevocably in love with some lady that was by no means goods enough for him revocably in love he was daily falling but some day he would go too deep and the waters would close over his wellloved head now in her dear old favouring eyes sophia furnival was by no means good enough and it had been quite clear that augustus had become thoroughly lost in his attempts to bring about a match between felix graham and the barristers daughter in preparing the bath for his friend he had himself fallen bodily into the water he was always at miss furnivals side as long as miss furnival would permit it but it seemed to lady staveley that miss furnival luckily was quite as fond of having lucius mason at her sidethat of the two she perhaps preferred lucius mason that her taste and judgment should be so bad was wonderful to lady staveley but this depravity though wonderful was useful and therefore lucius mason might have been welcome to remain at noningsby  it may however be possible that miss furnival knew what she was doing quite as well as lady staveley could know for her in the first place she may possibly have thought it indiscreet to admit mr staveleys attentions with too much freedom she may have doubted their sincerity or feared to give offence to the family or mr mason may in her sight have been the preferable suitor that his gifts of intellect were at any rate equal to those of the other there can be no doubt then his gifts of fortune were already his own and for ought that miss furnival knew might be equal to any that would ever appertain to the other gentleman that lady staveley should think her swan better looking than lady masons goose was very natural but then lady mason would no doubt have regarded the two birds in an exactly opposite light it is only fair to conceive that miss furnival was a better judge than either of them  on the evening before his departure the whole party had been playing commerce for the rule of the house during these holidays was this that all the amusements brought into vogue were to be adapted to the children if the grownup people could adapt themselves to them so much the better for them if not so much the worse they must in such case provide for themselves on the whole the grownup people seemed to live nearly as jovial a life as did the children whether the judge himself was specially fond of commerce i cannot say but he persisted in putting in the whole pool and played through the entire game rigidly fighting for the same pool on behalf of a very small grandchild who sat during the whole time on his knee there are those who call cards the devils books but we will presume that the judge was of a different way of thinking  on this special evening sophia had been sitting next to augustusa young man can always arrange these matters in his own housebut had nevertheless lost all her lives early in the game i will not have any cheating tonight she had said to her neighbour i will take my chance and if i die i die one can die but once and so she had died three times indeed instead of once only and had left the table lucius mason also had died he generally did die the first having no aptitude for a collection of kings or aces and so they two came together over the fire in the second drawingroom far away from the cardplayers there was nothing at all remarkable in this as mr furnival and one or two others who did not play commerce were also there but nevertheless they were separated from those of the party who were most inclined to criticise their conduct  so you are leaving tomorrow mr mason said sophia  yes i go home tomorrow after breakfast to my own house where for some weeks to come i shall be absolutely alone  your mother is staying at the cleeve i think  yesand intends remaining there as she tells me i wish with all my heart she were at orley farm  papa saw her yesterday he went over to the cleeve on purpose to see her and this morning he has been talking to me about her i cannot tell you how i grieve for her  it is very sad very sad but i wish she were in her own house under the circumstances as they now are i think it would be better for her to be there than elsewhere her name has been disgraced  no mr mason not disgraced  yes disgraced mark you i do not say that she has been disgraced and pray do not suppose it possible that i should think so but a great opprobrium has been thrown on her name and it would be better i think that she should remain at home till she has cast it off from her even for myself i feel it almost wrong to be here nor would i have come had i known when i did come as much as i do know now  but no one can for a moment think that your mother has done anything that she should not have done  then why do so many people talk of her as though she had committed a great crime miss furnival i know that she is innocent i know it as surely as i know the fact of my own existence  and we all feel the same thing  but if you were in my placeif it were your father whose name was so bandied about in peoples mouths you would think that it behoved him to do nothing to go nowhere till he had forced the world to confess his innocence and this is ten times stronger with regard to a woman i have given my mother my counsel and i regret to say that she differs from me  why do you not speak to papa  i did once i went to him at his chambers and he rebuked me  rebuked you mr mason he did not do that intentionally i am sure i have heard him say that you are an excellent son  but nevertheless he did rebuke me he considered that i was travelling beyond my own concerns in wishing to interfere for the protection of my mothers name he said that i should leave it to such people as the staveleys and the ormes to guard her from ignominy and disgrace  oh he did not mean that  but to me it seems that it should be a sons first duty they are talking of trouble and of cost i would give every hour i have in the day and every shilling i own in the world to save her from one week of such suffering as she now endures but it cuts me to the heart when she tells me that because she is suffering therefore she must separate herself from me i think it would be better for her miss furnival to be staying at home with me than to be at the cleeve  the kindness of mrs orme must be a great support to her  and why should not my kindness be a support to heror rather my affection we know from whom all these scandals come my desire is to meet that man in a court of law and thrust these falsehoods down his throat  ah but you are a man  and therefore i would take the burden from her shoulders but no she will not trust to me the truth miss furnival is this that she has not yet learned to think of me as a man to her i am still the boy for whom she is bound to provide not the son who should bear for her all her cares as it is i feel that i do not dare again to trouble her with my advice  grandmamma is dead shouted out a shrill small voice from the cardtable oh grandmamma do have one of my lives look ive got three said another  thank you my dears but the natural term of my existence has come and i will not rebel against fate  oh grandmammawell let you have another grace  by no means charley indeed i am not clear that i am entitled to christian burial as it is  a case of felo de se i rather think said her son about this time of the night suicide does become common among the elders unfortunately for me the pistol that i have been snapping at my own head for the last halfhour always hangs fire  there was not much of lovemaking in the conversation which had taken place between young mason and sophia not much at least up to this point but a confidence had been established and before he left her he did say a word or two that was more tender in its nature you must not be in dudgeon with me he said for speaking to you of all this hitherto i have kept it all to myself and perhaps i should still have done so  oh no do not say that  i am in great grief it is dreadful to me to hear these things said and as yet i have found no sympathy  i can assure you mr mason that i do sympathise with you most sincerely i only wish my sympathy could be of more value  it will be invaluable he said not looking at her but fixing his eyes upon the fire if it be given with constancy from the first to the last of this sad affair  it shall be so given said miss furnival also looking at the fire  it will be tolerably long and men will say cruel things of us i can foresee this that it will be very hard to prove to the world with certainty that there is no foundation whatever for these charges if those who are now most friendly to us turn away from us  i will never turn away from you mr mason  then give me your hand on that and remember that such a promise in my ears means much he in his excitement had forgotten that there were others in the room who might be looking at them and that there was a vista open upon them direct from all the eyes at the cardtable but she did not forget it miss furnival could be very enthusiastic but she was one of those who in her enthusiasm rarely forgot anything nevertheless after a moments pause she gave him her hand there it is she said and you may be sure of this that with me also such a promise does mean something and now i will say good night and so having received the pressure of her hand she left him  i will get you your candle he said and so he did  good night papa she said kissing her father and then with a slight muttered word to lady staveley she withdrew having sacrificed the remainder of that evening for the sake of acceding to mr masons request respecting her pledge it could not be accounted strange that she should give her hand to the gentleman with whom she was immediately talking as she bade him good night  and now grandpapa is dead too said marian and theres nobody left but us three  and well divide said fanny sebright and so the game of commerce was brought to an end     chapter xxviii  monkton grange   during these days peregrine ormethough he was in love up to his very chin seriously in love acknowledging this matter to himself openly pulling his hair in the retirement of his bedroom and resolving that he would do that which he had hitherto in life always been successful in doingask namely boldly for that he wanted sorelyperegrine orme i say though he was in this condition did not in these days neglect his hunting a proper attendance upon the proceedings of the h h was the only duty which he had hitherto undertaken in return for all that his grandfather had done for him and i have no doubt that he conceived that he was doing a duty in going hither and thither about the county to their most distant meets at this period of the present season it happened that noningsby was more central to the proceedings of the hunt than the cleeve and therefore he was enabled to think that he was remaining away from home chiefly on business on one point however he had stoutly come to a resolution that question should be asked of madeline staveley before he returned to his grandfathers house  and now had arrived a special hunting morningspecial because the meet was in some degree a show meet appropriate for ladies at a comfortable distance from noningsby and affording a chance of amusement to those who sat in carriages as well as to those on horseback monkton grange was the wellknown name of the place a name perhaps dearer to the ladies than to the gentlemen of the country seeing that show meets do not always give the best sport monkton grange is an old farmhouse now hardly used as such having been left as regards the habitation in the hands of a head labourer but it still possesses the marks of ancient respectability and even of grandeur it is approached from the high road by a long double avenue of elms which still stand in all their glory the road itself has become narrow and the space between the side row of trees is covered by soft turf up which those coming to the meet love to gallop trying the fresh metal of their horses and the old house itself is surrounded by a moat dry indeed now for the most part but nevertheless an evident moat deep and well preserved with a bridge over it which fancy tells us must once have been a drawbridge it is here in front of the bridge that the old hounds sit upon their haunches resting quietly round the horses of the huntsmen while the young dogs move about and would wander if the whips allowed themone of the fairest sights to my eyes that this fair country of ours can show and here the sportsmen and ladies congregate by degrees men from a distance in dogcarts generally arriving first as being less able to calculate the time with accuracy there is room here too in the open space for carriages and there is one spot on which always stands old lord alstons chariot with the four posters an ancient sportsman he who still comes to some few favourite meets and though alston court is but eight miles from the grange the posthorses always look as though they had been made to do their best for his lordship likes to move fast even in his old age he is a tall thin man bent much with age and apparently too weak for much walking he is dressed from head to foot in a sportsmans garb with a broad stiffly starched coloured handkerchief tied rigidly round his neck one would say that old as he is he has sacrificed in no way to comfort it is with difficulty that he gets into his saddle his servant holding his rein and stirrup and giving him perhaps some other slight assistance but when he is there there he will remain all day and when his old blood warms he will gallop along the road with as much hot fervour as his grandson an old friend he of sir peregrines and why is not your grandfather here today he said on this occasion to young orme tell him from me that if he fails us in this way i shall think he is getting old lord alston was in truth five years older than sir peregrine but sir peregrine at this time was thinking of other things  illustration monkton grange  and then a very tidy little modern carriage bustled up the road a brougham made for a pair of horses which was well known to all hunting men in these parts it was very unpretending in its colour and harness but no vehicle more appropriate to its purpose ever carried two thoroughgoing sportsmen day after day about the country in this as it pulled up under the head tree of the avenue were seated the two miss tristrams the two miss tristrams were well known to the hamworth hunti will not merely say as fearless ridersof most girls who hunt as much can be said as that but they were judicious horsewomen they knew when to ride hard and when hard riding as regarded any necessary for the hunt would be absolutely thrown away they might be seen for half the day moving about the roads as leisurely or standing as quietly at the coverts side as might the seniors of the fields but when the time for riding did come when the hounds were really runningwhen other young ladies had begun to go homethen the miss tristrams were always therethere or thereabouts as their admirers would warmly boast  nor did they commence their days work as did other girls who came out on hunting mornings with most such it is clear to see that the object is pretty much the same here as in the ballroom spectatum veniunt veniunt spectentur ut ipsæ as it is proper natural and desirable that they should do by that word spectatum i would wish to signify something more than the mere use of the eyes perhaps an occasional word dropped here and there into the ears of a cavalier may be included in it and the spectentur also may include a word so received but the miss tristrams came for hunting perhaps there might be a slight shade of affectation in the manner by which they would appear to come for that and that only they would talk of nothing else at any rate during the earlier portion of the day when many listeners were by they were also well instructed as to the country to be drawn and usually had a word of import to say to the huntsman they were goodlooking fairhaired girls short in size with bright gray eyes and a short decisive mode of speaking it must not be imagined that they were altogether indifferent to such matters as are dear to the hearts of other girls they were not careless as to admiration and if report spoke truth of them were willing enough to establish themselves in the world but all their doings of that kind had a reference to their favourite amusement and they would as soon have thought of flirting with men who did not hunt as some other girls would with men who did not dance  i do not know that this kind of life had been altogether successful with them or that their father had been right to permit it he himself had formerly been a hunting man but he had become fat and lazy and the thing had dropped away from him occasionally he did come out with them but when he did not do so some other senior of the field would have them nominally under charge but practically they were as independent when going across the country as the young men who accompanied them i have expressed a doubt whether this life was successful with them and indeed such doubt was expressed by many of their neighbours it had been said of each of them for the last three years that she was engaged now to this man and then to that other but neither this man nor that other had yet made good the assertion and now people were beginning to say that no man was engaged to either of them hunting young ladies are very popular in the huntingfield i know no place in which girls receive more worship and attention but i am not sure but they may carry their enthusiasm too far for their own interests let their horsemanship be as perfect as it may be  the two girls on this occasion sat in their carriage till the groom brought up their horses and then it was wonderful to see with what ease they placed themselves in their saddles on such occasions they admitted no aid from the gentlemen around them but each stepping for an instant on a servants hand settled herself in a moment on horseback nothing could be more perfect than the whole thing but the wonder was that mr tristram should have allowed it  the party from noningsby consisted of six or seven on horseback besides those in the carriage among the former there were the two young ladies miss furnival and miss staveley and our friends felix graham augustus staveley and peregrine orme felix graham was not by custom a hunting man as he possessed neither time nor money for such a pursuit but today he was mounted on his friend staveleys second horse having expressed his determination to ride him as long as they two the man and the horse could remain together  i give you fair warning felix had said if i do not spare my own neck you cannot expect me to spare your horses legs  you may do your worst staveley had answered if you give him his head and let him have his own way he wont come to grief whatever you may do  on their road to monkton grange which was but three miles from noningsby peregrine orme had ridden by the side of miss staveley thinking more of her than of the affairs of the hunt prominent as they were generally in his thoughts how should he do it and when and in what way should he commence the deed he had an idea that it might be better for him if he could engender some closer intimacy between himself and madeline before he absolutely asked the fatal question but the closer intimacy did not seem to produce itself readily he had in truth known madeline staveley for many years almost since they were children together but lately during these christmas holidays especially there had not been between them that close conversational alliance which so often facilitates such an overture as that which peregrine was now desirous of making and worse again he had seen that there was such close conversational alliance between madeline and felix graham he did not on that account dislike the young barrister or call him even within his own breast a snob or an ass he knew well that he was neither the one nor the other but he knew as well that he could be no fit match for miss staveley and to tell the truth he did not suspect that either graham or miss staveley would think of such a thing it was not jealousy that tormented him so much as a diffidence in his own resources he made small attempts which did not succeed and therefore he determined that he would at once make a grand attempt he would create himself an opportunity before he left noningsby and would do it even today on horseback if he could find sufficient opportunity in taking a determined step like that he knew that he would not lack the courage  do you mean to ride today he said to madeline as they were approaching the bottom of the grange avenue for the last halfmile he had been thinking what he would say to her and thinking in vain and now at the last moment he could summon no words to his assistance more potent for his purpose than these  if you mean by riding mr orme going across the fields with you and the miss tristrams certainly not i should come to grief as you call it at the first ditch  and that is just what i shall do said felix graham who was at her other side  then if you take my advice youll remain with us in the wood and act as squire of dames what on earth would marian do if aught but good was to befall you  dear marian she gave me a special commission to bring her the foxs tail foxes tails are just like ladies  thank you mr graham ive heard you make some pretty compliments and that is about the prettiest  a faint heart will never win either the one or the other miss staveley  oh ah yes that will do very well under these circumstances i will accept the comparison  all of which very innocent conversation was overheard by peregrine orme riding on the other side of miss staveleys horse and why not neither graham nor miss staveley had any objection but how was it that he could not join in and take his share in it he had made one little attempt at conversation and that having failed he remained perfectly silent till they reached the large circle at the head of the avenue its no use this sort of thing he said to himself i must do it at a blow if i do it at all and then he rode away to the master of the hounds  as our party arrived at the open space the miss tristrams were stepping out of their carriage and they came up to shake hands with miss staveley  i am so glad to see you said the eldest it is so nice to have some ladies out besides ourselves  do keep up with us said the second its a very open country about here and anybody can ride it and then miss furnival was introduced to them does your horse jump miss furnival  i really do not know said sophia but i sincerely trust that if he does he will refrain today  dont say so said the eldest sportswoman if youll only begin it will come as easy to you as going along the road and then not being able to spare more of these idle moments they both went off to their horses walking as though their habits were no impediments to them and in half a minute they were seated  what is harriet on today asked staveley of a constant member of the hunt now harriet was the eldest miss tristram  a little brown mare she got last week that was a terrible brush we had on friday you werent out i think we killed in the open just at the edge of rotherham common harriet was one of the few that was up and i dont think the chestnut horse will be the better of it this season  that was the horse she got from griggs  yes she gave a hundred and fifty for him and im told he was as nearly done on friday as any animal you ever put your eyes on they say harriet cried when she got home now the gentleman who was talking about harriet on this occasion was one with whom she would no more have sat down to table than with her own groom  but though harriet may have cried when she got home on that fatal friday evening she was full of the triumph of the hunt on this morning it is not often that the hounds run into a fox and absolutely surround and kill him on the open ground and when this is done after a severe run there are seldom many there to see it if a man can fairly take a foxs brush on such an occasion as that let him do it otherwise let him leave it to the huntsman on the occasion in question it seems that harriet tristram might have done so and some one coming second to her had been gallant enough to do it for her  oh my lord you should have been out on friday she said to lord alston we had the prettiest thing i ever saw  a great deal too pretty for me my dear  oh you who know the roads so well would certainly have been up i suppose it was thirteen miles from cobbletons bushes to rotherham common  not much less indeed said his lordship unwilling to diminish the ladys triumph had a gentleman made the boast his lordship would have demonstrated that it was hardly more than eleven  i timed it accurately from the moment he went away said the lady and it was exactly fiftyseven minutes the first part of it was awfully fast then we had a little check at moseley bottom but for that nobody could have lived through it i never shall forget how deep it was coming up from there to cringleton i saw two men get off to ease their horses up the deep bit of plough and i would have done so too only my horse would not have stood for me to get up  i hope he was none the worse for it said the sporting character who had been telling staveley just now how she had cried when she got home that night  to tell the truth i fear it has done him no good he would not feed you know that night at all  and broke out into cold sweats said the gentleman  exactly said the lady not quite liking it but still enduring with patience  rather groggy on his pins the next morning suggested her friend  very groggy said harriet regarding the word as one belonging to fair sporting phraseology  and inclined to go very much on the points of his toes i know all about it miss tristam as well as though id seen him  theres nothing but rest for it i suppose  rest and regular exercisethats the chief thing and i should give him a mash as often as three times a week hell be all right again in three or four weeksthat is if hes sound you know  oh as sound as a bell said miss tristram  hell never be the same horse on a road though said the sporting gentlemen shaking his head and whispering to staveley  and now the time had come at which they were to move they always met at eleven and at ten minutes past to the moment jacob the huntsman would summons the old hounds from off their haunches i believe we may be moving jacob said mr williams the master  the time be up said jacob looking at a ponderous timekeeper that might with truth be called a huntingwatch and then they all moved slowly away back from the grange down a farmroad which led to monkton wood distant from the old house perhaps a quarter of a mile  may we go as far as the wood said miss furnival to augustus without being made to ride over hedges i mean  oh dear yes and ride about the wood half the day it will be an hour and a half before a fox will breakeven if he ever breaks  dear me how tired you will be of us now do say something pretty mr staveley  its not my métier we shall be tired not of you but of the thing galloping up and down the same cuts in the wood for an hour and a half is not exciting nor does it improve the matter much if we stand still as one should do by rights  that would be very slow  you need not be afraid they never do here everybody will be rushing about as though the very world depended on their galloping  im so glad thats just what i like  everybody except lord alston miss tristram and the other old stagers they will husband their horses and come out as fresh at two oclock as though they were only just out there is nothing so valuable as experience in hunting  do you think it nice seeing a young lady with so much hunting knowledge  now you want me to talk slander but i wont do it i admire the miss tristrams exceedingly and especially julia  and which is julia  the youngest that one riding by herself  and why dont you go and express your admiration  ah me why dont we all express the admiration that we feel and pour sweet praises into the ears of the lady that excites it because we are cowards miss furnival and are afraid even of such a weak thing as a woman  dear me i should hardly have thought that you would suffer from such terror as that  because you dont quite know me miss furnival  and miss julia tristram is the lady that has excited it  if it be not she it is some other fair votary of diana at present riding into monkton wood  ah now you are giving me a riddle to guess and i never guess riddles i wont even try at it but they all seem to be stopping  yes they are putting the hounds into covert now if you want to show yourself a good sportsman look at your watch you see that julia tristram has got hers in her hand  whats that for  to time the hounds to see how long theyll be before they find its very pretty work in a small gorse but in a great wood like this i dont care much for being so accurate but for heavens sake dont tell julia tristram i should not have a chance if she thought i was so slack  and now the hounds were scattering themselves in the wood and the party rode up the centre roadway towards a great circular opening in the middle of it here it was the recognised practice of the horsemen to stand and those who properly did their duty would stand there but very many lingered at the gate knowing that there was but one other exit from the wood without overcoming the difficulty of a very intricate and dangerous fence  there be a gap baint there said one farmer to another as they were entering  yes there be a gap and young grubbles broke his orses back a getting over of it last year said the second farmer  did he though said the first and so they both remained at the gate  and others a numerous body including most of the ladies galloped up and down the cross ways because the master of the hounds and the huntsman did so d those fellows riding up and down after me wherever i go said the master i believe they think im to be hunted this seemed to be said more especially to miss tristram who was always in the masters confidence and i fear that the fellows alluded to included miss furnival and miss staveley  and then there came the sharp eager sound of a hounds voice a single sharp happy opening bark and harriet tristram was the first to declare that the game was found just five minutes and twenty seconds my lord said julia tristram to lord alston thats not bad in a large wood like this  uncommonly good said his lordship and when are we to get out of it  theyll be here for the next hour im afraid said the lady not moving her horse from the place where she stood though many of the more impetuous of the men were already rushing away to the gates i have seen a fox go away from here without resting a minute but that was later in the season at the end of february foxes are away from home then all which observations showed a wonderfully acute sporting observation on the part of miss tristram  and then the music of the dogs became fast and frequent as they drove the brute across and along from one part of the large wood to another sure there is no sound like it for filling a mans heart with an eager desire to be at work what may be the trumpet in battle i do not know but i can imagine that it has the same effect and now a few of them were standing on that wide circular piece of grass when a sound the most exciting of them all reached their ears hes away shouted a whip from a corner of the wood the goodnatured beast though as yet it was hardly past christmastime had consented to bless at once so many anxious sportsmen and had left the back of the covert with the full pack at his heels  there is no gate that way miss tristram said a gentleman  theres a double ditch and bank that will do as well said she and away she went directly after the hounds regardless altogether of the gates peregrine orme and felix graham who were with her followed close upon her track     chapter xxix  breaking covert   theres a double ditch and bank that will do as well miss tristram had said when she was informed that there was no gate out of the wood at the side on which the fox had broken the gentleman who had tendered the information might as well have held his tongue for miss tristram knew the wood intimately was acquainted with the locality of all its gates and was acquainted also with the points at which it might be left without the assistance of any gate at all by those who were well mounted and could ride their horses therefore she had thus replied theres a double ditch and bank that will do as well and for the double ditch and bank at the end of one of the grassy roadways miss tristram at once prepared herself  thats the gap where grubbles broke his horses back said a man in a red coat to peregrine orme and so saying he made up his wavering mind and galloped away as fast as his nag could carry him but peregrine orme would not avoid a fence at which a lady was not afraid to ride and felix graham knowing little but fearing nothing followed peregrine orme  at the end of the roadway in the middle of the track there was the gap for a footman it was doubtless the easiest way over the fence for the ditch on that side was half filled up and there was space enough left of the halfbroken bank for a mans scrambling feet but miss tristram at once knew that it was a bad place for a horse the second or further ditch was the really difficult obstacle and there was no footing in the gap from which a horse could take his leap to the right of this the fence was large and required a good horse but miss tristram knew her animal and was accustomed to large fences the trained beast went well across on to the bank poised himself there for a moment and taking a second spring carried his mistress across into the further field apparently with ease in that field the dogs were now running altogether so that a sheet might have covered them and miss tristram exulting within her heart and holding in her horse knew that she had got away uncommonly well  peregrine orme followeda little to the right of the ladys passage so that he might have room for himself and do no mischief in the event of miss tristram or her horse making any mistake at the leap he also got well over but alas in spite of such early success he was destined to see nothing of the hunt that day felix graham thinking that he would obey instructions by letting his horse do as he pleased permitted the beast to come close upon ormes track and to make his jump before ormes horse had taken his second spring  have a care said peregrine feeling that the two were together on the bank or youll shove me into the ditch he however got well over  felix attempting to have a care just when his doing so could be of no avail gave his horse a pull with the curb as he was preparing for his second spring the outside ditch was broad and deep and well banked up and required that an animal should have all his power it was at such a moment as this that he should have been left to do his work without injudicious impediment from his rider but poor graham was thinking only of ormes caution and attempted to stop the beast when any positive and absolute stop was out of the question the horse made his jump and crippled as he was jumped short he came with his knees against the further bank threw his rider and then in his struggle to right himself rolled over him  felix felt at once that he was much hurtthat he had indeed come to grief but still he was not stunned nor did he lose his presence of mind the horse succeeded in gaining his feet and then felix also jumped up and even walked a step or two towards the head of the animal with the object of taking the reins but he found that he could not raise his arm and he found also that he could hardly breathe  both peregrine and miss tristram looked back theres nothing wrong i hope said the lady and then she rode on and let it be understood that in hunting those who are in advance generally do ride on the lame and the halt and the wounded if they cannot pick themselves up have to be picked up by those who come after them but peregrine saw that there was no one else coming that way the memory of young grubbles fate had placed an interdict on that pass out of the wood which nothing short of the pluck and science of miss tristram was able to disregard two cavaliers she had carried with her one she had led on to instant slaughter and the other remained to look after his fallen brotherinarms miss tristram in the mean time was in the next field and had settled well down to her work  are you hurt old fellow said peregrine turning back his horse but still not dismounting  not much i think said graham smiling theres something wrong about my armbut dont you wait and then he found that he spoke with difficulty  can you mount again  i dont think ill mind that perhaps id better sit down then peregrine orme knew that graham was hurt and jumping off his own horse he gave up all hope of the hunt  here you fellow come and hold these horses so invoked a boy who in following the sport had got as far as this ditch did as he was bid and scrambled over sit down graham there im afraid you are hurt did he roll on you but felix merely looked up into his facestill smiling he was now very pale and for the moment could not speak peregrine came close to him and gently attempted to raise the wounded limb whereupon graham shuddered and shook his head  i fear it is broken said peregrine graham nodded his head and raised his left hand to his breast and peregrine then knew that something else was amiss also  i dont know any feeling more disagreeable than that produced by being left alone in a field when out hunting with a man who has been very much hurt and who is incapable of riding or walking the hurt man himself has the privilege of his infirmities and may remain quiescent but you as his only attendant must do something you must for the moment do all and if you do wrong the whole responsibility lies on your shoulders if you leave a wounded man on the damp ground in the middle of winter while you run away five miles perhaps to the next doctor he may not improbablyas you then thinkbe dead before you come back you dont know the way you are heavy yourself and your boots are very heavy you must stay therefore but as you are no doctor you dont in the least know what is the amount of the injury in your great trouble you begin to roar for assistance but the woods reecho your words and the distant sound of the huntsmans horn as he summons his hounds at a check only mocks your agony  but peregrine had a boy with him get upon that horse he said at last ride round to farmer griggs and tell them to send somebody here with a spring cart he has got a spring cart i knowand a mattress in it  but i haint no gude at roiding like said the boy looking with dismay at ormes big horse  then run that will be better for you can go through the wood you know where farmer griggs lives the first farm the other side of the grange  ay ay i knows where farmer griggs lives well enough  run then and if the cart is here in half an hour ill give you a sovereign  inspirited by the hopes of such wealth golden wealth wealth for a lifetime the boy was quickly back over the fence and peregrine was left alone with felix graham he was now sitting down with his feet hanging into the ditch and peregrine was kneeling behind him i am sorry i can do nothing more said he but i fear we must remain here till the cart comes  i amsovexedabout your hunt said felix gasping as he spoke he had in fact broken his right arm which had been twisted under him as the horse rolled and two of his ribs had been staved in by the pommel of his saddle many men have been worse hurt and have hunted again before the end of the season but the fracture of three bones does make a man uncomfortable for the time now the cartissent for couldnt yougo on but it was not likely that peregrine orme would do that never mind me he said when a fellow is hurt he has always to do as hes told youd better have a drop of sherry look here ive got a flask at my saddle there you can support yourself with that arm a moment did you ever see horses stand so quiet ive got hold of yours and now ill fasten them together i say whitefoot you dont kick do you and then he contrived to picket the horses to two branches and having got out his case of sherry poured a small modicum into the silver mug which was attached to the apparatus and again supported graham while he drank youll be as right as a trivet byandby only youll have to make noningsby your headquarters for the next six weeks and then the same idea passed through the mind of each of themhow little a man need be pitied for such a misfortune if madeline staveley would consent to be his nurse  illustration felix graham in trouble  no man could have less surgical knowledge than peregrine orme but nevertheless he was such a man as one would like to have with him if one came to grief in such a way he was cheery and uphearted but at the same time gentle and even thoughtful his voice was pleasant and his touch could be soft for many years afterwards felix remembered how that sherry had been held to his lips and how the young heir of the cleeve had knelt behind him in his red coat supporting him as he became weary with waiting and saying pleasant words to him through the whole felix graham was a man who would remember such things  in running through the wood the boy first encountered three horsemen they were the judge with his daughter madeline and miss furnival there be a mon there who be amost dead said the boy hardly able to speak from want of breath i be agoing for farmer griggs cart and then they stopped him a moment to ask for some description but the boy could tell them nothing to indicate that the wounded man was one of their friends it might however be augustus and so the three rode on quickly towards the fence knowing nothing of the circumstances of the ditches which would make it out of their power to get to the fallen sportsman  but peregrine heard the sound of the horses and the voices of the horsemen by jove theres a lot of them coming down here said he its the judge and two of the girls oh miss staveley im so glad youve come graham has had a bad fall and hurt himself you havent a shawl have you the ground is so wet under him  it doesnt signify at all said felix looking round and seeing the faces of his friends on the other side of the bank  madeline staveley gave a slight shriek which her father did not notice but which miss furnival heard very plainly oh papa she said cannot you get over to him and then she began to bethink herself whether it were possible that she should give up something of her dress to protect the man who was hurt from the damp muddy ground on which he lay  can you hold my horse dear said the judge slowly dismounting for the judge though he rode every day on sanitary considerations had not a sportsmans celerity in leaving and recovering his saddle but he did get down and burdened as he was with a greatcoat he did succeed in crossing that accursed fence accursed it was from henceforward in the annals of the h h and none would ride it but daredevils who professed themselves willing to go at anything miss tristram however always declared that there was nothing in itthough she avoided it herself whispering to her friends that she had led others to grief there and might possibly do so again if she persevered  could you hold the horse said madeline to miss furnival and i will go for a shawl to the carriage miss furnival declared that to the best of her belief she could not but nevertheless the animal was left with her and madeline turned round and galloped back towards the carriage she made her horse do his best though her eyes were nearly blinded with tears and went straight on for the carriage though she would have given much for a moment to hide those tears before she reached it  oh mamma give me a thick shawl mr graham has hurt himself in the field and is lying on the grass and then in some incoherent and quick manner she had to explain what she knew of the accident before she could get a carriagecloak out of the carriage this however she did succeed in doing and in some manner very unintelligible to herself afterwards she did gallop back with her burden she passed the cloak over to peregrine who clambered up the bank to get it while the judge remained on the ground supporting the young barrister felix graham though he was weak was not stunned or senseless and he knew well who it was that had procured for him that comfort  and then the carriage followed madeline and there was quite a concourse of servants and horses and ladies on the inside of the fence but the wounded man was still unfortunately on the other side no cart from farmer griggs made its appearance though it was now more than half an hour since the boy had gone carts when they are wanted in such sudden haste do not make their appearance it was two miles through the wood to mr griggss farmyard and more than three miles back by any route which the cart could take and then it might be more than probable that in farmer griggss establishment there was not always a horse ready in harness or a groom at hand prepared to yoke him peregrine had become very impatient and had more than once invoked a silent anathema on the farmers head but nevertheless there was no appearance of the cart  we must get him across the ditches into the carriage said the judge  if lady staveley will let us do that said peregrine  the difficulty is not with lady staveley but with these nasty ditches said the judge for he had been up to his knees in one of them and the water had penetrated his boots but the task was at last done mrs arbuthnot stood up on the back seat of the carriage so that she might hold the horses and the coachman and footman got across into the field it would be better to let me lie here all day said felix as three of them struggled back with their burden the judge bringing up the rear with two huntingwhips and peregrines cap how on earth any one would think of riding over such a place as that said the judge but then when he had been a young man it had not been the custom for barristers to go out hunting  madeline as she saw the wounded man carefully laid on the back seat of the carriage almost wished that she could have her mothers place that she might support him would they be careful enough with him would they remember how terrible must be the pain of that motion to one so hurt as he was and then she looked into his face as he was made to lean back and she saw that he still smiled felix graham was by no means a handsome man i should hardly sin against the truth if i were to say that he was ugly but madeline as she looked at him now lying there utterly without colour but always with that smile on his countenance thought that no face to her liking had ever been more gracious she still rode close to him as they went down the grassy road saying never a word and miss furnival rode there also somewhat in the rear condoling with the judge as to his wet feet  miss furnival he said when a judge forgets himself and goes out hunting he has no right to expect anything better what would your father have said had he seen me clambering up the bank with young ormes huntingcap between my teeth i positively did  he would have rushed to assist you said miss furnival with a little burst of enthusiasm which was hardly needed on the occasion and then peregrine came after them leading grahams horse he had been compelled to return to the field and ride both the horses back into the wood one after the other while the footman held them that riding back over fences in cold blood is the work that really tries a mans nerve and a man has to do it too when no one is looking on how he does crane and falter and look about for an easy place at such a moment as that but when the blood is cold no places are easy  the procession got back to noningsby without adventure and graham as a matter of course was taken up to his bed one of the servants had been despatched to alston for a surgeon and in an hour or two the extent of the misfortune was known the right arm was brokenvery favourably as the doctor observed but two ribs were brokenrather unfavourably there was some talk of hæmorrhage and inward wounds and sir jacob from saville row was suggested by lady staveley but the judge knowing the extent of grahams means made some further preliminary inquiries and it was considered that sir jacob would not be neededat any rate not as yet  why dont they send for him said madeline to her mother with rather more than her wonted energy  your papa does not think it necessary my dear it would be very expensive you know  but mamma would you let a man die because it would cost a few pounds to cure him  my dear we all hope that mr graham wont dieat any rate not at present if there be any danger you may be sure that your papa will send for the best advice  but madeline was by no means satisfied she could not understand economy in a matter of life and death if sir jacobs coming would have cost fifty pounds or a hundred what would that have signified weighed in such a balance such a sum would be nothing to her father had augustus fallen and broken his arm all the sir jacobs in london would not have been considered too costly could their joint coming have mitigated any danger she did not however dare to speak to her mother again so she said a word or two to peregrine orme who was constant in his attendance on felix peregrine had been very kind and she had seen it and her heart therefore warmed towards him  dont you think he ought to have more advice mr orme  well no i dont know hes very jolly you know only he cant talk one of the bones ran into him but i believe hes all right  oh but that is so frightful and the tears were again in her eyes  if i were him i should think one doctor enough but its easy enough having a fellow down from london you know if you like it  if he should get worse mr orme and then peregrine made her a sort of promise but in doing so an idea shot through his poor heart of what the truth might really be he went back and looked at felix who was sleeping if it is so i must bear it he said to himself but ill fight it on and a quick thought ran through his brain of his own deficiencies he knew that he was not clever and bright in talk like felix graham he could not say the right thing at the right moment without forethought how he wished that he could but still he would fight it on as he would have done any losing matchto the last and then he sat down by felixs head and resolved that he would be loyal to his new friend all the sameloyal in all things needful but still he would fight it on     chapter xxx  another fall   felix graham had plenty of nurses but madeline was not one of them augustus staveley came home while the alston doctor was still busy at the broken bones and of course he would not leave his friend he was one of those who had succeeded in the hunt and consequently had heard nothing of the accident till the end of it miss tristram had been the first to tell him that mr graham had fallen in leaving the covert but having seen him rise to his legs she had not thought he was seriously hurt  i do not know much about your friend she had said but i think i may comfort you by an assurance that your horse is none the worse i could see as much as that  poor felix said staveley he has lost a magnificent run i suppose we are nine or ten miles from monkton grange now  eleven if we are a yard said the lady it was an ugly country but the pace was nothing wonderful and then others dropped in and at last came tidings about graham at first there was a whisper that he was dead he had ridden over orme it was said had nearly killed him and had quite killed himself then the report became less fatal both horses were dead but graham was still living though with most of his bones broken  dont believe it said miss tristram in what condition mr graham may be i wont say but that your horse was safe and sound after he got over the fence of that you may take my word and thus in a state of uncertainty obtaining fresh rumours from every person he passed staveley hurried home right arm and two ribs peregrine said to him as he met him in the hall is that all said augustus it was clear therefore that he did not think so much about it as his sister  if youd let her have her head shed never have come down like that augustus said as he sat that evening by his friends bedside  but he pulled off i fancy to avoid riding over me said peregrine  then he must have come too quick at his leap said augustus you should have steadied him as he came to it from all which graham perceived that a man cannot learn how to ride any particular horse by two or three words of precept  if you talk any more about the horse or the hunt or the accident neither of you shall stay in the room said lady staveley who came in at that moment but they both did stay in the room and said a great deal more about the hunt and the horse and the accident before they left it and even became so far reconciled to the circumstance that they had a hot glass of brandy and water each sitting by grahams fire  but augustus do tell me how he is madeline said to her brother as she caught him going to his room she had become ashamed of asking any more questions of her mother  hes all right only hell be as fretful as a porcupine shut up there at least i should be are there lots of novels in the house mind you send for a batch tomorrow novels are the only chance a man has when hes laid up like that before breakfast on the following morning madeline had sent off to the alston circulating library a list of all the best new novels of which she could remember the names  no definite day had hitherto been fixed for peregrines return to the cleeve and under the present circumstances he still remained at noningsby assisting to amuse felix graham for two days after the accident such seemed to be his sole occupation but in truth he was looking for an opportunity to say a word or two to miss staveley and paving his way as best he might for that great speech which he was fully resolved that he would make before he left the house once or twice he bethought himself whether he would not endeavour to secure for himself some confidant in the family and obtain the sanction and special friendship either of madelines mother or her sister or her brother but what if after that she should reject him would it not be worse for him then that any one should have known of his defeat he could as he thought endure to suffer alone but on such a matter as that pity would be unendurable so as he sat there by grahams fireside pretending to read one of poor madelines novels for the sake of companionship he determined that he would tell no one of his intentionno one till he could make the opportunity for telling her  and when he did meet her and find now and again some moment for saying a word alone to her she was very gracious to him he had been so kind and gentle with felix there was so much in him that was sweet and good and honest so much that such an event as this brought forth and made manifest that madeline and indeed the whole family could not but be gracious to him augustus would declare that he was the greatest brick he had ever known repeating all grahams words as to the patience with which the embryo baronet had knelt behind him on the cold muddy ground supporting him for an hour till the carriage had come up under such circumstances how could madeline refrain from being gracious to him  but it is all from favour to graham peregrine would say to himself with bitterness and yet though he said so he did not quite believe it poor fellow it was all from favour to graham and could he have thoroughly believed the truth of those words which he repeated to himself so often he might have spared himself much pain he might have spared himself much pain and possibly some injury for if aught could now tend to mature in madelines heart an affection which was but as yet nascent it would be the offer of some other lover but such reasoning on the matter was much too deep for peregrine orme it may be he said to himself that she only pities him because he is hurt if so is not this time better for me than any other if it be that she loves him let me know it and be out of my pain it did not then occur to him that circumstances such as those in question could not readily be made explicitthat madeline might refuse his love and yet leave him no wiser than he now was as to her reasons for so refusingperhaps indeed leave him less wise with increased cause for doubt and hopeless hope and the green melancholy of a rejected lover  madeline during these two days said no more about the london doctor but it was plain to all who watched her that her anxiety as to the patient was much more keen than that of the other ladies of the house she always thinks everybody is going to die lady staveley said to miss furnival intending not with any consummate prudence to account to that acute young lady for her daughters solicitude we had a cook here three months since who was very ill and madeline would never be easy till the doctor assured her that the poor womans danger was altogether past  she is so very warmhearted said miss furnival in reply it is quite delightful to see her and she will have such pleasure when she sees him come down from his room  lady staveley on this immediate occasion said nothing to her daughter but mrs arbuthnot considered that a sisterly word might perhaps be spoken in due season  the doctor says he is doing quite well now mrs arbuthnot said to her as they were sitting alone  but does he indeed did you hear him said madeline who was suspicious  he did so indeed i heard him myself but he says also that he ought to remain here at any rate for the next fortnightif mamma can permit it without inconvenience  of course she can permit it no one would turn any person out of their house in such a condition as that  papa and mamma both will be very happy that he should stay hereof course they would not do what you call turning him out but mad my darlingand then she came up close and put her arm round her sisters waist i think mamma would be more comfortable in his remaining here if your charity towards him werewhat shall i sayless demonstrative  what do you mean isabella  dearest dearest you must not be angry with me nobody has hinted to me a word on the subject nor do i mean to hint anything that can possibly be hurtful to you  but what do you mean  dont you know darling he is a young manandandpeople see with such unkind eyes and hear with such scandalloving ears there is that miss furnival  if miss furnival can think such things i for one do not care what she thinks  no nor do inot as regards any important result but may it not be well to be careful you know what i mean dearest  yesi know at least i suppose so and it makes me know also how very cold and shallow and heartless people are i wont ask any more questions isabella but i cant know that a fellowcreature is suffering in the houseand a person like him too so clever whom we all regard as a friendthe most intimate friend in the world that augustus hasand the best too as i heard papa himself saywithout caring whether he is going to live or die  there is no danger now you know  very well i am glad to hear it though i know very well that there must be danger after such a terrible accident as that  the doctor says there is none  at any rate i will not and then instead of finishing her sentence she turned away her head and put up her handkerchief to wipe away a tear  you are not angry with me dear said mrs arbuthnot  oh no said madeline and then they parted  for some days after that madeline asked no question whatever about felix graham but it may be doubted whether this did not make the matter worse even sophia furnival would ask how he was at any rate twice a day and lady staveley continued to pay him regular visits at stated intervals as he got better she would sit with him and brought back reports as to his sayings but madeline never discussed any of these and refrained alike from the conversation whether his broken bones or his unbroken wit were to be the subject of it and then mrs arbuthnot knowing that she would still be anxious gave her private bulletins as to the state of the sick mans progressall which gave an air of secrecy to the matter and caused even madeline to ask herself why this should be so  on the whole i think that mrs arbuthnot was wrong mrs arbuthnot and the whole staveley family would have regarded a mutual attachment between mr graham and madeline as a great family misfortune the judge was a considerate father to his children holding that a fathers control should never be brought to bear unnecessarily in looking forward to the future prospects of his sons and daughters it was his theory that they should be free to choose their lifes companions for themselves but nevertheless it could not be agreeable to him that his daughter should fall in love with a man who had nothing and whose future success at his own profession seemed to be so very doubtful on the whole i think that mrs arbuthnot was wrong and that the feeling that did exist in madelines bosom might more possibly have died away had no word been said about iteven by a sister  and then another event happened which forced her to look into her own heart peregrine orme did make his proposal he waited patiently during those two or three days in which the doctors visits were frequent feeling that he could not talk about himself while any sense of danger pervaded the house but then at last a morning came on which the surgeon declared that he need not call again till the morrow and felix himself when the medical back was turned suggested that it might as well be tomorrow week he began also to scold his friends and look bright about the eyes and drink his glass of sherry in a pleasant dinnertable fashion not as if he were swallowing his physic and peregrine when he saw all this resolved that the moment had come for the doing of his deed of danger the time would soon come at which he must leave noningsby and he would not leave noningsby till he had learned his fate  lady staveley who with a mothers eye had seen her daughters solicitude for felix grahams recoveryhad seen it and animadverted on it to herselfhad seen also or at any rate had suspected that peregrine orme looked on her daughter with favouring eyes now peregrine orme would have satisfied lady staveley as a soninlaw she liked his ways and manners of thoughtin spite of those rumours as to the ratcatching which had reached her ears she regarded him as quite clever enough to be a good husband and no doubt appreciated the fact that he was to inherit his title and the cleeve from an old grandfather instead of a middleaged father she therefore had no objection to leave peregrine alone with her one ewelamb and therefore the opportunity which he sought was at last found  i shall be leaving noningsby tomorrow miss staveley he said one day having secured an interview in the back drawingroomin that happy halfhour which occurs in winter before the world betakes itself to dress now i here profess my belief that out of every ten set offers made by ten young lovers nine of such offers are commenced with an intimation that the lover is going away there is a dash of melancholy in such tidings well suited to the occasion if there be any spark of love on the other side it will be elicited by the idea of a separation and then also it is so frequently the actual fact this making of an offer is in itself a hard piece of businessa job to be postponed from day to day it is so postponed and thus that dash of melancholy and that idea of separation are brought in at the important moment with so much appropriate truth  i shall be leaving noningsby tomorrow miss staveley peregrine said  oh dear we shall be so sorry but why are you going what will mr graham and augustus do without you you ought to stay at least till mr graham can leave his room  poor grahamnot that i think he is much to be pitied either but he wont be about for some weeks to come yet  you do not think he is worse do you  oh dear no not at all and peregrine was unconsciously irritated against his friend by the regard which her tone evinced he is quite well only they will not let him be moved but miss staveley it was not of mr graham that i was going to speak  noonly i thought he would miss you so much and then she blushed though the blush in the dark of the evening was lost upon him she remembered that she was not to speak about felix grahams health and it almost seemed as though mr orme had rebuked her for doing so in saying that he had not come there to speak of him  lady staveleys house has been turned up side down since this affair and it is time now that some part of the trouble should cease  oh mamma does not mind it at all  i know how good she is but nevertheless miss staveley i must go tomorrow and then he paused a moment before he spoke again it will depend entirely upon you he said whether i may have the happiness of returning soon to noningsby  on me mr orme  yes on you i do not know how to speak properly that which i have to say but i believe i may as well say it out at once i have come here now to tell you that i love you and to ask you to be my wife and then he stopped as though there were nothing more for him to say upon the matter  it would be hardly extravagant to declare that madelines breath was taken away by the very sudden manner in which young orme had made his proposition it had never entered her head that she had an admirer in him previously to grahams accident she had thought nothing about him since that event she had thought about him a good deal but altogether as of a friend of grahams he had been good and kind to graham and therefore she had liked him and had talked to him he had never said a word to her that had taught her to regard him as a possible lover and now that he was an actual lover a declared lover standing before her waiting for an answer she was so astonished that she did not know how to speak all her ideas too as to lovesuch ideas as she had ever formed were confounded by his abruptness she would have thought had she brought herself absolutely to think upon it that all speech of love should be very delicate that love should grow slowly and then be whispered softly doubtingly and with infinite care even had she loved him or had she been in the way towards loving him such violence as this would have frightened her and scared her love away poor peregrine his intentions had been so good and honest he was so true and hearty and free from all conceit in the matter it was a pity that he should have marred his cause by such ill judgment  but there he stood waiting an answerand expecting it to be as open definite and plain as though he had asked her to take a walk with him madeline he said stretching out his hand when he perceived that she did not speak to him at once there is my hand if it be possible give me yours  oh mr orme  i know that i have not said what i had to say veryvery gracefully but you will not regard that i think you are too good and too true  she had now seated herself and he was standing before her she had retreated to a sofa in order to avoid the hand which he had offered her but he followed her and even yet did not know that he had no chance of success mr orme she said at last speaking hardly above her breath what has made you do this  what has made me do it what has made me tell you that i love you  you cannot be in earnest  not in earnest by heavens miss staveley no man who has said the same words was ever more in earnest do you doubt me when i tell you that i love you  oh i am so sorry and then she hid her face upon the arm of the sofa and burst into tears  peregrine stood there like a prisoner on his trial waiting for a verdict he did not know how to plead his cause with any further language and indeed no further language could have been of any avail the judge and jury were clear against him and he should have known the sentence without waiting to have it pronounced in set terms but in plain words he had made his offer and in plain words he required that an answer should be given to him well he said will you not speak to me will you not tell me whether it shall be so  nonono she said  you mean that you cannot love me and as he said this the agony of his tone struck her ear and made her feel that he was suffering hitherto she had thought only of herself and had hardly recognised it as a fact that he could be thoroughly in earnest  mr orme i am very sorry do not speak as though you were angry with me but  but you cannot love me and then he stood again silent for there was no reply is it that miss staveley that you mean to answer if you say that with positive assurance i will trouble you no longer poor peregrine he was but an unskilled lover  no she sobbed forth through her tears but he had so framed his question that he hardly knew what no meant  do you mean that you cannot love me or may i hope that a day will come may i speak to you again  oh no no i can answer you now it grieves me to the heart i know you are so good but mr orme  well  it can never never be  and i must take that as answer  i can make no other he still stood before herwith gloomy and almost angry brow could she have seen him and then he thought he would ask her whether there was any other love which had brought about her scorn for him it did not occur to him at the first moment that in doing so he would insult and injure her  at any rate i am not flattered by a reply which is at once so decided he began by saying  oh mr orme do not make me more unhappy  but perhaps i am too late perhaps then he remembered himself and paused never mind he said speaking to himself rather than to her goodbye miss staveley you will at any rate say goodbye to me i shall go at once now  go at once go away mr orme  yes why should i stay here do you think that i could sit down to table with you all after that i will ask your brother to explain my going i shall find him in his room goodbye  she took his hand mechanically and then he left her when she came down to dinner she looked furtively round to his place and saw that it was vacant     chapter xxxi  footsteps in the corridor   upon my word i am very sorry said the judge but what made him go off so suddenly i hope theres nobody ill at the cleeve and then the judge took his first spoonful of soup  no no there is nothing of that sort said augustus his grandfather wants him and orme thought he might as well start at once he was always a sudden harumscarum fellow like that  hes a very pleasant nice young man said lady staveley and never gives himself any airs i like him exceedingly  poor madeline did not dare to look either at her mother or her brother but she would have given much to know whether either of them were aware of the cause which had sent peregrine orme so suddenly away from the house at first she thought that augustus surely did know and she was wretched as she thought that he might probably speak to her on the subject but he went on talking about orme and his abrupt departure till she became convinced that he knew nothing and suspected nothing of what had occurred  but her mother said never a word after that eulogium which she had uttered and madeline read that eulogium altogether aright it said to her ears that if ever young orme should again come forward with his suit her mother would be prepared to receive him as a suitor and it said moreover that if that suitor had been already sent away by any harsh answer she would not sympathise with that harshness  the dinner went on much as usual but madeline could not bring herself to say a word she sat between her brotherinlaw mr arbuthnot on one side and an old friend of her fathers of thirty years standing on the other the old friend talked exclusively to lady staveley and mr arbuthnot though he now and then uttered a word or two was chiefly occupied with his dinner during the last three or four days she had sat at dinner next to peregrine orme and it seemed to her now that she always had been able to talk to him she had liked him so much too was it not a pity that he should have been so mistaken and then as she sat after dinner eating five or six grapes she felt that she was unable to recall her spirits and look and speak as she was wont to do a thing had happened which had knocked the ground from under herhad thrown her from her equipoise and now she lacked the strength to recover herself and hide her dismay  after dinner while the gentlemen were still in the diningroom she got a book and nobody disturbed her as she sat alone pretending to read it there never had been any intimate friendship between her and miss furnival and that young lady was now employed in taking the chief part in a general conversation about wools lady staveley got through a good deal of wool in the course of the year as also did the wife of the old thirtyyears friend but miss furnival short as her experience had been was able to give a few hints to them both and did not throw away the occasion there was another lady there rather deaf to whom mrs arbuthnot devoted herself and therefore madeline was allowed to be alone  then the men came in and she was obliged to come forward and officiate at the teatable the judge insisted on having the teapot and urn brought into the drawingroom and liked to have his cup brought to him by one of his own daughters so she went to work and made the tea but still she felt that she scarcely knew how to go through her task what had happened to her that she should be thus beside herself and hardly capable of refraining from open tears she knew that her mother was looking at her and that now and again little things were done to give her ease if any ease were possible  is anything the matter with my madeline said her father looking up into her face and holding the hand from which he had taken his cup  no papa only i have got a headache  a headache dear thats not usual with you  i have seen that she has not been well all the evening said lady staveley but i thought that perhaps she might shake it off you had better go my dear if you are suffering isabella im sure will pour out the tea for us  and so she got away and skulked slowly up stairs to her own room she felt that it was skulking why should she have been so weak as to have fled in that way she had no headachenor was it heartache that had now upset her but a man had spoken to her openly of love and no man had ever so spoken to her before  she did not go direct to her own chamber but passed along the corridor towards her mothers dressingroom it was always her custom to remain there some halfhour before she went to bed doing little things for her mother and chatting with any other girl who might be intimate enough to be admitted there now she might remain there for an hour alone without danger of being disturbed and she thought to herself that she would remain there till her mother came and then unburthen herself of the whole story  as she went along the corridor she would have to pass the room which had been given up to felix graham she saw that the door was ajar and as she came close up to it she found the nurse in the act of coming out from the room mrs baker had been a very old servant in the judges family and had known madeline from the day of her birth her chief occupation for some years had been nursing when there was anybody to nurse and taking a general care and surveillance of the familys health when there was no special invalid to whom she could devote herself since grahams accident she had been fully employed and had greatly enjoyed the opportunities it had given her  mrs baker was in the doorway as madeline attempted to pass by on tiptoe oh hes a deal better now miss madeline so that you neednt be afeard of disturbingaint you mr graham so she was thus brought into absolute contact with her friend for the first time since he had hurt himself  illustration footsteps in the corridor  indeed i am said felix i only wish theyd let me get up and go down stairs is that miss staveley mrs baker  yes sure come my dear hes got his dressinggown on and you may just come to the door and ask him how he does  i am very glad to hear that you are so much better mr graham said madeline standing in the doorway with averted eyes and speaking with a voice so low that it only just reached his ears  thank you miss staveley i shall never know how to express what i feel for you all  and theres none of em have been more anxious about you than she i can tell you and none of em aint kinderhearteder said mrs baker  i hope you will be up soon and be able to come down to the drawingroom said madeline and then she did glance round and for a moment saw the light of his eye as he sat upright in the bed he was still pale and thin or at least she fancied so and her heart trembled within her as she thought of the danger he had passed  i do so long to be able to talk to you again all the others come and visit me but i have only heard the sounds of your footsteps as you pass by  and yet she always walks like a mouse said mrs baker  but i have always heard them he said i hope marian thanked you for the books she told me how you had gotten them for me  she should not have said anything about them it was augustus who thought of them said madeline  marian comes to me four or five times a day he continued i do not know what i should do without her  i hope she is not noisy said madeline  laws miss he dont care for noise now only he aint good at moving yet and wont be for some while  pray take care of yourself mr graham she said i need not tell you how anxious we all are for your recovery good night mr graham and then she passed on to her mothers dressingroom and sitting herself down in an armchair opposite to the fire began to thinkto think or else to try to think  and what was to be the subject of her thoughts regarding peregrine orme there was very little room for thinking he had made her an offer and she had rejected it as a matter of course seeing that she did not love him she had no doubt on that head and was well aware that she could never accept such an offer on what subject then was it necessary that she should think  how odd it was that mr grahams room door should have been open on this especial evening and that nurse should have been standing there ready to give occasion for that conversation that was the idea that first took possession of her brain and then she recounted all those few words which had been spoken as though they had had some special valueas though each word had been laden with interest she felt half ashamed of what she had done in standing there and speaking at his bedroom door and yet she would not have lost the chance for worlds there had been nothing in what had passed between her and the invalid the very words spoken elsewhere or in the presence of her mother and sister would have been insipid and valueless and yet she sat there feeding on them as though they were of flavour so rich that she could not let the sweetness of them pass from her she had been stunned at the idea of poor peregrines love and yet she never asked herself what was this new feeling she did not inquirenot yet at leastwhether there might be danger in such feelings  she remained there with eyes fixed on the burning coals till her mother came up what madeline said lady staveley are you here still i was in hopes you would have been in bed before this  my headache is gone now mamma and i waited because  well dear because what and her mother came and stood over her and smoothed her hair i know very well that something has been the matter there has been something eh madeline  yes mamma  and you have remained up that we may talk about it is that it dearest  i did not quite mean that but perhaps it will be best i cant be doing wrong mamma in telling you  well you shall judge of that yourself and lady staveley sat down on the sofa so that she was close to the chair which madeline still occupied as a general rule i suppose you could not be doing wrong but you must decide if you have any doubt wait till tomorrow  no mamma i will tell you now mr orme  well dearest did mr orme say anything specially to you before he went away  hehe  come to me madeline and sit here we shall talk better then and the mother made room beside her on the sofa for her daughter and madeline running over leaned with her head upon her mothers shoulder well darling what did he say did he tell you that he loved you  yes mamma  and you answered him  i could only tell him  yes i know poor fellow but madeline is he not an excellent young manone at any rate that is lovable of course in such a matter the heart must answer for itself but i looking at the offer as a motheri could have been well pleased  but mamma i could not  well love there shall be an end of it at least for the present when i heard that he had gone suddenly away i thought that something had happened  i am so sorry that he should be unhappy for i know that he is good  yes he is good and your father likes him and augustus in such a matter as this madeline i would never say a word to persuade you i should think it wrong to do so but it may be dearest that he has flurried you by the suddenness of his offer and that you have not yet thought much about it  but mamma i know that i do not love him  of course that is natural it would have been a great misfortune if you had loved him before you had reason to know that he loved youa great misfortune but nownow that you cannot but think of him now that you know what his wishes are perhaps you may learn  but i have refused him and he has gone away  young gentlemen under such circumstances sometimes come back again  he wont come back mamma becausebecause i told him so plainlyi am sure he understands that it is all to be at an end  but if he should and if you should then think differently towards him  oh no  but if you should it may be well that you should know how all your friends esteem him in a worldly view the marriage would be in all respects prudent and as to disposition and temper which i admit are much more important i confess i think that he has all the qualities best adapted to make a wife happy but as i said before the heart must speak for itself  yes of course and i know that i shall never love himnot in that way  you may be sure dearest that there will be no constraint put upon you it might be possible that i or your papa should forbid a daughters marriage if she had proposed to herself an imprudent match but neither he nor i would ever use our influence with a child to bring about a marriage because we think it prudent in a worldly point of view and then lady staveley kissed her daughter  dear mamma i know how good you are to me and she answered her mothers embrace by the pressure of her arm but nevertheless she did not feel herself to be quite comfortable there was something in the words which her mother had spoken which grated against her most cherished feelingssomething though she by no means knew what why had her mother cautioned her in that way that there might be a case in which she would refuse her sanction to a proposed marriage isabellas marriage had been concluded with the full agreement of the whole family and she madeline had certainly never as yet given cause either to father or mother to suppose that she would be headstrong and imprudent might not the caution have been omittedor was it intended to apply in any way to circumstances as they now existed  you had better go now dearest said lady staveley and for the present we will not think any more about this gallant young knight and then madeline having said good night went off rather crestfallen to her own room in doing so she again had to pass grahams door and as she went by it walking not quite on tiptoe she could not help asking herself whether or no he would really recognise the sound of her footsteps  it is hardly necessary to say that lady staveley had conceived to herself a recognised purpose in uttering that little caution to her daughter and she would have been quite as well pleased had circumstances taken felix graham out of her house instead of peregrine orme but felix graham must necessarily remain for the next fortnight and there could be no possible benefit in ormes return at any rate till graham should have gone     chapter xxxii  what bridget bolster had to say   it has been said in the earlier pages of this story that there was no prettier scenery to be found within thirty miles of london than that by which the little town of hamworth was surrounded this was so truly the case that hamworth was full of lodgings which in the autumn season were always full of lodgers the middle of winter was certainly not the time for seeing the hamworth hills to advantage nevertheless it was soon after christmas that two rooms were taken there by a single gentleman who had come down for a week apparently with no other view than that of enjoying himself he did say something about london confinement and change of air but he was manifestly in good health had an excellent appetite said a great deal about fresh eggswhich at that time of the year was hardly reasonable and brought with him his own pale brandy this gentleman was mr crabwitz  the house at which he was to lodge had been selected with considerable judgment it was kept by a tidy old widow known as mrs trump but those who knew anything of hamworth affairs were well aware that mrs trump had been left without a shilling and could not have taken that snug little house in paradise row and furnished it completely out of her own means no mrs trumps lodginghouse was one of the irons which samuel dockwrath ever kept heating in the fire for the behoof of those fourteen children he had taken a lease of the house in paradise row having made a bargain and advanced a few pounds while it was yet being built and he then had furnished it and put in mrs trump mrs trump received from him wages and a percentage but to him were paid over the quota of shillings per week in consideration for which the lodgers were accommodated all of which mr crabwitz had ascertained before he located himself in paradise row  and when he had so located himself he soon began to talk to mrs trump about mr dockwrath he himself as he told her in confidence was in the profession of the law he had heard of mr dockwrath and should be very glad if that gentleman would come over and take a glass of brandy and water with him some evening  and a very clever sharp gentleman he is said mrs trump  with a tolerably good business i suppose asked crabwitz  pretty fair for that sir but he do be turning his hand to everything hes a mortal long family of his own and he has need of it all if its ever so much but hell never be poor for the want of looking after it  but mr dockwrath did not come near his lodger on the first evening and mr crabwitz made acquaintance with mrs dockwrath before he saw her husband the care of the fourteen children was not supposed to be so onerous but that she could find a moment now and then to see whether mrs trump kept the furniture properly dusted and did not infringe any of the dockwrathian rules these were very strict and whenever they were broken it was on the head of mrs dockwrath that the anger of the ruler mainly fell  i hope you find everything comfortable sir said poor miriam having knocked at the sittingroom door when crabwitz had just finished his dinner  yes thank you very nice is that mrs dockwrath  yes sir im mrs dockwrath as its we who own the room i looked in to see if anythings wanting  you are very kind no nothing is wanting but i should be delighted to make your acquaintance if you would stay for a moment might i ask you to take a chair and mr crabwitz handed her one  thank you no sir i wont intrude  not at all mrs dockwrath but the fact is im a lawyer myself and i should be so glad to become known to your husband i have heard a great deal of his name lately as to a rather famous case in which he is employed  not the orley farm case said mrs dockwrath immediately  yes yes exactly  and is he going on with that sir asked mrs dockwrath with great interest  is he not i know nothing about it myself but i always supposed that such was the case if i had such a wife as you mrs dockwrath i should not leave her in doubt as to what i was doing in my own profession  i know nothing about it mr cookefor it was as mr cooke that he now sojourned at hamworth not that it should be supposed he had received instructions from mr furnival to come down to that place under a false name from mr furnival he had received no further instructions on that matter than those conveyed at the end of a previous chapter i know nothing about it mr cooke and dont want to know generally but i am anxious about this orley farm case i do hope that hes going to drop it and then mr crabwitz elicited her view of the case with great ease  on that evening about nine mr dockwrath did go over to paradise row and did allow himself to be persuaded to mix a glass of brandy and water and light a cigar my missus tells me sir that you belong to the profession as well as myself  oh yes im a lawyer mr dockwrath  practising in town as an attorney sir  not as an attorney on my own hook exactly i chiefly employ my time in getting up cases for barristers theres a good deal done in that way  oh indeed said mr dockwrath beginning to feel himself the bigger man of the two and from that moment he patronised his companion instead of allowing himself to be patronised  this went against the grain with mr crabwitz but having an object to gain he bore it we hear a great deal up in london just at present about this orley farm case and i always hear your name as connected with it i had no idea when i was taking these lodgings that i was coming into a house belonging to that mr dockwrath  the same party sir said mr dockwrath blowing the smoke out of his mouth as he looked up to the ceiling  and then by degrees mr crabwitz drew him into conversation dockwrath was by nature quite as clever a man as crabwitz and in such a matter as this was not one to be outwitted easily but in truth he had no objection to talk about the orley farm case i have taken it up on public motives mr cooke he said and i mean to go through with it  oh of course in such a case as that you will no doubt go through with it  thats my intention i assure you and i tell you what young masonthats the son of the widow of the old man who made the will  or rather who did not make it as you say  yes yes he made the will but he did not make the codiciland that young mason has no more right to the property than you have  hasnt he now  no and i can prove it too  well the general opinion in the profession is that lady mason will stand her ground and hold her own i dont know what the points are myself but i have heard it discussed and that is certainly what people think  then people will find that they are very much mistaken  i was talking to one of rounds young men about it and i fancy they are not very sanguine  i do not care a fig for round or his young men it would be quite as well for joseph mason if round and crook gave up the matter altogether it lies in a nutshell and the truth must come out whatever round and crook may choose to say and ill tell you moreold furnival big a man as he thinks himself cannot save her  has he anything to do with it asked mr cooke  yes the sly old fox my belief is that only for him shed give up the battle and be down on her marrowbones asking for mercy  shed have little chance of mercy from what i hear of joseph mason  shed have to give up the property of course and even then i dont know whether hed let her off by heavens he couldnt let her off unless i chose and then by degrees he told mr cooke some of the circumstances of the case  but it was not till the fourth evening that mr dockwrath spent with his lodger that the intimacy had so far progressed as to enable mr crabwitz to proceed with his little scheme on that day mr dockwrath had received a notice that at noon on the following morning mr joseph mason and bridget bolster would both be at the house of messrs round and crook in bedford row and that he could attend at that hour if it so pleased him it certainly would so please him he said to himself when he got that letter and in the evening he mentioned to his new friend the business which was taking him to london  if i might advise you in the matter mr dockwrath said crabwitz i should stay away altogether  and why so  because thats not your market this poor devil of a womanfor she is a poor devil of a woman  shell be poor enough before long  it cant be any gratification to you running her down  ah but the justice of the thing  bother youre talking now to a man of the world who can say what is the justice or the injustice of anything after twenty years of possession i have no doubt the codicil did express the old mans wisheven from your own story but of course you are looking for your market now it seems to me that theres a thousand pounds in your way as clear as daylight  i dont see it myself mr cooke  no but i do the sort of thing is done every day you have your fatherinlaws office journal  safe enough  burn itor leave it about in these rooms likeso that somebody else may burn it  id like to see the thousand pounds first  of course youd do nothing till you knew about thatnothing except keeping away from round and crook tomorrow the money would be forthcoming if the trial were notoriously dropped by next assizes  dockwrath sat thinking for a minute or two and every moment of thought made him feel more strongly that he could not now succeed in the manner pointed out by mr cooke but where would be the market you are talking of said he  i could manage that said crabwitz  and go shares in the business  no no nothing of the sort and then he added remembering that he must show that he had some personal object if i got a trifle in the matter it would not come out of your allowance  the attorney again sat silent for a while and now he remained so for full five minutes during which mr crabwitz puffed the smoke from between his lips with a look of supreme satisfaction may i ask at last mr dockwrath said whether you have any personal interest in this matter  none in the leastthat is to say none as yet  you did not come down here with any view  oh dear no nothing of the sort but i see at a glance that it is one of those cases in which a compromise would be the most judicious solution of difficulties i am well used to this kind of thing mr dockwrath  it would not do sir said mr dockwrath after some further slight period of consideration it wouldnt do round and crook have all the dates and so has mason too and the original of that partnership deed is forthcoming and they know what witnesses to depend on no sir ive begun this on public grounds and i mean to carry it on i am in a manner bound to do so as the representative of the attorney of the late sir joseph masonand by heavens mr cooke ill do my duty  i dare say youre right said mr crabwitz mixing a quarter of a glass more brandy and water  i know im right sir said dockwrath and when a man knows hes right he has a deal of inward satisfaction in the feeling after that mr crabwitz was aware that he could be of no use at hamworth but he stayed out his week in order to avoid suspicion  on the following day mr dockwrath did proceed to bedford row determined to carry out his original plan and armed with that inward satisfaction to which he had alluded he dressed himself in his best and endeavoured as far as was in his power to look as though he were equal to the messrs round old crook he had seen once and him he already despised he had endeavoured to obtain a private interview with mrs bolster before she could be seen by matthew round but in this he had not succeeded mrs bolster was a prudent woman and acting doubtless under advice had written to him saying that she had been summoned to the office of messrs round and crook and would there declare all that she knew about the matter at the same time she returned to him a money order which he had sent to her  punctually at twelve he was in bedford row and there he saw a respectablelooking female sitting at the fire in the inner part of the outer office this was bridget bolster but he would by no means have recognised her bridget had risen in the world and was now head chambermaid at a large hotel in the west of england in that capacity she had laid aside whatever diffidence may have afflicted her earlier years and was now able to speak out her mind before any judge or jury in the land indeed she had never been much afflicted by such diffidence and had spoken out her evidence on that former occasion now twenty years since very plainly but as she now explained to the head clerk she had at that time been only a poor ignorant slip of a girl with no more than eight pounds a year wages  dockwrath bowed to the head clerk and passed on to mat rounds private room mr matthew is inside i suppose said he and hardly waiting for permission he knocked at the door and then entered there he saw mr matthew round sitting in his comfortable armchair and opposite to him sat mr mason of groby park  mr mason got up and shook hands with the hamworth attorney but round junior made his greeting without rising and merely motioned his visitor to a chair  mr mason and the young ladies are quite well i hope said mr dockwrath with a smile  quite well i thank you said the county magistrate  this matter has progressed since i last had the pleasure of seeing them you begin to think i was right eh mr mason  dont let us triumph till we are out of the wood said mr round it is a deal easier to spend money in such an affair as this than it is to make money by it however we shall hear today more about it  i do not know about making money said mr mason very solemnly but that i have been robbed by that woman out of my just rights in that estate for the last twenty yearsthat i may say i do know  quite true mr mason quite true said mr dockwrath with considerable energy  and whether i make money or whether i lose money i intend to proceed in this matter it is dreadful to think that in this free and enlightened country so abject an offender should have been able to hold her head up so long without punishment and without disgrace  that is exactly what i feel said dockwrath the very stones and trees of hamworth cry out against her  gentlemen said mr round we have first to see whether there has been any injustice or not if you will allow me i will explain to you what i now propose to do  proceed sir said mr mason who was by no means satisfied with his young attorney  bridget bolster is now in the next room and as far as i can understand the case at present she would be the witness on whom your case mr mason would most depend the man kenneby i have not yet seen but from what i understand he is less likely to prove a willing witness than mrs bolster  i cannot go along with you there mr round said dockwrath  excuse me sir but i am only stating my opinion if i should find that this woman is unable to say that she did not sign two separate documents on that daythat is to say so with a positive and point blank assurance i shall recommend you as my client to drop the prosecution  i will never drop it said mr mason  you will do as you please continued round i can only say what under such circumstances will be the advice given to you by this firm i have talked the matter over very carefully with my father and with our other partner and we shall not think well of going on with it unless i shall now find that your view is strongly substantiated by this woman  then outspoke mr dockwrath under these circumstances mr mason if i were you i should withdraw from the house at once i certainly would not have my case blown upon  mr mason sir will do as he pleases about that as long as the business with which he honours us is straightforward we will do it for him as for an old client although it is not exactly in our own line but we can only do it in accordance with our own judgment i will proceed to explain what i now propose to do the woman bolster is in the next room and i with the assistance of my head clerk will take down the headings of what evidence she can give  in our presence sir said mr dockwrath or if mr mason should decline at any rate in mine  by no means mr dockwrath said round  i think mr dockwrath should hear her story said mr mason  he certainly will not do so in this house or in conjunction with me in what capacity should he be present mr mason  as one of mr masons legal advisers said dockwrath  if you are to be one of them messrs round and crook cannot be the others i think i explained that to you before it now remains for mr mason to say whether he wishes to employ our firm in this matter or not and i can tell him fairly mr round added this after a slight pause that we shall be rather pleased than otherwise if he will put the case into other hands  of course i wish you to conduct it said mr mason who with all his bitterness against the present holders of orley farm was afraid of throwing himself into the hands of dockwrath he was not an ignorant man and he knew that the firm of round and crook bore a high reputation before the world  then said round i must do my business in accordance with my own views of what is right i have reason to believe that no one has yet tampered with this woman and as he spoke he looked hard at dockwrath though probably attempts may have been made  i dont know who should tamper with her said dockwrath unless it be lady masonwhom i must say you seem very anxious to protect  another word like that sir and i shall be compelled to ask you to leave the house i believe that this woman has been tampered with by no one i will now learn from her what is her remembrance of the circumstances as they occurred twenty years since and i will then read to you her deposition i shall be sorry gentlemen to keep you here perhaps for an hour or so but you will find the morning papers on the table and then mr round gathering up certain documents passed into the outer office and mr mason and mr dockwrath were left alone  he is determined to get that woman off said mr dockwrath in a whisper  i believe him to be an honest man said mr mason with some sternness  honesty sir it is hard to say what is honesty and what is dishonesty would you believe it mr mason only last night i had a thousand pounds offered me to hold my tongue about this affair  mr mason at the moment did not believe this but he merely looked hard into his companions face and said nothing  by the heavens above us what i tell you is true a thousand pounds mr mason only think how they are going it to get this thing stifled and where should the offer come from but from those who know i have the power  do you mean to say that the offer came from this firm  hushsh mr mason the very walls hear and talk in such a place as this im not to know who made the offer and i dont know but a man can give a very good guess sometimes the party who was speaking to me is up to the whole transaction and knows exactly what is going on herehere in this house he let it all out using pretty nigh the same words as round used just now he was full about the doubt that round and crook feltthat theyd never pull it through ill tell you what it is mr mason they dont mean to pull it through  what answer did you make to the man  what answer why i just put my thumb this way over my shoulder no mr mason if i cant carry on without bribery and corruption i wont carry on at all hed called at the wrong house with that dodge and so he soon found  and you think he was an emissary from messrs round and crook  hushshsh for heavens sake mr mason do be a little lower you can put two and two together as well as i can mr mason i find they make four i dont know whether your calculation will be the same my belief is that these people are determined to save that woman dont you see it in that young fellows eyethat his heart is all on the other side now hes got hold of that woman bolster and hell teach her to give such evidence as will upset us but ill be even with him yet mr mason if youll only trust me well both be even with him yet  mr mason at the present moment said nothing further and when dockwrath pressed him to continue the conversation in whispers he distinctly said that he would rather say no more upon the subject just then he would wait for mr rounds return am i at liberty he asked to mention that offer of the thousand pounds  whatto mat round said dockwrath certainly not mr mason it wouldnt be our game at all  very well sir and then mr mason took up a newspaper and no further words were spoken till the door opened and mr round reentered the room  this he did with slow deliberate step and stopping on the hearthrug he stood leaning with his back against the mantelpiece it was clear from his face to see that he had much to tell and clear also that he was not pleased at the turn which affairs were taking  well gentlemen i have examined the woman he said and here is her deposition  and what does she say asked mr mason  come out with it sir said dockwrath did she or did she not sign two documents on that day  mr mason said round turning to that gentleman and altogether ignoring dockwrath and his question i have to tell you that her statement as far as it goes fully corroborates your view of the case as far as it goes mind you  oh it does does it said dockwrath  and she is the only important witness said mr mason with great exultation  i have never said that what i did say was thisthat your case must break down unless her evidence supported it it does support itstrongly but you will want more than that  and now if you please mr round what is it that she has deposed asked dockwrath  she remembers it all then said mason  she is a remarkably clearheaded woman and apparently does remember a great deal but her remembrance chiefly and most strongly goes to thisthat she witnessed only one deed  she can prove that can she said mason and the tone of his voice was loudly triumphant  she declares that she never signed but one deed in the whole of her lifeeither on that day or on any other and over and beyond this she says nownow that i have explained to her what that other deed might have beenthat old mr usbech told her that it was about a partnership  he did did he said dockwrath rising from his chair and clapping his hands very well i dont think we shall want more than that mr mason  there was a tone of triumph in the mans voice and a look of gratified malice in his countenance which disgusted mr round and irritated him almost beyond his power of endurance it was quite true that he would much have preferred to find that the womans evidence was in favour of lady mason he would have been glad to learn that she actually had witnessed the two deeds on the same day his tone would have been triumphant and his face gratified had he returned to the room with such tidings his feelings were all on that side though his duty lay on the other he had almost expected that it would be so as it was he was prepared to go on with his duty but he was not prepared to endure the insolence of mr dockwrath there was a look of joy also about mr mason which added to his annoyance it might be just and necessary to prosecute that unfortunate woman at orley farm but he could not gloat over such work  mr dockwrath he said i will not put up with such conduct here if you wish to rejoice about this you must go elsewhere  and what are we to do now said mr mason i presume there need be no further delay  i must consult with my partner if you can make it convenient to call this day week  but she will escape  no she will not escape i shall not be ready to say anything before that if you are not in town then i can write to you and so the meeting was broken up and mr mason and mr dockwrath left the lawyers office together  mr mason and mr dockwrath left the office in bedford row together and thus it was almost a necessity that they should walk together for some distance through the streets mr mason was going to his hotel in soho square and mr dockwrath turned with him through the passage leading into red lion square linking his own arm in that of his companion the yorkshire county magistrate did not quite like this but what was he to do  did you ever see anything like that sir said mr dockwrath for by heavens i never did  like what said mr mason  like that fellow therethat round it is my opinion that he deserves to have his name struck from the rolls is it not clear that he is doing all in his power to bring that wretched woman off and ill tell you what mr mason if you let him play his own game in that way he will bring her off  but he expressly admitted that this woman bolsters evidence is conclusive  yes he was so driven into a corner that he could not help admitting that the woman had been too many for him and he found that he couldnt cushion her but do you mind my words mr mason he intends that you shall be beaten its as plain as the nose on your face you can read it in the very look of him and in every tone of his voice at any rate i can ill tell you what it isand then he squeezed very close to mr masonhe and old furnival understand each other in this matter like two brothers of course round will have his bill against you win or lose hell get his costs out of your pocket but he can make a deuced pretty thing out of the other side as well let me tell you mr mason that when notes for a thousand pounds are flying here and there it isnt every lawyer that will see them pass by him without opening his hand  i do not think that mr round would take a bribe said mr mason very stiffly  wouldnt he just as a hound would a pat of butter its your own lookout you know mr mason i havent got an estate of twelve hundred a year depending on it but remember thisif she escapes now orley farm is gone for ever  all this was extremely disagreeable to mr mason in the first place he did not at all like the tone of equality which the hamworth attorney had adopted he did not like to acknowledge that his affairs were in any degree dependent on a man of whom he thought so badly as he did of mr dockwrath he did not like to be told that round and crook were roguesround and crook whom he had known all his life but least of all did he like the feeling of suspicion with which in spite of himself this man had imbued him or the fear that his victim might at last escape him excellent therefore as had been the evidence with which bridget bolster had declared herself ready to give in his favour mr mason was not a contented man when he sat down to his solitary beefsteak in soho square     chapter xxxiii  the angel of light   in speaking of the character and antecedents of felix graham i have said that he was moulding a wife for himself the idea of a wife thus moulded to fit a mans own grooves and educated to suit matrimonial purposes according to the exact views of the future husband was by no means original with him other men have moulded their wives but i do not know that as a rule the practice has been found to answer it is open in the first place to this objectionthat the moulder does not generally conceive such idea very early in life and the idea when conceived must necessarily be carried out on a young subject such a plan is the result of much deliberate thought and has generally arisen from long observation on the part of the thinker of the unhappiness arising from marriages in which there has been no moulding such a frame of mind comes upon a bachelor perhaps about his thirtyfifth year and then he goes to work with a girl of fourteen the operation takes some ten years at the end of which the moulded bride regards her lord as an old man on the whole i think that the ordinary plan is the better and even the safer dance with a girl three times and if you like the light of her eye and the tone of voice with which she breathless answers your little questions about horseflesh and musicabout affairs masculine and femininethen take the leap in the dark there is danger no doubt but the moulded wife is i think more dangerous  with felix graham the matter was somewhat different seeing that he was not yet thirty and that the lady destined to be the mistress of his family had already passed through three or four years of her noviciate he had begun to be prudent early in life or had become prudent rather by force of sentiment than by force of thought mary snow was the name of his brideelect and it is probable that had not circumstances thrown mary snow in his way he would not have gone out of his way to seek a subject for his experiment mary snow was the daughter of an engravernot of an artist who receives four or five thousand pounds for engraving the chefdoeuvre of a modern painterbut of a man who executed flourishes on ornamental cards for tradespeople and assisted in the illustration of circus playbills with this man graham had become acquainted through certain transactions of his with the press and had found him to be a widower drunken dissolute and generally drowned in poverty one child the man had and that child was mary snow  how it came to pass that the young barrister first took upon himself the charge of maintaining and educating this poor child need not now be told his motives had been thoroughly good and in the matter he had endeavoured to act the part of a kind samaritan he had found her pretty half starved dirty ignorant and modest and so finding her had made himself responsible for feeding cleaning and teaching herand ultimately for marrying her one would have said that in undertaking a task of such undoubted charity as that comprised in the three first charges he would have encountered no difficulty from the drunken dissolute impoverished engraver but the man from the beginning was cunning and before graham had succeeded in obtaining the custody of the child the father had obtained a written undertaking from him that he would marry her at a certain age if her conduct up to that age had been becoming as to this latter stipulation no doubt had arisen and indeed graham had so acted by her that had she fallen away the fault would have been all her own there wanted now but one year to the coming of that day on which he was bound to make himself a happy man and hitherto he himself had never doubted as to the accomplishment of his undertaking  he had told his friendsthose with whom he was really intimate augustus staveley and one or two otherswhat was to be his matrimonial lot in life and they had ridiculed him for his quixotic chivalry staveley especially had been strong in his conviction that no such marriage would ever take place and had already gone so far as to plan another match for his friend  you know you do not love her he had said since felix had been staying on this occasion at noningsby  i know no such thing felix had answered almost in anger on the contrary i know that i do love her  yes as i love my niece marian or old aunt bessy who always supplied me with sugarcandy when i was a boy  it is i that have supplied mary with her sugarcandy and the love thus engendered is the stronger  nevertheless you are not in love with her and never will be and if you marry her you will commit a great sin  how moral you have grown  no im not im not a bit moral but i know very well when a man is in love with a girl and i know very well that youre not in love with mary snow and i tell you what my friend if you do marry her you are done for life there will absolutely be an end of you  you mean to say that your royal highness will drop me  i mean to say nothing about myself my dropping you or not dropping you wont alter your lot in life i know very well what a poor man wants to give him a start and a fellow like you who has such quaint ideas on so many things requires all the assistance he can get you should look out for money and connection  sophia furnival for instance  no she would not suit you i perceive that now  so i supposed well my dear fellow we shall not come to loggerheads about that she is a very fine girl and you are welcome to the hatful of moneyif you can get it  thats nonsense im not thinking of sophia furnival any more than you are but if i did it would be a proper marriage now and then he went on with some further very sage remarks about miss snow  all this was said as felix graham was lying with his broken bones in the comfortable room at noningsby and to tell the truth when it was so said his heart was not quite at ease about mary snow up to this time having long since made up his mind that mary should be his wife he had never allowed his thoughts to be diverted from that purpose nor did he so allow them nowas long as he could prevent them from wandering  but lying there at noningsby thinking of those sweet christmas evenings how was it possible that they should not wander his friend had told him that he did not love mary snow and then when alone he asked himself whether in truth he did love her he had pledged himself to marry her and he must carry out that pledge but nevertheless did he love her and if not her did he love any other  mary snow knew very well what was to be her destiny and indeed had known it for the last two years she was now nineteen years oldand madeline staveley was also nineteen she was nineteen and at twenty she was to become a wife as by agreement between felix graham and mr snow the drunken engraver they knew their destinythe future husband and the future wifeand each relied with perfect faith on the good faith and affection of the other  graham while he was thus being lectured by staveley had under his pillow a letter from mary he wrote to her regularlyon every sunday and on every tuesday she answered him nothing could be more becoming than the way she obeyed all his behests on such matters and it really did seem that in his case the moulded wife would turn out to have been well moulded when staveley left him he again read marys letter her letters were always of the same length filling completely the four sides of a sheet of note paper they were excellently well written and as no one word in them was ever altered or erased it was manifest enough to felix that the original composition was made on a rough draft as he again read through the four sides of the little sheet of paper he could not refrain from conjecturing what sort of a letter madeline staveley might write mary snows letter ran as follows      3 bloomfield terrace peckham    tuesday 10 january 18     my dearest felix  she had so called him for the last twelvemonth by common consent between graham and the very discreet lady under whose charge she at present lived previously to that she had written to him as my dear mr graham     my dearest felix     i am very glad to hear that your arm and your two ribs are    getting so much better i received your letter yesterday    and was glad to hear that you are so comfortable in    the house of the very kind people with whom you are    staying if i knew them i would send them my respectful    remembrances but as i do not know them i suppose it would    not be proper but i remember them in my prayers  this last assurance was inserted under the express instruction of mrs thomas who however did not read marys letters but occasionally on some subjects gave her hints as to what she ought to say nor was there hypocrisy in this for under the instruction of her excellent mentor she had prayed for the kind people     i hope you will be well enough to come and pay me a visit    before long but pray do not come before you are well    enough to do so without giving yourself any pain i am    glad to hear that you do not mean to go hunting any more    for it seems to me to be a dangerous amusement  and then the first paragraph came to an end     my papa called here yesterday he said he was very badly    off indeed and so he looked i did not know what to    say at first but he asked me so much to give him some    money that i did give him at last all that i had it was    nineteen shillings and sixpence mrs thomas was angry    and told me i had no right to give away your money and    that i should not have given more than half a crown i    hope you will not be angry with me i do not want any more    at present but indeed he was very bad especially about    his shoes     i do not know that i have any more to say except that    i put back thirty lines of télémaque into french every    morning before breakfast it never comes near right but    nevertheless m grigaud says it is well done he says that    if it came quite right i should compose french as well as    m fénelon which of course i cannot expect     i will now say goodbye and i am yours most    affectionately     mary snow   there was nothing in this letter to give any offence to felix graham and so he acknowledged to himself he made himself so acknowledge because on the first reading of it he had felt that he was half angry with the writer it was clear that there was nothing in the letter which would justify censurenothing which did not almost demand praise he would have been angry with her had she limited her filial donation to the halfcrown which mrs thomas had thought appropriate he was obliged to her for that attention to her french which he had specially enjoined nothing could be more proper than her allusion to the staveleysand altogether the letter was just what it ought to be nevertheless it made him unhappy and irritated him was it well that he should marry a girl whose father was indeed very bad but especially about his shoes staveley had told him that connection would be necessary for him and what sort of a connection would this be and was there one word in the whole letter that showed a spark of true love did not the footfall of madeline staveleys step as she passed along the passage go nearer to his heart than all the outspoken assurance of mary snows letter  nevertheless he had undertaken to do this thing and he would do itlet the footfall of madeline staveleys step be ever so sweet in his ear and then lying back in his bed he began to think whether it would have been as well that he should have broken his neck instead of his ribs in getting out of monkton grange covert  mrs thomas was a lady who kept a school consisting of three little girls and mary snow she had in fact not been altogether successful in the line of life she had chosen for herself and had hardly been able to keep her modest doorplate on her door till graham in search of some home for his bride then in the first noviciate of her moulding had come across her her means were now far from plentiful but as an average number of three children still clung to her and as mary snows seventy pounds per annumto include clotheswere punctually paid the small house at peckham was maintained under these circumstances mary snow was somebody in the eyes of mrs thomas and felix graham was a very great person indeed  graham had received his letter on a wednesday and on the following monday mary as usual received one from him these letters always came to her in the evening as she was sitting over her tea with mrs thomas the three children having been duly put to bed grahams letters were very short as a man with a broken right arm and two broken ribs is not fluent with his pen but still a word or two did come to her dearest mary i am doing better and better and i hope i shall see you in about a fortnight quite right in giving the money stick to the french your own f g but as he signed himself her own his mind misgave him that he was lying  it is very good of him to write to you while he is in such a state said mrs thomas  indeed it is said maryvery good indeed and then she went on with the history of rasselas in his happy valley by which study mrs thomas intended to initiate her into that course of novelreading which has become necessary for a british lady but mrs thomas had a mind to improve the present occasion it was her duty to inculcate in her pupil love and gratitude towards the beneficent man who was doing so much for her gratitude for favours past and love for favours to come and now while that scrap of a letter was lying on the table the occasion for doing so was opportune  mary i do hope you love mr graham with all your heart and all your strength she would have thought it wicked to say more but so far she thought she might go considering the sacred tie which was to exist between her pupil and the gentleman in question  oh yes indeed i do and then marys eyes fell wishfully on the cover of the book which lay in her lap while her finger kept the place rasselas is not very exciting but it was more so than mrs thomas  you would be very wicked if you did not and i hope you think sometimes of the very responsible duties which a wife owes to her husband and this will be more especially so with you than with any other womanalmost that i ever heard of  there was something in this that was almost depressing to poor marys spirit but nevertheless she endeavoured to bear up against it and do her duty i shall do all i can to please him mrs thomasand indeed i do try about the french and he says i was right to give papa that money  but there will be many more things than that when youve stood at the altar with him and become his wifebone of his bone mary and she spoke these last words in a very solemn tone shaking her head and the solemn tone almost ossified poor marys heart as she heard it  yes i know there will but i shall endeavour to find out what he likes  i dont think he is so particular about his eating and drinking as some other gentlemen though no doubt he will like his things nice  i know he is fond of strong tea and i shant forget that  and about dress he is not very rich you know mary but it will make him unhappy if you are not always tidy and his own shirtsi fancy he has no one to look after them now for i so often see the buttons off you should never let one of them go into his drawers without feeling them all to see that theyre on tight  ill remember that said mary and then she made another little furtive attempt to open the book  and about your own stockings mary nothing is so useful to a young woman in your position as a habit of darning neat im sometimes almost afraid that you dont like darning  oh yes i do that was a fib but what could she do poor girl when so pressed  because i thought you would look at jane robinsons and julia wrights which are lying there in the basket i did rebeccas myself before tea till my old eyes were sore  oh i didnt know said mary with some slight offence in her tone why didnt you ask me to do them downright if you wanted  its only for the practice it will give you  practice im always practising something but nevertheless she laid down the book and dragged the basket of work up on to the table why mrs thomas its impossible to mend these theyre all darn  give them to me said mrs thomas and then there was silence between them for a quarter of an hour during which marys thoughts wandered away to the events of her future life would his stockings be so troublesome as these  but mrs thomas was at heart an honest woman and as a rule was honest also in practice her conscience told her that mr graham might probably not approve of this sort of practice for conjugal duties and in spite of her failing eyes she resolved to do her duty never mind them mary said she i remember now that you were doing your own before dinner  of course i was said mary sulkily and as for practice i dont suppose hell want me to do more of that than anything else  well dear put them by and miss snow did put them by resuming rasselas as she did so who darned the stockings of rasselas and felt that the buttons were tight on his shirts what a happy valley must it have been if a bride expectant were free from all such cares as these  i suppose mary it will be some time in the spring of next year mrs thomas was not reading and therefore a little conversation from time to time was to her a solace  what will be mrs thomas  why the marriage  i suppose it will he told father it should be early in 18 and i shall be past twenty then  i wonder where youll go to live  i dont know he has never said anything about that  i suppose not but im sure it will be a long way away from peckham in answer to this mary said nothing but could not help wishing that it might be so peckham to her had not been a place bright with happiness although she had become in so marked a way a child of good fortune and then moreover she had a deep care on her mind with which the streets and houses and pathways of peckham were closely connected it would be very expedient that she should go far far away from peckham when she had become in actual fact the very wife of felix graham  miss mary whispered the redarmed maid of all work creeping up to marys bedroom door when they had all retired for the night and whispering through the chink miss mary ive somethink to say and mary opened the door ive got a letter from him and the maid of all work absolutely produced a little note enclosed in a green envelope  sarah i told you not said mary looking very stern and hesitating with her finger whether or no she would take the letter  but he did so beg and pray besides miss as he says hisself he must have his answer any genleman he says as a right to a answer and if youd a seed him yourself im sure youd have took it he did look so nice with a blue and gold hankercher round his neck he was agoing to the theatre he said  and who was going with him sarah  oh no one only his mamma and sister and them sort hes all righthe is and then mary snow did take the letter  and ill come for the answer when youre settling the room after breakfast tomorrow said the girl  no i dont know i shant send any answer at all but sarah for heavens sake do not say a word about it  who i laws love you miss i wouldntnot for worlds of gold and then mary was left alone to read a second letter from a second suitor  angel of light it began but cold as your own fair name poor mary thought it was very nice and very sweet and though she was so much afraid of it that she almost wished it away yet she read it a score of times stolen pleasures always are sweet she had not cared to read those two lines from her own betrothed lord above once or at the most twice and yet they had been written by a good mana man superlatively good to her and written too with considerable pain  illustration the angel of light  she sat down all trembling to think of what she was doing and then as she thought she read the letter again angel of light but cold as your own fair name alas alas it was very sweet to her     chapter xxxiv  mr furnival looks for assistance   and you think that nothing can be done down there said mr furnival to his clerk immediately after the return of mr crabwitz from hamworth to london  nothing at all sir said mr crabwitz with laconic significance  well i dare say not if the matter could have been arranged at a reasonable cost without annoyance to my friend lady mason i should have been glad but on the whole it will perhaps be better that the law should take its course she will suffer a good deal but she will be the safer for it afterwards  mr furnival i went so far as to offer a thousand pounds  a thousand pounds then theyll think were afraid of them  not a bit more than they did before though i offered the money he doesnt know the least that the offer came from our side but ill tell you what it is mr furnival i suppose i may speak my mind  oh yes but remember this crabwitz lady mason is no more in danger of losing the property than you are it is a most vexatious thing but there can be no doubt as to what the result will be  well mr furnivali dont know  in such matters i am tolerably well able to form an opinion  oh certainly  and thats my opinion now i shall be very glad to hear yours  my opinion is this mr furnival that sir joseph never made that codicil  and what makes you think so  the whole course of the evidence its quite clear there was another deed executed that day and witnessed by bolster and kenneby had there been two documents for them to witness they would have remembered it so soon after the occurrence  well crabwitz i differ from youdiffer from you in toto but keep your opinion to yourself thats all ive no doubt you did the best for us you could down at hamworth and im much obliged to you youll find weve got our hands quite full againalmost too full then he turned round to his table and to the papers upon it whereupon crabwitz took the hint and left the room  but when he had gone mr furnival again raised his eyes from the papers on the table and leaning back in his chair gave himself up to further consideration of the orley farm case crabwitz he knew was a sharp clever man and now the opinion formed by crabwitz after having seen this hamworth attorney tallied with his own opinion yes it was his own opinion he had never said as much even to himself with those inward words which a man uses when he assures himself of the result of his own thoughts but he was aware that it was his own opinion in his heart of hearts he did believe that that codicil had been fraudulently manufactured by his friend and client lady mason  under these circumstances what should he do he had the handle of his pen between his teeth as was his habit when he was thinking and tried to bring himself to some permanent resolution  how beautiful had she looked while she stood in sir peregrines library leaning on the old mans armhow beautiful and how innocent that was the form which his thoughts chiefly took and then she had given him her hand and he still felt the soft silken touch of her cool fingers he would not be a man if he could desert a woman in such a strait and such a woman if even guilty had she not expiated her guilt by deep sorrow and then he thought of mr mason of groby park and he thought of sir peregrines strong conviction and of judge staveleys belief and he thought also of the strong hold which public opinion and twenty years of possession would still give to the cause he favoured he would still bring her through yes in spite of her guilt if she were guilty on the strength of her innocency if she were innocent but on account of her beauty and soft hand and deep liquid eye so at least he would have owned could he have been honest enough to tell himself the whole truth  but he must prepare himself for the battle in earnest it was not as though he had been briefed in this case and had merely to perform the duty for which he had been hired he was to undertake the whole legal management of the affair he must settle what attorney should have the matter in hand and instruct that attorney how to reinstruct him and how to reinstruct those other barristers who must necessarily be employed on the defence in a case of such magnitude he did not yet know under what form the attack would be made but he was nearly certain that it would be done in the shape of a criminal charge he hoped that it might take the direct form of an accusation of forgery the stronger and more venomous the charge made the stronger also would be public opinion in favour of the accused and the greater the chance of an acquittal but if she were to be found guilty on any charge it would matter little on what any such verdict of guilty would be utter ruin and obliteration of her existence  he must consult with some one and at last he made up his mind to go to his very old friend mr chaffanbrass mr chaffanbrass was safe and he might speak out his mind to him without fear of damaging the cause not that he could bring himself to speak out his real mind even to mr chaffanbrass he would so speak that mr chaffanbrass should clearly understand him but still not even to his ears would he say that he really believed lady mason to have been guilty how would it be possible that he should feign before a jury his assured nay his indignant conviction of his clients innocence if he had ever whispered to any one his conviction of her guilt  on that same afternoon he sent to make an appointment with mr chaffanbrass and immediately after breakfast on the following morning had himself taken to that gentlemans chambers the chambers of this great guardian of the innocenceor rather notguiltiness of the publicwere not in any sonamed inn but consisted of two gloomy dark panelled rooms in ely place the course of our story however will not cause us to make many visits to ely place and any closer description of them may be spared i have said that mr chaffanbrass and mr furnival were very old friends so they were they had known each other for more than thirty years and each knew the whole history of the others rise and progress in the profession but any results of their friendship at present were but scanty they might meet each other in the streets perhaps once in the year and occasionallybut very seldommight be brought together on subjects connected with their profession as was the case when they travelled together down to birmingham as to meeting in each others houses or coming together for the sake of the friendship which existedthe idea of doing so never entered the head of either of them  all the world knows mr chaffanbrasseither by sight or by reputation those who have been happy enough to see the face and gait of the man as in years now gone he used to lord it at the old bailey may not have thought much of the privilege which was theirs but to those who have only read of him and know of his deeds simply by their triumphs he was a man very famous and worthy to be seen look thats chaffanbrass it was he who crossexamined  at the old bailey and sent him howling out of london banished for ever into the wilderness where where is that chaffanbrass what a dirty little man  to this dirty little man in ely place mr furnival now went in his difficulty mr furnival might feel himself sufficient to secure the acquittal of an innocent person or even of a guilty person under ordinary circumstances but if any man in england could secure the acquittal of a guilty person under extraordinary circumstances it would be mr chaffanbrass this had been his special line of work for the last thirty years  mr chaffanbrass was a dirty little man and when seen without his gown and wig might at a first glance be thought insignificant but he knew well how to hold his own in the world and could maintain his opinion unshaken against all the judges in the land well furnival and what can i do for you he said as soon as the member for the essex marshes was seated opposite to him it isnt often that the light of your countenance shines so far east as this somebody must be in trouble i suppose  somebody is in trouble said mr furnival and then he began to tell his story mr chaffanbrass listened almost in silence throughout now and then he asked a question by a word or two expressing no opinion whatever as he did so but he was satisfied to leave the talking altogether in the hands of his visitor till the whole tale was told ah he said then a clever woman  an uncommonly sweet creature too said mr furnival  i dare say said mr chaffanbrass and then there was a pause  and what can i do for you said mr chaffanbrass  in the first place i should be very glad to have your advice and then of course i must lead in defending herunless it were well that i should put the case altogether in your hands  oh no dont think of that i couldnt give the time to it my heart is not in it as yours is where will it be  at alston i suppose  at the spring assizes that will be let me see about the 10th of march  i should think we might get it postponed till the summer round is not at all hot about it  should we gain anything by that if a prisoner be innocent why torment him by delay he is tolerably sure of escape if he be guilty extension of time only brings out the facts the clearer as far as my experience goes the sooner a man is tried the betteralways  and you would consent to hold a brief  under you well yes i dont mind it at alston anything to oblige an old friend i never was proud you know  and what do you think about it chaffanbrass  ah thats the question  she must be pulled through twenty years of possession think of that  thats what mason the man down in yorkshire is thinking of theres no doubt of course about that partnership deed  i fear not round would not go on with it if that were not all true  it depends on those two witnesses furnival i remember the case of old though it was twenty years ago and i had nothing to do with it i remember thinking that lady mason was a very clever woman and that round and crook were rather slow  hes a brute is that fellow mason of groby park  a brute is he well get him into the box and make him say as much for himself shes uncommonly pretty isnt she  she is a pretty woman  and interesting it will all tell you know a widow with one son isnt she  yes and she has done her duty admirably since her husbands death you will find too that she has the sympathies of all the best people in her neighbourhood she is staying now at the house of sir peregrine orme who would do anything for her  anything would he  and the staveleys know her the judge is convinced of her innocence  is he hell probably have the home circuit in the summer his conviction expressed from the bench would be more useful to her you can make staveley believe everything in a drawingroom or over a glass of wine but ill be hanged if i can ever get him to believe anything when hes on the bench  but chaffanbrass the countenance of such people will be of great use to her down there everybody will know that shes been staying with sir peregrine  ive no doubt shes a clever woman  but this new trouble has half killed her  i dont wonder at that either these sort of troubles do vex people a pretty woman like that should have everything smooth shouldnt she well well do the best we can youll see that im properly instructed bytheby who is her attorney in such a case as that you couldnt have a better man than old solomon aram but solomon aram is too far east from you i suppose  isnt he a jew  upon my word i dont know hes an attorney and thats enough for me  and then the matter was again discussed between them and it was agreed that a third counsel would be wanting felix graham is very much interested in the case said mr furnival and is as firmly convinced of her innocence asas i am and he managed to look his ally in the face and to keep his countenance firmly  ah said mr chaffanbrass but what if he should happen to change his opinion about his own client  we could prevent that i think  im not so sure and then hed throw her over as sure as your names furnival  i hardly think hed do that  i believe hed do anything and mr chaffanbrass was quite moved to enthusiasm ive heard that man talk more nonsense about the profession in one hour than i ever heard before since i first put a cotton gown on my back he does not understand the nature of the duty which a professional man owes to his client  but hed work well if he had a case at heart himself i dont like him but he is clever  you can do as you like of course i shall be out of my ground down at alston and of course i dont care who takes the fag of the work but i tell you this fairlyif he does go into the case and then turns against us or drops iti shall turn against him and drop into him  heaven help him in such a case as that and then these two great luminaries of the law shook hands and parted  one thing was quite clear to mr furnival as he had himself carried in a cab from ely place to his own chambers in lincolns inn mr chaffanbrass was fully convinced of lady masons guilt he had not actually said so but he had not even troubled himself to go through the little ceremony of expressing a belief in her innocence mr furnival was well aware that mr chaffanbrass would not on this account be less likely to come out strongly with such assurances before a jury or to be less severe in his crossexamination of a witness whose evidence went to prove that guilt but nevertheless the conviction was disheartening mr chaffanbrass would know almost by instinct whether an accused person was or was not guilty and he had already perceived by instinct that lady mason was guilty mr furnival sighed as he stepped out of his cab and again wished that he could wash his hands of the whole affair he wished it very muchbut he knew that his wish could not be gratified  solomon aram he said to himself as he again sat down in his armchair it will sound badly to those people down at alston at the old bailey they dont mind that kind of thing and then he made up his mind that solomon aram would not do it would be a disgrace to him to take a case out of solomon arams hands mr chaffanbrass did not understand all this mr chaffanbrass had been dealing with solomon arams all his life mr chaffanbrass could not see the effect which such an alliance would have on the character of a barrister holding mr furnivals position solomon aram was a good man in his way no doubtperhaps the best man going in taking every dodge to prevent a conviction no man could be better than solomon aram all this mr furnival feltbut he felt also that he could not afford it it would be tantamount to a confession of guilt to take such a man as that down into the country he said to himself trying to excuse himself  and then he also made up his mind that he would sound felix graham if felix graham could be induced to take up the case thoroughly believing in the innocence of his client no man would be more useful as a junior felix graham went the home circuit on which alston was one of the assize towns     chapter xxxv  love was still the lord of all   why should i not such had been the question which sir peregrine orme had asked himself over and over again in these latter days since lady mason had been staying at his house and the purport of the question was thiswhy should he not make lady mason his wife  i and my readers can probably see very many reasons why he should not do so but then we are not in love with lady mason her charms and her sorrowsher soft sad smile and her more lovely tears have not operated upon us we are not chivalrous old gentlemen past seventy years of age but still alive keenly alive to a strong feeling of romance that visit will perhaps be remembered which mr furnival made at the cleeve and the subsequent interview between lady mason and the baronet on that day he merely asked himself the question and took no further step on the subsequent day and the day after it was the same he still asked himself the question sitting alone in his library but he did not ask it as yet of any one else when he met lady mason in these days his manner to her was full of the deference due to a lady and of the affection due to a dear friend but that was all mrs orme seeing this and cordially concurring in this love for her guest followed the lead which her fatherinlaw gave and threw herself into lady masons arms they two were fast and bosom friends  and what did lady mason think of all this in truth there was much in it that was sweet to her but there was something also that increased that idea of danger which now seemed to envelop her whole existence why had sir peregrine so treated her in the library behaving towards her with such tokens of close affection he had put his arm round her waist and kissed her lips and pressed her to his old bosom why had this been so he had assured her that he would be to her as a father but her womans instinct had told her that the pressure of his hand had been warmer than that which a father accords to his adopted daughter no idea of anger had come upon her for a moment but she had thought about it much and had thought about it almost in dismay what if the old man did mean more than a fathers love it seemed to her as though it must be a dream that he should do so but what if he did how should she answer him in such circumstances what should she do or say could she afford to buy his friendshipeven his warmest love at the cost of the enmity of so many others would not mrs orme hate her mrs orme whom she truly dearly eagerly loved mrs ormes affection was of all personal gratifications the sweetest to her and the young heirwould not he hate her nay would he not interfere and with some strong hand prevent so mean a deed on the part of his grandfather and if so would she not thus have lost them altogether and then she thought of that other friend whose aid would be so indispensable to her in this dreadful time of tribulation how would mr furnival receive such tidings if it should come to pass that such tidings were to be told  lady mason was rich with female charms and she used them partly with the innocence of the dove but partly also with the wisdom of the serpent but in such use as she did make of these only weapons which providence had given to her i do not think that she can be regarded as very culpable during those long years of her young widowhood in which nothing had been wanting to her her conduct had been free from any hint of reproach she had been content to find all her joy in her duties and in her love as a mother now a great necessity for assistance had come upon her it was necessary that she should bind men to her cause men powerful in the world and able to fight her battle with strong arms she did so bind them with the only chains at her commandbut she had no thought nay no suspicion of evil in so doing it was very painful to her when she found that she had caused unhappiness to mrs furnival and it caused her pain now also when she thought of sir peregrines new love she did wish to bind these men to her by a strong attachment but she would have stayed this feeling at a certain point had it been possible for her so to manage it  in the mean time sir peregrine still asked himself that question he had declared to himself when first the idea had come to him that none of those whom he loved should be injured he would even ask his daughterinlaws consent condescending to plead his cause before her making her understand his motives and asking her acquiescence as a favour he would be so careful of his grandson that this second marriageif such event did come to passshould not put a pound out of his pocket or at any rate should not hamper the succession of the estate with a pound of debt and then he made excuses to himself as to the step which he proposed to take thinking how he would meet his friends and how he would carry himself before his old servants  old men have made more silly marriages than this which he then desired gentlemen such as sir peregrine in age and station have married their housemaidshave married young girls of eighteen years of agehave done so and faced their friends and servants afterwards the bride that he proposed to himself was a lady an old friend a woman over forty and one whom by such a marriage he could greatly assist in her deep sorrow why should he not do it  after much of such thoughts as these extended over nearly a week he resolved to speak his mind to mrs orme if it were to be done it should be done at once the incredulous unromantic readers of this age would hardly believe me if i said that his main object was to render assistance to lady mason in her difficulty but so he assured himself and so he believed this assistance to be of true service must be given at onceand having so resolved he sent for mrs orme into the library  edith my darling he said taking her hand and pressing it between both his own as was often the wont with him in his more affectionate moods i want to speak to youon business that concerns me nearly may perhaps concern us all nearly can you give me half an hour  of course i canwhat is it sir i am a bad hand at business but you know that  sit down dear there sit there and i will sit here as to this business no one can counsel me as well as you  dearest father i should be a poor councillor in anything  not in this edith it is about lady mason that i would speak to you we both love her dearly do we not  i do  and are glad to have her here  oh so glad when this trial is only over it will be so sweet to have her for a neighbour we really know her now and it will be so pleasant to see much of her  there was nothing discouraging in this but still the words in some slight degree grated against sir peregrines feelings at the present moment he did not wish to think of lady mason as living at orley farm and would have preferred that his daughterinlaw should have spoken of her as being there at the cleeve  yes we know her now he said and believe me in this edith no knowledge obtained of a friend in happiness is at all equal to that which is obtained in sorrow had lady mason been prosperous had she never become subject to the malice and avarice of wicked people i should never have loved her as i do love her  nor should i father  she is a cruelly illused woman and a woman worthy of the kindest usage i am an old man now but it has never before been my lot to be so anxious for a fellowcreature as i am for her it is dreadful to think that innocence in this country should be subject to such attacks  indeed it is but you do not think that there is any danger  this was all very well and showed that mrs ormes mind was well disposed towards the woman whom he loved but he had known that before and he began to feel that he was not approaching the object which he had in view edith at last he said abruptly i love her with my whole heart i would fain make hermy wife sir peregrine orme had never in his course through life failed in anything for lack of courage and when the idea came home to him that he was trembling at the task which he had imposed on himself he dashed at it at once it is so that forlorn hopes are led and become not forlorn it is so that breaches are taken  your wife said mrs orme she would not have breathed a syllable to pain him if she could have helped it but the suddenness of the announcement overcame her for a moment  yes edith my wife let us discuss the matter before you condemn it but in the first place i would have you to understand thisi will not marry her if you say that it will make you unhappy i have not spoken to her as yet and she knows nothing of this project sir peregrine it may be presumed had not himself thought much of that kiss which he had given her you he continued to say have given up your whole life to me you are my angel if this thing will make you unhappy it shall not be done  sir peregrine had not so considered it but with such a woman as mrs orme this was of course the surest way to overcome opposition on her own behalf thinking only of herself she would stand in the way of nothing that could add to sir peregrines happiness but nevertheless the idea was strong in her mind that such a marriage would be imprudent sir peregrine at present stood high before the world would he stand so high if he did this thing his gray hair and old manly bearing were honoured and revered by all who knew him would this still be so if he made himself the husband of lady mason she loved so dearly she valued so highly the honour that was paid to him she was so proud of her own boy in that he was the grandson of so perfect a gentleman would not this be a sad ending to such a career such were the thoughts which ran through her mind at the moment  make me unhappy she said getting up and going over to him it is your happiness of which i would think will it make you more happy  it will enable me to befriend her more effectually  but dearest father you must be the first consideration to usto me and peregrine will it make you more happy  i think it will he answered slowly  then i for one will say nothing against it she answered she was very weak it will be said yes she was weak many of the sweetest kindest best of women are weak in this way it is not every woman that can bring herself to say hard useful wise words in opposition to the follies of those they love best a woman to be useful and wise no doubt should have such power for myself i am not so sure that i like useful and wise women then i for one will say nothing against it said mrs orme deficient in utility wanting in wisdom but full of the sweetest affection  you are sure that you will not love her the less yourself said sir peregrine  yes i am sure of that if it were to be so i should endeavour to love her the more  dearest edith i have only one other person to tell  do you mean peregrine she said in her softest voice  yes of course he must be told but as it would not be well to ask his consentas i have asked yours and then as he said this she kissed his brow  but you will let him know it  yes that is if she accepts my proposition then he shall know it immediately and edith my dear you may be sure of this nothing that i do shall be allowed in any way to injure his prospects or to hamper him as regards money when i am gone if this marriage takes place i cannot do very much for her in the way of money she will understand that something i can of course  and then mrs orme stood over the fire looking at the hot coals and thinking what lady masons answer would be she esteemed lady mason very highly regarding her as a woman sensible and conscientious at all points and she felt by no means certain that the offer would be accepted what if lady mason should say that such an arrangement would not be possible for her mrs orme felt that under such circumstances she at any rate would not withdraw her love from lady mason  and now i may as well speak to her at once said sir peregrine is she in the drawingroom  i left her there  will you ask her to come to mewith my love  i had better not say anything i suppose  sir peregrine in his heart of hearts wished that his daughterinlaw could say it all but he would not give her such a commission no perhaps not and then mrs orme was going to leave him  one word more edith you and i darling have known each other so long and loved each other so well that i should be unhappy if i were to fall in your estimation  there is no fear of that father  will you believe me when i assure you that my great object in doing this is to befriend a good and worthy woman whom i regard as ill usedbeyond all ill usage of which i have hitherto known anything  she then assured him that she did so believe and she assured him truly after that she left him and went away to send in lady mason for her interview in the mean time sir peregrine got up and stood with his back to the fire he would have been glad that the coming scene could be over and yet i should be wronging him to say that he was afraid of it there would be a pleasure to him in telling her that he loved her so dearly and trusted her with such absolute confidence there would be a sort of pleasure to him in speaking even of her sorrow and in repeating his assurance that he would fight the battle for her with all the means at his command and perhaps also there would be some pleasure in the downcast look of her eye as she accepted the tender of his love something of that pleasure he had known already and then he remembered the other alternative it was quite upon the cards that she should decline his offer he did not by any means shut his eyes to that did she do so his friendship should by no means be withdrawn from her he would be very careful from the onset that she should understand so much as that and then he heard the light footsteps in the hall the gentle hand was raised to the door and lady mason was standing in the room  dear lady mason he said meeting her half way across the room it is very kind of you to come to me when i send for you in this way  it would be my duty to come to you if it were half across the kingdomand my pleasure also  would it said he looking into her face with all the wishfulness of a young lover from that moment she knew what was coming strange as was the destiny which was to be offered to her at this period of her life yet she foresaw clearly that the offer was to be made what she did not foresee what she could not foretell was the answer which she might make to it  it would certainly be my sweetest pleasure to send for you if you were away from usto send for you or to follow you said he  i do not know how to make return for all your kind regard to meto you and to dear mrs orme  call her edith will you not you did so call her once  i call her so often when we are alone together now and yet i feel that i have no right  you have every right you shall have every right if you will accept it lady mason i am an old mansome would say a very old man but i am not too old to love you can you accept the love of an old man like me  lady mason was as we are aware not taken in the least by surprise but it was quite necessary that she should seem to be so taken this is a little artifice which is excusable in almost any lady at such a period sir peregrine she said you do not mean more than the love of a most valued friend  yes much more i mean the love of a husband for his wife of a wife for her husband  sir peregrine ah me you have not thought of this my friend you have not remembered the position in which i am placed dearest dearest friend dearest of all friendsand then she knelt before him leaning on his knees as he sat in his accustomed large armchair it may not be so think of the sorrow that would come to you and yours if my enemies should prevail  by  they shall not prevail swore sir peregrine roundly and as he swore the oath he put his two hands upon her shoulders  no we will hope not i should die here at your feet if i thought that they could prevail but i should die twenty deaths were i to drag you with me into disgrace there will be disgrace even in standing at that bar  who will dare to say so when i shall stand there with you said sir peregrine  there was a feeling expressed in his face as he spoke these words which made it glorious and bright and beautiful she with her eyes laden with tears could not see it but nevertheless she knew that it was bright and beautiful and his voice was full of hot eager assurancethat assurance which had the power to convey itself from one breast to another would it not be so if he stood there with her as her husband and lord would it not be the case that no one would dare to impute disgrace to her  and yet she did not wish it even yet thinking of all this as she did think of it according to the truth of the argument which he himself put before her she would still have preferred that it should not be so if she only knew with what words to tell him soto tell him so and yet give no offence for herself she would have married him willingly why should she not nay she could and would have loved him and been to him a wife such as he could have found in no other woman but she said within her heart that she owed him kindness and gratitudethat she owed them all kindness and that it would be bad to repay them in such a way as this she also thought of sir peregrines gray hairs and of his proud standing in the county and the respect in which men held him would it be well in her to drag him down in his last days from the noble pedestal on which he stood and repay him thus for all that he was doing for her  well said he stroking her soft hair with his handsthe hair which appeared in front of the quiet prim cap she wore shall it be so will you give me the right to stand there with you and defend you against the tongues of wicked men we each have our own weakness and we also have each our own strength there i may boast that i should be strong  she thought again for a moment or two without rising from her knees and also without speaking would such strength suffice and if it did suffice would it then be well with him as for herself she did love him if she had not loved him before she loved him now who had ever been to her so noble so loving so gracious as he in her ears no young lovers vows had ever sounded in her heart such love as all the world knows had never been known her former husband had been kind to her in his way and she had done her duty by him carefully painfully and with full acceptance of her position but there had been nothing there that was bright and grand and noble she would have served sir peregrine on her knees in the smallest offices and delighted in such services it was not for lack of love that she must refuse him but still she did not answer him and still he stroked her hair  it would be better that you had never seen me at last she said and she spoke with truth the thought of her mind that she must do his bidding whatever that bidding might be she had in a certain way acknowledged to herself if he would have it so so it must be how could she refuse him anything or be disobedient in aught to one to whom she owed so much but still it would be wiser otherwise wiser for allunless it were for herself alone it would be better that you had never seen me she said  nay not so dearest that it would not be better for mefor me and edith i am quite sure and i would fain hope that for you  oh sir peregrine you know what i mean you know how i value your kindness what should i be if it were withdrawn from me  it shall not be withdrawn do not let that feeling actuate you answer me out of your heart and however your heart may answer remember this that my friendship and support shall be the same if you will take me for your husband as your husband will i stand by you if you cannotthen i will stand by you as your father  what could she say a word or two she did speak as to mrs orme and her feelings delaying her absolute replyand as to peregrine orme and his prospects but on both as on all other points the baronet was armed with his answer he had spoken to his darling edith and she had gladly given her consent to her it would be everything to have so sweet a friend and then as to his heir every care should be taken that no injury should be done to him and speaking of this sir peregrine began to say a few words plaintively about money but then lady mason stopped him no she said she could not and would not listen to that she would have no settlement no consideration as to money should be made to weigh with her it was in no degree for that and then she wept there till she would have fallen had he not supported her  what more is there to be told of course she accepted him as far as i can see into such affairs no alternative was allowed to her she also was not a wise woman at all points she was one whose feelings were sometimes too many for her and whose feelings on this occasion had been much too many for her had she been able to throw aside from her his offer she would have done so but she had felt that she was not able if you wish it sir peregrine she said at last  and can you love an old man he had asked old men sometimes will ask questions such as these she did not answer him but stood by his side and then again he kissed her and was happy  he resolved from that moment that lady mason should no longer be regarded as the widow of a city knight but as the wife elect of a country baronet whatever ridicule he might incur in this matter he would incur at once men and women had dared to speak of her cruelly and they should now learn that any such future speech would be spoken of one who was exclusively his property let any who chose to be speakers under such circumstances look to it he had devoted himself to her that he might be her knight and bear her scathless through the fury of this battle with gods help he would put on his armour at once for that fight let them who would now injure her look to it as soon as might be she should bear his name but all the world should know at once what was her right to claim his protection he had never been a coward and he would not now be guilty of the cowardice of hiding his intentions if there were those who chose to smile at the old mans fancy let them smile there would be many he knew who would not understand an old mans honour and an old mans chivalry  my own one he then said pressing her again to his side will you tell edith or shall i she expects it but lady mason begged that he would tell the tale it was necessary she said that she should be alone for a while and then escaping she went to her own chamber  ask mrs orme if she will kindly step to me said sir peregrine having rang his bell for the servant  lady mason escaped across the hall to the stairs and succeeded in reaching her room without being seen by any one then she sat herself down and began to look her future world in the face two questions she had to ask would it be well for her that this marriage should take place and would it be well for him in an offhand way she had already answered both questions but she had done so by feeling rather than by thought  no doubt she would gain much in the coming struggle by such a position as sir peregrine would give her it did seem to her that mr dockwrath and joseph mason would hardly dare to bring such a charge as that threatened against the wife of sir peregrine orme and then too what evidence as to character would be so substantial as the evidence of such a marriage but how would mr furnival bear it and if he were offended would it be possible that the fight should be fought without him no that would be impossible the lawyers knowledge experience and skill were as necessary to her as the baronets position and character but why should mr furnival be offended by such a marriage she did not know she said to herself she could not see that there should be cause of offence but yet some inner whisper of her conscience told her that there would be offence must mr furnival be told and must he be told at once and then what would lucius say and think and how should she answer the strong words which her son would use to her he would use strong words she knew and would greatly dislike this second marriage of his mother what grownup son is ever pleased to hear that his mother is about to marry the cleeve must be her home nowthat is if she did this deed the cleeve must be her home and she must be separated in all things from orley farm as she thought of this her mind went back and back to those long gone days in which she had been racked with anxiety that orley farm should be the inheritance of the little baby that was lying at her feet she remembered how she had pleaded to the father pointing out the rights of her sondeclaring and with justice that for herself she had asked for nothing but that for himinstead of asking might she not demand was not that other son provided for and those grownup women with their rich husbands is he not your child as well as they she had pleaded is he not your own and as well worthy of your love she had succeeded in getting the inheritance for the baby at her feetbut had his having it made her happy or him then her child had been all in all to her but now she felt that that child was half estranged from her about this very property and would become wholly estranged by the method she was taking to secure it i have toiled for him she said to herself rising up early and going to bed late but the thief cometh in the night and despoileth it who can guess the bitterness of her thoughts as she said this  but her last thoughts as she sat there thinking were of himsir peregrine would it be well for him that he should do this and in thus considering she did not turn her mind chiefly to the usual view in which such a marriage would be regarded men might call sir peregrine an old fool and laugh at him but for that she would with gods help make him amends in those matters he could judge for himself and should he judge it right thus to link his life to hers she would be true and leal to him in all things  but then about this trial if there came disgrace and ruin and an utter overthrow if would it not be well at any rate that no marriage should take place till that had been decided she could not find it in her heart to bring down his old gray hairs with utter sorrow to the grave     chapter xxxvi  what the young men thought about it   lucius mason at this time was living at home at orley farm not by any means in a happy frame of mind it will be perhaps remembered that he had at one time had an interview with mr furnival in that lawyers chambers which was by no means consoling to him seeing that mr furnival had poohpoohed him and his pretensions in a very offhand way and he had since paid a very memorable visit to mr dockwrath in which he had hardly been more successful nevertheless he had gone to another lawyer he had felt it impossible to remain tranquil pursuing the ordinary avocations of his life while such dreadful charges were being made openly against his mother and being so made without any authorised contradiction he knew that she was innocent no doubt on that matter ever perplexed his mind for a moment but why was she such a coward that she would not allow him to protect her innocence in the only way which the law permitted he could hardly believe that he had no power of doing so even without her sanction and therefore he went to another lawyer  the other lawyer did him no good it was not practicable that he the son should bring an action for defamatory character on the part of the mother without that mothers sanction moreover as this new lawyer saw in a moment any such interference on the part of lucius and any interposition of fresh and new legal proceedings would cripple and impede the advisers to whom lady mason had herself confided her own case the new lawyer could do nothing and thus lucius again repulsed betook himself to orley farm in no happy frame of mind  for some day or two after this he did not see his mother he would not go down to the cleeve though they sent up and asked him and she was almost afraid to go across to the house and visit him he will be in church on sunday she had said to mrs orme but he was not in church on sunday and then on sunday afternoon she did go to him this it will be understood was before sir peregrine had made his offer and therefore as to that there was as yet no embarrassment on the widows mind  i cannot help feeling mother he said after she had sat there with him for a short time that for the present there is a division between you and me  oh lucius  it is no use our denying it to ourselves it is so you are in trouble and you will not listen to my advice you leave my house and take to the roof of a new and an untried friend  no lucius not that  yes i say a new friend twelve months ago though you might call there you never did more than thatand even that but seldom they are new friends and yet now that you are in trouble you choose to live with them  dear lucius is there any reason why i should not visit at the cleeve  yes if you ask meyes and now he spoke very sternly there is a cloud upon you and you should know nothing of visitings and of new friendships till that cloud has been dispersed while these things are being said of you you should set at no other table than this and drink of no mans cup but mine i know your innocence and as he went on to speak he stood up before her and looked down fully into her face but others do not i know how unworthy are these falsehoods with which wicked men strive to crush you but others believe that they are true accusations they cannot be disregarded and now it seemsnow that you have allowed them to gather to a head they will result in a trial during which you will have to stand at the bar charged with a dreadful crime  oh lucius and she hid her eyes in her hands i could not have helped it how could i have helped it  well it must be so now and till that trial is over here should be your place here at my right hand i am he who am bound to stand by you it is i whose duty it is to see that your name be made white again though i spend all i have ay and my life in doing it i am the one man on whose arm you have a right to lean and yet in such days as these you leave my house and go to that of a stranger  he is not a stranger lucius  he cannot be to you as a son should be however it is for you to judge i have no control in this matter but i think it right that you should know what are my thoughts  and then she had crept back again to the cleeve let lucius say what he might let this additional sorrow be ever so bitter she could not obey her sons behests if she did so in one thing she must do so in all she had chosen her advisers with her best discretion and by that choice she must abideeven though it separated her from her son she could not abandon sir peregrine orme and mr furnival so she crept back and told all this to mrs orme her heart would have utterly sunk within her could she not have spoken openly to some one of this sorrow  but he loves you mrs orme had said comforting her it is not that he does not love you  but he is so stern to me and then mrs orme had kissed her and promised that none should be stern to her there in that house on the morning after this sir peregrine had made his offer and then she felt that the division between her and her boy would be wider than ever and all this had come of that inheritance which she had demanded so eagerly for her child  and now lucius was sitting alone in his room at orley farm having for the present given up all idea of attempting anything himself by means of the law he had made his way into mr dockwraths office and had there insulted the attorney in the presence of witnesses his hope now was that the attorney might bring an action against him if that were done he would thus have the means of bringing out all the facts of the case before a jury and a judge it was fixed in his mind that if he could once drag that reptile before a public tribunal and with loud voice declare the wrong that was being done all might be well the public would understand and would speak out and the reptile would be scorned and trodden under foot poor lucius it is not always so easy to catch public sympathy and it will occur sometimes that the wrong reptile is crushed by the great public heel  illustration lucius mason in his study  he had his books before him as he sat therehis latham and his pritchard and he had the jawbone of one savage and the skull of another his liverpool bills for unadulterated guano were lying on the table and a philosophical german treatise on agriculture which he had resolved to study it became a man he said to himself to do a mans work in spite of any sorrow but nevertheless as he sat there his studies were but of little service to him how many men have declared to themselves the same thing but have failed when the trial came who can command the temper and the mind at ten i will strike the lyre and begin my poem but at ten the poetic spirit is under a dark cloudbecause the water for the tea had not boiled when it was brought in at nine and so the lyre remains unstricken  and lucius found that he could not strike his lyre for days he had sat there and no good note had been produced and then he had walked over his land having a farming man at his heels thinking that he could turn his mind to the actual and practical working of his land but little good had come of that either it was january and the land was sloppy and half frozen there was no useful work to be done on it and then what farmer greenwood had once said of him was true enough the young maisters spry and active surely but he cant let unself down to stable doong and the loik o that he had some grand idea of farminga conviction that the agricultural world in general was very backward and that he would set it right even now in his sorrow as he walked through his splashy frozen fields he was tormented by a desire to do something he knew not what that might be great  he had no such success on the present occasion and returned disconsolate to the house this happened about noon on the day after that on which sir peregrine had declared himself he returned as i have said to the house and there at the kitchen door he met a little girl whom he knew well as belonging to the cleeve she was a favourite of mrs ormes was educated and clothed by her and ran on her messages now she had brought a letter up to lucius from his mother curtsying low she so told him and he at once went into the sittingroom where he found it lying on his table his hand was nervous as he opened it but if he could have seen how tremulous had been the hand that wrote it the letter was as follows      dearest lucius     i know you will be very much surprised at what i am going    to tell you but i hope you will not judge me harshly    if i know myself at all i would take no step of any kind    for my own advantage which could possibly injure you at    the present moment we unfortunately do not agree about a    subject which is troubling us both and i cannot therefore    consult you as i should otherwise have done i trust that    by gods mercy these troubles may come to an end and that    there may be no further differences between you and me     sir peregrine orme has made me an offer of marriage and i    have accepted it  lucius mason when he had read so far threw down the letter upon the table and rising suddenly from his chair walked rapidly up and down the room marry him he said out loud marry him the idea that their fathers and mothers should marry and enjoy themselves is always a thing horrible to be thought of in the minds of the rising generation lucius mason now began to feel against his mother the same sort of anger which joseph mason had felt when his father had married again marry him and then he walked rapidly about the room as though some great injury had been threatened to him  and so it had in his estimation was it not her position in life to be his mother had she not had her young days but it did not occur to him to think what those young days had been and this then was the meaning of her receding from his advice and from his roof she had been preparing for herself in the world new hopes a new home and a new ambition and she had so prevailed upon the old man that he was about to do this foolish thing then again he walked up and down the room injuring his mother much in his thoughts he gave her credit for none of those circumstances which had truly actuated her in accepting the hand which sir peregrine had offered her in that matter touching the orley farm estate he could acquit his mother instantlywith acclamation but in this other matter he had pronounced her guilty before she had been allowed to plead then he took up the letter and finished it     sir peregrine orme has made me an offer of marriage and    i have accepted it it is very difficult to explain in a    letter all the causes that have induced me to do so the    first perhaps is this that i feel myself so bound to him    by love and gratitude that i think it my duty to fall in    with all his wishes he has pointed out to me that as my    husband he can do more for me than would be possible for    him without that name i have explained to him that i    would rather perish than that he should sacrifice himself    but he is pleased to say that it is no sacrifice at any    rate he so wishes it and as mrs orme has cordially    assented i feel myself bound to fall in with his views    it was only yesterday that sir peregrine made his offer i    mention this that you may know that i have lost no time in    telling you     dearest lucius believe that i shall be as ever    your most affectionate mother     mary mason     the little girl will wait for an answer if she finds that    you are at the farm   no he said to himself still walking about the room she can never be to me the same mother that she was i would have sacrificed everything for her she should have been the mistress of my house at any rate till she herself should have wished it otherwise but now and then his mind turned away suddenly to sophia furnival  i cannot myself but think that had that affair of the trial been set at rest lady mason would have been prudent to look for another home the fact that orley farm was his house and not hers occurred almost too frequently to lucius mason and i am not certain that it would have been altogether comfortable as a permanent residence for his mother after he should have brought home to it some such bride as her he now proposed to himself  it was necessary that he should write an answer to his mother which he did at once      orley farm  january     dear mother     it is i fear too late for me to offer any counsel on the    subject of your letter i cannot say that i think you are    right     your affectionate son     lucius mason   and then having finished this he again walked the room it is all up between me and her he said as real friends in life and heart she shall still have the respect of a son and i shall have the regard of a mother but how can i trim my course to suit the welfare of the wife of sir peregrine orme and then he lashed himself into anger at the idea that his mother should have looked for other solace than that which he could have given  nothing more from the cleeve reached him that day but early on the following morning he had a visitor whom he certainly had not expected before he sat down to his breakfast he heard the sound of a horses feet before the door and immediately afterwards peregrine orme entered the sittingroom he was duly shown in by the servant and in his ordinary way came forward quickly and shook hands then he waited till the door was closed and at once began upon the subject which had brought him there  mason he said you have heard of this that is being done at the cleeve  lucius immediately fell back a step or two and considered for a moment how he should answer he had pressed very heavily on his mother in his own thoughts but he was not prepared to hear her harshly spoken of by another  yes said he i have heard  and i understand from your mother that you do not approve of it  approve of it no i do not approve of it  nor by heavens do i  i do not approve of it said mason speaking with deliberation but i do not know that i can take any steps towards preventing it  cannot you see her and talk to her and tell her how wrong it is  wrong i do not know that she is wrong in that sense i do not know that you have any right to blame her why do not you speak to your grandfather  so i haveas far as it was possible for me but you do not know sir peregrine no one has any influence over him but my motherand now also your mother  and what does mrs orme say  she will say nothing i know well that she disapproves of it she must disapprove of it though she will not say so she would rather burn off both her hands than displease my grandfather she says that he asked her and that she consented  it seems to me that it is for her and you to prevent this  no it is for your mother to prevent it only think of it mason he is over seventy and as he says himself he will not burden the estate with a new jointure why should she do it  you are wronging her there it is no affair of money she is not going to marry him for what she can get  then why should she do it  because he tells her these troubles about the lawsuit have turned her head and she has put herself entirely into his hands i think she is wrong i could have protected her from all this evil and would have done so i could have done more i think than sir peregrine can do but she has thought otherwise and i do not know that i can help it  but will you speak to her will make her perceive that she is injuring a family that is treating her with kindness  if she will come here i will speak to her i cannot do it there i cannot go down to your grandfathers house with such an object as that  all the world will turn against her if she marries him said peregrine and then there was silence between them for a moment or two  it seems to me said lucius at last that you wrong my mother very much in this matter and lay all the blame where but the smallest part of the blame is deserved she has no idea of money in her mind or any thought of pecuniary advantage she is moved solely by what your grandfather has said to herand by an insane dread of some coming evil which she thinks may be lessened by his assistance you are in the house with them and can speak to himand if you please to her also i do not see that i can do either  and you will not help me to break it off  certainlyif i can see my way  will you write to her  well i will think about it  whether she be to blame or not it must be your duty as well as mine to prevent such a marriage if it be possible think what people will say of it  after some further discussion peregrine remounted his horse and rode back to the cleeve not quite satisfied with young mason  if you do speak to herto my mother do it gently those were the last words whispered by lucius as peregrine orme had his foot in the stirrup  young peregrine orme as he rode home felt that the world was using him very unkindly everything was going wrong with him and an idea entered his head that he might as well go and look for sir john franklin at the north pole or join some energetic traveller in the middle of central africa he had proposed to madeline staveley and had been refused that in itself caused a load to lie on his heart which was almost unendurableand now his grandfather was going to disgrace himself he had made his little effort to be respectable and discreet devoting himself to the county hunt and county drawingrooms giving up the pleasures of london and the glories of dissipation and for what  then peregrine began to argue within himself as some others have done before him  were it not better done as others use he said to himself in that or other language and as he rode slowly into the courtyard of the cleeve he thought almost with regret of his old friend carroty bob     chapter xxxvii  peregrines eloquence   in the last chapter peregrine orme called at orley farm with the view of discussing with lucius mason the conduct of their respective progenitors and as will be remembered the young men agreed in a general way that their progenitors were about to make fools of themselves poor peregrine however had other troubles on his mind not only had his grandfather been successful in love but he had been unsuccessful as he had journeyed home from noningsby to the cleeve in a highwheeled vehicle which he called his trap he had determined being then in a frame of mind somewhat softer than was usual with him to tell all his troubles to his mother it sounds as though it were lackadaisicalsuch a resolve as this on the part of a dashing young man who had been given to the pursuit of rats and was now a leader among the sons of nimrod in the pursuit of foxes young men of the present day when got up for the eyes of the world look and talk as though they could never tell their mothers anythingas though they were harder than flint and as little in want of a womans counsel and a womans help as a colonel of horse on the morning of a battle but the rigid virility of his outward accoutrements does in no way alter the man of flesh and blood who wears them the young hero so stern to the eye is i believe as often tempted by stress of sentiment to lay bare the sorrow of his heart as is his sister on this occasion peregrine said to himself that he would lay bare the sorrow of his heart he would find out what others thought of that marriage which he had proposed to himself and then if his mother encouraged him and his grandfather approved he would make another attack beginning on the side of the judge or perhaps on that of lady staveley  but he found that others as well as he were labouring under a stress of sentiment and when about to tell his own tale he had learned that a tale was to be told to him he had dined with lady mason his mother and his grandfather and the dinner had been very silent three of the party were in love and the fourth was burdened with the telling of the tale the baronet himself said nothing on the subject as he and his grandson sat over their wine but later in the evening peregrine was summoned to his mothers room and she with considerable hesitation and much diffidence informed him of the coming nuptials  marry lady mason he had said  yes peregrine why should he not do so if they both wish it  peregrine thought that there were many causes and impediments sufficiently just why no such marriage should take place but he had not his arguments ready at his fingers ends he was so stunned by the intelligence that he could say but little about it on that occasion by the few words that he did say and by the darkness of his countenance he showed plainly enough that he disapproved and then his mother said all that she could in the baronets favour pointing out that in a pecuniary way peregrine would receive benefit rather than injury  im not thinking of the money mother  no my dear but it is right that i should tell you how considerate your grandfather is  all the same i wish he would not marry this woman  woman peregrine you should not speak in that way of a friend whom i dearly love  she is a woman all the same and then he sat sulkily looking at the fire his own stress of sentiment did not admit of free discussion at the present moment and was necessarily postponed on that other affair he was told that his grandfather would be glad to see him on the following morning and then he left his mother  your grandfather peregrine asked for my assent said mrs orme and i thought it right to give it this she said to make him understand that it was no longer in her power to oppose the match and she was thoroughly glad that this was so for she would have lacked the courage to oppose sir peregrine in anything  on the next morning peregrine saw his grandfather before breakfast his mother came to his room door while he was dressing to whisper a word of caution to him pray be courteous to him she said remember how good he is to youto us both say that you congratulate him  but i dont said peregrine  ah but peregrine  ill tell you what ill do mother ill leave the house altogether and go away if you wish it  oh peregrine how can you speak in that way but hes waiting now pray pray be kind in your manner to him  he descended with the same sort of feeling which had oppressed him on his return home after his encounter with carroty bob in smithfield since then he had been on enduring good terms with his grandfather but now again all the discomforts of war were imminent  good morning sir he said on going into his grandfathers dressingroom  good morning peregrine and then there was silence for a moment or two  did you see your mother last night  yes i did see her  and she told you what it is that i propose to do  yes sir she told me  i hope you understand my boy that it will not in any way affect your own interests injuriously  i dont care about that sirone way or the other  but i do peregrine having seen to that i think that i have a right to please myself in this matter  oh yes sir i know you have the right  especially as i can benefit others are you aware that your mother has cordially given her consent to the marriage  she told me that you had asked her and that she had agreed to it she would agree to anything  peregrine that is not the way in which you should speak of your mother  and then the young man stood silent as though there was nothing more to be said indeed he had nothing more to say he did not dare to bring forward in words all the arguments against the marriage which were now crowding themselves into his memory but he could not induce himself to wish the old man joy or to say any of those civil things which are customary on such occasions the baronet sat for a while silent also and a cloud of anger was coming across his brow but he checked that before he spoke well my boy he said and his voice was almost more than usually kind i can understand your thoughts and we will say nothing of them at present all i will ask of you is to treat lady mason in a manner befitting the position in which i intend to place her  if you think it will be more comfortable sir i will leave the cleeve for a time  i hope that may not be necessarywhy should it or at any rate not as yet he added as a thought as to his wedding day occurred to him and then the interview was over and in another halfhour they met again at breakfast  in the breakfastroom lady mason was also present peregrine was the last to enter and as he did so his grandfather was already standing in his usual place with the book of prayers in his hand waiting that the servants should arrange themselves at their chairs before he knelt down there was no time then for much greeting but peregrine did shake hands with her as he stept across to his accustomed corner he shook hands with her and felt that her hand was very cold but he did not look at her nor did he hear any answer given to his muttered words when they all got up she remained close to mrs orme as though she might thus be protected from the anger which she feared from sir peregrines other friends and at breakfast also she sat close to her far away from the baronet and almost hidden by the urn from his grandson sitting there she said nothing neither in truth did she eat anything it was a time of great suffering to her for she knew that her coming could not be welcomed by the young heir it must not be she said to herself over and over again though he turn me out of the house i must tell him that it cannot be so  after breakfast peregrine had ridden over to orley farm and there held his consultation with the other heir on his returning to the cleeve he did not go into the house but having given up his horse to a groom wandered away among the woods lucius mason had suggested that he peregrine orme should himself speak to lady mason on this matter he felt that his grandfather would be very angry should he do so but he did not regard that much he had filled himself full with the theory of his duties and he would act up to it he would see her without telling any one what was his purpose and put it to her whether she would bring down this destruction on so noble a gentleman having thus resolved he returned to the house when it was already dark and making his way into the drawingroom sat himself down before the fire still thinking of his plan the room was dark as such rooms are dark for the last hour or two before dinner in january and he sat himself in an armchair before the fire intending to sit there till it would be necessary that he should go to dress it was an unaccustomed thing with him so to place himself at such a time or to remain in the drawingroom at all till he came down for a few minutes before dinner but he did so now having been thrown out of his usual habits by the cares upon his mind he had been so seated about a quarter of an hour and was already nearly asleep when he heard the rustle of a womans garment and looking round with such light as the fire gave him perceived that lady mason was in the room she had entered very quietly and was making her way in the dark to a chair which she frequently occupied between the fire and one of the windows and in doing so she passed so near peregrine as to touch him with her dress  lady mason he said speaking in the first place in order that she might know that she was not alone it is almost dark shall i ring for candles for you  she started at hearing his voice begged his pardon for disturbing him declined his offer of light and declared that she was going up again to her own room immediately but it occurred to him that if it would be well that he should speak to her it would be well that he should do so at once and what opportunity could be more fitting than the present if you are not in a hurry about anything he said would you mind staying here for a few minutes  oh no certainly not but he could perceive that her voice trembled in uttering even these few words  i think id better light a candle he said and then he did light one of those which stood on the corner of the mantelpiecea solitary candle which only seemed to make the gloom of the large room visible she however was standing close to it and would have much preferred that the room should have been left to its darkness  wont you sit down for a few minutes and then she sat down ill just shut the door if you dont mind and then having done so he returned to his own chair and again faced the fire he saw that she was pale and nervous and he did not like to look at her as he spoke he began to reflect also that they might probably be interrupted by his mother and he wished that they could adjourn to some other room that however seemed to be impossible so he summoned up all his courage and began his task  i hope you wont think me uncivil lady mason for speaking to you about this affair  oh no mr orme i am sure that you will not be uncivil to me  of course i cannot help feeling a great concern in it for its very nearly the same you know as if he were my father indeed if you come to that its almost worse and i can assure you it is nothing about money that i mind many fellows in my place would be afraid about that but i dont care twopence what he does in that respect he is so honest and so noblehearted that i am sure he wont do me a wrong  i hope not mr orme and certainly not in respect to me  i only mention it for fear you should misunderstand me but there are other reasons lady mason why this marriage will make memake me very unhappy  are there i shall be so unhappy if i make others unhappy  you will theni can assure you of that it is not only me but your own son i was up with him today and he thinks of it the same as i do  what did he say mr orme  what did he say well i dont exactly remember his words but he made me understand that your marriage with sir peregrine would make him very unhappy he did indeed why do you not see him yourself and talk to him  i thought it best to write to him in the first place  well now you have written and dont you think it would be well that you should go up and see him you will find that he is quite as strong against it as i amquite  peregrine had he known it was using the arguments which were of all the least likely to induce lady mason to pay a visit to orley farm she dreaded the idea of a quarrel with her son and would have made almost any sacrifice to prevent such a misfortune but at the present moment she feared the anger of his words almost more than the anger implied by his absence if this trial could be got over she would return to him and almost throw herself at his feet but till that time might it not be well that they should be apart at any rate these tidings of his discontent could not be efficacious in inducing her to seek him  dear lucius she said not addressing herself to her companion but speaking her thoughts i would not willingly give him cause to be discontented with me  he is then very discontented i can assure you of that  yes he and i think differently about all this  ah but dont you think you had better speak to him before you quite make up your mind he is your son you know and an uncommon clever fellow too hell know how to say all this much better than i do  say what mr orme  why of course you cant expect that anybody will like such a marriage as thisthat is anybody except you and sir peregrine  your mother does not object to it  my mother but you dont know my mother yet she would not object to have her head cut off if anybody wanted it that she cared about i do not know how it has all been managed but i suppose sir peregrine asked her then of course she would not object but look at the common sense of it lady mason what does the world always say when an old man like my grandfather marries a young woman  but i am not so far she got and then she stopped herself  we have all liked you very much im sure i have for one and ill go in for you heart and soul in this shameful law business when lucius asked me i didnt think anything of going to that scoundrel in hamworth and all along ive been delighted that sir peregrine took it up by heavens id be glad to go down to yorkshire myself and walk into that fellow that wants to do you this injury i would indeed and ill stand by you as strong as anybody but lady mason when it comes to ones grandfather marrying ititit think what people in the county will say of him if it was your father and if he had been at the top of the tree all his life how would you like to see him get a fall and be laughed at as though he were in the mud just when he was too old ever to get up again  i am not sure whether lucius mason with all his cleverness could have put the matter much better or have used a style of oratory more efficacious to the end in view peregrine had drawn his picture with a coarse pencil but he had drawn it strongly and with graphic effect and then he paused not with selfconfidence or as giving his companion time to see how great had been his art but in want of words and somewhat confused by the strength of his own thoughts so he got up and poked the fire turning his back to it and then sat down again it is such a deuce of a thing lady mason he said that you must not be angry with me for speaking out  oh mr orme i am not angry and i do not know what to say to you  why dont you speak to lucius  what could he say more than you have said dear mr orme i would not injure himyour grandfather i meanfor all that the world holds  you will injure himin the eyes of all his friends  then i will not do it i will go to him and beg him that it may not be so i will tell him that i cannot anything will be better than bringing him to sorrow or disgrace  by jove but will you really peregrine was startled and almost frightened at the effect of his own eloquence what would the baronet say when he learned that he had been talked out of his wife by his grandson  mr orme continued lady mason i am sure you do not understand how this matter has been brought about if you did however much it might grieve you you would not blame me even in your thoughts from the first to the last my only desire has been to obey your grandfather in everything  but you would not marry him out of obedience  i wouldand did so intend i would certainly if in doing so i did him no injury you say that your mother would give her life for him so would ithat or anything else that i could give without hurting him or others it was not i that sought for this marriage nor did i think of it if you were in my place mr orme you would know how difficult it is to refuse  peregrine again got up and standing with his back to the fire thought over it all again his soft heart almost relented towards the woman who had borne his rough words with so much patient kindness had sir peregrine been there then and could he have condescended so far he might have won his grandsons consent without much trouble peregrine like some other generals had expended his energy in gaining his victory and was more ready now to come to easy terms than he would have been had he suffered in the combat  illustration peregrines eloquence  well he said after a while im sure im very much obliged to you for the manner in which you have taken what i said to you nobody knows about it yet i suppose and perhaps if you will talk to the governor  i will talk to him mr orme  thank you and then perhaps all things may turn out right ill go and dress now and so saying he took his departure leaving her to consider how best she might act at this crisis of her life so that things might go right if such were possible the more she thought of it the less possible it seemed that her affairs should be made to go right     chapter xxxviii  oh indeed   the dinner on that day at the cleeve was not very dull peregrine had some hopes that the idea of the marriage might be abandoned and was at any rate much better disposed towards lady mason than he had been he spoke to her asking her whether she had been out and suggesting roast mutton or some such creature comfort this was lost neither on sir peregrine nor on mrs orme and they both exerted themselves to say a few words in a more cheery tone than had been customary in the house for the last day or two lady mason herself did not say much but she had sufficient tact to see the effort which was being made and though she spoke but little she smiled and accepted graciously the courtesies that were tendered to her  then the two ladies went away and peregrine was again left with his grandfather that was a nasty accident that graham had going out of monkton grange said he speaking on the moment of his closing the diningroom door after his mother i suppose you heard all about it sir having fought his battle so well before dinner he was determined to give some little rest to his halfvanquished enemy  the first tidings we heard were that he was dead said sir peregrine filling his glass  no he wasnt dead but of course you know that now he broke an arm and two ribs and got rather a bad squeeze he was just behind me you know and i had to wait for him i lost the run and had to see harriet tristram go away with the best lead any one has had to a fast thing this year thats an uncommon nasty place at the back of monkton grange  i hope peregrine you dont think too much about harriet tristram  think of her who i think of her in what sort of a way i think she goes uncommonly well to hounds  that may be but i should not wish to see you pin your happiness on any lady that was celebrated chiefly for going well to hounds  do you mean marry her and peregrine immediately made a strong comparison in his mind between miss tristram and madeline staveley  yes thats what i did mean  i wouldnt have her if she owned every foxcover in the county no by jove i know a trick worth two of that its jolly enough to see them going but as to being in love with themin that sort of way  you are quite right my boy quite right it is not that that a man wants in a wife  no said peregrine with a melancholy cadence in his voice thinking of what it was that he did want and so they sat sipping their wine the turn which the conversation had taken had for the moment nearly put lady mason out of the young mans head  you would be very young to marry yet said the baronet  yes i should be young but i dont know that there is any harm in that  quite the contrary if a young man feels himself to be sufficiently settled your mother i know would be very glad that you should marry earlyand so should i if you married well  what on earth could all this mean it could not be that his grandfather knew that he was in love with miss staveley and had this been known his grandfather would not have talked of harriet tristram oh yes of course a fellow should marry well i dont think much of marrying for money  nor do i peregrinei think very little of it  nor about being of very high birth  well it would make me unhappyvery unhappy if you were to marry below your own rank  what do you call my own rank  i mean any girl whose father is not a gentleman and whose mother is not a lady and of whose education among ladies you could not feel certain  i could be quite certain about her said peregrine very innocently  her what her  oh i forgot that we were talking about nobody  you dont mean harriet tristram  no certainly not  of whom were you thinking peregrine may i askif it be not too close a secret and then again there was a pause during which peregrine emptied his glass and filled it again he had no objection to talk to his grandfather about miss staveley but he felt ashamed of having allowed the matter to escape him in this sort of way i will tell you why i ask my boy continued the baronet i am going to do that which many people will call a very foolish thing  you mean about lady mason  yes i mean my own marriage with lady mason we will not talk about that just at present and i only mention it to explain that before i do so i shall settle the property permanently if you were married i should at once divide it with you i should like to keep the old house myself till i die  oh sir  but sooner than give you cause of offence i would give that up  i would not consent to live in it unless i did so as your guest  until your marriage i think of settling on you a thousand a yearbut it would add to my happiness if i thought it likely that you would marry soon now may i ask of whom were you thinking  peregrine paused for a second or two before he made any reply and then he brought it out boldly i was thinking of madeline staveley  then my boy you were thinking of the prettiest girl and the bestbred lady in the county heres her health and he filled for himself a bumper of claret you couldnt have named a woman whom i should be more proud to see you bring home and your mothers opinion of her is the same as mine i happen to know that and with a look of triumph he drank his glass of wine as though much that was very joyful to him had been already settled  yes said peregrine mournfully she is a very nice girl at least i think so  the man who can win her peregrine may consider himself to be a lucky fellow you were quite right in what you were saying about money no man feels more sure of that than i do but if i am not mistaken miss staveley will have something of her own i rather think that arbuthnot got ten thousand pounds  im sure i dont know sir said peregrine and his voice was by no means as much elated as that of his grandfather  i think he did or if he didnt get it all the remainder is settled on him and the judge is not a man to behave better to one child than to another  i suppose not  and then the conversation flagged a little for the enthusiasm was all one side it was moreover on that side which naturally would have been the least enthusiastic poor peregrine had only told half his secret as yet and that not the most important half to sir peregrine the tidings as far as he had heard them were very pleasant he did not say to himself that he would purchase his grandsons assent to his own marriage by giving his consent to his grandsons marriage but it did seem to him that the two affairs acting upon each other might both be made to run smooth his heir could have made no better choice in selecting the lady of his love sir peregrine had feared much that some miss tristram or the like might have been tendered to him as the future lady orme and he was agreeably surprised to find that a new mistress for the cleeve had been so well chosen he would be all kindness to his grandson and win from him if it might be possible reciprocal courtesy and complaisance your mother will be very pleased when she hears this he said  i meant to tell my mother said peregrine still very dolefully but i do not know that there is anything in it to please her i only said that ii admired miss staveley  my dear boy if youll take my advice youll propose to her at once you have been staying in the same house with her and  but i have  have what  i have proposed to her  well  and she has refused me you know all about it now and theres no such great cause for joy  oh you have proposed to her have you spoken to her father or mother  what was the use when she told me plainly that she did not care for me of course i should have asked her father as to lady staveley she and i got on uncommonly well im almost inclined to think that she would not have objected  it would be a very nice match for them and i dare say she would not have objected and then for some ten minutes they sat looking at the fire peregrine had nothing more to say about it and the baronet was thinking how best he might encourage his grandson  you must try again you know at last he said  well i fear not i do not think it would be any good im not quite sure she does not care for some one else  who is he  oh a fellow thats there the man who broke his arm i dont say she does you know and of course you wont mention it  sir peregrine gave the necessary promises and then endeavoured to give encouragement to the lover he would himself see the judge if it were thought expedient and explain what liberal settlement would be made on the lady in the event of her altering her mind young ladies you know are very prone to alter their minds on such matters said the old man in answer to which peregrine declared his conviction that madeline staveley would not alter her mind but then do not all despondent lovers hold that opinion of their own mistresses  sir peregrine had been a great gainer by what had occurred and so he felt it at any rate all the novelty of the question of his own marriage was over as between him and peregrine and then he had acquired a means of being gracious which must almost disarm his grandson of all power of criticism when he an old man was ready to do so much to forward the views of a young man could it be possible that the young man should oppose his wishes and peregrine was aware that his power of opposition was thus lessened  in the evening nothing remarkable occurred between them each had his or her own plans but these plans could not be furthered by anything to be said in a general assembly lady mason had already told to mrs orme all that had passed in the drawingroom before dinner and sir peregrine had determined that he would consult mrs orme as to that matter regarding miss staveley he did not think much of her refusal young ladies always do refuseat first  on the day but one following this there came another visit from mr furnival and he was for a long time closeted with sir peregrine matthew round had he said been with him and had felt himself obliged in the performance of his duty to submit a case to counsel on behalf of his client joseph mason he had not as yet received the written opinion of sir richard leatherham to whom he had applied but nevertheless as he wished to give every possible notice he had called to say that his firm were of opinion that an action must be brought either for forgery or for perjury  for perjury mr furnival had said  well yes we would wish to be as little harsh as possible but if we convict her of having sworn falsely when she gave evidence as to having copied the codicil herself and having seen it witnessed by the pretended witnesseswhy in that case of course the property would go back  i cant give any opinion as to what might be the result in such a case said mr furnival  mr round had gone on to say that he thought it improbable that the action could be tried before the summer assizes  the sooner the better as far as we are concerned said mr furnival  if you really mean that i will see that there shall be no unnecessary delay mr furnival had declared that he did really mean it and so the interview had ended  mr furnival had really meant it fully concurring in the opinion which mr chaffanbrass had expressed on this matter but nevertheless the increasing urgency of the case had almost made him tremble he still carried himself with a brave outside before mat round protesting as to the utter absurdity as well as cruelty of the whole proceeding but his conscience told him that it was not absurd perjury he said to himself and then he rang the bell for crabwitz the upshot of that interview was that mr crabwitz received a commission to arrange a meeting between that great barrister the member for the essex marshes and mr solomon aram  wont it look rather ratherrather you know what i mean sir crabwitz had asked  we must fight these people with their own weapons said mr furnivalnot exactly with justice seeing that messrs round and crook were not at all of the same calibre in the profession as mr solomon aram  mr furnival had already at this time seen mr slow of the firm of slow and bideawhile who were sir peregrines solicitors this he had done chiefly that he might be able to tell sir peregrine that he had seen him mr slow had declared that the case was one which his firm would not be prepared to conduct and he named a firm to which he should recommend his client to apply but mr furnival carefully considering the whole matter had resolved to take the advice and benefit by the experience of mr chaffanbrass  and then he went down once more to the cleeve poor mr furnival in these days he was dreadfully buffeted about both as regards his outer man and his inner conscience by this unfortunate case giving up to it time that would otherwise have turned itself into heaps of gold giving up domestic consciencefor mrs furnival was still hot in her anger against poor lady mason and giving up also much peace of mind for he felt that he was soiling his hands by dirty work but he thought of the ladys pale sweet face of her tearladen eye of her soft beseeching tones and gentle touch he thought of these thingsas he should not have thought of themand he persevered  on this occasion he was closeted with sir peregrine for a couple of hours and each heard much from the other that surprised him very much sir peregrine when he was told that mr solomon aram from bucklersbury and mr chaffanbrass from the old bailey were to be retained for the defence of his future wife drew himself up and said that he could hardly approve of it the gentlemen named were no doubt very clever in criminal concerns he could understand as much as that though he had not had great opportunity of looking into affairs of that sort but surely in lady masons case assistance of such a description would hardly be needed would it not be better to consult messrs slow and bideawhile  and then it turned out that messrs slow and bideawhile had been consulted and mr furnival not altogether successfully endeavoured to throw dust into the baronets eyes declaring that in a combat with the devil one must use the devils weapons he assured sir peregrine that he had given the matter his most matured and indeed most painful professional consideration there were unfortunate circumstances which required peculiar care it was a matter which would depend entirely on the evidence of one or two persons who might be suborned and in such a case it would be well to trust to those who knew how to break down and crush a lying witness in such work as that slow and bideawhile would be innocent and ignorant as babes as to breaking down and crushing a witness anxious to speak the truth mr furnival at that time said nothing  i will not think that falsehood and fraud can prevail said sir peregrine proudly  but they do prevail sometimes said mr furnival and then with much outer dignity of demeanour but with some shamefaced tremblings of the inner man hidden under the guise of that outer dignity sir peregrine informed the lawyer of his great purpose  indeed said mr furnival throwing himself back into his chair with a start  yes mr furnival i should not have taken the liberty to trouble you with a matter so private in its nature but for your close professional intimacy and great friendship with lady mason  oh indeed said mr furnival and the baronet could understand from the lawyers tone that even he did not approve     chapter xxxix  why should he go   i am well aware mr staveley that you are one of those gentlemen who amuse themselves by frequently saying such things to girls i had learned your character in that respect before i had been in the house two days  then miss furnival you learned what was very false may i ask who has blackened me in this way in your estimation it will be easily seen from this that mr augustus staveley and miss furnival were at the present moment alone together in one of the rooms at noningsby  my informant she replied has been no one special sinner whom you can take by the throat and punish indeed if you must shoot anybody it should be chiefly yourself and after that your father and mother and sisters but you need not talk of being black such sins are venial nowadays and convey nothing deeper than a light shade of brown  i regard a man who can act in such a way as very base  such a way as what mr staveley  a man who can win a girls heart for his own amusement  i said nothing about the winning of hearts that is treachery of the worst dye but i acquit you of any such attempt when there is a question of the winning of hearts men look so different  i dont know how they look said augustus not altogether satisfied as to the manner in which he was being treatedbut such has been my audacitymy too great audacity on the present occasion  you are the most audacious of men for your audacity would carry you to the feet of another lady tomorrow without the slightest check  and that is the only answer i am to receive from you  it is quite answer enough what would you have me do get up and decline the honour of being mrs augustus staveley with a curtsy  noi would have you do nothing of the kind i would have you get up and accept the honourwith a kiss  so that you might have the kiss and i might have the i was going to say disappointment only that would be untrue let me assure you that i am not so demonstrative in my tokens of regard  i wonder whether you mean that you are not so honest  no mr staveley i mean nothing of the kind and you are very impertinent to express such a supposition what have i done or said to make you suppose that i have lost my heart to you  as you have mine it is at any rate human nature in me to hope that i might have yours  psha your heart you have been making a shuttlecock of it till it is doubtful whether you have not banged it to pieces i know two ladies who carry in their caps two feathers out of it it is so easy to see when a man is in love they all go crossgartered like malvoliocrossgartered in their looks and words and doings  and there is no touch of all this in me  you crossgartered you have never got so far yet as a lackadaisical twist to the corner of your mouth did you watch mr orme before he went away  why was he crossgartered  but you men have no eyes you never see anything and your idea of lovemaking is to sit under a tree wishing wondering whether the ripe fruit will fall down into your mouth ripe fruit does sometimes fall and then it is all well with you but if it wont you pass on and say that it is sour as for climbing  the fruit generally falls too fast to admit of such exercise said staveley who did not choose that all the sharp things should be said on the other side  and that is the result of your very extended experience the orchards which have been opened to you have not i fear been of the first quality mr staveley my hand will do very well by itself such is not the sort of climbing that is required that is what i call stooping to pick up the fruit that has fallen and as she spoke she moved a little away from him on the sofa  and how is a man to climb  do you really mean that you want a lesson but if i were to tell you my words would be thrown away men will not labour who have gotten all that they require without work why strive to deserve any woman when women are plenty who do not care to be deserved that plan of picking up the fallen apples is so much the easier  the lesson might perhaps have been given and miss furnival might have imparted to mr staveley her idea of excelsior in the matter of lovemaking had not mr staveleys mother come into the room at that moment mrs staveley was beginning to fear that the results of her christmas hospitality would not be satisfactory peregrine orme whom she would have been so happy to welcome to the warmest corner of her household temple as a son had been sent away in wretchedness and disappointment madeline was moping about the house hardly making an effort to look like herself attributing in her mothers ears all her complaint to that unexpected interview with peregrine orme but not so attributing itas her mother fanciedwith correctness and there was felix graham still in the room up stairs the doctor having said that he might be moved in a day or twothat is such movement might possibly be effected without detrimentbut having said also that another ten days of uninterrupted rest would be very desirable and now in addition to this her son augustus was to be found on every wet morning closeted somewhere with sophia furnivalon every wet morning and sometimes on dry mornings also  illustration lady stavely interrupting her son and sophia furnival  and then on this very day lady staveley had discovered that felix grahams door in the corridor was habitually left open she knew her child too well and was too clear and pure in her own mind to suppose that there was anything wrong in thisthat clandestine talkings were arranged or anything planned in secret what she feared was that which really occurred the door was left open and as madeline passed felix would say a word and then madeline would pause and answer him such words as they were might have been spoken before all the household and if so spoken would have been free from danger but they were not free from danger when spoken in that way in the passage of a halfclosed doorwayall which lady staveley understood perfectly  baker she had said with more of anger in her voice than was usual with her why do you leave that door open  i think it sweetens the room my lady and indeed felix graham sometimes thought so too  nonsense every sound in the house must be heard keep it shut if you please  yes my lady said mrs bakerwho also understood perfectly  he is better my darling said mrs baker to madeline the same day and indeed for that he is well enough as regards eating and drinking but it would be cruelty to move him yet i heard what the doctor said  who talks of moving him  well he talks of it himself and the doctor said it might be possible but i know what that means  what does it mean  why just this that if we want to get rid of him it wont quite be the death of him  but who wants to get rid of him  im sure i dont i dont mind my trouble the least in life hes as nice a young gentleman as ever i sat beside the bed of and hes full of spirithe is  and then madeline appealed to her mother surely her mother would not let mr graham be sent out of the house in his present state merely because the doctor said it might be possible to move him without causing his instant death and tears stood in poor madelines eyes as she thus pleaded the cause of the sick and wounded this again tormented lady staveley who found it necessary to give further caution to mrs baker baker she said how can you be so foolish as to be talking to miss madeline about mr grahams arm  who my lady i my lady  yes you when you know that the least thing frightens her dont you remember how ill it made her when rogerroger was an old family groomwhen roger had that accident lady staveley might have saved herself the trouble of the reminiscence as to roger for baker knew more about it than that when rogers scalp had been laid bare by a fall miss madeline had chanced to see it and had fainted but miss madeline was not fainting now baker knew all about it almost better than lady staveley herself it was of very little use talking to baker about roger the groom baker thought that mr felix graham was a very nice young man in spite of his not being exactly handsomelike about the physgognomy as she remarked to one of the younger maids who much preferred peregrine orme  coming away from this last interval with mrs baker lady staveley interrupted her son and sophia furnival in the back drawingroom and began to feel that her solicitude for her children would be almost too much for her why had she asked that nasty girl to her house and why would not the nasty girl go away as for her going away there was no present hope for it had been arranged that she should stay for another fortnight why could not the fates have been kind and have allowed felix graham and miss furnival to fall in love with each other i can never make a daughter of her if he does marry her lady staveley said to herself as she looked at them  augustus looked as though he were detected and stammered out some question about his mother and the carriage but miss furnival did not for a moment lose her easy presence of mind lady staveley said she why does not your son go and hunt or shoot or fish instead of staying in the house all day it seems to me that his time is so heavy on his hands that he will almost have to hang himself  im sure i cant tell said lady staveley who was not so perfect an actor as her guest  i do think gentlemen in the house in the morning always look so unfortunate you have been endeavouring to make yourself agreeable but you know youve been yawning  do you suppose then that men never sit still in the morning said augustus  oh in their chambers yes or on the bench and perhaps also behind counters but they very seldom do so in a drawingroom you have been fidgeting about with the poker till you have destroyed the look of the fireplace  well ill go and fidget up stairs with graham said he and so he left the room  nasty sly girl said lady staveley to herself as she took up her work and sat herself down in her own chair  augustus did go up to his friend and found him reading letters there was no one else in the room and the door when augustus reached it was properly closed i think i shall be off tomorrow old boy said felix  then i think youll do no such thing said augustus whats in the wind now  the doctor said this morning that i could be moved without danger  he said that it might possibly be done in two or three daysthat was all what on earth makes you so impatient youve nothing to do nobody else wants to see you and nobody here wants to get rid of you  youre wrong in all your three statements  the deuce i am who wants to get rid of you  that shall come last i have something to do and somebody else does want to see me ive got a letter from mary here and another from mrs thomas and he held up to view two letters which he had received and which had in truth startled him  marys duennathe artist who is supposed to be moulding the wife  yes marys duenna or marys artist whichever you please  and which of them wants to see you its just like a woman to require a mans attendance exactly when he is unable to move  then felix though he did not give up the letters to be read described to a certain extent their contents i dont know what on earth has happened he said mary is praying to be forgiven and saying that it is not her fault and mrs thomas is full of apologies declaring that her conscience forces her to tell everything and yet between them both i do not know what has happened  miss snow has probably lost the key of the workbox you gave her  i have not given her a workbox  then the writingdesk thats what a man has to endure when he will make himself head schoolmaster to a young lady and so youre going to look after your charge with your limbs still in bandages  just so and then he took up the two letters and read them again while staveley still sat on the foot of the bed i wish i knew what to think about it said felix  about what said the other and then there was another pause and another reading of a portion of the letters  there seems somethingsomething almost frightful to me said felix gravely in the idea of marrying a girl in a few months time who now at so late a period of our engagement writes to me in that sort of cold formal way  its the proper mouldedwife style you may depend said augustus  ill tell you what staveley if you can talk to me seriously for five minutes i shall be obliged to you if that is impossible to you say so and i will drop the matter  well go on i am serious enough in what i intend to express even though i may not be so in my words  im beginning to have my doubts about this dear girl  ive had my doubts for some time  not mark you with regard to myself the question is not now whether i can love her sufficiently for my own happiness on that side i have no longer the right to a doubt  but you wouldnt marry her if you did not love her  we need not discuss that but what if she does not love me what if she would think it a release to be freed from this engagement how am i to find that out  augustus sat for a while silent for he did feel that the matter was serious the case as he looked at it stood thushis friend graham had made a very foolish bargain from which he would probably be glad to escape though he could not now bring himself to say as much but this bargain bad for him would probably be very good for the young lady the young lady having no shilling of her own and no merits of birth or early breeding to assist her outlook in the world might probably regard her readymade engagement to a clever kindhearted highspirited man as an advantage not readily to be abandoned staveley as a sincere friend was very anxious that the match should be broken off but he could not bring himself to tell graham that he thought that the young lady would so wish according to his idea the young lady must undergo a certain amount of disappointment and receive a certain amount of compensation graham had been very foolish and must pay for his folly but in preparing to do so it would be better that he should see and acknowledge the whole truth of the matter  are you sure that you have found out your own feelings staveley said at last and his tone was then serious enough even for his friend  it hardly matters whether i have or have not said felix  it matters above all thingsabove all things because as to them you may come to something like certainty of the inside of her heart you cannot know so much the fact i take it is thisthat you would wish to escape from this bondage  no not unless i thought she regarded it as bondage also it may be that she does as for myself i believe that at the present moment such a marriage would be for me the safest step that i could take  safe as against what danger  all dangers how if i should learn to love another womansome one utterly out of my reachwhile i am still betrothed to her  i rarely flatter you graham and dont mean to do it now but no girl ought to be out of your reach you have talent position birth and gifts of nature which should make you equal to any lady as for money the less you have the more you should look to get but if you would cease to be mad two years would give you command of an income  but i shall never cease to be mad  who is it that cannot be serious now  well i will be seriousserious enough i can afford to be so as i have received my medical passport for tomorrow no girl you say ought to be out of my reach if the girl were one miss staveley should she be regarded as out of my reach  a man doesnt talk about his own sister said staveley having got up from the bed and walked to the window and i know you dont mean anything  but by heavens i do mean a great deal  what is it you mean then  i mean thiswhat would you say if you learned that i was a suitor for her hand  staveley had been right in saying that a man does not talk about his own sister when he had declared with so much affectionate admiration for his friends prowess that he might aspire to the hand of any lady that one retiring modestbrowed girl had not been thought of by him a man in talking to another man about women is always supposed to consider those belonging to himself as exempt from the incidents of the conversation the dearest friends do not talk to each other about their sisters when they have once left school and a man in such a position as that now taken by graham has to make fight for his ground as closely as though there had been no former intimacies my friend smith in such a matter as that though i have been hail fellow with him for the last ten years has very little advantage over jones who was introduced to the house for the first time last week and therefore staveley felt himself almost injured when felix graham spoke to him about madeline  what would i say wellthat is a question one does not understand unlessunless you really meant to state it as a fact that it was your intention to propose to her  but i mean rather to state it as a fact that it is not my intention to propose to her  then we had better not speak of her  listen to me a moment in order that i may not do so it will be better for mebetter for us all that i should leave the house  do you mean to say  yes i do mean to say i mean to say all that your mind is now suggesting to you i quite understand your feelings when you declare that a man does not like to talk of his own sister and therefore we will talk of your sister no more old fellow dont look at me as though you meant to drop me  augustus came back to the bedside and again seating himself put his hand almost caressingly over his friends shoulder i did not think of this he said  no one never does think of it graham replied  and she  she knows no more of it than that bedpost said graham the injury such as there is is all on one side but ill tell you who suspects it  baker  your mother i am much mistaken if you will not find that she with all her hospitality would prefer that i should recover my strength elsewhere  but you have done nothing to betray yourself  a mothers ears are very sharp i know that it is so i cannot explain to you how do you tell her that i think of getting up to london tomorrow and see how she will take it and staveley do not for a moment suppose that i am reproaching her she is quite right i believe that i have in no way committed myselfthat i have said no word to your sister with which lady staveley has a right to feel herself aggrieved but if she has had the wit to read the thoughts of my bosom she is quite right to wish that i were out of the house  poor lady staveley had been possessed of no such wit at all the sphynx which she had read had been one much more in her own line she had simply read the thoughts in her daughters bosomor rather the feelings in her daughters heart  augustus staveley hardly knew what he ought to say he was not prepared to tell his friend that he was the very brotherinlaw for whose connection he would be desirous such a marriage for madeline even should madeline desire it would not be advantageous when augustus told graham that he had gifts of nature which made him equal to any lady he did not include his own sister and yet the idea of acquiescing in his friends sudden departure was very painful to him there can be no reason why you should not stay up here you know at last he saidand in so saying he pronounced an absolute verdict against poor felix  on few matters of moment to a mans own heart can he speak out plainly the whole truth that is in him graham had intended so to do but had deceived himself he had not absolutely hoped that his friend would say come among us and be one of us take her and be my brother but yet there came upon his heart a black load of disappointment in that the words which were said were the exact opposite of these graham had spoken of himself as unfit to match with madeline staveley and madeline staveleys brother had taken him at his word the question which augustus asked himself was thiswas it or was it not practicable that graham should remain there without danger of intercourse with his sister to felix the question came in a very different shape after having spoken as he had spokenmight he be allowed to remain there enjoying such intercourse or might he not that was the question to which he had unconsciously demanded an answerand unconsciously he had still hoped that the question might be answered in his favour he had so hoped although he was burdened with mary snow and although he had spoken of his engagement with that lady in so rigid a spirit of selfmartyrdom but the question had been answered against him the offer of a further asylum in the seclusion of that bedroom had been made to him by his friend with a sort of proviso that it would not be well that he should go further than the bedroom and his inner feelings at once grated against each other making him wretched and almost angry  thank you no i understand how kind you are but i will not do that i will write up tonight and shall certainly start tomorrow  my dear fellow  i should get into a fever if i were to remain in this house after what i have told you i could not endure to see you or your mother or baker or marian or any one else dont talk about it indeed you ought to feel that it is not possible i have made a confounded ass of myself and the sooner i get away the better i sayperhaps you would not be angry if i was to ask you to let me sleep for an hour or so now after that ill get up and write my letters  he was very sore he knew that he was sick at heart and ill at ease and cross with his friend and knew also that he was unreasonable in being so staveleys words and manner had been full of kindness graham was aware of this and was therefore the more irritated with himself but this did not prevent his being angry and cross with his friend  graham said the other i see clearly enough that i have annoyed you  not in the least a man falls into the mud and then calls to another man to come and see him the man in the mud of course is not comfortable  but you have called to me and i have not been able to help you  i did not suppose you would so there has been no disappointment indeed there was no possibility for help i shall follow out the line of life which i have long since chalked out for myself and i do not expect that i shall be more wretched than other poor devils around me as far as my idea goes it all makes very little difference now leave me theres a good fellow  dear old fellow i would give my right hand if it would make you happy  but it wont your right hand will make somebody else happy i hope  ill come up to you again before dinner  very well and staveley what we have now said cannot be forgotten between us but when we next meet and ever after let it be as though it were forgotten then he settled himself down on the bed and augustus left the room  it will not be supposed that graham did go to sleep or that he had any thought of doing so when he was alone those words of his friend rang over and over again in his ears no girl ought to be out of your reach why should madeline staveley be out of his reach simply because she was his friends sister he had been made welcome to that house and therefore he was bound to do nothing unhandsome by the family but then he was bound by other laws equally clear to do nothing unhandsome by any other familyor by any other lady if there was anything in staveleys words they applied as strongly to staveleys sister as to any other girl and why should not he a lawyer marry a lawyers daughter sophia furnival with her hatful of money would not be considered too high for him and in what respect was madeline staveley above sophia furnival that the one was immeasurably above the other in all those respects which in his estimation tended towards female perfection he knew to be true enough but the fruit which he had been forbidden to gather hung no higher on the social tree than that other fruit which he had been specially invited to pluck and garner  and then graham was not a man to think any fruit too high for him he had no overweening idea of his own deserts either socially or professionally nor had he taught himself to expect great things from his own genius but he had that audacity of spirit which bids a man hope to compass that which he wishes to compassthat audacity which is both the father and mother of successthat audacity which seldom exists without the inner capability on which it ought to rest  but then there was mary snow augustus staveley thought but little of mary snow according to his theory of his friends future life mary snow might be laid aside without much difficulty if this were so why should not madeline be within his reach but then was it so had he not betrothed himself to mary snow in the presence of the girls father with every solemnity and assurance in a manner fixed beyond that of all other betrothals alas yes and for this reason it was right that he should hurry away from noningsby  then he thought of marys letter and of mrs thomass letter what was it that had been done mary had written as though she had been charged with some childish offence but mrs thomas talked solemnly of acquitting her own conscience what could have happened that had touched mrs thomas in the conscience  but his thoughts soon ran away from the little house at peckham and settled themselves again at noningsby should he hear more of madelines footstepsand if not why should they have been banished from the corridor should he hear her voice again at the doorand if not why should it have been hushed there is a silence which may be more eloquent than the sounds which it follows had no one in that house guessed the feelings in his bosom she would have walked along the corridor as usual and spoken a word with her sweet voice in answer to his word he felt sure that this would be so no more but who had stopped it and why should such sounds be no more heard  at last he did go to sleep not in pursuance of any plan formed for doing so for had he been asked he would have said that sleep was impossible for him but he did go to sleep and when he awoke it was dark he had intended to have got up and dressed on that afternoon or to have gone through such ceremony of dressing as was possible for himin preparation of his next days exercise and now he rose up in his bed with a start angry with himself in having allowed the time to pass by him  lord love you mr graham why how you have slept said mrs baker if i havent just sent your dinner down again to keep hot such a beautiful pheasant and the bread saucell be lumpy now for all the world like pap  never mind the bread sauce mrs bakerthe pheasants the thing  and her ladyships been here mr graham only she wouldnt have you woke she wont hear of your being moved tomorrow nor yet wont the judge there was a rumpus down stairs when mr augustus as much as mentioned it i know one who  you know one whoyou were saying  never mindit aint one more than another but its all you aint to leave this tomorrow so you may just give it over and indeed your things is all at the wash so you cantand now ill go down for the pheasant  felix still declared very positively that he should go but his doing so did not shake mrs baker the letterbag he knew did not leave till eight and as yet it was not much past five he would see staveley again after his dinner and then he would write  when augustus left the room in the middle of the day he encountered madeline wandering about the house in these days she did wander about the house as though there were something always to be done in some place apart from that in which she then was and yet the things which she did were but few she neither worked nor read and as for household duties her share in them was confined almost entirely to the morning and evening teapot  it isnt true that hes to go tomorrow morning augustus is it said she  who graham well he says that he will he is very anxious to get to london and no doubt he finds it stupid enough lying there and doing nothing  but he can do as much there as he can lying by himself in his own chambers where i dont suppose he would have anybody to look after him he thinks hes a trouble and all that and therefore he wants to go but you know mamma doesnt mind about trouble of that kind and what should we think of it afterwards if anything bad was to happen to your friend because we allowed him to leave the house before he was in a fit state to be moved of course mr pottinger says so mr pottinger was the doctor of course mr pottinger says so because he thinks he has been so long here and he doesnt understand  but mr pottinger would like to keep a patient  oh no hes not at all that sort of man hed think of mammathe trouble i mean of having a stranger in the house but you know mamma would think nothing of that especially for such an intimate friend of yours  augustus turned slightly round so as to look more fully into his sisters face and he saw that a tear was gathered in the corner of her eye she perceived his glance and partly shrank under it but she soon recovered herself and answered it i know what you mean she said and if you choose to think so i cant help it but it is horriblehorrible and then she stopped herself finding that a little sob would become audible if she trusted herself to further words  you know what i mean mad he said putting his arm affectionately round her waist and what is it that i mean come you and i never have any secretsyou always say so when you want to get at mine tell me what it is that i mean  i havent got any secret  but what did i mean  you looked at me because i dont want you to let them send mr graham away if it was old mr furnival i shouldnt like them to turn him out of this house when he was in such a state as that  poor mr furnival no i think he would bear it worse than felix  then why should he go and whyshould you look at me in that way  did i look at you mad well i believe i did we are to have no secrets are we  no said she but she did not say it in the same eager voice with which hitherto she had declared that they would always tell each other everything  felix graham is my friend said he my special friend and i hope you will always like my friends but  well she said  you know what i mean mad  yes she said  that is all dearest and then she knew that he also had cautioned her not to fall in love with felix graham and she felt angry with him for the caution whywhywhy but she hardly knew as yet how to frame the question which she desired to ask herself     chapter xl  i call it awful   oh indeed those had been the words with which mr furnival had received the announcement made by sir peregrine as to his proposed nuptials and as he uttered them the lawyer drew himself up stiffly in his chair looking much more like a lawyer and much less like an old family friend than he had done the moment before  whereupon sir peregrine drew himself up also yes he said i should be intrusive if i were to trouble you with my motives and therefore i need only say further as regards the lady that i trust that my support standing as i shall do in the position of her husband will be more serviceable to her than it could otherwise have been in this trial which she will i presume be forced to undergo  no doubt no doubt said mr furnival and then the interview had ended the lawyer had been anxious to see his client and had intended to ask permission to do so but he had felt on hearing sir peregrines tidings that it would be useless now to make any attempt to see her alone and that he could speak to her with no freedom in sir peregrines presence so he left the cleeve having merely intimated to the baronet the fact of his having engaged the services of mr chaffanbrass and mr solomon aram you will not see lady mason sir peregrine had asked thank you i do not know that i need trouble her mr furnival had answered you of course will explain to her how the case at present stands i fear she must reconcile herself to the fact of a trial you are aware sir peregrine that the offence imputed is one for which bail will be taken i should propose yourself and her son of course i should be happy to lend my own name but as i shall be on the trial perhaps it may be as well that this should be avoided  bail will be taken these words were dreadful in the ears of the expectant bridegroom had it come to this that there was a question whether or no she should be locked up in a prison like a felon but nevertheless his heart did not misgive him seeing how terribly she was injured by others he felt himself bound by the stronger law to cling to her himself such was the special chivalry of the man  mr furnival on his return to london thought almost more of sir peregrine than he did either of lady mason or of himself was it not a pity was it not a thousand pities that that aged noble gentleman should be sacrificed he had felt angry with sir peregrine when the tidings were first communicated to him but now as he journeyed up to london this feeling of anger was transferred to his own client this must be her doing and such doing on her part while she was in her present circumstances was very wicked and then he remembered her guilther probable guilt and his brow became very black her supposed guilt had not been horrible to him while he had regarded it as affecting herself alone and in point of property affecting joseph mason and her son lucius he could look forward sometimes almost triumphantly to the idea of washing herso far as this worlds washing goesfrom that guilt and setting her up again clear before the world even though in doing so he should lend a hand in robbing joseph mason of his estate but this dragging down of anotherand such anotherhead into the vortex of ruin and misery was horrible to him he was not straitlaced or mealymouthed or overburthened with scruples in the way of his profession he could do many a thing at whichi express a single opinion with much anxious deferenceat which an honest man might be scandalized if it came beneath his judgment unprofessionally but this he could not stand something must be done in the matter the marriage must be stayed till after the trialor else he must himself retire from the defence and explain both to lady mason and to sir peregrine why he did so  and then he thought of the woman herself and his spirit within him became very bitter had any one told him that he was jealous of the preference shown by his client to sir peregrine he would have fumed with anger and thought that he was fuming justly but such was in truth the case though he believed her to have been guilty of this thing though he believed her to be now guilty of the worse offence of dragging the baronet to his ruin still he was jealous of her regard had she been content to lean upon him to trust to him as her great and only necessary friend he could have forgiven all else and placed at her service the full force of his professional powereven though by doing so he might have lowered himself in mens minds and what reward did he expect none he had formed no idea that the woman would become his mistress all that was as obscure before his minds eye as though she had been nineteen and he fiveandtwenty  he was to dine at home on this day that being the first occasion of his doing so foras mrs furnival declaredthe last six months in truth however the interval had been long though not so long as that he had a hope that having announced his intention he might find the coast clear and hear martha biggs spoken of as a dear one lately gone but when he arrived at home martha biggs was still there under circumstances as they now existed mrs furnival had determined to keep martha biggs by her unless any special edict for her banishment should come forth then in case of such special edict martha biggs should go and thence should arise the new casus belli mrs furnival had made up her mind that war was expedientnay absolutely necessary she had an idea formed no doubt from the reading of history that some allies require a smart brush now and again to blow away the clouds of distrust which become engendered by time between them and that they may become better allies than ever afterwards if the appropriate time for such a brush might ever come it had come now all the worldso she said to herselfwas talking of mr furnival and lady mason all the world knew of her injuries  martha biggs was second cousin to mr crooks brothers wifei speak of that mr crook who had been professionally known for the last thirty years as the partner of mr round it had been whispered in the office in bedford rowsuch whisper i fear originating with old roundthat mr furnival admired his fair client hence light had fallen upon the eyes of martha biggs and the secret of her friend was known to her need i trace the course of the tale with closer accuracy  oh kitty she had said to her friend with tears that eveningi cannot bear to keep it to myself any more i cannot when i see you suffering so its awful  cannot bear to keep what martha  oh i know indeed all the town knows it now  knows what you know how i hate that kind of thing if you have anything to say speak out  this was not kind to such a faithful friend as martha biggs but martha knew what sacrifices friendship such as hers demanded and she did not resent it  well thenif i am to speak out itslady mason and i do say that its shameful quite shamefuland awful i call it awful  mrs furnival had not said much at the time to encourage the fidelity of her friend but she was thus justified in declaring to herself that her husbands goings on had become the talk of all the worldand his goings on especially in that quarter in which she had long regarded them with so much dismay she was not therefore prepared to welcome him on this occasion of his coming home to dinner by such tokens of friendly feeling as the dismissal of her friend to red lion square when the moment for absolute war should come martha biggs should be made to depart  mr furnival when he arrived at his own house was in a thoughtful mood and disposed for quiet and domestic meditation had miss biggs not been there he could have found it in his heart to tell everything about lady mason to his wife asking her counsel as to what he should do with reference to that marriage could he have done so all would have been well but this was not possible while that redfaced lump of a woman from red lion square sat in his drawingroom making everything uncomfortable  the three sat down to dinner together and very little was said between them mr furnival did try to be civil to his wife but wives sometimes have a mode of declining such civilities without committing themselves to overt acts of war to miss biggs mr furnival could not bring himself to say anything civil seeing that he hated her but such words as he did speak to her she received with grim griffinlike austerity as though she were ever meditating on the awfulness of his conduct and so in truth she was why his conduct was more awful in her estimation since she had heard lady masons name mentioned than when her mind had been simply filled with general ideas of vague conjugal infidelity i cannot say but such was the case i call it awful were the first words she again spoke when she found herself once more alone with mrs furnival in the drawingroom and then she sat down over the fire thinking neither of her novel nor her knitting with her mind deliciously filled with the anticipation of coming catastrophes  if i sit up after halfpast ten would you mind going to bed said mrs furnival when they had been in the drawingroom about ten minutes  oh no not in the least said miss biggs ill be sure to go but she thought it very unkind and she felt as a child does who is deceived in a matter of being taken to the play if no one goes the child can bear it but to see others go and to be left behind is too much for the feelings of any childor of martha biggs  mr furnival had no inclination for sitting alone over his wine on this occasion had it been possible for him he would have preferred to have gone quickly up stairs and to have taken his cup of coffee from his wifes hand with some appreciation of domestic comfort but there could be no such comfort to him while martha biggs was there so he sat down stairs sipping his port according to his custom and looking into the fire for a solution of his difficulties about lady mason he began to wish that he had never seen lady mason and to reflect that the intimate friendship of pretty women often brings with it much trouble he was resolved on one thing he would not go down into court and fight that battle for lady orme were he to do so the matter would have taken quite a different phaseone that he had not at all anticipated in case that his present client should then have become lady orme mr chaffanbrass and mr solomon aram might carry on the battle between them with such assistance as they might be able to get from messrs slow and bideawhile he became angry as he drank his port and in his anger he swore that it should be so and then as his anger became hot at the close of his libations he remembered that martha biggs was up stairs and became more angry still and thus when he did go into the drawingroom at some time in the evening not much before ten he was not in a frame of mind likely to bring about domestic comfort  he walked across the drawingroom sat down in an armchair by the table and took up the last number of a review without speaking to either of them whereupon mrs furnival began to ply her needle which had been lying idly enough upon her work and martha biggs fixed her eyes intently upon her book so they sat twenty minutes without a word being spoken and then mrs furnival inquired of her lord whether he chose to have tea  of course i shallwhen you have it said he  dont mind us said mrs furnival  pray dont mind me said martha biggs dont let me be in the way  no i wont said mr furnival whereupon miss biggs again jumped up in her chair as though she had been electrified it may be remembered that on a former occasion mr furnival had sworn at heror at least in her presence  you need not be rude to a lady in your own house because she is my friend said mrs furnival  bother said mr furnival and now if we are going to have any tea let us have it  i dont think ill mind about tea tonight mrs furnival said miss biggs having received a notice from her friends eye that it might be well for her to depart my head aches dreadful and i shall be better in bed goodnight mrs furnival and then she took her candle and went away  for the next five minutes there was not a word said no tea had been ordered although it had been mentioned mrs furnival had forgotten it among the hot thoughts that were running through her mind and mr furnival was indifferent upon the subject he knew that something was coming and he resolved that he would have the upper hand let that something be what it might he was being ill usedso he said to himselfand would not put up with it  at last the battle began he was not looking but he heard her first movement as she prepared herself tom she said and then the voice of the war goddess was again silent he did not choose to answer her at the instant and then the war goddess rose from her seat and again spoke tom she said standing over him and looking at him  what is it you mean said he allowing his eyes to rise to her face over the top of his book  tom she said for the third time  ill have no nonsense kitty said he if you have anything to say say it  even then she had intended to be affectionatehad so intended at the first commencement of her address she had no wish to be a war goddess but he had assisted her attempt at love by no gentle word by no gentle look by no gentle motion i have this to say she replied you are disgracing both yourself and me and i will not remain in this house to be a witness to it  then you may go out of the house these words be it remembered were uttered not by the man himself but by the spirit of port wine within the man  tom do you say thatafter all  by heavens i do say it ill not be told in my own drawingroom even by you that i am disgracing myself  then why do you go after that woman down to hamworth all the world is talking of you at your age too you ought to be ashamed of yourself  i cant stand this said he getting up and throwing the book from him right across the drawingroom floor and by heavens i wont stand it  then why do you do it sir  kitty i believe the devil must have entered into you to drive you mad  oh oh oh very well sir the devil in the shape of drink and lust has entered into you but you may understand this iwillnotconsent to live with you while such deeds as these are being done and then without waiting for another word she stormed out of the room     volume ii  chapter xli  how can i save him   i will not consent to live with you while such deeds as these are being done such were the last words which mrs furnival spoke as she walked out of her own drawingroom leaving her husband still seated in his armchair  what was he to do those who would hang by the letter of the law in such matters may say that he should have rung the bell sent for his wife explained to her that obedience was a necessary duty on her part and have finished by making her understand that she must and would continue to live wherever he chose that she should live there be those who say that if a man be anything of a man he can always insure obedience in his own household he has the power of the purse and the power of the law and if having these he goes to the wall it must be because he is a poor creature those who so say have probably never tried the position  mr furnival did not wish to send for his wife because by doing so he would have laid bare his sore before his servants he could not follow her because he knew that he should not find her alone in her room nor did he wish for any further parley because he knew that she would speak loud and probably sobnay very possibly proceed to a fainting fit and moreover he much doubted whether he would have the power to keep her in the house if it should be her pleasure to leave it and then what should he do the doing of something in such a catastrophe was he thought indispensable  was ever a man so ill treated was ever jealousy so groundless here was a woman with whom he was on the point of quarrelling who was engaged to be married to another man whom for months past he had only seen as a client and on her account he was to be told by his wife that she would not consent to live with him yes it was quite indispensable that he should do something  at last he went to bed and slept upon it not sharing the marital couch but occupying his own dressingroom in the morning however as he sat down to his solitary breakfast he was as far as ever from having made up his mind what that something should be a message was brought to him by an elderly female servant with a grave facethe elderly servant who had lived with them since their poorer dayssaying that missus would not come down to breakfast this morning there was no love sent no excuse as to illness no semblance of a peaceable reason assumed even to deceive the servant it was clear to mr furnival that the servant was intended to know all about it and miss biggs says sir that if you please youre not to wait for her  very well thatll do said mr furnival who had not the slightest intention of waiting for miss biggs and then he sat himself down to eat his bacon and bethink himself what step he would take with this recreant and troublesome spouse  while he was thus employed the post came the bulk of his letters as a matter of course went to his chambers but there were those among his correspondents who wrote to him at harley street today he received three or four letters but our concern will be with one only this one bore the hamworth postmark and he opened it the first knowing that it came from lady mason it was as follows      private     the cleeve 23rd january 18     my dear mr furnival     i am so very sorry that i did not see you today indeed    your leaving without seeing me has made me unhappy for i    cannot but think that it shows that you are displeased    under these circumstances i must write to you and explain    to you how that came to pass which sir peregrine told you    i have not let him know that i am writing to you and i    think for his sake that i had better not but he is so    good and has shown to me such nobleness and affection    that i can hardly bring myself to have any secret from    him     you may conceive what was my surprise when i first    understood that he wished to make me his wife it is    hardly six months since i thought that i was almost    exceeding my station in visiting at his house then by    degrees i began to be received as a friend and at last i    found myself treated with the warmest love but still i    had no thought of this and i knew that it was because of    my great trouble that sir peregrine and mrs orme were so    good to me     when he sent for me into his library and told me what    he wished i could not refuse him anything i promised    obedience to him as though i were a child and in this way    i found myself engaged to be his wife when he told me    that he would have it so how could i refuse him knowing    as i do all that he has done for me and thinking of it    as i do every minute as for loving him of course i love    him who that knows him does not love him he is made to    be loved no one is so good and so noble as he but of    love of that sort i had never dreamed ah me noa woman    burdened as i am does not think of love     he told me that he would have it so and i said that i    would obey him and he tried to prove to me that in this    dreadful trial it would be better for me but i would not    wish it on that account he has done enough for me without    my causing him such injury when i argued it with him    trying to say that others would not like it he declared    that mrs orme would be well pleased and indeed so she    told me afterwards herself and thus i yielded to him    and agreed that i would be his wife but i was not happy    thinking that i should injure him and i promised only    because i could not deny him     but the day before yesterday young mr orme his grandson    came to me and told me that such a marriage would be very    wrong and i do believe him he said that old family    friends would look down upon his grandfather and ridicule    him if he were to make this marriage and i can see that    it would be so i would not have such injury come upon him    for the gain of all the world to myself so i have made    up my mind to tell him that it cannot be even though i    should anger him and i fear that it will anger him for    he loves to have his own wayespecially in doing good    and he thinks that our marriage would rescue me altogether    from the danger of this trial     so i have made up my mind to tell him but i have not    found courage to do it yet and i do wish dear mr    furnival that i might see you first i fear that i may    have lost your friendship by what has already been done    if so what will become of me when i heard that you had    gone without asking for me my heart sank within me i    have two friends whom i so dearly love and i would fain    do as both direct me if that may be possible and now i    propose to go up to london tomorrow and to be at your    chambers about one oclock i have told sir peregrine and    mrs orme that i am going but he is too nobleminded    to ask questions now that he thinks i may feel myself    constrained to tell him so i will call in lincolns inn    at one oclock and i trust that if possible you will see    me i am greatly in want of your advice for in truth i    hardly know what to do     pray believe me to be always your attached friend     mary mason   there was hardly a wordi believe not a word in that letter that was not true her acceptance of sir peregrine had been given exactly in the manner and for the reasons there explained and since she had accepted him she had been sorry for having done so exactly in the way now described she was quite willing to give up her husband if it was thought bestbut she was not willing to give up her friend she was not willing to give up either friend and her great anxiety was so to turn her conduct that she might keep them both  mr furnival was gratified as he read the lettergratified in spite of his present frame of mind of course he would see herand of course as he himself well knew would take her again into favour but he must insist on her carrying out her purpose of abandoning the marriage project if arising from this abandonment there should be any coolness on the part of sir peregrine mr furnival would not regret it mr furnival did not feel quite sure whether in the conduct of this case he was not somewhat hampered by theenergetic zeal of sir peregrines line of defence  when he had finished the perusal of his letter and the consideration which it required he put it carefully into his breast coat pocket envelope and all what might not happen if he left that envelope about in that house and then he took it out again and observed upon the cover the hamworth postmark very clear postmarks nowadays are very clear and everybody may know whence a letter comes his letters had been brought to him by the butler but was it not probable that that ancient female servant might have seen them first and have conveyed to her mistress intelligence as to this postmark if so and mr furnival almost felt himself to be guilty as he thought of it  while he was putting on his greatcoat in the hall the butler assisting him the ancient female servant came to him again there was a look about her face which told of war and declared her to be if not the chief lieutenant of his wife at any rate her colourserjeant martha biggs no doubt was chief lieutenant missus desires me to ask said she with her grim face and austere voice whether you will be pleased to dine at home today and yet the grim austere woman could be affectionate and almost motherly in her ministrations to him when things were going well and had eaten his salt and broken his bread for more than twenty years all this was very hard because continued the woman missus says she thinks she shall be out this evening herself  where is she going  missus didnt tell me sir  he almost determined to go up stairs and call upon her to tell him what she was going to do but he remembered that if he did it would surely make a row in the house miss biggs would put her head out of some adjacent door and scream oh laws and he would have to descend his own stairs with the consciousness that all his household were regarding him as a brute so he gave up that project no he said i shall not dine at home and then he went his way  missus is very aggravating said the butler as soon as the door was closed  you dont know what cause she has spooner said the housekeeper very solemnly  is it at his age i believe its all nonsense i dofeminine fancies and vagaries of the weaker sex  yes i dare say thats what you men always say but if he dont look out hell find missusll be too much for him whatd he do if she were to go away from him  dowhy live twice as jolly it would only be the first rumpus of the thing  i am afraid that there was some truth in what spooner said it is the first rumpus of the thing or rather the fear of that which keeps together many a couple  at one oclock there came a timid female rap at mr furnivals chamber door and the juvenile clerk gave admittance to lady mason crabwitz since the affair of that mission down at hamworth had so far carried a point of his that a junior satellite was now permanently installed and for the future the indignity of opening doors and just stepping out into chancery lane would not await him lady mason was dressed all in blackbut this was usual with her when she left home today however there was about her something blacker and more sombre than usual the veil which she wore was thick and completely hid her face and her voice as she asked for mr furnival was low and plaintive but nevertheless she had by no means laid aside the charm of womanhood or it might be more just to say that the charm of womanhood had not laid aside her there was that in her figure step and gait of going which compelled men to turn round and look at her we all know that she had a son some two or three and twenty years of age and that she had not been quite a girl when she married but notwithstanding this she was yet young and though she made no effortno apparent effortto maintain the power and influence which beauty gives yet she did maintain it  he came forward and took her by the hand with all his old affectionate regard and muttering some words of ordinary salutation led her to a chair it may be that she muttered something also but if so the sound was too low to reach his ears she sat down where he placed her and as she put her hand on the table near her arm he saw that she was trembling  i got your letter this morning he said by way of beginning the conversation  yes she said and then finding that it was not possible that he should hear her through her veil she raised it she was very pale and there was a look of painful care almost of agony round her mouth he had never seen her look so palebut he said to himself at the same time that he had never seen her look so beautiful  and to tell you the truth lady mason i was very glad to get it you and i had better speak openly to each other about thishad we not  oh yes she said and then there was a struggle within her not to tremblea struggle that was only too evident she was aware of this and took her hand off the table  i vexed you because i did not see you at the cleeve the other day  because i thought that you were angry with me  and i was so  oh mr furnival  wait a moment lady mason i was angryor rather sorry and vexed to hear of that which i did not approve but your letter has removed that feeling i can now understand the manner in which this engagement was forced upon you and i understand alsodo i notthat the engagement will not be carried out  she did not answer him immediately and he began to fear that she repented of her purpose because said he under no other circumstances could i  stop mr furnival pray do not be severe with me and she looked at him with eyes which would almost have melted his wifeand which he was quite unable to withstand had it been her wish she might have made him promise to stand by her even though she had persisted in her engagement  no no i will not be severe  i do not wish to marry him she went on to say i have resolved to tell him so that was what i said in my letter  yes yes  i do not wish to marry him i would not bring his gray hairs with sorrow to the graveno not to save myself from and then as she thought of that from which she desired to save herself she trembled again and was silent  it would create in mens minds such a strong impression against you were you to marry him at this moment  it is of him i am thinkingof him and lucius mr furnival they might do their worst with me if it were not for that thought my boy and then she rose from her chair and stood upright before him as though she were going to do or say some terrible thing he still kept his chair for he was startled and hardly knew what he would be about that last exclamation had come from her almost with a shriek and now her bosom was heaving as though her heart would burst with the violence of her sobbing i will go she said i had better go and she hurried away towards the door  no no do not go yet and he rose to stop her but she was quite passive i do not know why you should be so much moved now but he did know he did understand the very essence and core of her feelingsas probably may the reader also but it was impossible that he should allow her to leave him in her present state  she sat down again and leaning both her arms upon the table hid her face within her hands he was now standing and for the moment did not speak to her indeed he could not bring himself to break the silence for he saw her tears and could still hear the violence of her sobs and then she was the first to speak if it were not for him she said raising her head i could bear it all what will he do what will he do  you mean said mr furnival speaking very slowly if theverdictshould go against us  it will go against us she said will it nottell me the truth you are so clever you must know tell me how it will go is there anything i can do to save him and she took hold of his arm with both her hands and looked up eagerlyoh with such terrible eagernessinto his face  would it not have been natural now that he should have asked her to tell him the truth and yet he did not dare to ask her he thought that he knew it he felt surealmost sure that he could look into her very heart and read there the whole of her secret but still there was a doubtenough of doubt to make him wish to ask the question nevertheless he did not ask it  mr furnival she said and as she spoke there was a hardness came over the soft lines of her feminine face a look of courage which amounted almost to ferocity a look which at the moment recalled to his mind as though it were but yesterday the attitude and countenance she had borne as she stood in the witnessbox at that other trial now so many years sincethat attitude and countenance which had impressed the whole court with so high an idea of her courage mr furnival weak as i am i could bear to die here on the spotnowif i could only save him from this agony it is not for myself i suffer and then the terrible idea occurred to him that she might attempt to compass her escape by death but he did not know her that would have been no escape for her son  and you too think that i must not marry him she said putting up her hands to her brows as though to collect her thoughts  no certainly not lady mason  no no it would be wrong but mr furnival i am so driven that i know not how i should act what if i should lose my mind and as she looked at him there was that about her eyes which did tell him that such an ending might be possible  do not speak in such a way he said  no i will not i know that it is wrong i will go down there and tell him that it must notmust not be so but i may stay at the cleevemay i not  oh certainlyif he wishes itafter your understanding with him  ah he may turn me out may he not and they are so kind to me so gentle and so good and lucius is so stern but i will go back sternness will perhaps be better for me now than love and kindness  in spite of everything in the teeth of his almost certain conviction of her guilt he would now even now have asked her to come to his own house and have begged her to remain there till the trial was overif only he had had the power to do so what would it be to him what the world might say if she should be proved guilty why should not he have been mistaken as well as others and he had an idea that if he could get her into his own hands he might still bring her through triumphantlywith assistance from solomon aram and chaffanbrass he was strongly convinced of her guilt but by no means strongly convinced that her guilt could be proved but then he had no house at the present moment that he could call his own his kitty the kitty of whom he still sometimes thought with affectionthat kitty whose soft motherly heart would have melted at such a story of a womans sorrows if only it had been rightly approachedthat kitty was now vehemently hostile hostile both to him and to this very woman for whom he would have asked her care  may god help me said the poor woman i do not know where else to turn for aid well i may go now then and indeed why should i take up your time further  but before she did go mr furnival gave her much counsel he did not ask as to her guilt but he did give her that advice which he would have thought most expedient had her guilt been declared and owned he told her that very much would depend on her maintaining her present position and standing that she was so to carry herself as not to let people think that she was doubtful about the trial and that above all things she was to maintain a composed and steadfast manner before her son as to the ormes he bade her not to think of leaving the cleeve unless she found that her remaining there would be disagreeable to sir peregrine after her explanation with him that she was to decline the marriage engagement he was very positive on that subject there was to be no doubt  and then she went and as she passed down the dark passage into the new square by the old gate of the chancellors court she met a stout lady the stout lady eyed her savagely but was not quite sure as to her identity lady mason in her trouble passed the stout lady without taking any notice of her     chapter xlii  john kenneby goes to hamworth   when john kenneby dined with his sister and brotherinlaw on christmasday he agreed at the joint advice of the whole party there assembled that he would go down and see mr dockwrath at hamworth in accordance with the invitation received from that gentlemanhis enemy dockwrath who had carried off miriam usbech for whom john kenneby still sighedin a gentle easy manner indeedbut still sighed as though it were an affair but of yesterday but though he had so agreed and though he had never stirred from that resolve he by no means did it immediately he was a slow man whose life had offered him but little excitement and the little which came to him was husbanded well and made to go a long way he thought about this journey for nearly a month before he took it often going to his sister and discussing it with her and once or twice seeing the great moulder himself at last he fixed a day and did go down to hamworth  he had moreover been invited to the offices of messrs round and crook and that visit also was as yet unpaid a clerk from the house in bedford row had found him out at hubbles and greases and had discovered that he would be forthcoming as a witness on the special subject of his evidence not much had then passed the clerk having had no discretion given him to sift the matter but kenneby had promised to go to bedford row merely stipulating for a day at some little distance of time that day was now near at hand but he was to see dockwrath first and hence it occurred that he now made his journey to hamworth  but another member of that christmas party at great st helens had not been so slow in carrying out his little project mr kantwise had at once made up his mind that it would be as well that he should see dockwrath it would not suit him to incur the expense of a journey to hamworth even with the additional view of extracting payment for that set of metallic furniture but he wrote to the attorney telling him that he should be in london in the way of trade on such and such a day and that he had tidings of importance to give with reference to the great orley farm case dockwrath did see him and the result was that mr kantwise got his money fourteen elevenat least he got fourteen seven six and had a very hard fight for the three odd halfcrownsand dockwrath learned that john kenneby if duly used would give evidence on his side of the question  and then kenneby did go down to hamworth he had not seen miriam usbech since the days of her marriage he had remained hanging about the neighbourhood long enough to feast his eyes with the agony of looking at the bride and then he had torn himself away circumstances since that had carried him one way and miriam another and they had never met time had changed him very little and what change time had made was perhaps for the better he hesitated less when he spoke he was less straggling and undecided in his appearance and had about him more of manhood than in former days but poor miriam had certainly not been altered for the better by years and circumstances as far as outward appearance went  kenneby as he walked up from the station to the houseand from old remembrances he knew well where the house stoodgave up his mind entirely to the thought of seeing miriam and in his memories of old love passages almost forgot the actual business which now brought him to the place to him it seemed as though he was going to meet the same miriam he had leftthe miriam to whom in former days he had hardly ventured to speak of love and to whom he must not now venture so to speak at all he almost blushed as he remembered that he would have to take her hand  there are men of this sort men slow in their thoughts but very keen in their memories men who will look for the glance of a certain bright eye from a windowpane though years have rolled on since last they saw itsince last they passed that window such men will bethink themselves after an interval of weeks how they might have brought up wit to their use and improved an occasion which chance had given them but when the bright eyes do glance such men pass by abashed and when the occasion offers their wit is never at hand nevertheless they are not the least happy of mankind these neverreadies they do not pick up sudden prizes but they hold fast by such good things as the ordinary run of life bestows upon them there was a lady even now a friend of mrs moulder ready to bestow herself and her fortune on john kennebya larger fortune than miriam had possessed and one which would not now probably be neutralised by so large a family as poor miriam had bestowed upon her husband  how would miriam meet him it was of this he thought as he approached the door of course he must call her mrs dockwrath though the other name was so often on his tongue he had made up his mind for the last week past that he would call at the private door of the house passing by the door of the office otherwise the chances were that he would not see miriam at all his enemy dockwrath would be sure to keep him from her presence dockwrath had ever been inordinately jealous but when he came to the officedoor he hardly had the courage to pass on to that of the private dwelling his heart beat too quickly and the idea of seeing miriam was almost too much for him but nevertheless he did carry out his plan and did knock at the door of the house  and it was opened by miriam herself he knew her instantly in spite of all the change he knew her but the whole course of his feelings were altered at the moment and his blood was made to run the other way and she knew him too la john she said whod have thought of seeing you and she shifted the baby whom she carried from one arm to the other as she gave him her hand in token of welcome  illustration john kenneby and miriam dockwrath  it is a long time since we met he said he felt hardly any temptation now to call her miriam indeed it would have seemed altogether in opposition to the common order of things to do so she was no longer miriam but the maternal dockwraththe mother of that long string of dirty children whom he saw gathered in the passage behind her he had known as a fact that she had all the children but the fact had not made the proper impression on his mind till he had seen them  a long time deed then it is why weve hardly seen each other since you used to be a courting of me have we but my john why havent you got a wife for yourself these many years but come in im glad to see every bit of you so i am though ive hardly a place to put you to sit down in and then she opened a door and took him into a little sittingroom on the lefthand side of the passage  his feeling of intense enmity to dockwrath was beginning to wear away and one of modified friendship for the whole family was supervening it was much better that it should be so he could not understand before how dockwrath had had the heart to write to him and call him john but now he did understand it he felt that he could himself be friendly with dockwrath now and forgive him all the injury he felt also that it would not go so much against the grain with him to marry that friend as to whom his sister would so often solicit him  i think you may venture to sit down upon them said miriam though i cant say that i have ever tried myself this speech referred to the chairs with which her room was supplied and which kenneby seemed to regard with suspicion  they are very nice im sure said he but i dont think i ever saw any like them  nor nobody else either but dont you tell him so and she nodded with her head to the side of the house on which the office stood i had as nice a set of mahoganys as ever a woman could want and bought with my own money too john but hes took them away to furnish some of his lodgings opposite and put them things here in their place dont sam youll have em all twisted about nohows in no time if you go to use em in that way  i wants to see the pictur on the table said sam  drat the picture said mrs dockwrath it was hard wasnt it john to see my own mahoganys as i had rubbed with my own hands till they was ever so bright and as was bought with my own money too took away and them things brought here sam if you twist that round any more ill box your ears one cant hear oneself speak with the noise  they dont seem to be very useful said kenneby  useful theyre got up for cheaterythats what theyre got up for and that dockwrath should be took in with emhe thats so sharp at everythingthats what surprises me but laws john it isnt the sharp ones that gets the best off you was never sharp but youre as smirk and smooth as though you came out of a bandbox i am glad to see you john so i am and she put her apron up to her eyes and wiped away a tear  is mr dockwrath at home said john  sam run round and see if your fathers in the office hell be home to dinner i know molly do be quiet with your sister i never see such a girl as you are for bothering you didnt come down about business did you john and then kenneby explained to her that he had been summoned by dockwrath as to the matter of this orley farm trial while he was doing so sam returned to say that his father had stepped out but would be back in half an hour and mrs dockwrath finding it impossible to make use of her company sittingroom took her old lover into the family apartment which they all ordinarily occupied  you can sit down there at any rate without it all crunching under you up to nothing and she emptied for him as she spoke the seat of an old wellworn horsehair bottomed armchair as to them tin things i wouldnt trust myself on one of them and so i told him angry as it made him but now about poor lady mason sam and molly you go into the garden theres good children they is so ready with their ears john and he contrives to get everything out of em now do tell me about this  kenneby could not help thinking that the love match between miriam and her husband had not turned out in all respects well and i fear that he derived from the thought a certain feeling of consolation he was spoken about in a manner that did not betoken unfailing love and perfect confidence perhaps miriam was at this moment thinking that she might have done better with her youth and her money she was thinking of nothing of the kind her mind was one that dwelt on the present not on the past she was unhappy about her furniture unhappy about the frocks of those four younger children unhappy that the loaves of bread went faster and faster every day very unhappy now at the savageness with which her husband prosecuted his anger against lady mason but it did not occur to her to be unhappy because she had not become mrs kenneby  mrs dockwrath had more to tell in the matter than had kenneby and when the elder of the children who were at home had been disposed of she was not slow to tell it isnt it dreadful john to think that they should come against her now and the will all settled as it was twenty year ago but you wont say anything against her will you now john she was always a good friend to you wasnt she though it wasnt much use was it it was thus that she referred to the business before them and to the love passages of her early youth at the same time  its a very dreadful affair said kenneby very solemnly and the more i think of it the more dreadful it becomes  but you wont say anything against her will you you wont go over to his side eh john  i dont know much about sides said he  hell get himself into trouble with it i know he will i do so wish youd tell him for he cant hurt you if you stand up to him if i speaklord bless you i dont dare to call my soul my own for a week afterwards  is he so very  oh dreadful john hes bid me never speak a word to her but for all that i used till she went away down to the cleeve yonder and what do you think they say now and i do believe it too they say that sir peregrine is going to make her his lady if he does that it stands to reason that dockwrath and joseph mason will get the worst of it im sure i hope they will only hell be twice as hard if he dont make money by it in some way  will he now  indeed he will you never knew anything like him for hardness if things go wrong awhile i know hes got lots of money because hes always buying up bits of houses besides what has he done with mine but yet sometimes youd hardly think hed let me have bread enough for the childrenand as for clothes poor miriam it seemed that her husband shared with her but few of the spoils or triumphs of his profession  tidings now came in from the office that dockwrath was there youll come round and eat a bit of dinner with us said she hesitatingly he felt that she hesitated and hesitated himself in his reply he must say something in the way of asking you you know and then say youll come his manners nothing to you you know do now it does me good to look at you john it does indeed and then without making any promise he left her and went round to the office  kenneby had made up his mind talking over the matter with moulder and his sister that he would be very reserved in any communication which he might make to dockwrath as to his possible evidence at the coming trial but nevertheless when dockwrath had got him into his office the attorney made him give a succinct account of everything he knew taking down his deposition in a regular manner and now if youll just sign that dockwrath said to him when he had done  i dont know about signing said kenneby a man should never write his own name unless he knows why  you must sign your own deposition and the attorney frowned at him and looked savage what would a judge say to you in court if you had made such a statement as this affecting the character of a woman like lady mason and then had refused to sign it youd never be able to hold up your head again  wouldnt i said kenneby gloomily and he did sign it this was a great triumph to dockwrath mat round had succeeded in getting the deposition of bridget bolster but he had got that of john kenneby  and now said dockwrath ill tell you what well dowell go to the blue postsyou remember the blue postsand ill stand a beef steak and a glass of brandy and water i suppose youll go back to london by the 3 pm train we shall have lots of time  kenneby said that he should go back by the 3 pm train but he declined with considerable hesitation the beefsteak and brandy and water after what had passed between him and miriam he could not go to the blue posts with her husband  nonsense man said dockwrath you must dine somewhere  but kenneby said that he should dine in london he always preferred dining late besides it was a long time since he had been at hamworth and he was desirous of taking a walk that he might renew his associations  associations said dockwrath with a sneer according to his ideas a man could have no pleasant associations with a place unless he had made money there or been in some way successful now john kenneby had enjoyed no success at hamworth well then if you prefer associations to the blue posts ill say goodbye to you i dont understand it myself we shall see each other at the trial you know kenneby with a sigh said that he supposed they should  are you going into the house said dockwrath to see her again and he indicated with his head the side on which his wife was as she before had indicated his side  well yes i think ill say goodbye  dont be talking to her about this affair she understands nothing about it and everything goes up to that woman at orley farm and so they parted  and he wanted you to go to the blue posts did he said miriam when she heard of the proposition its like him if there is to be any money spent its anywhere but at home  but i aint going said john  hell go before the days out though he maynt get his dinner there and hell be ever so free when hes there hell stand brandy and water to half hamworth when he thinks he can get anything by it but if youll believe me john though ive all the fag of the house on me and all them children i cant get a pint of beernot regularbetwixt breakfast and bedtime poor miriam why had she not taken advice when she was younger john kenneby would have given her what beer was good for her quite regularly  then he went out and took his walk sauntering away to the gate of orley farm and looking up the avenue he ventured up some way and there at a distance before him he saw lucius mason walking up and down from the house towards the road and back again swinging a heavy stick in his hand with his hat pressed down over his brows kenneby had no desire to speak to him so he returned to the gate and thence went back to the station escaping the town by a side lane and in this way he got back to london without holding further communication with the people of hamworth     chapter xliii  john kennebys courtship   shes as sweet a temper john as ever stirred a lump of sugar in her tea said mrs moulder to her brother as they sat together over the fire in great st helens on that same eveningafter his return from hamworth that she isand so smiley always found her shes always the same smiley said to me many a day and what can a man want more than that  thats quite true said john  and then as to her habitsi never knew her take a drop too much since first i set eyes on her and thats nigh twenty years ago she likes things comfortableand why shouldnt she with two hundred a year of her own coming out of the kingsland road brickfields as for dress her things is beautiful and she is the woman that takes care of em why i remember an irish tabinet as smiley gave her when first that venture in the brickfields came up money if that tabinet is as much as turned yet why ill eat it and then the best of it is shell have you tomorrow indeed she will or tonight if youll ask her goodness gracious if there aint moulder and the excellent wife jumped up from her seat poked the fire emptied the most comfortable armchair and hurried out to the landing at the top of the stairs presently the noise of a loudly wheezing pair of lungs was heard and the commercial traveller enveloped from head to foot in coats and comforters made his appearance he had just returned from a journey and having deposited his parcels and packages at the house of business of hubbles and grease in houndsditch had now returned to the bosom of his family it was a way he had not to let his wife know exactly the period of his return whether he thought that by so doing he might keep her always on the alert and ready for marital inspection or whether he disliked to tie himself down by the obligation of a fixed time for his return mrs moulder had never made herself quite sure but on neither view of the subject did she admire this practice of her lord she had on many occasions pointed out to him how much more snug she could make him if he would only let her know when he was coming but he had never taken the hint and in these latter days she had ceased to give it  why im uncommon cold he said in answer to his wifes inquiries after his welfare and so would you be too if youd come up from leeds since youd had your dinner what john are you there the two of you are making yourself snug enough i suppose with something hot  not a drop hes had yet since hes been in the house said mrs moulder and hes hardly as much as darkened the door since you left it and mrs moulder added with some little hesitation in her voice mrs smiley is coming in tonight moulder  the d she is theres always something of that kind when i gets home tired out and wants to be comfortable i mean to have my supper to myself as i likes it if all the mother smileys in london choose to come the way what on earth is she coming here for this time of night  why moulder you know  no i dont know i only know this that when a mans used up with business he dont want to have any of that nonsense under his nose  if you mean me began john kenneby  i dont mean you of course not and i dont mean anybody here take my coats will you and let me have a pair of slippers if mrs smiley thinks that im going to change my pants or put myself about for her  laws moulder she dont expect that  she wont get it any way heres john dressed up as if he was going to a box in the theatre and youwhy should you be going to expense and knocking out things that costs money because mother smileys coming ill smiley her  now moulder but mrs moulder knew that it was of no use speaking to him at the present moment her task should be thisto feed and cosset him if possible into good humour before her guest should arrive her praises of mrs smiley had been very fairly true but nevertheless she was a lady who had a mind and voice of her own as any lady has a right to possess who draws in her own right two hundred a year out of a brickfield in the kingsland road such a one knows that she is above being snubbed and mrs smiley knew this of herself as well as any lady and if moulder in his wrath should call her mother smiley or give her to understand that he regarded her as an old woman that lady would probably walk herself off in a great dudgeonherself and her share in the brickfield to tell the truth mrs smiley required that considerable deference should be paid to her  mrs moulder knew well what was her husbands present ailment he had dined as early as one and on his journey up from leeds to london had refreshed himself with drink only that last glass of brandy which he had taken at the peterborough station had made him cross if she could get him to swallow some hot food before mrs smiley came all might yet be well  and whats it to be m she said in her most insinuating voicetheres a lovely chop down stairs and theres nothing so quick as that  chop he said and it was all he did say at the moment  theres a am in beautiful cut she went on showing by the urgency of her voice how anxious she was on the subject  for the moment he did not answer her at all but sat facing the fire and running his fat fingers through his uncombed hair mrs smiley he said i remember when she was kitchenmaid at old potts  she aint nobodys kitchenmaid now said mrs moulder almost prepared to be angry in the defence of her friend  and i never could make out when it was that smiley married herthat is if he ever did  now moulder thats shocking of you of course he married her she and i is nearly an age as possible though i think she is a year over me she says not and it aint nothing to me but i remember the wedding as if it was yesterday you and i had never set eyes on each other then m this last she added in a plaintive tone hoping to soften him  are you going to keep me here all night without anything he then said let me have some whiskyhot withand dont stand there looking at nothing  but youll take some solids with it moulder why it stands to reason youll be famished  do as youre bid will you and give me the whisky are you going to tell me when im to eat and when im to drink like a child this he said in that tone of voice which made mrs moulder know that he meant to be obeyed and though she was sure that he would make himself drunk she was compelled to minister to his desires she got the whisky and hot water the lemon and sugar and set the things beside him and then she retired to the sofa john kenneby the while sat perfectly silent looking on perhaps he was considering whether he would be able to emulate the domestic management of dockwrath or of moulder when he should have taken to himself mrs smiley and the kingsland brickfield  if youve a mind to help yourself john i suppose youll do it said moulder  none for me just at present thankee said kenneby  i suppose you wouldnt swallow nothing less than wine in them togs said the other raising his glass to his lips well heres better luck and im blessed if its not wanting im pretty well tired of this go and so i mean to let em know pretty plainly  all this was understood by mrs moulder who knew that it only signified that her husband was half tipsy and that in all probability he would be whole tipsy before long there was no help for it were she to remonstrate with him in his present mood he would very probably fling the bottle at her head indeed remonstrances were never of avail with him so she sat herself down thinking how she would run down when she heard mrs smileys step and beg that lady to postpone her visit indeed it would be well to send john to convey her home again  moulder swallowed his glass of hot toddy fast and then mixed another his eyes were very bloodshot and he sat staring at the fire his hands were thrust into his pockets between the periods of his drinking and he no longer spoke to any one im  if i stand it he growled forth addressing himself ive stood it a  deal too long and then he finished the second glass there was a sort of understanding on the part of his wife that such interjections as these referred to hubbles and grease and indicated a painfully advanced state of drink there was one hope the double heat that of the fire and of the whisky might make him sleep and if so he would be safe for two or three hours  im blessed if i do and thats all said moulder grasping the whiskybottle for the third time his wife sat behind him very anxious but not daring to interfere its going over the table m she then said  d the table he answered and then his head fell forward on his breast and he was fast asleep with the bottle in his hand  put your hand to it john said mrs moulder in a whisper but john hesitated the lion might rouse himself if his prey were touched  hell let it go easy if you put your hand to it hes safe enough now there if we could only get him back from the fire a little or his facell be burnt off of him  but you wouldnt move him  well yes well try ive done it before and hes never stirred come here just behind the casters is good i know laws aint he heavy and then they slowly dragged him back he grunted out some halfpronounced threat as they moved him but he did not stir and his wife knew that she was again mistress of the room for the next two hours it was true that he snored horribly but then she was used to that  you wont let her come up will you said john  why not she knows what men is as well i do smiley wasnt that way often i believe but he was awful when he was he wouldnt sleep it off quite innocent like that but would break everything about the place and then cry like a child after it now moulders got none of that about him the worst of it is how am i ever to get him into bed when he wakes  while the anticipation of this great trouble was still on her mind the ring at the bell was heard and john kenneby went down to the outer door that he might pay to mrs smiley the attention of waiting upon her up stairs and up stairs she came bristling with silkthe identical irish tabinet perhaps which had never been turnedand conscious of the business which had brought her  whatmoulders asleep is he she said as she entered the room i suppose thats as good as a pair of gloves any way  he aint just very well said mrs moulder winking at her friend hes tired after a long journey  ohh ahh said mrs smiley looking down upon the sleeping beauty and understanding everything at a glance its uncommon bad for him you know because hes so given to flesh  its as much fatigue as anything said the wife  yes i dare say and mrs smiley shook her head if he fatigues himself so much as that often hell soon be off the hooks  much was undoubtedly to be borne from two hundred a year in a brickfield especially when that two hundred a year was coming so very near home but there is an amount of impertinent familiarity which must be put down even in two hundred a year ive known worse cases than him my dear and that ended worse  oh i dare say but youre mistook if you mean smiley it was sepilus as took him off as everybody knows  well my dear im sure im not going to say anything against that and now john do help her off with her bonnet and shawl while i get the teathings  mrs smiley was a firm set healthylooking woman ofabout forty she had large dark glassy eyes which were bright without sparkling her cheeks were very red having a fixed settled colour that never altered with circumstances her black wiry hair was ended in short crisp curls which sat close to her head it almost collected like a wig but the hair was in truth her own her mouth was small and her lips thin and they gave to her face a look of sharpness that was not quite agreeable nevertheless she was not a badlooking woman and with such advantages as two hundred a year and the wardrobe which mrs moulder had described was no doubt entitled to look for a second husband  well mr kenneby and how do you find yourself this cold weather dear how he do snore dont he  yes said kenneby very thoughtfully he does rather he was thinking of miriam usbech as she was twenty years ago and of mrs smiley as she appeared at present not that he felt inclined to grumble at the lot prepared for him but that he would like to take a few more years to think about it  and then they sat down to tea the lovely chops which moulder had despised and the ham in beautiful cut which had failed to tempt him now met with due appreciation mrs smiley though she had never been known to take a drop too much did like to have things comfortable and on this occasion she made an excellent meal with a large pockethandkerchief of mouldersbrought in for the occasionstretched across the broad expanse of the irish tabinet we shant wake him shall we said she as she took her last bit of muffin  not till he wakes natural of hisself said mrs moulder when hes worked it off hell rouse himself and i shall have to get him to bed  hell be a bit patchy then wont he  well just for a while of course he will said mrs moulder but theres worse than him tomorrow morning maybe hell be just as sweet as sweet it dont hang about him sullen like thats what i hate when it hangs about em then the teathings were taken away mrs smiley in her familiarity assisting in the removal andin spite of the example now before themsome more sugar and some more spirits and some more hot water were put upon the table well i dont mind just the least taste in life mrs moulder as were quite between friends and im sure youll want it tonight to keep yourself up mrs moulder would have answered these last words with some severity had she not felt that good humour now might be of great value to her brother  well john and what is it youve got to say to her said mrs moulder as she put down her empty glass between friends who understood each other so well and at their time of life what was the use of ceremony  la mrs moulder what should he have got to say nothing im sure as id think of listening to  you try her john  not but what ive the greatest respect in life for mr kenneby and always did have if you must have anything to do with men ive always said recommend me to them as is quiet and steady and hasnt got too much of the gaba quiet man is the man for me any day  well john said mrs moulder  now mrs moulder cant you keep yourself to yourself and we shall do very well laws how he do snore when his head goes bobbing that way i do so fear hell have a fit  no he wont hes coming to all right well john  im sure i shall be very happy said john if she likes it she says that she respects me and im sure ive a great respect for her i always hadeven when mr smiley was alive  its very good of you to say so said she not speaking however as though she were quite satisfied what was the use of his remembering smiley just at present  enoughs enough between friends any day said mrs moulder so give her your hand john  i think itll be right to say one thing first said kenneby with a solemn and deliberate tone  and whats that said mrs smiley eagerly  in such a matter as this continued kenneby where the hearts are concerned  you didnt say anything about hearts yet said mrs smiley with some measure of approbation in her voice  didnt i said kenneby then it was an omission on my part and i beg leave to apologise but what i was going to say is this when the hearts are concerned everything should be honest and aboveboard  oh of course said mrs moulder and im sure she dont suspect nothing else  youd better let him go on said mrs smiley  my heart has not been free from womans lovely image  and isnt free now is it john said mrs moulder  ive had my object and though shes been anothers still ive kept her image on my heart  but it aint there any longer john hes speaking of twenty years ago mrs smiley  its quite beautiful to hear him said mrs smiley go on mr kenneby  the years are gone by as though they was nothing and still ive had her image on my heart ive seen her today  her gentlemans still alive aint he asked mrs smiley  and likely to live said mrs moulder  ive seen her today kenneby continued and now the adriatics free to wed another  neither of the ladies present exactly understood the force of the quotation but as it contained an appropriate reference to marriage and apparently to a second marriage it was taken by both of them in good part he was considered to have made his offer and mrs smiley thereupon formally accepted him hes spoke quite handsome im sure said mrs smiley to his sister and i dont know that any woman has a right to expect more as to the brickfields and then there was a slight reference to business with which it will not be necessary that the readers of this story should embarrass themselves  soon after that mr kenneby saw mrs smiley home in a cab and poor mrs moulder sat by her lord till he roused himself from his sleep let us hope that her troubles with him were as little vexatious as possible and console ourselves with the reflection that at twelve oclock the next morning after the second bottle of soda and brandy he was as sweet as sweet     chapter xliv  showing how lady mason could be very noble   lady mason returned to the cleeve after her visit to mr furnivals chambers and nobody asked her why she had been to london or whom she had seen nothing could be more gracious than the deference which was shown to her and the perfect freedom of action which was accorded to her on that very day lady staveley had called at the cleeve explaining to sir peregrine and mrs orme that her visit was made expressly to lady mason i should have called at orley farm of course said lady staveley only that i hear that lady mason is likely to prolong her visit with you i must trust to you mrs orme to make all that understood sir peregrine took upon himself to say that it all should be understood and then drawing lady staveley aside told her of his own intended marriage i cannot but be aware he said that i have no business to trouble you with an affair that is so exclusively our own but i have a wish which perhaps you may understand that there should be no secret about it i think it better for her sake that it should be known if the connection can be of any service to her she should reap that benefit now when some people are treating her name with a barbarity which i believe to be almost unparalleled in this country in answer to this lady staveley was of course obliged to congratulate him and she did so with the best grace in her power but it was not easy to say much that was cordial and as she drove back with mrs arbuthnot to noningsby the words which were said between them as to lady mason were not so kindly meant towards that lady as their remarks on their journey to the cleeve  lady staveley had hopedthough she had hardly expressed her hope even to herself and certainly had not spoken of it to any one elsethat she might have been able to say a word or two to mrs orme about young peregrine a word or two that would have shown her own good feeling towards the young manher own regard and almost affection for him even though this might have been done without any mention of madelines name she might have learned in this way whether young orme had made known at home what had been his hopes and what his disappointments and might have formed some opinion whether or no he would renew his suit she would not have been the first to mention her daughters name but if mrs orme should speak of it then the subject would be free for her and she could let it be known that the heir of the cleeve should at any rate have her sanction and good will what happiness could be so great for her as that of having a daughter so settled within eight miles of her and then it was not only that a marriage between her daughter and peregrine orme would be an event so fortunate but also that those feelings with reference to felix graham were so unfortunate that young heart she thought could not as yet be heavy laden and it might be possible that the whole affair should be made to run in the proper courseif only it could be done at once but now that tale which sir peregrine had told her respecting himself and lady mason had made it quite impossible that anything should be said on the other subject and then again if it was decreed that the noningsby family and the family of the cleeve should be connected would not such a marriage as this between the baronet and lady mason be very injurious so that lady staveley was not quite happy as she returned to her own house  lady staveleys message however for lady mason was given with all its full force sir peregrine had felt grateful for what had been done and mrs orme in talking of it made quite the most of it civility from the staveleys to the ormes would not in the ordinary course of things be accounted of any special value the two families might and naturally would know each other on intimate terms but the ormes would as a matter of course stand the highest in general estimation now however the ormes had to bear up lady mason with them sir peregrine had so willed it and mrs orme had not for a moment thought of contesting the wish of one whose wishes she had never contested no words were spoken on the subject but still with both of them there was a feeling that lady staveleys countenance and open friendship would be of value when it had come to this with sir peregrine orme he was already disgraced in his own estimationalready disgraced although he declared to himself a thousand times that he was only doing his duty as a gentleman  on that evening lady mason said no word of her new purpose she had pledged herself both to peregrine orme and to mr furnival to both she had made a distinct promise that she would break off her engagement and she knew well that the deed should be done at once but how was she to do it with what words was she to tell him that she had changed her mind and would not take the hand that he had offered to her she feared to be a moment alone with peregrine lest he should tax her with the nonfulfilment of her promise but in truth peregrine at the present moment was thinking more of another matter it had almost come home to him that his grandfathers marriage might facilitate his own and though he still was far from reconciling himself to the connection with lady mason he was almost disposed to put up with it  on the following day at about noon a chariot with a pair of posthorses was brought up to the door of the cleeve at a very fast pace and the two ladies soon afterwards learned that lord alston was closeted with sir peregrine lord alston was one of sir peregrines oldest friends he was a man senior both in age and standing to the baronet and moreover he was a friend who came but seldom to the cleeve although his friendship was close and intimate nothing was said between mrs orme and lady mason but each dreaded that lord alston had come to remonstrate about the marriage and so in truth he had the two old men were together for about an hour and then lord alston took his departure without asking for or seeing any other one of the family lord alston had remonstrated about the marriage using at last very strong language to dissuade the baronet from a step which he thought so unfortunate but he had remonstrated altogether in vain every word he had used was not only fruitless but injurious for sir peregrine was a man whom it was very difficult to rescue by opposition though no man might be more easily led by assumed acquiescence  orme my dear fellow said his lordship towards the end of the interview it is my duty as an old friend to tell you this  then lord alston you have done your duty  not while a hope remains that i may prevent this marriage  there is ground for no such hope on your part and permit me to say that the expression of such a hope to me is greatly wanting in courtesy  you and i continued lord alston without apparent attention to the last words which sir peregrine had spoken have nearly come to the end of our tether here our careers have been run and i think i may say as regards both but i may certainly say as regards you that they have been so run that we have not disgraced those who preceded us our dearest hopes should be that our names may never be held as a reproach by those who come after us  with gods blessing i will do nothing to disgrace my family  but orme you and i cannot act as may those whose names in the world are altogether unnoticed i know that you are doing this from a feeling of charity to that lady  i am doing it lord alston because it so pleases me  but your first charity is due to your grandson suppose that he was making an offer of his hand to the daughter of some noblemanas he is so well entitled to dohow would it affect his hopes if it were known that you at the time had married a lady whose misfortune made it necessary that she should stand at the bar in a criminal court  lord alston said sir peregrine rising from his chair i trust that my grandson may never rest his hopes on any woman whose heart could be hardened against him by such a thought as that  but what if she should be guilty said lord alston  permit me to say said sir peregrine still standing and standing now bolt upright as though his years did not weigh on him a feather that this conversation has gone far enough there are some surmises to which i cannot listen even from lord alston  then his lordship shrugged his shoulders declared that in speaking as he had spoken he had endeavoured to do a friendly duty by an old friendcertainly the oldest and almost the dearest friend he hadand so he took his leave the wheels of the chariot were heard grating over the gravel as he was carried away from the door at a gallop and the two ladies looked into each others faces saying nothing sir peregrine was not seen from that time till dinner but when he did come into the drawingroom his manner to lady mason was if possible more gracious and more affectionate than ever  so lord alston was here today peregrine said to his mother that night before he went to bed  yes he was here  it was about this marriage mother as sure as i am standing here  i dont think lord alston would interfere about that perry  wouldnt he he would interfere about anything he did not like that is as far as the pluck of it goes of course he cant like it who can  perry your grandfather likes it and surely he has a right to please himself  i dont know about that you might say the same thing if he wanted to kill all the foxes about the place or do any other outlandish thing of course he might kill them as far as the law goes but where would he be afterwards she hasnt said anything to him has she  i think not  nor to you  no she has not spoken to me not about that  she promised me positively that she would break it off  you must not be hard on her perry  just as these words were spoken there came a low knock at mrs ormes dressingroom door this room in which mrs orme was wont to sit for an hour or so every night before she went to bed was the scene of all the meetings of affection which took place between the mother and the son it was a pretty little apartment opening from mrs ormes bedroom which had at one time been the exclusive property of peregrines father but by degrees it had altogether assumed feminine attributes had been furnished with soft chairs a sofa and a ladys table and though called by the name of mrs ormes dressingroom was in fact a separate sittingroom devoted to her exclusive use sir peregrine would not for worlds have entered it without sending up his name beforehand and this he did on only very rare occasions but lady mason had of late been admitted here and mrs orme now knew that it was her knock  open the door perry she said it is lady mason he did open the door and lady mason entered  oh mr orme i did not know that you were here  i am just off good night mother  but i am disturbing you  no we had done and he stooped down and kissed his mother good night lady mason hadnt i better put some coals on for you or the fire will be out he did put on the coals and then he went his way  lady mason while he was doing this had sat down on the sofa close to mrs orme but when the door was closed mrs orme was the first to speak well dear she said putting her hand caressingly on the others arm i am inclined to think that had there been no one whom mrs orme was bound to consult but herself she would have wished that this marriage should have gone on to her it would have been altogether pleasant to have had lady mason ever with her in the house and she had none of those fears as to future family retrospections respecting which lord alston had spoken with so much knowledge of the world as it was her manner was so caressing and affectionate to her guest that she did much more to promote sir peregrines wishes than to oppose them well dear she said with her sweetest smile  i am so sorry that i have driven your son away  he was going besides it would make no matter he would stay here all night sometimes if i didnt drive him away myself he comes here and writes his letters at the most unconscionable hours and uses up all my notepaper in telling some horsekeeper what is to be done with his mare  ah how happy you must be to have him  well i suppose i am she said as a tear came into her eyes we are so hard to please i am all anxiety now that he should be married and if he were married then i suppose i should grumble because i did not see so much of him he would be more settled if he would marry i think for myself i approve of early marriages for young men and then she thought of her own husband whom she had loved so well and lost so soon and so they sat silent for a while each thinking of her own lot in life  but i must not keep you up all night said lady mason  oh i do so like you to be here said the other then again she took hold of her arm and the two women kissed each other  but edith said the other i came in here tonight with a purpose i have something that i wish to say to you can you listen to me  oh yes said mrs orme surely  has your son been talking to you aboutabout what was said between him and me the other day i am sure he has for i know he tells you everythingas he ought to do  yes he did speak to me said mrs orme almost trembling with anxiety  i am so glad for now it will be easier for me to tell you and since that i have seen mr furnival and he says the same i tell you because you are so good and so loving to me i will keep nothing from you but you must not tell sir peregrine that i talked to mr furnival about this  mrs orme gave the required promise hardly thinking at the moment whether or no she would be guilty of any treason against sir peregrine in doing so  i think i should have said nothing to him though he is so very old a friend had not mr orme  you mean peregrine  yes had not he been soso earnest about it he told me that if i married sir peregrine i should be doing a cruel injury to himto his grandfather  he should not have said that  yes edithif he thinks it he told me that i should be turning all his friends against him so i promised him that i would speak to sir peregrine and break it off if it be possible  he told me that  and then i spoke to mr furnival and he told me that i should be blamed by all the world if i were to marry him i cannot tell you all he said but he said this that ifif  if what dear  if in the court they should say  say what  say that i did this thingthen sir peregrine would be crushed and would die with a broken heart  but they cannot say thatit is impossible you do not think it possible that they can do so and then again she took hold of lady masons arm and looked up anxiously into her face she looked up anxiously not suspecting anything not for a moment presuming it possible that such a verdict could be justly given but in order that she might see how far the fear of a fate so horrible was operating on her friend lady masons face was pale and woeworn but not more so than was now customary with her  one cannot say what may be possible she answered slowly i suppose they would not go on with it if they did not think they had some chance of success  you mean as to the property  yes as to the property  but why should they not try that if they must try it without dragging you there  ah i do not understand or at least i cannot explain it mr furnival says that it must be so and therefore i shall tell sir peregrine tomorrow that all this must be given up and then they sat together silently holding each other by the hand  good night edith lady mason said at last getting up from her seat  good night dearest  you will let me be your friend still will you not said lady mason  my friend oh yes always my friend why should this interfere between you and me  but he will be very angryat least i fear that he will not thatnot that he will have anything to regret but the very strength of his generosity and nobleness will make him angry he will be indignant because i do not let him make this sacrifice for me and thenand theni fear i must leave this house  oh no not that i will speak to him he will do anything for me  it will be better perhaps that i should go people will think that i am estranged from lucius but if i go you will come to me he will let you do that will he not  and then there were warm close promises given and embraces interchanged the women did love each other with a hearty true love and each longed that they might be left together and yet how different they were and how different had been their lives  the prominent thought in lady masons mind as she returned to her own room was thisthat mrs orme had said no word to dissuade her from the line of conduct which she had proposed to herself mrs orme had never spoken against the marriage as peregrine had spoken and mr furnival her heart had not been stern enough to allow her to do that but was it not clear that her opinion was the same as theirs lady mason acknowledged to herself that it was clear and acknowledged to herself also that no one was in favour of the marriage i will do it immediately after breakfast she said to herself and then she sat downand sat through the half the night thinking of it  mrs orme when she was left alone almost rebuked herself in that she had said no word of counsel against the undertaking which lady mason proposed for herself for mr furnival and his opinion she did not care much indeed she would have been angry with lady mason for speaking to mr furnival on the subject were it not that her pity was too deep to admit of any anger that the truth must be established at the trial mrs orme felt all but confident when alone she would feel quite sure on this point though a doubt would always creep in on her when lady mason was with her but now as she sat alone she could not realise the idea that the fear of a verdict against her friend should offer any valid reason against the marriage the valid reasons if there were such must be looked for elsewhere and were these other reasons so strong in their validity sir peregrine desired the marriage and so did lady mason herself as regarded her own individual wishes mrs orme was sure that this was so and then for her own self shesir peregrines daughterinlaw the only lady concerned in the mattershe also would have liked it but her son disliked it and she had yielded so far to the wishes of her son well was it not right that with her those wishes should be all but paramount and thus she endeavoured to satisfy her conscience as she retired to rest  on the following morning the four assembled at breakfast lady mason hardly spoke at all to any one mrs orme who knew what was about to take place was almost as silent but sir peregrine had almost more to say than usual to his grandson he was in good spirits having firmly made up his mind on a certain point and he showed this by telling peregrine that he would ride with him immediately after breakfast what has made you so slack about your hunting during the last two or three days he asked  i shall hunt tomorrow said peregrine  then you can afford time to ride with me through the woods after breakfast and so it would have been arranged had not lady mason immediately said that she hoped to be able to say a few words to sir peregrine in the library after breakfast place aux dames said he peregrine the horses can wait and so the matter was arranged while they were still sitting over their toast  peregrine as this was said had looked at his mother but she had not ventured to take her eyes for a moment from the teapot then he had looked at lady mason and saw that she was as it were going through a fashion of eating her breakfast in order to break the absolute silence of the room he muttered something about the weather and then his grandfather with the same object answered him after that no words were spoken till sir peregrine rising from his chair declared that he was ready  he got up and opened the door for his guest and then hurrying across the hall opened the library door for her also holding it till she had passed in then he took her left hand in his and passing his right arm round her waist asked her if anything disturbed her  oh yes she said yes there is much that disturbs me i have done very wrong  how done wrong mary she could not recollect that he had called her mary before and the sound she thought was very sweetwas very sweet although she was over forty and he over seventy years of age  i have done very wrong and i have now come here that i may undo it dear sir peregrine you must not be angry with me  i do not think that i shall be angry with you but what is it dearest  but she did not know how to find words to declare her purpose it was comparatively an easy task to tell mrs orme that she had made up her mind not to marry sir peregrine but it was by no means easy to tell the baronet himself and now she stood there leaning over the fireplace with his arm round her waistas it behoved her to stand no longer seeing the resolution to which she had come but still she did not speak  well mary what is it i know there is something on your mind or you would not have summoned me in here is it about the trial have you seen mr furnival again  no it is not about the trial she said avoiding the other question  what is it then  sir peregrine it is impossible that we should be married and thus she brought forth her tidings as it were at a gasp speaking at the moment with a voice that was almost indicative of anger  and why not said he releasing her from his arm and looking at her  it cannot be she said  and why not lady mason  it cannot be she said again speaking with more emphasis and with a stronger tone  and is that all that you intend to tell me have i done anything that has offended you  offended me no i do not think that would be possible the offence is on the other side  then my dear  but listen to me now it cannot be i know that it is wrong everything tells me that such a marriage on your part would be a sacrificea terrible sacrifice you would be throwing away your great rank  no shouted sir peregrine not though i married a kitchenmaidinstead of a lady who in social life is my equal  ah no i should not have said rank you cannot lose thatbut your station in the world the respect of all around you thethethe  who has been telling you all this  i have wanted no one to tell me thinking of it has told it me all my own heart which is full of gratitude and love for you has told me  you have not seen lord alston  lord alston oh no  has peregrine been speaking to you  peregrine  yes peregrine my grandson  he has spoken to me  telling you to say this to me then he is an ungrateful boya very ungrateful boy i would have done anything to guard him from wrong in this matter  ah now i see the evil that i have done why did i ever come into the house to make quarrels between you  there shall be no quarrel i will forgive him even that if you will be guided by me and dearest mary you must be guided by me now this matter has gone too far for you to go backunless indeed you will say that personally you have an aversion to the marriage  oh no no it is not that she said eagerly she could not help saying it with eagerness she could not inflict the wound on his feelings which her silence would then have given  under those circumstances i have a right to say that the marriage must go on  no no  but i say it must sit down mary and she did sit down while he stood leaning over her and thus spoke you speak of sacrificing me i am an old man with not many more years before me if i did sacrifice what little is left to me of life with the object of befriending one whom i really love there would be no more in it than what a man might do and still feel that the balance was on the right side but here there will be no sacrifice my life will be happier and so will ediths and so indeed will that boys if he did but know it for the worlds talk which will last some month or two i care nothing this i will confess that if i were prompted to this only by my own inclination only by love for you and as he spoke he held out his hand to her and she could not refuse him hersin such a case i should doubt and hesitate and probably keep aloof from such a step but it is not so in doing this i shall gratify my own heart and also serve you in your great troubles believe me i have thought of that  i know you have sir peregrineand therefore it cannot be  but therefore it shall be the world knows it now and were we to be separated after what has past the world would say that ii had thought you guilty of this crime  i must bear all that and now she stood before him not looking him in the face but with her face turned down towards the ground and speaking hardly above her breath  by heavens no not whilst i can stand by your side not whilst i have strength left to support you and thrust the lie down the throat of such a wretch as joseph mason no mary go back to edith and tell her that you have tried it but that there is no escape for you and then he smiled at her his smile at times could be very pleasant  but she did not smile as she answered him sir peregrine she said and she endeavoured to raise her face to his but failed  well my love  sir peregrine i am guilty  guilty guilty of what he said startled rather than instructed by her words  guilty of all this with which they charge me and then she threw herself at his feet and wound her arms round his knees  illustration guilty     chapter xlv  showing how mrs orme could be very weak minded   i venture to think i may almost say to hope that lady masons confession at the end of the last chapter will not have taken anybody by surprise if such surprise be felt i must have told my tale badly i do not like such revulsions of feeling with regard to my characters as surprises of this nature must generate that lady mason had committed the terrible deed for which she was about to be tried that mr furnivals suspicion of her guilt was only too well founded that mr dockwrath with his wicked ingenuity had discovered no more than the truth will in its open revelation have caused no surprise to the readerbut it did cause terrible surprise to sir peregrine orme  and now we must go back a little and endeavour to explain how it was that lady mason had made this avowal of her guilt that she had not intended to do so when she entered sir peregrines library is very certain had such been her purpose she would not have asked mrs orme to visit her at orley farm had such a course of events been in her mind she would not have spoken of her departure from the cleeve as doubtful no she had intended still to keep her terrible secret to herself still to have leaned upon sir peregrines arm as on the arm of a trusting friend but he had overcome her by his generosity and in her fixed resolve that he should not be dragged down into this abyss of misery the sudden determination to tell the truth at least to him had come upon her she did tell him all and then as soon as the words were out of her mouth the strength which had enabled her to do so deserted her and she fell at his feet overcome by weakness of body as well as spirit  but the words which she spoke did not at first convey to his mind their full meaning though she had twice repeated the assertion that she was guilty the fact of her guilt did not come home to his understanding as a thing that he could credit there was something he doubted not to surprise and harass himsomething which when revealed and made clear might or might not affect his purpose of marryingsomething which it behoved this woman to tell before she could honestly become his wife something which was destined to give his heart a blow but he was very far as yet from understanding the whole truth let us think of those we love best and ask ourselves how much it would take to convince us of their guilt in such a matter that thrusting of the lie down the throat of joseph mason had become to him so earnest a duty that the task of believing the lie to be on the other side was no easy one the blow which he had to suffer was a cruel blow lady mason however was merciful for she might have enhanced the cruelty tenfold  he stood there wondering and bewildered for some minutes of time while she with her face hidden still clung round his knees what is it at last he said i do not understand but she had no answer to make to him her great resolve had been quickly made and quickly carried out but now the reaction left her powerless he stooped down to raise her but when he moved she fell prone upon the ground he could hear her sobs as though her bosom would burst with them  and then by degrees the meaning of her words began to break upon him i am guilty of all this with which they charge me could that be possible could it be that she had forged that will that with base premeditated contrivance she had stolen that property stolen it and kept it from that day to thisthrough all these long years and then he thought of her pure life of her womanly dignified repose of her devotion to her sonsuch devotion indeedof her sweet pale face and soft voice he thought of all this and of his own love and friendship for herof ediths love for her he thought of it all and he could not believe that she was guilty there was some other fault some much lesser fault than that with which she charged herself but there she lay at his feet and it was necessary that he should do something towards lifting her to a seat  he stooped and took her by the hand but his feeble strength was not sufficient to raise her lady mason he said speak to me i do not understand you will you not let me seat you on the sofa  but she at least had realised the full force of the revelation she had made and lay there covered with shame brokenhearted and unable to raise her eyes from the ground with what inward struggles she had played her part during the last few months no one might ever know but those struggles had been kept to herself the world her world that world for which she had cared in which she had lived had treated her with honour and respect and had looked upon her as an illused innocent woman but now all that would be over every one now must know what she was and then as she lay there that thought came to her must every one know it was there no longer any hope for her must lucius be told she could bear all the rest if only he might be ignorant of his mothers disgracehe for whom all had been done but no he and every one must know it oh if the beneficent spirit that sees all and pities all would but take her that moment from the world  when sir peregrine asked her whether he should seat her on the sofa she slowly picked herself up and with her head still crouching towards the ground placed herself where she before had been sitting he had been afraid that she would have fainted but she was not one of those women whose nature easily admits of such relief as that though she was always pale in colour and frail looking there was within her a great power of selfsustenance she was a woman who with a good cause might have dared anything with the worst cause that a woman could well have she had dared and endured very much she did not faint nor gasp as though she were choking nor become hysteric in her agony but she lay there huddled up in the corner of the sofa with her face hidden and all those feminine graces forgotten which had long stood her in truth so royally the inner true living woman was there at lastthat and nothing else  but hewhat was he to do it went against his heart to harass her at that moment but then it was essential that he should know the truth the truth or a suspicion of the truth was now breaking upon him and if that suspicion should be confirmed what was he to do it was at any rate necessary that everything should be put beyond a doubt  lady mason he said if you are able to speak to me  yes she said gradually straightening herself and raising her head though she did not look at him yes i am able but there was something terrible in the sound of her voice it was such a sound of agony that he felt himself unable to persist  if you wish it i will leave you and come backsay in an hour  no no do not leave me and her whole body was shaken with a tremour as though of an ague fit do not go away and i will tell you everything i did it  did what  iforged the will i did it alli am guilty  there was the whole truth now declared openly and in the most simple words and there was no longer any possibility that he should doubt it was very terriblea terrible tragedy but to him at this present moment the part most frightful was his and her present position what should he do for her how should he counsel her in what way so act that he might best assist her without compromising that high sense of right and wrong which in him was a second nature he felt at the moment that he would still give his last shilling to rescue heronly that there was the property let the heavens fall justice must be done there even a wretch such as joseph mason must have that which was clearly his own  as she spoke those last words she had risen from the sofa and was now standing before him resting with her hands upon the table like a prisoner in the dock  what he said with your own hands  yes with my own hands when he would not do justice to my baby when he talked of that other being the head of his house i did it with my own handsduring the night  and you wrote the namesyourself  yes i wrote them all and then there was again silence in the room but she still stood leaning on the table waiting for him to speak her doom  he turned away from the spot in which he had confronted her and walked to the window what was he to do how was he to help her and how was he to be rid of her how was he to save his daughter from further contact with a woman such as this and how was he to bid his daughter behave to this woman as one woman should behave to another in her misery then too he had learned to love her himselfhad yearned to call her his own and though this in truth was a minor sorrow it was one which at the moment added bitterness to the others but there she stood still waiting her doom and it was necessary that that doom should be spoken by him  if this can really be true  it is true you do not think that a woman would falsely tell such a tale as that against herself  then i fearthat this must be over between you and me  there was a relief to her a sort of relief in those words the doom as so far spoken was so much a matter of course that it conveyed no penalty her story had been told in order that that result might be attained with certainty there was almost a tone of scorn in her voice as she said oh yes all that must be over  and what next would you have me do he asked  i have nothing to request she said if you must tell it to all the world do so  tell it no it will not be my business to be an informer  but you must tell it there is mrs orme  yes to edith  and i must leave the house oh where shall i go when he knows it and where will he go wretched miserable woman but yet so worthy of pity what a terrible retribution for that nights work was now coming on her  he again walked to the window to think how he might answer these questions must he tell his daughter must he banish this criminal at once from his house every one now had been told of his intended marriage every one had been told through lord alston mr furnival and such as they that at any rate must now be untold and would it be possible that she should remain there living with them at the cleeve while all this was being done in truth he did not know how to speak he had not hardness of heart to pronounce her doom  of course i shall leave the house she said with something almost of pride in her voice if there be no place open to me but a gaol i will do that perhaps i had better go now and get my things removed at once say a word of love for me to hera word of respectful love and she moved as though she were going to the door  but he would not permit her to leave him thus he could not let the poor crushed broken creature wander forth in her agony to bruise herself at every turn and to be alone in her despair she was still the woman whom he had loved and over and beyond that was she not the woman who had saved him from a terrible downfall by rushing herself into utter ruin for his sake he must take some steps in her behalfif he could only resolve what those steps should be she was moving to the door but stopping her he took her by the hand you did it he said and he your husband knew nothing of it the fact itself was so wonderful that he had hardly as yet made even that all his own  i did it and he knew nothing of it i will go now sir peregrine i am strong enough  but where will you go  ah me where shall i go and she put the hand which was at liberty up to her temple brushing back her hair as though she might thus collect her thoughts where shall i go but he does not know it yet i will go now to orley farm when must he be told tell me that when must he know it  no lady mason you cannot go there today its very hard to say what you had better do  very hard she echoed shaking her head  but you must remain here at presentat the cleeve i mean at any rate for today i will think about it i will endeavour to think what may be the best  butwe cannot meet now she and imrs orme and then again he was silent for in truth the difficulties were too many for him might it not be best that she should counterfeit illness and be confined to her own room but then he was averse to recommend any counterfeit and if mrs orme did not go to her in her assumed illness the counterfeit would utterly fail of effect in the household and then should he tell mrs orme the weight of these tidings would be too much for him if he did not share them with some one so he made up his mind that he must tell them to herthough to no other one  i must tell her he said  oh yes she replied and he felt her hand tremble in his and dropped it he had forgotten that he thus held her as all these thoughts pressed upon his brain  i will tell it to her but to no one else if i might advise you i would say that it will be well for you now to take some rest you are agitated and  agitated yes but you are right sir peregrine i will go at once to my room and then  then perhapsin the course of the morning you will see me again  wherewill you come to me there  i will see you in her room in her dressingroom she will be down stairs you know from which last words the tidings were conveyed to lady mason that she was not to see mrs orme again  and then she went and as she slowly made her way across the hall she felt that all of evil all of punishment that she had ever anticipated had now fallen upon her there are periods in the lives of some of usi trust but of fewwhen with the silent inner voice of suffering we call on the mountains to fall and crush us and on the earth to gape open and take us in when with an agony of intensity we wish that our mothers had been barren in those moments the poorest and most desolate are objects to us of envy for their sufferings can be as nothing to our own lady mason as she crept silently across the hall saw a servant girl pass down towards the entrance to the kitchen and would have given all all that she had in the world to have changed places with that girl but no change was possible for her neither would the mountains crush her nor would the earth take her in there was her burden and she must bear it to the end there was the bed which she had made for herself and she must lie upon it no escape was possible to her she had herself mixed the cup and she must now drink of it to the dregs  slowly and very silently she made her way up to her own room and having closed the door behind her sat herself down upon the bed it was as yet early in the morning and the servant had not been in the chamber there was no fire there although it was still midwinter of such details as these sir peregrine had remembered nothing when he recommended her to go to her own room nor did she think of them at first as she placed herself on the bedside but soon the bitter air pierced her through and through and she shivered with the cold as she sat there after a while she got herself a shawl wrapped it close around her and then sat down again she bethought herself that she might have to remain in this way for hours so she rose again and locked the door it would add greatly to her immediate misery if the servants were to come while she was there and see her in her wretchedness presently the girls did come and being unable to obtain entrance were told by lady mason that she wanted the chamber for the present whereupon they offered to light the fire but she declared that she was not cold her teeth were shaking in her head but any suffering was better than the suffering of being seen  illustration lady mason after her confession  she did not lie down or cover herself further than she was covered with that shawl nor did she move from her place for more than an hour by degrees she became used to the cold she was numbed and as it were half dead in all her limbs but she had ceased to shake as she sat there and her mind had gone back to the misery of her position there was so much for her behind that was worse what should she do when even this retirement should not be allowed to her instead of longing for the time when she should be summoned to meet sir peregrine she dreaded its coming it would bring her nearer to that other meeting when she would have to bow her head and crouch before her son  she had been there above an hour and was in truth ill with the cold when she heardand scarcely hearda light step come quickly along the passage towards her door her womans ear instantly told her who owned that step and her heart once more rose with hope was she coming there to comfort her to speak to the poor bruised sinner one word of feminine sympathy the quick light step stopped at the door there was a pause and then a low low knock was heard lady mason asked no question but dropping from the bed hurried to the door and turned the key she turned the key and as the door was opened half hid herself behind itand then mrs orme was in the room  what you have no fire she said feeling that the air struck her with a sudden chill oh this is dreadful my poor poor dear and then she took hold of both lady masons hands had she possessed the wisdom of the serpent as well as the innocence of the dove she could not have been wiser in her first mode of addressing the sufferer for she knew it all during that dreadful hour sir peregrine had told her the whole story and very dreadful that hour had been to her he when he attempted to give counsel in the matter had utterly failed he had not known what to suggest nor could she say what it might be wisest for them all to do but on one point her mind had been at once resolved the woman who had once been her friend whom she had learned to love should not leave the house without some sympathy and womanly care the guilt was very bad yes it was terrible she acknowledged that it was a thing to be thought of only with shuddering but the guilt of twenty years ago did not strike her senses so vividly as the abject misery of the present day there was no pity in her bosom for mr joseph mason when she heard the story but she was full of pity for her who had committed the crime it was twenty years ago and had not the sinner repented besides was she to be the judge judge not and ye shall not be judged she said when she thought that sir peregrine spoke somewhat harshly in the matter so she said altogether misinterpreting the scripture in her desire to say something in favour of the poor woman  but when it was hinted to her that lady mason might return to orley farm without being again seen by her her womans heart at once rebelled if she has done wrong said mrs orme  she has done great wrongfearful wrong said sir peregrine  it will not hurt me to see her because she has done wrong not see her while she is in the house if she were in the prison would i not go to see her and then sir peregrine had said no more but he loved his daughterinlaw all the better for her unwonted vehemence  you will do what is right he saidas you always do then he left her and she after standing for a few moments while she shaped her thoughts went straight away to lady masons room  she took lady mason by both her hands and found that they were icy cold oh this is dreadful she said come with me dear but lady mason still stood up by the bedhead whither she had retreated from the door her eyes were still cast upon the ground and she leaned back as mrs orme held her as though by her weight she would hinder her friend from leading her from the room  you are frightfully cold said mrs orme  has he told you said lady mason asking the question in the lowest possible whisper and still holding back as she spoke  yes he has told mebut no one elseno one else and then for a few moments nothing was spoken between them  oh that i could die said the poor wretch expressing in words that terrible wish that the mountains might fall upon her and crush her  you must not say that that would be wicked you know he can comfort you do you not know that he will comfort you if you are sorry for your sins and go to him  but the woman in her intense suffering could not acknowledge to herself any idea of comfort ah me she exclaimed with a deep bursting sob which went straight to mrs ormes heart and then a convulsive fit of trembling seized her so strongly that mrs orme could hardly continue to hold her hands  you are ill with the cold she said come with me lady mason you shall not stay here longer  lady mason then permitted herself to be led out of the room and the two went quickly down the passage to the head of the front stairs and from thence to mrs ormes room in crossing the house they had seen no one and been seen by no one and lady mason when she came to the door hurried in that she might again hide herself in security for the moment as soon as the door was closed mrs orme placed her in an armchair which she wheeled up to the front of the fire and seating herself on a stool at the poor sinners feet chafed her hands within her own she took away the shawl and made her stretch out her feet towards the fire and thus seated close to her she spoke no word for the next halfhour as to the terrible fact that had become known to her then on a sudden as though the ice of her heart had thawed from the warmth of the others kindness lady mason burst into a flood of tears and flinging herself upon her friends neck and bosom begged with earnest piteousness to be forgiven  and mrs orme did forgive her many will think that she was wrong to do so and i fear it must be acknowledged that she was not strong minded by forgiving her i do not mean that she pronounced absolution for the sin of past years or that she endeavoured to make the sinner think that she was no worse for her sin mrs orme was a good churchwoman but not strong individually in points of doctrine all that she left mainly to the womans conscience and her own dealings with her saviourmerely saying a word of salutary counsel as to a certain spiritual pastor who might be of aid but mrs orme forgave heras regarded herself she had already while all this was unknown taken this woman to her heart as pure and good it now appeared that the woman had not been pure had not been goodand then she took her to her heart again criminal as the woman was disgraced and debased subject almost to the heaviest penalties of outraged law and justice a felon against whom the actual hands of the laws myrmidons would probably soon prevail a creature doomed to bear the scorn of the lowest of her fellowcreaturessuch as she was this other woman pure and high so shielded from the worlds impurity that nothing ignoble might touch herthis lady took her to her heart again and promised in her ear with low sweet words of consolation that they should still be friends i cannot say that mrs orme was right that she was weak minded i feel nearly certain but perhaps this weakness of mind may never be brought against her to her injury either in this world or in the next  i will not pretend to give the words which passed between them at that interview after a while lady mason allowed herself to be guided all in all by her friends advice as though she herself had been a child it was decided that for the presentthat is for the next day or twolady mason should keep her room at the cleeve as an invalid counterfeit in this there would be none certainly for indeed she was hardly fit for any place but her own bed if inclined and able to leave her room she should be made welcome to the use of mrs ormes dressingroom it would only be necessary to warn peregrine that for the present he must abstain from coming there the servants mrs orme said had heard of their masters intended marriage they would now hear that this intention had been abandoned on this they would put their own construction and would account in their own fashion for the fact that sir peregrine and his guest no longer saw each other but no suspicion of the truth would get abroad when it was seen that lady mason was still treated as a guest at the cleeve as to such future steps as might be necessary to be taken mrs orme would consult with sir peregrine and tell lady mason from time to time and as for the sad truth the terrible truththat at any rate for the present should be told to no other ears and so the whole morning was spent and mrs orme saw neither sir peregrine nor her son till she went down to the library in the first gloom of the winter evening     chapter xlvi  a womans idea of friendship   sir peregrine after the hour that he had spent with his daughterinlawthat terrible hour during which lady mason had sat alone on the bedsidereturned to the library and remained there during the whole of the afternoon it may be remembered that he had agreed to ride through the woods with his grandson but that purpose had been abandoned early in the day and peregrine had in consequence been hanging about the house he soon perceived that something was amiss but he did not know what he had looked for his mother and had indeed seen her for a moment at her door but she had told him that she could not then speak to him sir peregrine also had shut himself up but about the hour of dusk he sent for his grandson and when mrs orme on leaving lady mason went down to the library she found them both together  they were standing with their backs to the fire and the gloom in the room was too dark to allow of their faces being seen but she felt that the conversation between them was of a serious nature indeed what conversation in that house could be other than serious on that day i see that i am disturbing you she said preparing to retreat i did not know that you were together  do not go edith said the old man peregrine put a chair for your mother i have told him that all this is over now between me and lady mason  she trembled as she heard the words for it seemed to her that there must be danger now in even speaking of lady masondanger with reference to that dreadful secret the divulging of which would be so fatal  i have told him continued sir peregrine that for a few minutes i was angry with him when i heard from lady mason that he had spoken to her but i believe that on the whole it is better that it should have been so  he would be very unhappy if anything that he had done had distressed you said mrs orme hardly knowing what words to use or how to speak nor did she feel quite certain as yet how much had been told to her son and how much was concealed from him  no no no said the old man laying his arm affectionately on the young mans shoulder he has done nothing to distress me there is nothing wrongnothing wrong between him and me thank god for that but perry we will think now of that other matter have you told your mother anything about it and he strove to look away from the wretchedness of his mornings work to something in his family that still admitted of a bright hope  no sir not yet we wont mind that just now and then they all remained silent mrs orme sitting and the two men still standing with their backs towards the fire her mind was too intent on the unfortunate lady up stairs to admit of her feeling interest in that other unknown matter to which sir peregrine had alluded  if you have done with perry she said at last i would be glad to speak to you for a minute or two  oh yes said peregrinewe have done and then he went  you have told him said she as soon as they were left together  told him what of her oh no i have told him that thatthat idea of mine has been abandoned from this time forth sir peregrine could never endure to speak of his proposed marriage nor to hear it spoken of he conceives that this has been done at her instance he continued  and so it has said mrs orme with much more of decision in her voice than was customary with her  and so it has he repeated after her  nobody must know of thissaid she very solemnly standing up and looking into his face with eager eyes nobody but you and i  all the world i fear will know it soon said sir peregrine  no no why should all the world know it had she not told us we should not have known it we should not have suspected it mr furnival who understands these thingshe does not think her guilty  but ediththe property  let her give that upafter a while when all this has passed by that man is not in want it will not hurt him to be without it a little longer it will be enough for her to do that when this trial shall be over  but it is not hers she cannot give it up it belongs to her sonor is thought to belong to him it is not for us to be informers edith  no no it is not for us to be informers we must remember that  certainly it is not for us to tell the story of her guilt but her guilt will remain the same will be acted over and over again every day while the proceeds of the property go into the hands of lucius mason it is that which is so terrible ediththat her conscience should have been able to bear that load for the last twenty years a deed donethat admits of no restitution may admit of repentance we may leave that to the sinner and his conscience hoping that he stands right with his maker but here with her there has been a continual theft going on from year to yearwhich is still going on while lucius mason holds a sod of orley farm true repentance with her must be impossible it seems so to me and sir peregrine shuddered at the doom which his own rectitude of mind and purpose forced him to pronounce  it is not she that has it said mrs orme it was not done for herself  there is no difference in that said he sharply all sin is selfish and so was her sin in this her object was the aggrandisement of her own child and when she could not accomplish that honestly she did it by fraud andandand edith my dear you and i must look at this thing as it is you must not let your kind heart make your eyes blind in a matter of such moment  no father nor must the truth make our hearts cruel you talk of restitution and repentance repentance is not the work of a day how are we to say by what struggles her poor heart has been torn  i do not judge her  no no that is it we may not judge her may we but we may assist her in her wretchedness i have promised that i will do all i can to aid her you will allow me to do soyou will will you not and she pressed his arm and looked up into his face entreating him since first they two had known each other he had never yet denied her a request it was a law of his life that he would never do so but now he hesitated not thinking that he would refuse her but feeling that on such an occasion it would be necessary to point out to her how far she might go without risk of bringing censure on her own name but in this case though the mind of sir peregrine might be the more logical the purpose of his daughterinlaw was the stronger she had resolved that such communication with crime would not stain her and she already knew to what length she would go in her charity indeed her mind was fully resolved to go far enough  i hardly know as yet what she intends to do any assistance that you can give her must i should say depend on her own line of conduct  but i want your advice as to that i tell you what i purpose it is clear that mr furnival thinks she will gain the day at this trial  but mr furnival does not know the truth  nor will the judge and the lawyers and all the rest as you say so properly it is not for us to be the informers if they can prove it let them but you would not have her tell them all against herself and then she paused waiting for his answer  i do not know i do not know what to say it is not for me to advise her  ah but it is for you she said and as she spoke she put her little hand down on the table with an energy which startled him she is herea wretched woman in your house and why do you know the truth why has it been told to you and me because without telling it she could not turn you from that purpose of yours it was generous fatherconfess that it was very generous  yes it was generous said sir peregrine  it was very generous it would be base in us if we allowed ourselves to forget that but i was telling you my plan she must go to this trial  oh yes there will be no doubt as to that  thenif she can escape let the property be given up afterwards  i do not see how it is to be arranged the property will belong to lucius and she cannot give it up then it is not so easy to put matters right when guilt and fraud have set them wrong  we will do the best we can even suppose that you were to tell lucius afterwardsyou yourself if that were necessary you know  and so by degrees she talked him over but yet he would come to no decision as to what steps he himself must take what if he himself should go to mr round and pledge himself that the whole estate should be restored to mr mason of groby on condition that the trial were abandoned the world would probably guess the truth after that but the terrible trial and the more terrible punishment which would follow it might be thus escaped poor sir peregrine even when he argued thus within himself his conscience told him that in taking such a line of conduct he himself would be guilty of some outrage against the law by aiding a criminal in her escape he had heard of misprision of felony but nevertheless he allowed his daughterinlaw to prevail before such a step as this could be taken the consent of lady mason must of course be obtained but as to that mrs orme had no doubt if lucius could be induced to abandon the property without hearing the whole story it would be well but if that could not be achievedthen the whole story must be told to him and you will tell it mrs orme said to him it would be easier for me to cut off my right arm he answered but i will do my best  and then came the question as to the place of lady masons immediate residence it was evident to mrs orme that sir peregrine expected that she would at once go back to orley farmnot exactly on that day nor did he say on the day following but his words made it very manifest that he did not think it right that she should under existing circumstances remain at the cleeve sir peregrine however as quickly understood that mrs orme did not wish her to go away for some days  it would injure the cause if she were to leave us quite at once said mrs orme  but how can she stay here my dearwith no one to see her with none but the servants to wait upon her  i should see her said mrs orme boldly  do you mean constantlyin your old friendly way  yes constantly and she added after a pause not only here but at orley farm also and then there was another pause between them  sir peregrine certainly was not a cruel man nor was his heart by any means hardened against the lady with whom circumstances had lately joined him so closely indeed since the knowledge of her guilt had fully come upon him he had undertaken the conduct of her perilous affairs in a manner more confidential even than that which had existed while he expected to make her his wife but nevertheless it went sorely against the grain with him when it was proposed that there should still exist a close intimacy between the one cherished lady of his household and the woman who had been guilty of so base a crime it seemed to him that he might touch pitch and not be defiledhe or any man belonging to him but he could not reconcile it to himself that the widow of his son should run such risk in his estimation there was something almost more than human about the purity of the only woman that blessed his hearth it seemed to him as though she were a sacred thing to be guarded by a shrineto be protected from all contact with the pollutions of the outer world and now it was proposed to him that she should take a felon to her bosom as her friend  but will that be necessary edith he said and after all that has been revealed to us now will it be wise  i think so she said speaking again with a very low voice why should i not  because she has shown herself unworthy of such friendshipunfit for it i should say  unworthy dear father is she not as worthy and as fit as she was yesterday if we saw clearly into each others bosom whom should we think worthy  but you would not choose for your friend oneone who could do such a deed as that  no i would not choose her because she had so acted nor perhaps if i knew all beforehand would i open my heart to one who had so done but it is different now what are love and friendship worth if they cannot stand against such trials as these  do you mean edith that no crime would separate you from a friend  i have not said that there are circumstances always but if she repentsas i am sure she does i cannot bring myself to desert her who else is there that can stand by her now what other woman at any rate i have promised her and you would not have me break my word  thus she again gained her point and it was settled that for the present lady mason should be allowed to occupy her own roomher own room and occasionally mrs ormes sittingroom if it pleased her to do so no day was named for her removal but mrs orme perfectly understood that the sooner such a day could be fixed the better sir peregrine would be pleased and indeed his household as at present arranged was not a pleasant one the servants had all heard of his intended marriage and now they must also hear that that intention was abandoned and yet the lady would remain up stairs as a guest of his there was much in this that was inconvenient but under circumstances as they now existed what could he do  when all this was arranged and mrs orme had dressed for dinner she again went to lady mason she found her in bed and told her that at night she would come to her and tell her all and then she instructed her own servant as to attending upon the invalid in doing this she was cunning in letting a word fall here and there that might teach the woman that that marriage purpose was all over but nevertheless there was so much care and apparent affection in her mode of speaking and she gave her orders for lady masons comfort with so much earnestness that no idea could get abroad in the household that there had been any cause for absolute quarrel  late at night when her son had left her she did go again to her guests room and sitting down by the bedside she told her all that had been planned pointing out however with much care that as a part of those plans orley farm was to be surrendered to joseph mason you think that is right do you not said mrs orme almost trembling as she asked a question so pertinent to the deed which the other had done and to that repentance for the deed which was now so much to be desired  yes said the other of course it will be right and then the thought that it was not in her power to abandon the property occurred to her also if the estate must be voluntarily surrendered no one could so surrender it but lucius mason she knew this and felt at the moment that of all men he would be the least likely to do so unless an adequate reason was made clearly plain to him the same thought at the same moment was passing through the minds of them both but lady mason could not speak out her thought and mrs orme would not say more on that terrible day to trouble the mind of the poor creature whose sufferings she was so anxious to assuage  and then lady mason was left alone and having now a partner in her secret slept sounder than she had done since the tidings first reached her of mr dockwraths vengeance     chapter xlvii  the gem of the four families   and now we will go back to noningsby on that evening graham ate his pheasant with a relish although so many cares sat heavy on his mind and declared to mrs bakers great satisfaction that the cook had managed to preserve the bread sauce uninjured through all the perils of delay which it had encountered  bread sauce is so ticklish a simmer too much and its clean done for mrs baker said with a voice of great solicitude but she had been accustomed perhaps to patients whose appetites were fastidious the pheasant and the bread sauce and the mashed potatoes all prepared by mrs bakers own hands to be eaten as spoon meat disappeared with great celerity and then as graham sat sipping the solitary glass of sherry that was allowed to him meditating that he would begin his letter the moment the glass was empty augustus staveley again made his appearance  illustration bread sauce is so ticklish  well old fellow said he how are you now and he was particularly careful so to speak as to show by his voice that his affection for his friend was as strong as ever but in doing so he showed also that there was some special thought still present in his mindsome feeling which was serious in its nature if not absolutely painful  staveley said the other gravely i have acquired knowledge today which i trust i may carry with me to my grave  and what is that said augustus looking round to mrs baker as though he thought it well that she should be out of the room before the expected communication was made but mrs bakers attention was so riveted by her patients earnestness that she made no attempt to go  it is a wasting of the best gifts of providence said graham to eat a pheasant after one has really done ones dinner  oh thats it is it said augustus  so it is sir said mrs baker thinking that the subject quite justified the manner  and of no use whatsoever to eat only a little bit of one as a man does then to know what a pheasant is you should have it all to yourself  so you should sir said mrs baker quite delighted and very much in earnest  and you should have nothing else then if the bird be good to begin with and has been well hung  theres a deal in that said mrs baker  then i say youll know what a pheasant is thats the lesson which i have learned today and i give it you as an adequate return for the pheasant itself  i was almost afeard it would be spoilt by being brought up the second time said mrs baker and so i said to my lady but she wouldnt have you woke nohow and then mrs baker having heard the last of the lecture took away the empty wineglass and shut the door behind her  and now ill write those two letters said graham what ive written hitherto i wrote in bed and i feel almost more awkward now i am up than i did then  but what letters are they  well one to my laundress to tell her i shall be there tomorrow and one to mary snow to say that ill see her the day after  then felix dont trouble yourself to write either you positively wont go tomorrow  who says so  the governor he has heard from my mother exactly what the doctor said and declares that he wont allow it he means to see the doctor himself before you stir and he wants to see you also i am to tell you hell come to you directly after breakfast  i shall be delighted to see your father and am very much gratified by his kindness but  but what  im a free agent i supposeto go when i please  not exactly the law is unwritten but by traditional law a man laid up in his bedroom is not free to go and come no action for false imprisonment would lie if mrs baker kept all your clothes away from you  i should like to try the question  you will have the opportunity for you may be sure that youll not leave this tomorrow  it would depend altogether on the evidence of the doctor  exactly so and as the doctor in this case would clearly be on the side of the defendants a verdict on behalf of the plaintiff would not be by any means attainable after that the matter was presumed to be settled and graham said no more as to leaving noningsby on the next day as things turned out afterwards he remained there for another week  i must at any rate write a letter to mary snow he said and to mary snow he did write some three or four lines augustus sitting by the while augustus staveley would have been very glad to know the contents or rather the spirit of those lines but nothing was said about them and the letter was at last sealed up and intrusted to his care for the postbag there was very little in it that could have interested augustus staveley or any one else it contained the ordinary but no more than the ordinary terms of affection he told her that he found it impracticable to move himself quite immediately and then as to that cause of displeasurethat cause of supposed displeasure as to which both mary and mrs thomas had written he declared that he did not believe that anything had been done that he should not find it easy to forgive after so long an absence  augustus then remained there for another hour but not a word was said between the young men on that subject which was nearest at the moment to the hearts of both of them each was thinking of madeline but neither of them spoke as though any such subject were in their thoughts  heaven and earth said augustus at last pulling out his watch it only wants three minutes to seven i shall have a dozen messages from the judge before i get down to know whether he shall come and help me change my boots ill see you again before i go to bed goodbye old fellow and then graham was again alone  if lady staveley were really angry with him for loving her daughterif his friend staveley were in very truth determined that such love must under no circumstances be sanctionedwould they treat him as they were treating him would they under such circumstances make his prolonged stay in the house an imperative necessity he could not help asking himself this question and answering it with some gleam of hope and then he acknowledged to himself that it was ungenerous in him to do so his remaining therethe liberty to remain there which had been conceded to himhad arisen solely from the belief that a removal in his present state would be injudicious he assured himself of this over and over again so that no false hope might linger in his heart and yet hope did linger there whether false or true why might he not aspire to the hand of madeline staveleyhe who had been assured that he need regard no woman as too high for his aspirations  mrs baker he said that evening as that excellent woman was taking away his teathings i have not heard miss staveleys voice these two days  well no no more you have said she theres two ways you know mr graham of going to her part of the house theres the door that opens at the end of the passage by her mammas room shes been that way and thats the reason i suppose there aint no other im sure  one likes to hear ones friends if one cant see them thats all  to be sure one does i remember as how when i had the measlesi was living with my ladys mother as maid to the young ladies there was four of em and i dressed em allgod bless em theyve all got husbands now and grown familiesonly there aint one among em equal to our miss madeline though theres some of em much richer when my lady married himthe judge you knowhe was the poorest of the lot they didnt think so much of him when he came acourting in those days  he was only a practising barrister then  oh yes he knew well how to practise for miss isabellaas she was thenvery soon made up her mind about him laws mr graham she used to tell me everything in them days they didnt want her to have nothing to say to mr staveley at first but she made up her mind and though she wasnt one of them as has many words like miss furnival down there there was no turning her  did she marry at last against their wish  oh dear no nothing of that sort she wasnt one of them flighty ones neither she just made up her own mind and bided and now i dont know whether she hasnt done about the best of em all them oliphants is full of money they do sayfull of money that was miss louisa who came next but lord love you mr graham hes so crammed with gout as he cant ever put a foot to the ground and as crossas cross as cross we goes there sometimes you know then the girls is all plain and young mr oliphant the sonwhy he never so much as speaks to his own father and though theyre rolling in money they say he cant pay for the coat on his back now our mr augustus unless it is that he wont come down to morning prayers and always keeps the dinner waiting i dont think theres ever a black look between him and his papa and as for miss madelineshes the gem of the four families everybody gives that up to her  if madelines mother married a barrister in opposition to the wishes of her familya barrister who then possessed nothing but his witswhy should not madeline do so also that was of course the line which his thoughts took but then as he said to himself madelines father had been one of the handsomest men of his day whereas he was one of the ugliest and madelines father had been encumbered with no mary snow a man who had been such a fool as he who had gone so far out of the regular course thinking to be wiser than other men but being in truth much more silly could not look for that success and happiness in life which men enjoy who have not been so lamentably deficient in discretion twas thus that he lectured himself but still he went on thinking of madeline staveley  there had been some disagreeable confusion in the house that afternoon after augustus had spoken to his sister madeline had gone up to her own room and had remained there chewing the cud of her thoughts both her sister and her brother had warned her about this man she could moreover divine that her mother was suffering under some anxiety on the same subject why was all this why should these things be said and thought why should there be uneasiness in the house on her account in this matter of mr graham she acknowledged to herself that there was such uneasinessand she almost acknowledged to herself the cause  but while she was still sitting over her own fire with her needle untouched beside her her father had come home and lady staveley had mentioned to him that mr graham thought of going on the next day  nonsense my dear said the judge he must not think of such a thing he can hardly be fit to leave his room yet  pottinger does say that it has gone on very favourably pleaded lady staveley  but thats no reason he should destroy the advantages of his healthy constitution by insane imprudence hes got nothing to do he wants to go merely because he thinks he is in your way  lady staveley looked wishfully up in her husbands face longing to tell him all her suspicions but as yet her grounds for them were so slight that even to him she hesitated to mention them  his being here is no trouble to me of course she said  of course not you tell him so and hell stay said the judge i want to see him tomorrow myselfabout this business of poor lady masons  immediately after that he met his son and augustus also told him that graham was going  oh no hes not going at all said the judge ive settled that with your mother  hes very anxious to be off said augustus gravely  and why is there any reason  well i dont know for a moment he thought he would tell his father the whole story but he reflected that his doing so would be hardly fair towards his friend i dont know that there is any absolute reason but im quite sure that he is very anxious to go  the judge at once perceived that there was something in the wind and during that hour in which the pheasant was being discussed up in grahams room he succeeded in learning the whole from his wife dear good loving wife a secret of any kind from him was an impossibility to her although that secret went no further than her thoughts  the darling girl is so anxious about him thatthat im afraid said she  hes by no means a bad sort of man my love said the judge  but hes got nothingliterally nothing said the mother  neither had i when i went a wooing said the judge but nevertheless i managed to have it all my own way  you dont mean really to make a comparison said lady staveley in the first place you were at the top of your profession  was i if so i must have achieved that distinction at a very early age and then he kissed his wife very affectionately nobody was there to see and under such circumstances a man may kiss his wife even though he be a judge and between fifty and sixty years old after that he again spoke to his son and in spite of the resolves which augustus had made as to what friendship required of him succeeded in learning the whole truth  late in the evening when all the party had drunk their cups of tea when lady staveley was beginning her nap and augustus was making himself agreeable to miss furnivalto the great annoyance of his mother who half rousing herself every now and then looked sorrowfully at what was going on with her winking eyesthe judge contrived to withdraw with madeline into the small drawingroom telling her as he put his arm around her waist that he had a few words to say to her  well papa said she as at his bidding she sat herself down beside him on the sofa she was frightened because such summonses were very unusual but nevertheless her fathers manner towards her was always so full of love that even in her fear she felt a comfort in being with him  my darling he said i want to ask you one or two questionsabout our guest here who has hurt himselfmr graham  yes papa and now she knew that she was trembling with nervous dread  you need not think that i am in the least angry with you or that i suspect you of having done or said or even thought anything that is wrong i feel quite confident that i have no cause to do so  oh thank you papa  but i want to know whether mr graham has ever spoken to youas a lover  never papa  because under the circumstances of his present stay here his doing so would i think have been ungenerous  he never has papa in any waynot a single word  and you have no reason to regard him in that light  no papa but in the speaking of these last two words there was a slight hesitationthe least possible shade of doubt conveyed which made itself immediately intelligible to the practised ear of the judge  tell me all my darlingeverything that there is in your heart so that we may help each other if that may be possible  he has never said anything to me papa  because your mamma thinks that you are more anxious about him than you would be about an ordinary visitor  does she  has any one else spoken to you about mr graham  augustus did papa and isabella some time ago  then i suppose they thought the same  yes i suppose they did  and now dear is there anything else you would like to say to me about it  no papa i dont think there is  but remember this alwaysthat my only wishes respecting you and your mothers wishes also are to see you happy and good  i am very happy papa  and very good also to the best of my belief and then he kissed her and they went back again into the large drawingroom  many of my readers and especially those who are old and wiseif i chance to have any suchwill be inclined to think that the judge behaved foolishly in thus crossquestioning his daughter on a matter which if it were expedient that it should die away would die away the more easily the less it were talked about but the judge was an odd man in many of the theories of his life one of them with reference to his children was very odd and altogether opposed to the usual practice of the world it was thisthat they should be allowed as far as was practicable to do what they liked now the general opinion of the world is certainly quite the reversenamely this that children as long as they are under the control of their parents should be hindered and prevented in those things to which they are most inclined of course the world in general in carrying out this practice excuses it by an assertionmade to themselves or othersthat children customarily like those things which they ought not to like but the judge had an idea quite opposed to this children he said if properly trained would like those things which were good for them now it may be that he thought his daughter had been properly trained  he is a very clever young man my dear you may be sure of that were the last words which the judge said to his wife that night  but then he has got nothing she replied and he is so uncommonly plain  the judge would not say a word more but he could not help thinking that this last point was one which might certainly be left to the young lady     chapter xlviii  the angel of light under a cloud   on the following morning according to appointment the judge visited felix graham in his room it was only the second occasion on which he had done so since the accident and he was therefore more inclined to regard him as an invalid than those who had seen him from day to day  i am delighted to hear that your bones have been so amenable said the judge but you must not try them too far well get you down stairs into the drawingroom and see how you get on there by the next few days  i dont want to trouble you more than i can help said felix sheepishly he knew that there were reasons why he should not go into that drawingroom but of course he could not guess that those reasons were as well known to the judge as they were to himself  you shant trouble usmore than you can help i am not one of those men who tell my friends that nothing is a trouble of course you give trouble  i am so sorry  theres your bed to make my dear fellow and your gruel to warm you know shakspeare pretty well by heart i believe and he puts that matteras he did every other matterin the best and truest point of view lady macbeth didnt say she had no labour in receiving the king the labour we delight in physics pain she said those were her words and now they are mine  with a more honest purpose behind said felix  well yes ive no murder in my thoughts at present so that is all settled and lady staveley will be delighted to see you down stairs tomorrow  i shall be only too happy felix answered thinking within his own mind that he must settle it all in the course of the day with augustus  and now perhaps you will be strong enough to say a few words about business  certainly said graham  you have heard of this orley farm case in which our neighbour lady mason is concerned  oh yes we were all talking of it at your tablei think it was the night or a night or two before my accident  very well then you know all about it at least as much as the public knows generally it has now been decided on the part of joseph masonthe husbands eldest son who is endeavouring to get the propertythat she shall be indicted for perjury  for perjury  yes and in doing that regarding the matter from his point of view they are not deficient in judgment  but how could she have been guilty of perjury  in swearing that she had been present when her husband and the three witnesses executed the deed if they have any ground to stand onand i believe they have none whatever but if they have they would much more easily get a verdict against her on that point than on a charge of forgery supposing it to be the fact that her husband never executed such a deed it would be manifest that she must have sworn falsely in swearing that she saw him do so  why yes one would say so  but that would afford by no means conclusive evidence that she had forged the surreptitious deed herself  it would be strong presumptive evidence that she was cognizant of the forgery  perhaps sobut uncorroborated would hardly bring a verdict after such a lapse of years and then moreover a prosecution for forgery if unsuccessful would produce more painful feeling whether successful or unsuccessful it would do so bail could not be taken in the first instance and such a prosecution would create a stronger feeling that the poor lady was being persecuted  those who really understand the matter will hardly thank them for their mercy  but then so few will really understand it the fact however is that she will be indicted for perjury i do not know whether the indictment has not been already laid mr furnival was with me in town yesterday and at his very urgent request i discussed the whole subject with him i shall be on the home circuit myself on these next spring assizes but i shall not take the criminal business at alston indeed i should not choose that this matter should be tried before me under any circumstances seeing that the lady is my near neighbour now furnival wants you to be engaged on the defence as junior counsel  with himself  yes with himselfand with mr chaffanbrass  with mr chaffanbrass said graham in a tone almost of horroras though he had been asked to league himself with all that was most disgraceful in the professionas indeed perhaps he had been  yeswith mr chaffanbrass  will that be well judge do you think  mr chaffanbrass no doubt is a very clever man and it may be wise in such a case as this to have the services of a barrister who is perhaps unequalled in his power of crossexamining a witness  does his power consist in making a witness speak the truth or in making him conceal it  perhaps in both but here if it be the case as mr furnival suspects that witnesses will be suborned to give false evidence  but surely the rounds would have nothing to do with such a matter as that  no probably not i am sure that old richard round would abhor any such work as you or i would do they take the evidence as it is brought to them i believe there is no doubt that at any rate one of the witnesses to the codicil in question will now swear that the signature to the document is not her signature  a womanis it  yes a woman in such a case it may perhaps be allowable to employ such a man as mr chaffanbrass and i should tell you also such another man as mr solomon aram  solomon aram too why judge the old bailey will be left bare  the shining lights will certainly be down at alston now under those circumstances will you undertake the case  would youin my place  yes if i were fully convinced of the innocence of my client at the beginning  but what if i were driven to change my opinion as the thing progressed  you must go on in such a case as a matter of course  i suppose i can have a day or two to think of it  oh yes i should not myself be the bearer to you of mr furnivals message were it not that i think that lady mason is being very cruelly used in the matter if i were a young man in your position i should take up the case con amore for the sake of beauty and womanhood i dont say that that quixotism is very wise but still i dont think it can be wrong to join yourself even with such men as chaffanbrass and mr solomon aram if you can feel confident that you have justice and truth on your side then after a few more words the interview was over and the judge left the room making some further observation as to his hope of seeing graham in the drawingroom on the next day  on the following morning there came from peckham two more letters for graham one of course from mary snow and one from mrs thomas we will first give attention to that from the elder lady she commenced with much awe declaring that her pen trembled within her fingers but that nevertheless she felt bound by her conscience and that duty which she owed to mr graham to tell him everything that had occurredword by word as she expressed it and then felix looking at the letter saw that he held in his hand two sheets of letter paper quite full of small writing the latter of which was crossed she went on to say that her care had been unremitting and her solicitude almost maternal that marys conduct had on the whole been such as to inspire her with undeviating confidence but that the guile of the present age was such especially in respect to female servantswho seemed in mrs thomass opinion to be sent in these days express from a very bad place for the express assistance of a very bad gentlemanthat it was impossible for any woman let her be ever so circumspect to say what was what or who was who from all which graham learned that mrs thomas had been done but by the middle of the third page he had as yet learned nothing as to the manner of the doing  but by degrees the long reel unwinded itselfangel of light and all mary snow had not only received but had answered a lovers letter she had answered that lovers letter by making an appointment with him and she had kept that appointmentwith the assistance of the agent sent express from that very bad gentleman all this mrs thomas had only discovered afterwards by finding the lovers letter and the answer which the angel of light had written both of these she copied verbatim thinking probably that the original documents were too precious to be intrusted to the post and then ended by saying that an additional year of celibacy passed under a closer espionage and with more severe moral training might still perhaps make mary snow fit for the high destiny which had been promised to her  the only part of this letter which felix read twice was that which contained the answer from the angel of light to her lover you have been very wicked to address me the angel of light said severely and it is almost impossible that i should ever forgive you if only she could have brought herself to end there but her nature which the lover had greatly belied in likening it to her name was not cold enough for this so she added a few more words very indiscreetly as i want to explain to you why i can never see you again i will meet you on thursday afternoon at halfpast four a little way up clapham lane at the corner of the doctors wall just beyond the third lamp it was the first letter she had ever written to a lover and the poor girl had betrayed herself by keeping a copy of it  and then graham came to mary snows letter to himself which as it was short the reader shall have entire      my dear mr graham     i never was so unhappy in my life and i am sure i dont    know how to write to you of course i do not think you    will ever see me again unless it be to upbraid me for my    perfidy and i almost hope you wont for i should sink    into the ground before your eyes and yet i didnt mean to    do anything very wrong and when i did meet him i wouldnt    as much as let him take me by the handnot of my own    accord i dont know what she has said to you and i think    she ought to have let me read it but she speaks to me now    in such a way that i dont know how to bear it she has    rummaged among everything i have got but i am sure she    could find nothing except those two letters it wasnt my    fault that he wrote to me though i know now i ought not    to have met him he is quite a genteel young man and very    respectable in the medical line only i know that makes    no difference now seeing how good you have been to me i    dont ask you to forgive me but it nearly kills me when i    think of poor papa     yours always most unhappy and very sorry for what i have    done     mary snow   poor mary snow could any man under such circumstances have been angry with her in the first place if men will mould their wives they must expect that kind of thing and then after all was there any harm done if ultimately he did marry mary snow would she make a worse wife because she had met the apothecarys assistant at the corner of the doctors wall under the third lamppost graham as he sat with the letters before him made all manner of excuses for her and this he did the more eagerly because he felt that he would have willingly made this affair a cause for breaking off his engagement if his conscience had not told him that it would be unhandsome in him to do so  when augustus came he could not show the letters to him had he done so it would have been as much as to declare that now the coast was clear as far as he was concerned he could not now discuss with his friend the question of mary snow without also discussing the other question of madeline staveley so he swept the letters away and talked almost entirely about the orley farm case  i only wish i were thought good enough for the chance said augustus by heavens i would work for that woman as i never could work again for any fee that could be offered me  so would i but i dont like my fellowlabourers  i should not mind that  i suppose said graham there can be no possible doubt as to her absolute innocence  none whatever my father has no doubt furnival has no doubt sir peregrine has no doubtwho bytheby is going to marry her  nonsense  oh but he is though he has taken up her case con amore with a vengeance  i should be sorry for that it makes me think him a fool and hera very clever woman  and so that matter was discussed but not a word was said between them about mary snow or as to that former conversation respecting madeline staveley each felt then there was a reserve between them but each felt also that there was no way of avoiding this the governor seems determined that you shant stir yet awhile augustus said as he was preparing to take his leave  i shall be off in a day or two at the furthest all the same said graham  and you are to drink tea down stairs tonight ill come and fetch you as soon as were out of the diningroom i can assure you that your first appearance after your accident has been duly announced to the public and that you are anxiously expected and then staveley left him  so he was to meet madeline that evening his first feeling at the thought was one of joy but he soon brought himself almost to wish that he could leave noningsby without any such meeting there would have been nothing in itnothing that need have called for observation or remarkhad he not told his secret to augustus but his secret had been told to one and might be known to others in the house indeed he felt sure that it was suspected by lady staveley it could not as he said to himself have been suspected by the judge or the judge would not have treated him in so friendly a manner or have insisted so urgently on his coming down among them  and then how should he carry himself in her presence if he were to say nothing to her his saying nothing would be remarked and yet he felt that all his powers of selfcontrol would not enable him to speak to her in the same manner that he would speak to her sister he had to ask himself moreover what line of conduct he did intend to follow if he was still resolved to marry mary snow would it not be better that he should take this bull by the horns and upset it at once in such case madeline staveley must be no more to him than her sister but then he had two intentions in accordance with one he would make mary snow his wife and in following the other he would marry miss staveley it must be admitted that the two brides which he proposed to himself were very different the one that he had moulded for his own purposes was not as he admitted quite equal to her of whom nature education and birth had had the handling  again he dined alone but on this occasion mrs baker was able to elicit from him no enthusiasm as to his dinner and yet she had done her best and placed before him a sweetbread and dish of seakale that ought to have made him enthusiastic i had to fight with the gardener for that like anything she said singing her own praises when he declined to sing them  dear me theyll think that i am a dreadful person to have in the house  not a bit only they shant think as how im going to be said no to in that way when ive set my mind on a thing i know whats going and i know whats proper why laws mr graham theres heaps of things there and yet theres no getting of emunless theres a party or the like of that whats the use of a garden i sayor of a gardener neither if you dont have garden stuff its not to look at do finish it nowafter all the trouble i had standing over him in the cold while he cut it  oh dear oh dear mrs baker why did you do that  he thought to perish me making believe it took him so long to get at it but im not so easy perished i can tell him that id have stood there till now but what i had it miss madeline seed me as i was coming in and asked me what id been doing  i hope you didnt tell her that i couldnt live without seakale  i told her that i meant to give you your dinner comfortable as long as you had it up here and she said but laws mr graham you dont care what a young lady says to an old woman like me youll see her yourself this evening and then you can tell her whether or no the seakale was worth the eating its not so badly biled i will say that for hannah cook though she is rampagious sometimes he longed to ask her what words madeline had used even in speaking on such a subject as this but he did not dare to do so mrs baker was very fond of talking about miss madeline but graham was by no means assured that he should find an ally in mrs baker if he told her all the truth  at last the hour arrived and augustus came to convoy him down to the drawingroom it was now many days since he had been out of that room and the very fact of moving was an excitement to him he hardly knew how he might feel in walking down stairs and could not quite separate the nervousness arising from his shattered bones from that other nervousness which came from hisshattered heart the word is undoubtedly a little too strong but as it is there there let it stay when he reached the drawingroom he almost felt that he had better decline to enter it the door however was opened and he was in the room before he could make up his mind to any such step and he found himself being walked across the floor to some especial seat while a dozen kindly anxious faces were crowding round him  heres an armchair mr graham kept expressly for you near the fire said lady staveley and i am extremely glad to see you well enough to fill it  welcome out of your room sir said the judge i compliment you and pottinger also upon your quick recovery but allow me to tell you that you dont yet look a man fit to rough it alone in london  i feel very well sir said graham  and then mrs arbuthnot greeted him and miss furnival and four or five others who were of the party and he was introduced to one or two whom he had not seen before marian too came up to himvery gently as though he were as brittle as glass having been warned by her mother oh mr felix she said i was so unhappy when your bones were broken i do hope they wont break again  and then he perceived that madeline was in the room and was coming up to him she had in truth not been there when he first entered having thought it better as a matter of strategy to follow upon his footsteps he was getting up to meet her when lady staveley spoke to him  dont move mr graham invalids you know are chartered  i am very glad to see you once more down stairs said madeline as she frankly gave him her handnot merely touching hisvery very glad but i do hope you will get stronger before you venture to leave noningsby you have frightened us all very much by your terrible accident  all this was said in her peculiarly sweet silver voice not speaking as though she were dismayed and beside herself or in a hurry to get through a lesson which she had taught herself she had her secret to hide and had schooled herself how to hide it but in so schooling herself she had been compelled to acknowledge to herself that the secret did exist she had told herself that she must meet him and that in meeting him she must hide it this she had done with absolute success such is the peculiar power of women and her mother who had listened not only to every word but to every tone of her voice gave her exceeding credit  theres more in her than i thought there was said sophia furnival to herself who had also listened and watched  it has not gone very deep with her said the judge who on this matter was not so good a judge as miss furnival  she cares about me just as mrs baker does said graham to himself who was the worst judge of them all he muttered something quite unintelligible in answer to the kindness of her words and then madeline having gone through her task retired to the further side of the round table and went to work among the teacups  and then the conversation became general turning altogether on the affairs of lady mason it was declared as a fact by lady staveley that there was to be a marriage between sir peregrine orme and his guest and all in the room expressed their sorrow the women were especially indignant i have no patience with her said mrs arbuthnot she must know that such a marriage at his time of life must be ridiculous and injurious to the whole family  the women were very indignantall except miss furnival who did not say much but endeavoured to palliate the crimes of lady mason in that which she did say i do not know that she is more to blame than any other lady who marries a gentleman thirty years older than herself  i do then said lady staveley who delighted in contradicting miss furnival and so would you too my dear if you had known sir peregrine as long as i have and ifififbut it does not matter i am very sorry for lady masonvery i think she is a woman cruelly used by her own connections but my sympathies with her would be warmer if she had refrained from using her power over an old gentleman like sir peregrine in the way she has done in all which expression of sentiment the reader will know that poor dear lady staveley was wrong from the beginning to the end  for my part said the judge i dont see what else she was to do if sir peregrine asked her how could she refuse  my dear said lady staveley  according to that papa every lady must marry any gentleman that asks her said mrs arbuthnot  when a lady is under so deep a weight of obligation i dont know how she is to refuse my idea is that sir peregrine should not have asked her  and mine too said felix unless indeed he did it under an impression that he could fight for her better as her husband than simply as a friend  and i feel sure that that is what he did think said madeline from the further side of the table and her voice sounded in grahams ears as the voice of eve may have sounded to adam no let him do what he might in the worldwhatever might be the form in which his future career should be fashioned one thing was clearly impossible to him he could not marry mary snow had he never learned to know what were the true charms of feminine grace and loveliness it might have been possible for him to do so and to have enjoyed afterwards a fair amount of contentment but now even contentment would be impossible to him under such a lot as that not only would he be miserable but the woman whom he married would be wretched also it may be said that he made up his mind definitely while sitting in that armchair that he would not marry mary snow poor mary snow her fault in the matter had not been great  when graham was again in his room and the servant who was obliged to undress him had left him he sat over his fire wrapped in his dressinggown bethinking himself what he would do i will tell the judge everything he said at last then if he will let me into his house after that i must fight my own battle and so he betook himself to bed     chapter xlix  mrs furnival cant put up with it   when lady mason last left the chambers of her lawyer in lincolns inn she was watched by a stout lady as she passed through the narrow passage leading from the old to the new square that fact will i trust be remembered and i need hardly say that the stout lady was mrs furnival she had heard betimes of the arrival of that letter with the hamworth postmark had felt assured that it was written by the hands of her hated rival and had at once prepared for action  i shall leave this house todayimmediately after breakfast she said to miss biggs as they sat disconsolately at the table with the urn between them  and i think you will be quite right my dear replied miss biggs it is your bounden duty to put down such wicked iniquity as thisnot only for your own sake but for that of morals in general what in the world is there so beautiful and so lovely as a high tone of moral sentiment to this somewhat transcendental question mrs furnival made no reply that a high tone of moral sentiment as a thing in general for the worlds use is very good she was no doubt aware but her mind at the present moment was fixed exclusively on her own peculiar case that tom furnival should be made to give up seeing that nasty woman who lived at hamworth and to give up also having letters from herthat at present was the extent of her moral sentiment his wicked iniquity she could forgive with a facility not at all gratifying to miss biggs if only she could bring about such a result as that so she merely grunted in answer to the above proposition  and will you sleep away from this asked miss biggs  certainly i will i will neither eat here nor sleep here nor stay here till i know that all this is at an end i have made up my mind what i will do  well asked the anxious martha  oh never mind i am not exactly prepared to talk about it there are things one cant talk aboutnot to anybody one feels as though one would burst in mentioning it i do i know  martha biggs could not but feel that this was hard but she knew that friendship is nothing if it be not long enduring dearest kitty she exclaimed if true sympathy can be of service to you  i wonder whether i could get respectable lodgings in the neighbourhood of red lion square for a week said mrs furnival once more bringing the conversation back from the abstract to the concrete  in answer to this miss biggs of course offered the use of her own bedroom and of her fathers house but her father was an old man and mrs furnival positively refused to agree to any such arrangement at last it was decided that martha should at once go off and look for lodgings in the vicinity of her own home that mrs furnival should proceed to carry on her own business in her own waythe cruelty being this that she would not give the least hint as to what that way might beand that the two ladies should meet together in the red lion square drawingroom at the close of the day  and about dinner dear asked miss biggs  i will get something at a pastrycooks said mrs furnival  and your clothes dear  rachel will see about them she knows now rachel was the old female servant of twenty years standing and the disappointment experienced by poor miss biggs at the ignorance in which she was left was greatly enhanced by a belief that rachel knew more than she did mrs furnival would tell rachel but would not tell her this was very very hard as miss biggs felt but nevertheless friendship sincere friendship is long enduring and true patient merit will generally receive at last its appropriate reward  then mrs furnival had sat down martha biggs having been duly sent forth on the mission after the lodgings and had written a letter to her husband this she intrusted to rachel whom she did not purpose to remove from that abode of iniquity from which she herself was fleeing and having completed her letter she went out upon her own work the letter ran as follows      harley streetfriday     my dearest tom     i cannot stand this any longer so i have thought it best    to leave the house and go away i am very sorry to be    forced to such a step as this and would have put up with    a good deal first but there are some things which i    cannot put up withand wont i know that a woman has    to obey her husband and i have always obeyed you and    thought it no hardship even when i was left so much alone    but a woman is not to see a slut brought in under her very    noseand i wont put up with it weve been married now    going on over twentyfive years and its terrible to    think of being driven to this i almost believe it will    drive me mad and then when im a lunatic of course you    can do as you please     i dont want to have any secrets from you where i shall    go i dont yet know but ive asked martha biggs to take    lodgings for me somewhere near her i must have somebody    to speak to now and again so you can write to 23 red lion    square till you hear further its no use sending for me    for i wont comenot till i know that you think better    of your present ways of going on i dont know whether you    have the power to get the police to come after me but i    advise you not if you do anything of that sort the people    about shall hear of it     and now tom i want to say one word to you you cant    think its a happiness to me going away from my own home    where i have lived respectable so many years or leaving    you whom ive loved with all my whole heart it makes me    very very unhappy so that i could sit and cry all day if    it werent for pride and because the servants shouldnt    see me to think that it has come to this after all oh    tom i wonder whether you ever think of the old days when    we used to be so happy in keppel street there wasnt    anybody then that you cared to see except mei do    believe that and youd always come home then and i never    thought bad of it though you wouldnt have a word to speak    to me for hours because you were doing your duty but you    aint doing your duty now tom you know you aint doing    your duty when you never dine at home and come home so    cross with wine that you curse and swear and have that    nasty woman coming to see you at your chambers dont tell    me its about law business ladies dont go to barristers    chambers about law business all that is done by    attorneys ive heard you say scores of times that you    never would see people themselves and yet you see her     oh tom you have made me so wretched but i can forgive    it all and will never say another word about it to fret    you if youll only promise me to have nothing more to    say to that woman of course id like you to come home to    dinner but id put up with that youve made your own way    in the world and perhaps its only right you should enjoy    it i dont think so much dining at the club can be good    for you and im afraid youll have gout but i dont    want to bother you about that send me a line to say that    you wont see her any more and ill come back to harley    street at once if you cant bring yourself to do that    youandimustpart i can put up with a great deal    but i cant put up with thatand wont     your affectionate loving wife     c furnival   i wonder whether you ever think of the old days when we used to be so happy in keppel street ah me how often in after life in those successful days when the battle has been fought and won when all seems outwardly to go wellhow often is this reference made to the happy days in keppel street it is not the prize that can make us happy it is not even the winning of the prize though for the one short halfhour of triumph that is pleasant enough the struggle the long hot hour of the honest fight the grinding workwhen the teeth are set and the skin moist with sweat and rough with dust when all is doubtful and sometimes desperate when a man must trust to his own manhood knowing that those around him trust to it not at allthat is the happy time of life there is no human bliss equal to twelve hours of work with only six hours in which to do it and when the expected pay for that work is worse than doubtful the inner satisfaction is so much the greater oh those happy days in keppel street or it may be over in dirty lodgings in the borough or somewhere near the marylebone workhouseanywhere for a moderate weekly stipend those were to us and now are to others and always will be to many the happy days of life how bright was love and how full of poetry flashes of wit glanced here and there and how they came home and warmed the cockles of the heart and the unfrequent bottle methinks that wine has utterly lost its flavour since those days there is nothing like it long work grinding weary work work without pay hopeless work but work in which the worker trusts himself believing it to be good let him like mahomet have one other to believe in him and surely nothing else is needed ah me i wonder whether you ever think of the old days when we used to be so happy in keppel street  nothing makes a man so cross as success or so soon turns a pleasant friend into a captious acquaintance your successful man eats too much and his stomach troubles him he drinks too much and his nose becomes blue he wants pleasure and excitement and roams about looking for satisfaction in places where no man ever found it he frets himself with his bankers book and everything tastes amiss to him that has not on it the flavour of gold the straw of an omnibus always stinks the linings of the cabs are filthy there are but three houses round london at which an eatable dinner may be obtained and yet a few years since how delicious was that cut of roast goose to be had for a shilling at the eatinghouse near golden square mrs jones and mrs green mrs walker and all the other mistresses are too vapid and stupid and humdrum for endurance the theatres are dull as lethe and politics have lost their salt success is the necessary misfortune of life but it is only to the very unfortunate that it comes early  mrs furnival when she had finished her letter and fastened it drew one of the heavy diningroom armchairs over against the fire and sat herself down to consider her past life still holding the letter in her lap she had not on that morning been very careful with her toilet as was perhaps natural enough the cares of the world were heavy on her and he would not be there to see her her hair was rough and her face was red and she had hardly had the patience to make straight the collar round her neck to the eye she was an untidy angry crosslooking woman but her heart was full of tendernessfull to overflowing she loved him now as well as ever she had loved himalmost more as the thought of parting from him pressed upon her was he not all in all to her had she not worshipped him during her whole life could she not forgive him  forgive him yes forgive him with the fullest frankest freest pardon if he would only take forgiveness should she burn that letter in the fire send to biggs saying that the lodgings were not wanted and then throw herself at toms feet imploring him to have mercy upon her all that she could do within her heart and make her words as passionate as soft and as poetical as might be those of a young wife of twenty but she felt that such wordsthough she could frame the sentence while sitting therecould never get themselves spoken she had tried it and it had been of no avail not only should she be prepared for softness but he also must be so prepared and at the same moment if he should push her from him and call her a fool when she attempted that throwing of herself at his feet how would it be with her spirit then no she must go forth and the letter must be left if there were any hope of union for the future it must come from a parting for the present so she went up stairs and summoned rachel remaining with her in consultation for some halfhour then she descended with her bonnet and shawl got into a cab while spooner stood at the door looking very serious and was driven awaywhither no one knew in harley street except mrs furnival herself and that cabman  shell never put her foot inside this hall door again thats my idea of the matter said spooner  indeed and she will said rachel and be a happier woman than ever shes been since the house was took  if i know master said spooner hes not the man to get rid of an old woman easy like that and then ave her back agin upon hearing which words so very injurious to the sex in general rachel walked into the house not deigning any further reply  and then as we have seen mrs furnival was there standing in the dark shadow of the lincolns inn passage when lady mason left the lawyers chambers she felt sure that it was lady mason but she could not be quite sure the woman though she came out from the entry which led to her husbands chambers might have come down from some other set of rooms had she been quite certain she would have attacked her rival there laying bodily hands upon her in the purlieus of the lord chancellors court as it was the poor bruised creature was allowed to pass by and as she emerged out into the light at the other end of the passage mrs furnival became quite certain of her identity  never mind she said to herself she shant escape me long him i could forgive if he would only give it up but as for her let what come of it come may i will tell that woman what i think of her conduct before i am many hours older then giving one look up to the windows of her husbands chambers she walked forth through the dusty old gate into chancery lane and made her way on foot up to no 23 red lion square im glad ive done it she said to herself as she went very glad theres nothing else for it when things come to such a head as that and in this frame of mind she knocked at her friends door  well said martha biggs with her eyes and mouth and arms and heart all open  have you got me the lodgings said mrs furnival  yes close byin orange street im afraid youll find them very dull and what have you done  i have done nothing and i dont at all mind their being dull they cant possibly be more dull than harley street  and i shall be near you shant i said martha biggs  umph said mrs furnival i might as well go there at once and get myself settled so she did the affectionate martha of course accompanying her and thus the affairs of that day were over  her intention was to go down to hamworth at once and make her way up to orley farm at which place she believed that lady mason was living up to this time she had heard no word of the coming trial beyond what mr furnival had told her as to his clients law business and whatever he had so told her she had scrupulously disbelieved in her mind all that went for nothing law business she was not so blind so soft so green as to be hoodwinked by such stuff as that beautiful widows dont have personal interviews with barristers in their chambers over and over again let them have what law business they may at any rate mrs furnival took upon herself to say that they ought not to have such interviews she would go down to orley farm and she would have an interview with lady mason perhaps the thing might be stopped in that way  on the following morning she received a note from her husband the consideration of which delayed her proceedings for that day  dear kitty the note ran      i think you are very foolish if regard for me had not    kept you at home some consideration with reference to    sophia should have done so what you say about that poor    lady at orley farm is too absurd for me to answer if you    would have spoken to me about her i would have told you    that which would have set your mind at rest at any rate    as regards her i cannot do this in a letter nor could i    do it in the presence of your friend miss biggs     i hope you will come back at once but i shall not add    to the absurdity of your leaving your own house by any    attempt to bring you back again by force as you must want    money i enclose a check for fifty pounds i hope you will    be back before you want more but if not i will send it as    soon as you ask for it     yours affectionately as always     t furnival   there was about this letter an absence of sentiment and an absence of threat and an absence of fuss which almost overset her could it be possible that she was wrong about lady mason should she go to him and hear his own account before she absolutely declared war by breaking into the enemys camp at orley farm then moreover she was touched and almost overcome about the money she wished he had not sent it to her that money difficulty had occurred to her and been much discussed in her own thoughts of course she could not live away from him if he refused to make her any allowanceat least not for any considerable time he had always been liberal as regards money since money had been plenty with him and therefore she had some supply with her she had jewels too which were her own and though as she had already determined she would not part with them without telling him what she was about to do yet she could if pressed live in this way for the next twelve monthsperhaps with close economy even for a longer time than that in her present frame of mind she had looked forward almost with gratification to being pinched and made uncomfortable she would wear her ordinary and more dowdy dresses she would spend much of her time in reading sermons she would get up very early and not care what she ate or drank in short she would make herself as uncomfortable as circumstances would admit and thoroughly enjoy her grievances  but then this check of fifty pounds and this offer of as much more as she wanted when that was gone rather took the ground from under her feet unless she herself chose to give way she might go on living in orange street to the end of the chapter with every material comfort about herkeeping her own brougham if she liked for the checks she now knew would come without stint and he would go on living in harley street seeing lady mason as often as he pleased sophia would be the mistress of the house and as long as this was so lady mason would not show her face there now this was not a course of events to which mrs furnival could bring herself to look forward with satisfaction  all this delayed her during that day but before she went to bed she made up her mind that she would at any rate go down to hamworth tom she knew was deceiving her of that she felt morally sure she would at any rate go down to hamworth and trust to her own wit for finding out the truth when there     chapter l  it is quite impossible   all was now sadness at the cleeve it was soon understood among the servants that there was to be no marriage and the tidings spread from the house out among the neighbours and into hamworth but no one knew the reason of this changenone except those three the woman herself who had committed the crime and the two to whom she had told it on that same night the night of the day on which the tale had been told lady mason wrote a linealmost a single line to her son      dearest lucius     all is over between me and sir peregrine it is better    that it should be so i write to tell you this without    losing an hour for the present i remain here with my    deardearest friends     your own affectionate mother     m mason   this note she had written in obedience to the behests of mrs orme and even under her dictationwith the exception of one or two words i remain here with my friends mrs orme had said but lady mason had put in the two epithets and had then declared her own conviction that she had now no right to use such language  yes of me you may certainly said mrs orme keeping close to her shoulder  then i will alter it said lady mason i will write it again and say i am staying with you  but this mrs orme had forbidden no it will be better so she said sir peregrine would wish it i am sure he would he quite agrees that mrs orme did not finish her sentence but the letter was despatched written as above the answer which lucius sent down before breakfast the next morning was still shorter      dearest mother     i am greatly rejoiced that it is so     your affectionate son     l m   he sent this note but he did not go down to her nor was there any other immediate communication between them  all was now sadness at the cleeve peregrine knew that that marriage project was over and he knew also that his grandfather and lady mason did not now meet each other but he knew nothing of the cause though he could not but remark that he did not see her on that day she did not come down either to dinner or during the evening nor was she seen on the following morning he peregrine felt aware that something had occurred at that interview in the library after breakfast but was lost in surmising what that something had been that lady mason should have told his grandfather that the marriage must be given up would have been only in accordance with the promise made by her to him but he did not think that that alone would have occasioned such utter sadness such deathlike silence in the household had there been a quarrel lady mason would have gone homebut she did not go home had the match been broken off without a quarrel why should she mysteriously banish herself to two rooms so that no one but his mother should see her  and he too had his own peculiar sorrow on that morning sir peregrine had asked him to ride through the grounds and it had been the baronets intention to propose during that ride that he should go over to noningsby and speak to the judge about madeline we all know how that proposition had been frustrated and now peregrine thinking over the matter saw that his grandfather was not in a position at the present moment to engage himself ardently in any such work by whatever means or whatever words he had been induced to agree to the abandonment of that marriage engagement that abandonment weighed very heavily on his spirits it was plain to see that he was a broken man broken in heart and in spirit he shut himself up alone in his library all that afternoon and had hardly a word to say when he came out to dinner in the evening he was very pale too and slow and weak in his step he tried to smile as he came up to his daughterinlaw in the drawingroom but his smile was the saddest thing of all and then peregrine could see that he ate nothing he was very gentle in his demeanour to the servants very courteous and attentive to mrs orme very kind to his grandson but yet his mind was heavybrooding over some sorrow that oppressed it on the following morning it was the same and the grandson knew that he could look to his grandfather for no assistance at noningsby  immediately after breakfast peregrine got on his horse without speaking to any one of his intentionalmost without having formed an intention and rode off in the direction of alston he did not take the road but went out through the cleeve woods on to the common by which had he turned to the left he might have gone to orley farm but when on the top of the rise from crutchley bottom he turned to the right and putting his horse into a gallop rode along the open ground till he came to an enclosure into which he leaped from thence he made his way through a farm gate into a green country lane along which he still pressed his horse till he found himself divided from the end of a large wood by but one field he knew the ground well and the direction in which he was going he could pass through that wood and then down by an old farmhouse at the other end of it and so on to the alston road within a mile of noningsby he knew the ground well for he had ridden over every field of it when a man does so after thirty he forgets the spots which he passes in his hurry but when he does so before twenty he never forgets that field and that wood peregrine orme would never forget there was the double ditch and bank over which harriet tristram had ridden with so much skill and courage there was the spot on which he had knelt so long while felix graham lay back against him feeble and almost speechless and there on the other side had sat madeline on her horse pale with anxiety but yet eager with hope as she asked question after question as to him who had been hurt  peregrine rode up to the ditch and made his horse stand while he looked at it it was there then on that spot that he had felt the first pang of jealousy the idea had occurred to him that he for whom he had been doing a friends offices with such zealous kindness was his worst enemy had hehe peregrine ormebroken his arms and legs or even broken his neck would she have ridden up all thoughtless of herself and thrown her very life into her voice as she had done when she knew that felix graham had fallen from his horse and then he had gone on with his work aiding the hurt man as zealously as before but still feeling that he was bound to hate him and afterwards at noningsby he had continued to minister to him as to his friendzealously doing a friends offices but still feeling that the man was his enemy not that he was insincere there was no place for insincerity or treachery within his heart the man had done no illwas a good fellowwas entitled to his kindness by all the social laws which he knew they two had gone together from the same table to the same spot and had been close together when the one had come to sorrow it was his duty to act as grahams friend and yet how could he not feel that he must hate him  and now he sat looking at the fence wishingwishingno certainly not wishing that grahams hurt had been more serious but wishing that in falling from his horse he might utterly have fallen out of favour with that sweet young female heart or rather wishing could he so have expressed it that he himself might have had the fall and the broken bones and all the dangerso that he might also have had the interest which those eyes and that voice had shown  and then quickly he turned his horse and without giving the beast time to steady himself he rammed him at the fence the leap out of the wood into the field was difficult but that back into the wood was still worse the upjump was higher and the ditch which must be first cleared was broader nor did he take it at the easiest part as he had done on that day when he rode his own horse and then grahams back into the wood but he pressed his animal exactly at the spot from which his rival had fallen there were still the marks of the beasts struggle as he endeavoured to save himself before he came down head foremost into the ditch the bank had been somewhat narrowed and pared away and it was clearly the last place in the face of the whole opening into the wood which a rider with his senses about him would have selected for his jump  the horse knowing his masters humour and knowing alsowhich is so vitally importantthe nature of his masters courage jumped at the bank without pausing as i have said no time had been given him to steady himselfnot a moment to see where his feet should go to understand and make the most of the ground that he was to use he jumped and jumped well but only half gained the top of the bank the poor brute urged beyond his power could not get his hind feet up so near the surface as to give him a fulcrum for a second spring for a moment he strove to make good his footing still clinging with his fore feet and then slowly came down backwards into the ditch then regained his feet and dragging himself with an effort from the mud made his way back into the field peregrine orme had kept his seat throughout his legs were accustomed to the saddle and knew how to cling to it while there was a hope that he might struggle through and now that he was again in the field he wheeled his horse to a greater distance striking him with his whip and once more pushed him at the fence the gallant beast went at it bravely slightly swerving from the fatal spot to which peregrine had endeavoured once more to guide him leaped with a full spring from the unworn turf and barely touching the bank landed himself and his master lightly within the precincts of the wood  ahh said peregrine shouting angrily at the horse as though the brute had done badly instead of well and then he rode down slowly through the wood and out by monkton grange farm round the moat and down the avenue and before long he was standing at noningsby gate  he had not made up his mind to any plan of action nor indeed had he determined that he would ask to see any of the family or even enter the place the woman at the lodge opened the gate and he rode in mechanically asking if any of them were at home the judge and mr augustus were gone up to london but my lady and the other ladies were in the house mr graham had not gone the woman said in answer to his question nor did she know when he was going and then armed with this information peregrine orme rode round to the stables and gave up his horse to a groom  yes lady staveley was at home the servant said at the door would mr orme walk into the drawingroom where he would find the young ladies but mr orme would not do this he would go into a small bookroom with which he was well acquainted and have his name taken up to lady staveley he did not he said mean to stay very long but particularly wished to see lady staveley in a few minutes lady staveley came to him radiant with her sweetest smile and with both her hands held out to greet him  my dear mr orme she said i am delighted to see you but what made you run away from us so suddenly she had considered her words in that moment as she came across the hall and had thought that in this way she might best enable him to speak  lady staveley he said i have come here on purpose to tell you has your daughter told you anything  whomadeline  yes madeline i mean miss staveley has she said anything to you about me  well yes she has will you not sit down mr orme and then we shall be more comfortable hitherto he had stood up and had blurted out his words with a sudden determined and almost ferocious airas though he were going to demand the girls hand and challenge all the household if it were refused him but lady staveley understood his manner and his nature and liked him almost the better for his abruptness  she has spoken to me mr orme she has told me of what passed between you on the last day that you were with us  and yet you are surprised that i should have gone i wonder at that lady staveley you must have known  well perhaps i did know but sit down mr orme i wont let you get up in that restless way if we are to talk together tell me frankly what is it you think that i can do for you  i dont suppose you can do anythingbut i thought i would come over and speak to you i dont suppose ive any chance he had seated himself far back on a sofa and was holding his hat between his knees with his eyes fixed on the ground but as he spoke the last words he looked round into her face with an anxious inquiring glance which went direct to her heart  what can i say mr orme  ah no of course nothing goodbye lady staveley i might as well go i know that i was a fool for coming here i knew it as i was coming indeed i hardly meant to come in when i found myself at the gate  but you must not go from us like that  i must though do you think that i could go in and see her if i did i should make such a fool of myself that i could never again hold up my head and i am a fool i ought to have known that a fellow like me could have no chance with her i could knock my own head off if i only knew how for having made such an ass of myself  no one here thinks so of you mr orme  no one here thinks what  that it wasunreasonable in you to propose to madeline we all know that you did her much honour  psha said he turning away from her  ah but you must listen to me that is what we all thinkmadeline herself and i and her father no one who knows you could think otherwise we all like you and know how good and excellent you are and as to worldly station of course you stand above her  psha he said again angrily how could any one presume to talk of the worldly station of his goddess for just then madeline staveley to him was a goddess  that is what we think indeed mr orme as for myself had my girl come to me telling me that you had proposed to her and telling me also thatthatthat she felt that she might probably like you i should have been very happy to hear it and lady staveley as she spoke put out her hand to him  but what did she say asked peregrine altogether disregarding the hand  ah she did not say that she told me that she had declined the honour that you had offered herthat she did not regard you as she must regard the man to whom she would pledge her heart  but did she say that she could never love me and now as he asked the question he stood up again looking down with all his eyes into lady staveleys facethat face which would have been so friendly to him so kind and so encouraging had it been possible  never is a long word mr orme  ah but did she say it come lady staveley i know i have been a fool but i am not a cowardly fool if it be soif i have no hope tell me at once that i may go away in that case i shall be better anywhere out of the county  i cannot say that you should have no hope  you think then that there is a chance and for a moment he looked as though all his troubles were nearly over  if you are so impetuous mr orme i cannot speak to you if you will sit down for a minute or two i will tell you exactly what i think about it and then he sat down trying to look as though he were not impetuous i should be deceiving you if i were not to tell you that she speaks of the matter as though it were all overas though her answer to you was a final one  ah i knew it was so  but then mr orme many young ladies who have been at the first moment quite as sure of their decision have married the gentlemen whom they refused and have learned to love them with all their hearts  but she isnt like other girls said peregrine  i believe she is a great deal better than many but nevertheless she may be like others in that respect i do not say that it will be so mr orme i would not on any account give you hopes which i believed to be false but if you are anxious in the matter  i am as anxious about it as i am about my soul  oh fie mr orme you should not speak in that way but if you are anxious i would advise you to wait  and see her become the wife of some one else  listen to me mr orme madeline is very young and so indeed are you tooalmost too young to marry as yet even if my girl were willing that it should be so but we all like you very much and as you both are so very young i think that you might wait with patiencesay for a year then come to noningsby again and try your fortune once more that is my advice  will you tell me one thing lady staveley  what is that mr orme  does she care for any one else  lady staveley was prepared to do anything she could for her young friend except to answer that question she did believe that madeline cared for somebody elsecared very much but she did not think that any way would be opened by which that caring would be made manifest and she thought also that if wholly ungratified by any word of intercourse that feeling would die away could she have told everything to peregrine orme she would have explained to him that his best chance lay in that liking for felix graham or rather that as his rejection had been caused by that liking his chance would be good again when that liking should have perished from starvation but all this lady staveley could not explain to him nor would it have been satisfactory to her feelings had it been in her power to do so still there remained the question does she care for any one else  mr orme she said i will do all for you that a mother can do or ought to do but i must not admit that you have a right to ask such a question as that if i were to answer that now you would feel yourself justified in asking it again when perhaps it might not be so easy to answer  i beg your pardon lady staveley and peregrine blushed up to his eyes i did not intend  no do not beg my pardon seeing that you have given me no offence as i said just now all that a mother can and ought to do i will do for you i am very frank and tell you that i should be rejoiced to have you for my soninlaw  im sure im very much obliged to you  but neither by me nor by her father will any constraint ever be put on the inclinations of our child at any rate as to whom she will not accept she will always be allowed to judge for herself i have told you that to us you would be acceptable as a suitor and after that i think it will be best to leave the matter for the present without any further words let it be understood that you will spend next christmas at noningsby and then you will both be older and perhaps know your own minds better  thats a year you know  a year is not so very longat your time of life by which latter remark lady staveley did not show her knowledge of human nature  and i suppose i had better go now said peregrine sheepishly  if you like to go into the drawingroom im sure they will all be very glad to see you  but peregrine declared that he would not do this on any account you do not know lady staveley what a fool i should make myself it would be all over with me then  you should be more moderate in your feelings mr orme  its all very well saying that but you wouldnt be moderate if noningsby were on fire or if you thought the judge was going to die  good gracious mr orme  its the same sort of thing to me i can tell you a man cant be moderate when he feels that he should like to break his own neck i declare i almost tried to do it today  oh mr orme  well i did but dont suppose i say that as a sort of threat im safe enough to live for the next sixty years its only the happy people and those that are some good in the world that die goodbye lady staveley ill come back next christmasthat is if it isnt all settled before then but i know it will be no good then he got on his horse and rode very slowly home along the high road to the cleeve  lady staveley did not go in among the other ladies till luncheon was announced and when she did so she said no word about her visitor nevertheless it was known by them all that peregrine orme had been there ah thats mr ormes roancoloured horse sophia furnival had said getting up and thrusting her face close to the drawingroom window it was barely possible to see a portion of the road from the drawingroom but sophias eyes had been sharp enough to see that portion  a groom has probably come over with a note said mrs arbuthnot  very likely said sophia but they all knew from her voice that the rider was no groom and that she did not intend it to be thought that he was a groom madeline said not a word and kept her countenance marvellously but she knew well enough that peregrine had been with her mother and guessed also why he had been there  madeline had asked herself some serious questions and had answered them also since that conversation which she had had with her father he had assured her that he desired only her happiness and though in so saying he had spoken nothing of marriage she had well understood that he had referred to her future happinessat that time when by her own choice she should be leaving her fathers house and now she asked herself boldly in what way might that happiness be best secured hitherto she had refrained from any such home questions latterly within the last week or two ideas of what love meant had forced themselves upon her mind how could it have been otherwise but she had never dared to tell herself either that she did love or that she did not mr orme had come to her with his offer plainly asking her for the gift of her heart and she had immediately been aware that any such gift on her part was impossibleany such gift in his favour she had known without a moments thought that there was no room for hesitation had he asked her to take wings and fly away with him over the woods the feat would not have been to her more impossible than that of loving him as his wife yet she liked himliked him much in these latter days because he had been so good to felix graham when she felt that she liked him as she refused him she felt also that it was for this reason that she liked him on the day of grahams accident she had thought nothing of himhad hardly spoken to him but now she loved himwith a sort of love because he had been so good to graham though in her heart she knew all this she asked herself no questions till her father had spoken to her of her future happiness  then as she wandered about the house alonefor she still went on wanderingshe did ask herself a question or two what was it that had changed her thus and made her gay quick step so slow what had altered the happy silver tone of her voice what had created that load within her which seemed to weigh her down during every hour of the day she knew that there had been a change that she was not as she had been and now she asked herself the question not on the first asking nor on the second did the answer come not perhaps on the twentieth but the answer did come at last and she told herself that her heart was no longer her own she knew and acknowledged to herself that felix graham was its master and owner  and then came the second question under those circumstances what had she better do her mother had told herand the words had fallen deep into her earsthat it would be a great misfortune if she loved any man before she had reason to know that that man loved her she had no such knowledge as regarded felix graham a suspicion that it might be so she did feela suspicion which would grow into a hope let her struggle against it as she might baker that injudicious baker had dropped in her hearing a word or two which assisted this suspicion and then the open frank question put to her by her father when he demanded whether graham had addressed her as a lover had tended towards the same result what had she better do of one thing she now felt perfectly certain let the world go as it might in other respects she could never leave her fathers house as a bride unless the bridegroom were felix graham a marriage with him might probably be impracticable but any other marriage would be absolutely impossible if her father or her mother told her not to think of felix graham as a matter of course she would obey them but not even in obedience to father or mother could she say that she loved any one else  and now all these matters having been considered what should she do her father had invited her to tell everything to him and she was possessed by a feeling that in this matter she might possibly find more indulgence with her father than with her mother but yet it was more natural that her mother should be her confidante and adviser she could speak to her mother also with a better courage even though she felt less certain of sympathy peregrine orme had now been there again and had been closeted with lady staveley on that ground she would speak and having so resolved she lost no time in carrying out her purpose  mamma mr orme was here today was he not  yes my love lady staveley was sorry rather than otherwise that her daughter had asked her but would have been puzzled to explain why such should have been the case  i thought so said madeline  he rode over and told me among other things that the match between his grandfather and lady mason is at an end i was very glad to hear it for i thought that sir peregrine was going to do a very foolish thing and then there were a few further remarks on that subject made probably by lady staveley with some undefined intention of inducing her daughter to think that peregrine orme had come over chiefly on that matter  but mamma  well my love  did he say anything aboutabout what he was speaking to me about  well madeline he did he did say something on that subject but i had not intended to tell you unless you had asked  i hope mamma he understands that what he wants can never happenthat is if he does want it now  he does want it certainly my dear  then i hope you told him that it can never be i hope you did mamma  but why should you be so certain about it my love he does not intend to trouble you with his suitnor do i why not leave that to time there can be no reason why you should not see him again on a friendly footing when this embarrassment between you shall have passed away  there would be no reason mamma if he were quite sure that there could never be any other footing  never is a very long word  illustration never is a very long word  but it is the only true word mamma it would be wrong in you it would indeed if you were to tell him to come again i like mr orme very much as a friend and i should be very glad to know himthat is if he chose to know me and madeline as she made this little proviso was thinking what her own worldly position might be as the wife of felix graham but as it is quite impossible that he and i should ever be anything else to each other he should not be asked to come here with any other intention  but madeline i do not see that it is so impossible  mamma it is impossible quite impossible to this assertion lady staveley made no answer in words but there was that in her countenance which made her daughter understand that she did not quite agree in this assertion or understand this impossibility  mamma it is quite quite impossible madeline repeated  but why so said lady staveley frightened by her daughters manner and almost fearing that something further was to come which had by far better be left unsaid  because mamma i have no love to give him oh mamma do not be angry with me do not push me away you know who it is that i love you knew it before and then she threw herself on her knees and hid her face on her mothers lap  lady staveley had known it but up to that moment she had hoped that that knowledge might have remained hidden as though it were unknown     chapter li  mrs furnivals journey to hamworth   when peregrine got back to the cleeve he learned that there was a lady with his mother he had by this time partially succeeded in reasoning himself out of his despondency he had learned at any rate that his proposition to marry into the staveley family had been regarded with favour by all that family except the one whose views on that subject were by far the most important to him and he had learned as he thought that lady staveley had no suspicion that her daughters heart was preoccupied but in this respect lady staveley had been too cunning for him wait he said to himself as he went slowly along the road its all very well to say wait but there are some things which wont bear waiting for a man who waits never gets well away with the hounds nevertheless as he rode into the courtyard his hopes were somewhat higher than they had been when he rode out of it  a lady what lady you dont mean lady mason  no the servant did not mean lady mason it was an elderly stout lady who had come in a fly and the elderly stout lady was now in the drawingroom with his mother lady mason was still up stairs we all know who was that elderly stout lady and we must now go back and say a few words as to her journey from orange street to hamworth  on the preceding evening mrs furnival had told martha biggs what was her intention or perhaps it would be more just to say that martha biggs had worked it out of her now that mrs furnival had left the fashionable neighbourhood of cavendish square and located herself in that eastern homely district to which miss biggs had been so long accustomed miss biggs had been almost tyrannical it was not that she was less attentive to her friend or less willing to slave for her with a view to any possible or impossible result but the friend of mrs furnivals bosom could not help feeling her opportunity mrs furnival had now thrown herself very much upon her friend and of course the friend now expected unlimited privilegesas is always the case with friends in such a position it is very well to have friends to lean upon but it is not always well to lean upon ones friends  i will be with you before you start in the morning said martha  it will not be at all necessary said mrs furnival  oh but i shall indeed and kitty i should think nothing of going with you if you would wish it indeed i think you should have a female friend alongside of you in such a trouble you have only to say the word and ill go in a minute  mrs furnival however did not say the word and miss biggs was obliged to deny herself the pleasure of the journey but true to her word she came in the morning in ample time to catch mrs furnival before she started and for half an hour poured out sweet counsel into her friends ear if ones friends would as a rule refrain from action how much more strongly would real friendship flourish in the world  now kitty i do trust you will persist in seeing her  thats why im going there  yes but she might put you off it if youre not firm of course shell deny herself if you send in your name first what i should do would be thisto ask to be shown in to her and then follow the servant when the happiness of a life is at stakethe happinesses of two lives i may say and perhaps the immortal welfare of one of them in another worldone must not stand too much upon etiquette you would never forgive yourself if you did your object is to save him and to shame her out of her vile conduct to shame her and frighten her out of it if that be possible follow the servant in and dont give them a moment to think thats my advice  in answer to all this mrs furnival did not say much and what little she did say was neither in the affirmative nor in the negative martha knew that she was being ill treated but not on that account did she relax her friendly efforts the time would soon come if all things went well when mrs furnival would be driven by the loneliness of her position to open her heart in a truly loving and confidential manner miss biggs hoped sincerely that her friend and her friends husband might be brought together againperhaps by her own efforts but she did not anticipateor perhaps desire any speedy termination of the present arrangements it would be well that mr furnival should be punished by a separation of some months then when he had learned to know what it was to have a home without a presiding genius he might if duly penitent and open in his confession be forgiven that was miss biggss programme and she thought it probable that mrs furnival might want a good deal of consolation before that day of open confession arrived  i shall go with you as far as the station kitty she said in a very decided voice  it will not be at all necessary mrs furnival replied  oh but i shall you must want support at such a moment as this and as far as i can give it you shall have it  but it wont be any support to have you in the cab with me if you will believe me i had rather go alone it is so necessary that i should think about all this  but martha would not believe her and as for thinking she was quite ready to take that part of the work herself dont say another word she said as she thrust herself in at the cabdoor after her friend mrs furnival hardly did say another word but martha biggs said many she knew that mrs furnival was cross ill pleased and not disposed to confidence but what of that her duty as a friend was not altered by mrs furnivals ill humour she would persevere and having in her hands so great an opportunity did not despair but what the time might come when both mr and mrs furnival would with united voices hail her as their preserver poor martha biggs she did not mean amiss but she was troublesome  it was very necessary that mrs furnival should think over the step which she was taking what was it that she intended to do when she arrived at hamworth that plan of forcing her way into lady masons house did not recommend itself to her the more in that it was recommended by martha biggs i suppose you will come up to us this evening martha said when she left her friend in the railway carriage not this evening i think i shall be so tired mrs furnival had replied then i shall come down to you said martha almost holloaing after her friend as the train started mr furnival would not have been displeased had he known the state of his wifes mind at that moment towards her late visitor during the whole of her journey down to hamworth she tried to think what she would say to lady mason but instead of so thinking her mind would revert to the unpleasantness of miss biggss friendship  when she left the train at the hamworth station she was solicited by the driver of a public vehicle to use his fly and having ascertained from the man that he well knew the position of orley farm she got into the carriage and had herself driven to the residence of her hated rival she had often heard of orley farm but she had never as yet seen it and now felt considerable anxiety both as regards the house and its occupant  this is orley farm maam said the man stopping at the gate shall i drive up  but at this moment the gate was opened by a decent respectable womanmrs furnival would not quite have called her a ladywho looked hard at the fly as it turned on to the private road  perhaps this lady could tell me said mrs furnival putting out her hand is this where lady mason lives  the woman was mrs dockwrath on that day samuel dockwrath had gone to london but before starting he had made known to his wife with fiendish glee that it had been at last decided by all the persons concerned that lady mason should be charged with perjury and tried for that offence  you dont mean to say that the judges have said so asked poor miriam  i do mean to say that all the judges in england could not save her from having to stand her trial and it is my belief that all the lawyers in the land cannot save her from conviction i wonder whether she ever thinks now of those fields which she took away from me  then when her masters back was turned she put on her bonnet and walked up to orley farm she knew well that lady mason was at the cleeve and believed that she was about to become the wife of sir peregrine but she knew also that lucius was at home and it might be well to let him know what was going on she had just seen lucius mason when she was met by mrs furnivals fly she had seen lucius mason and the angry manner in which he declared that he could in no way interfere in his mothers affairs had frightened her but mr lucius she had said she ought to be doing something you know there is no believing how bitter samuel is about it  he may be as bitter as he likes mrs dockwrath young mason had answered with considerable dignity in his manner it will not in the least affect my mothers interests in the present instance however i am not her adviser whereupon mrs dockwrath had retired and as she was afraid to go to lady mason at the cleeve she was about to return home when she opened the gate for mrs furnival she then explained that lady mason was not at home and had not been at home for some weeks that she was staying with her friends at the cleeve and that in order to get there mrs furnival must go back through hamworth and round by the high road  i knows the way well enough mrs dockwrath said the driver ive been at the cleeve before now i guess  so mrs furnival was driven back to hamworth and on going over that piece of ground she resolved that she would follow lady mason to the cleeve why should she be afraid of sir peregrine orme or of all the ormes why should she fear any one while engaged in the performance of so sacred a duty i must confess that in truth she was very much afraid but nevertheless she had herself taken on to the cleeve when she arrived at the door she asked of course for lady mason but did not feel at all inclined to follow the servant uninvited into the house as recommended by miss biggs lady mason the man said was not very well and after a certain amount of parley at the door the matter ended in her being shown into the drawingroom where she was soon joined by mrs orme  i am mrs furnival she began and then mrs orme begged her to sit down i have come here to see lady masonon some businesssome business not of a very pleasant nature im sure i dont know how to trouble you with it and yet and then even mrs orme could see that her visitor was somewhat confused  is it about the trial asked mrs orme  then there is really a lawsuit going on  a lawsuit said mrs orme rather puzzled  you said something about a trial now mrs orme pray do not deceive me im a very unhappy woman i am indeed  deceive you why should i deceive you  no indeed why should you and now i look at you i do not think you will  indeed i will not mrs furnival  and there is really a lawsuit then mrs furnival persisted in asking  i thought you would know all about it said mrs orme as mr furnival manages lady masons law business i thought that perhaps it was about that that you had come  then mrs furnival explained that she knew nothing whatever about lady masons affairs that hitherto she had not believed that there was any trial or any lawsuit and gradually explained the cause of all her trouble she did not do this without sundry interruptions caused both by her own feelings and by mrs ormes exclamations but at last it all came forth and before she had done she was calling her husband tom and appealing to her listener for sympathy  but indeed its a mistake mrs furnival it is indeed there are reasons which make me quite sure of it so spoke mrs orme how could lady mason have been in love with mr furnivalif such a state of things could be possible under any circumstancesseeing that she had been engaged to marry sir peregrine mrs orme did not declare her reasons but repeated with very positive assurances her knowledge that mrs furnival was labouring under some very grievous error  but why should she always be at his chambers i have seen her there twice mrs orme i have indeedwith my own eyes  mrs orme would have thought nothing of it if lady mason had been seen there every day for a week together and regarded mrs furnivals suspicions as an hallucination bordering on insanity a woman be in love with mr furnival a very pretty woman endeavour to entice away from his wife the affection of such a man as that as these ideas passed through mrs ormes mind she did not perhaps remember that sir peregrine who was more than ten years mr furnivals senior had been engaged to marry the same lady but then she herself loved sir peregrine dearly and she had no such feeling with reference to mr furnival she however did what was most within her power to do to allay the suffering under which her visitor laboured and explained to her the position in which lady mason was placed i do not think she can see you she ended by saying for she is in very great trouble  to be tried for perjury said mrs furnival out of whose heart all hatred towards lady mason was quickly departing had she heard that she was to be tried for murderthat she had been convicted for murderit would have altogether softened her heart towards her supposed enemy she could forgive her any offence but the one  yes indeed said mrs orme wiping a tear away from her eye as she thought of all the troubles present and to come it is the saddest thing poor lady it would almost break your heart if you were to see her since first she heard of this which was before christmas she has not had one quiet moment  poor creature said mrs furnival  ah you would say so if you knew all she has had to depend a great deal upon mr furnival for advice and without that i dont know what she would do this mrs orme said not wishing to revert to the charge against lady mason which had brought mrs furnival down to hamworth but still desirous of emancipating her poor friend completely from that charge and sir peregrine also is very kind to hervery this she added feeling that up to that moment mrs furnival could have heard nothing of the intended marriage but thinking it probable that she must do so before long indeed anybody would be kind to her who saw her in her suffering i am sure you would mrs furnival  dear dear said mrs furnival who was beginning to entertain almost a kindly feeling towards mrs orme  it is such a dreadful position for a lady sometimes i think that her mind will fail her before the day comes  but what a very wicked man that other mr mason must be said mrs furnival  that was a view of the matter on which mrs orme could not say much she disliked that mr mason as much as she could dislike a man whom she had never seen but it was not open to her now to say that he was very wicked in this matter i suppose he thinks the property ought to belong to him she answered  that was settled years ago said mrs furnival horrid cruel man but after all i dont see why she should mind it so much  oh mrs furnivalto stand in a court and be tried  but if one is innocent for my part if i knew myself innocent i could brave them all it is the feeling that one is wrong that cows one and mrs furnival thought of the little confession which she would be called upon to make at home  and then feeling some difficulty as to her last words in such an interview mrs furnival got up to go perhaps mrs orme she said i have been foolish in this  you have been mistaken mrs furnival i am sure of that  i begin to think i have but mrs orme will you let me ask you a favour perhaps you will not say anything about my coming here i have been very unhappy i have indeed and mrs furnivals handkerchief was now up at her eyes and mrs ormes heart was again full of pity of course she gave the required promise and looking to the character of the woman we may say that of course she kept it  mrs furnival what was she here about peregrine asked of his mother  i would rather not tell you perry said his mother kissing him and then there were no more words spoken on the subject  mrs furnival as she made her journey back to london began to dislike martha biggs more and more and most unjustly attributed to that lady in her thoughts the folly of this journey to hamworth the journey to hamworth had been her own doing and had the idea originated with miss biggs the journey would never have been made as it was while she was yet in the train she came to the strong resolution of returning direct from the london station to her own house in harley street it would be best to cut the knot at once and thus by a bold stroke of the knife rid herself of the orange street rooms and miss biggs at the same time she did drive to harley street and on her arrival at her own door was informed by the astonished spooner that master was at homeall alone in the diningroom he was going to dine at home and seemed very lonely like there as she stood in the hall there was nothing but the door between her and her husband and she conceived that the sound of her arrival must have been heard by him for a moment her courage was weak and she thought of hurrying up stairs had she done so her trouble would still have been all before her some idea of this came upon her mind and after a moments pause she opened the diningroom door and found herself in her husbands presence he was sitting over the fire in his armchair very gloomily and had not heard the arrival he too had some tenderness left in his heart and this going away of his wife had distressed him  tom she said going up to him and speaking in a low voice i have come back again and she stood before him as a suppliant  illustration tom she said i have come back     chapter lii  showing how things went on at noningsby   yes lady staveley had known it before she had given a fairly correct guess at the state of her daughters affections though she had not perhaps acknowledged to herself the intensity of her daughters feelings but the fact might not have mattered if it had never been told madeline might have overcome this love for mr graham and all might have been well if she had never mentioned it but now the mischief was done she had acknowledged to her motherand which was perhaps worse she had acknowledged to herselfthat her heart was gone and lady staveley saw no cure for the evil had this happened but a few hours earlier she would have spoken with much less of encouragement to peregrine orme  and felix graham was not only in the house but was to remain there for yet a while longer spending a very considerable portion of his time in the drawingroom he was to come down on this very day at three oclock after an early dinner and on the next day he was to be promoted to the diningroom as a soninlaw he was quite ineligible he had as lady staveley understood no private fortune and he belonged to a profession which he would not follow in the only way by which it was possible to earn an income by it such being the case her daughter whom of all girls she knew to be the most retiring the least likely to speak of such feelings unless driven to it by great stressher daughter had positively declared to her that she was in love with this man could anything be more hopeless could any position be more trying  oh dear oh dear oh dear she said almost wringing her hands in her vexationno my darling i am not angry and she kissed her child and smoothed her hair i am not angry but i must say i think it very unfortunate he has not a shilling in the world  i will do nothing that you and papa do not approve said madeline holding down her head  and then you know he doesnt think of such a thing himselfof course he does not indeed i dont think hes a marrying man at all  oh mamma do not talk in that wayas if i expected anything i could not but tell you the truth when you spoke of mr orme as you did  poor mr orme he is such an excellent young man  i dont suppose hes better than mr graham mamma if you speak of goodness  im sure i dont know said lady staveley very much put beside herself i wish there were no such things as young men at all theres augustus making a fool of himself and she walked twice the length of the room in an agony of maternal anxiety peregrine orme had suggested to her what she would feel if noningsby were on fire but could any such fire be worse than these pernicious love flames he had also suggested another calamity and as lady staveley remembered that she acknowledged to herself that the fates were not so cruel to her as they might have been so she kissed her daughter again assured her that she was by no means angry with her and then they parted  this trouble had now come to such a head that no course was any longer open to poor lady staveley but that one which she had adopted in all the troubles of her married life she would tell the judge everything and throw all the responsibility upon his back let him decide whether a cold shoulder or a paternal blessing should be administered to the ugly young man up stairs who had tumbled off his horse the first day he went out hunting and who would not earn his bread as others did but thought himself cleverer than all the world the feelings in lady staveleys breast towards mr graham at this especial time were not of a kindly nature she could not make comparisons between him and peregrine orme without wondering at her daughters choice peregrine was fair and handsome one of the curled darlings of the nation bright of eye and smooth of skin goodnatured of a sweet disposition a young man to be loved by all the world andincidentallythe heir to a baronetcy and a good estate all his people were nice and he lived close in the neighbourhood had lady staveley been set to choose a husband for her daughter she could have chosen none better and then she counted up felix graham his eyes no doubt were bright enough but taken altogether he wasat least so she said to herselfhideously ugly he was by no means a curled darling and then he was masterful in mind and not soft and pleasant as was young orme he was heir to nothing and as to people of his own he had none in particular who could say where he must live as likely as not in patagonia having been forced to accept a judgeship in that new colony for the sake of bread but her daughter should not go to patagonia with him if she could help it so when the judge came home that evening she told him all before she would allow him to dress for dinner  he certainly is not very handsome the judge said when lady staveley insisted somewhat strongly on that special feature of the case  i think he is the ugliest young man i know said her ladyship  he looks very well in his wig said the judge  wig madeline would not see him in a wig nor anybody else very often seeing the way he is going on about his profession what are we to do about it  well i should say do nothing  and let him propose to the dear girl if he chooses to take the fancy into his head  i dont see how we are to hinder him but i have that impression of mr graham that i do not think he will do anything unhandsome by us he has some singular ideas of his own about law and i grant you that he is plain  the plainest young man i ever saw said lady staveley  but if i know him he is a man of high character and much more than ordinary acquirement  i cannot understand madeline lady staveley went on not caring overmuch about felix grahams acquirements  well my dear i think the key to her choice is this that she has judged not with her eyes but with her ears or rather with her understanding had she accepted mr orme i as a father should of course have been well satisfied he is i have no doubt a fine young fellow and will make a good husband some day  oh excellent said her ladyship and the cleeve is only seven miles  but i must acknowledge that i cannot feel angry with madeline  angry no not angry who would be angry with the poor child  indeed i am somewhat proud of her it seems to me that she prefers mind to matter which is a great deal to say for a young lady  matter exclaimed lady staveley who could not but feel that the term as applied to such a young man as peregrine orme was very opprobrious  wit and intellect and power of expression have gone further with her than good looks and rank and worldly prosperity if that be so and i believe it is i cannot but love her the better for it  so do i love her as much as any mother can love her daughter  of course you do and the judge kissed his wife  and i like wit and genius and all that sort of thing  otherwise you would have not taken me my dear  you were the handsomest man of your day thats why i fell in love with you  the compliment is a very poor one said the judge  never mind that i like wit and genius too but wit and genius are none the better for being ugly and wit and genius should know how to butter their own bread before they think of taking a wife  you forget my dear that for aught we know wit and genius may be perfectly free from any such thought and then the judge made it understood that if he were left to himself he would dress for dinner  when the ladies left the parlour that evening they found graham in the drawingroom but there was no longer any necessity for embarrassment on madelines part at meeting him they had been in the room together on three or four occasions and therefore she could give him her hand and ask after his arm without feeling that every one was watching her but she hardly spoke to him beyond this nor indeed did she speak much to anybody the conversation till the gentlemen joined them was chiefly kept up by sophia furnival and mrs arbuthnot and even after that the evening did not pass very briskly  one little scene there was during which poor lady staveleys eyes were anxiously fixed upon her son though most of those in the room supposed that she was sleeping miss furnival was to return to london on the following day and it therefore behoved augustus to be very sad in truth he had been rather given to a melancholy humour during the last day or two had miss furnival accepted all his civil speeches making him answers equally civil the matter might very probably have passed by without giving special trouble to any one but she had not done this and therefore augustus staveley had fancied himself to be really in love with her what the ladys intentions were i will not pretend to say but if she was in truth desirous of becoming mrs staveley she certainly went about her business in a discreet and wise manner  so you leave us tomorrow immediately after breakfast said he having dressed his face with that romantic sobriety which he had been practising for the last three days  i am sorry to say that such is the fact said sophia  to tell you the truth i am not sorry said augustus and he turned away his face for a moment giving a long sigh  i dare say not mr staveley but you need not have said so to me said sophia pretending to take him literally at his word  because i cannot stand this kind of thing any longer i suppose i must not see you in the morningalone  well i suppose not if i can get down to prayers after having all my things packed up it will be as much as i can do  and if i begged for half an hour as a last kindness  i certainly should not grant it go and ask your mother whether such a request would be reasonable  psha  ah but its not psha halfhours between young ladies and young gentlemen before breakfast are very serious things  and i mean to be serious said augustus  but i dont said sophia  i am to understand then that under no possible circumstances  bless me mr staveley how solemn you are  there are occasions in a mans life when he is bound to be solemn you are going away from us miss furnival  one would think i was going to jeddo whereas i am going to harley street  and i may come and see you there  of course you may if you like it according to the usages of the world you would be reckoned very uncivil if you did not for myself i do not much care about such usages and therefore if you omit it i will forgive you  very well then i will say goodnightand goodbye these last words he uttered in a strain which should have melted her heart and as he took leave of her he squeezed her hand with an affection that was almost painful  it may be remarked that if augustus staveley was quite in earnest with sophia furnival he would have asked her that allimportant question in a straightforward manner as peregrine orme had asked it of madeline perhaps miss furnival was aware of this and being so aware considered that a serious halfhour before breakfast might not as yet be safe if he were really in love he would find his way to harley street on the whole i am inclined to think that miss furnival did understand her business  on the following morning miss furnival went her way without any further scenes of tenderness and lady staveley was thoroughly glad that she was gone a nasty sly thing she said to baker sly enough my lady said baker but our mr augustus will be one too many for her deary me to think of her having the imperance to think of him in all which miss furnival was i think somewhat ill used if young gentlemen such as augustus staveley are allowed to amuse themselves with young ladies surely young ladies such as miss furnival should be allowed to play their own cards accordingly  on that day early in the morning felix graham sought and obtained an interview with his host in the judges own study i have come about two things he said taking the easy chair to which he was invited  two or ten i shall be very happy said the judge cheerily  i will take business first said graham  and then pleasure will be the sweeter afterwards said the judge  i have been thinking a great deal about this case of lady masons and i have read all the papers old and new which mr furnival has sent me i cannot bring myself to suppose it possible that she can have been guilty of any fraud or deception  i believe her to be free from all guilt in the matteras i told you before but then of course you will take that as a private opinion not as one legally formed i have never gone into the matter as you have done  i confess that i do not like having dealings with mr chaffanbrass and mr aram  mr chaffanbrass and mr aram may not be so bad as you perhaps in ignorance suppose them to be does it not occur to you that we should be very badly off without such men as chaffanbrass and aram  so we should without chimneysweepers and scavengers  graham my dear fellow judge not that you be not judged i am older than you and have seen more of these men believe me that as you grow older and also see more of them your opinion will be more lenientand more just do not be angry with me for taking this liberty with you  my dear judge if you knew how i value ithow i should value any mark of such kindness that you can show me however i have decided that i will know something more of these gentlemen at once if i have your approbation i will let mr furnival know that i will undertake the case  the judge signified his approbation and thus the first of those two matters was soon settled between them  and now for the pleasure said the judge  i dont know much about pleasure said graham fidgeting in his chair rather uneasily im afraid there is not much pleasure for either of us or for anybody else in what im going to say  then there is so much more reason for having it said quickly unpleasant things should always be got over without delay  nothing on earth can exceed lady staveleys kindness to me and yours and that of the whole family since my unfortunate accident  dont think of it it has been nothing we like you but we should have done as much as that even if we had not  and now im going to tell you that i have fallen in love with your daughter madeline as the judge wished to have the tale told quickly i think he had reason to be satisfied with the very succinct terms used by felix graham  indeed said the judge  and that was the reason why i wished to go away at the earliest possible timeand still wish it  you are right there mr graham i must say you are right there under all the circumstances of the case i think you were right to wish to leave us  and therefore i shall go the first thing tomorrow morningin saying which last words poor felix could not refrain from showing a certain unevenness of temper and some disappointment  gently gently mr graham let us have a few more words before we accede to the necessity of anything so sudden have you spoken to madeline on this subject  not a word  and i may presume that you do not intend to do so  for a moment or so felix graham sat without speaking and then getting up from his chair he walked twice the length of the room upon my word judge i will not answer for myself if i remain here he said at last  a softerhearted man than judge staveley or one who could make himself more happy in making others happy never sat on the english bench was not this a gallant young fellow before himgallant and clever of good honest principles and a true manly heart was he not a gentleman by birth education and tastes what more should a man want for a soninlaw and then his daughter had had the wit to love this man so endowed it was almost on his tongue to tell graham that he might go and seek the girl and plead his own cause to her  but bread is bread and butchers bills are bills the man and the father and the successful possessor of some thousands a year was too strong at last for the softhearted philanthropist therefore having collected his thoughts he thus expressed himself upon the occasion  mr graham i think you have behaved very well in this matter and it is exactly what i should have expected from you the judge at the time knew nothing about mary snow as regards yourself personally i should be proud to own you as my soninlaw but i am of course bound to regard the welfare of my daughter your means i fear are but small  very small indeed said graham  and though you have all those gifts which should bring you on in your profession you have learned to entertain ideas which hitherto have barred you from success now i tell you what you shall do remain here two or three days longer till you are fit to travel and abstain from saying anything to my daughter come to me again in three months if you still hold the same mind and i will pledge myself to tell you then whether or no you have my leave to address my child as a suitor  felix graham silently took the judges hand feeling that a strong hope had been given to him and so the interview was ended     chapter liii  lady mason returns home   lady mason remained at the cleeve for something more than a week after that day on which she made her confession during which time she was fully committed to take her trial at the next assizes at alston on an indictment for perjury this was done in a manner that astonished even herself by the absence of all publicity or outward scandal the matter was arranged between mr matthew round and mr solomon aram and was so arranged in accordance with mr furnivals wishes mr furnival wrote to say that at such a time he would call at the cleeve with a postchaise this he did and took lady mason with him before two magistrates for the county who were sitting at doddinghurst a village five miles distant from sir peregrines house here by agreement they were met by lucius mason who was to act as one of the bailsmen for his mothers appearance at the trial sir peregrine was the other but it was brought about by amicable management between the lawyers that his appearance before the magistrates was not required there were also there the two attorneys bridget bolster the witness one torrington from london who brought with him the absolute deed executed on that 14th of july with reference to the then dissolved partnership of mason and martock and there was mr samuel dockwrath i must not forget to say that there was also a reporter for the press provided by the special care of the latternamed gentleman  illustration lady mason going before the magistrates  the arrival in the village of four different vehicles and the sight of such gentlemen as mr furnival mr round and mr aram of course aroused some excitement there but this feeling was kept down as much as possible and lady mason was very quickly allowed to return to the carriage mr dockwrath made one or two attempts to get up a scene and to rouse a feeling of public anger against the lady who was to be tried but the magistrates put him down they also seemed to be fully impressed with a sense of lady masons innocence in the teeth of the evidence which was given against her this was the general feeling on the minds of all peopleexcept of those who knew most about her there was an idea that affairs had so been managed by mr joseph mason and mr dockwrath that another trial was necessary but that the unfortunate victim of mr masons cupidity and mr dockwraths malice would be washed white as snow when the day of that trial came the chief performers on the present occasion were round and aram and a stranger to such proceedings would have said that they were acting in concert mr round pressed for the indictment and brought forward in a very short way the evidence of bolster and torrington mr aram said that his client was advised to reserve her defence and was prepared with bail to any amount mr round advised the magistrates that reasonable bail should be taken and then the matter was settled mr furnival sat on a chair close to the elder of those two gentlemen and whispered a word to him now and then lady mason was provided with an armchair close to mr furnivals right hand and close to her right hand stood her son her face was covered by a deep veil and she was not called upon during the whole proceeding to utter one audible word a single question was put to her by the presiding magistrate before the committal was signed and it was understood that some answer was made to it but this answer reached the ears of those in the room by means of mr furnivals voice  it was observed by most of those there that during the whole of the sitting lady mason held her sons hand but it was observed also that though lucius permitted this he did not seem to return the pressure he stood there during the entire proceedings without motion or speech looking very stern he signed the bailbond but even that he did without saying a word mr dockwrath demanded that lady mason should be kept in custody till the bond should also have been signed by sir peregrine but upon this mr round remarked that he believed mr joseph mason had intrusted to him the conduct of the case and the elder magistrate desired mr dockwrath to abstain from further interference all right said he to a person standing close to him but ill be too many for them yet as you will see when she is brought before a judge and jury and then lady mason stood committed to take her trial at the next alston assizes  when lucius had come forward to hand her from the postchaise in which she arrived lady mason had kissed him but this was all the intercourse that then passed between the mother and son mr furnival however informed him that his mother would return to orley farm on the next day but one  she thinks it better that she should be at home from this time to the day of the trial said mr furnival and on the whole sir peregrine is inclined to agree with her  i have thought so all through said lucius  but you are to understand that there is no disagreement between your mother and the family at the cleeve the idea of the marriage has as i think very properly been laid aside  of course it was proper that it should be laid aside  yes but i must beg you to understand that there has been no quarrel indeed you will i have no doubt perceive that as mrs orme has assured me that she will see your mother constantly till the time comes  she is very kind said lucius but it was evident from the tone of his voice that he would have preferred that all the ormes should have remained away in his mind this time of suffering to his mother and to him was a period of trial and probationa period if not of actual disgrace yet of disgrace before the world and he thought that it would have best become his mother to have abstained from all friendship out of her own family and even from all expressed sympathy till she had vindicated her own purity and innocence and as he thought of this he declared to himself that he would have sacrificed everything to her comfort and assistance if she would only have permitted it he would have loved her and been tender to her receiving on his own shoulders all those blows which now fell so hardly upon hers every word should have been a word of kindness every look should have been soft and full of affection he would have treated her not only with all the love which a son could show to a mother but with all the respect and sympathy which a gentleman could feel for a lady in distress but then in order that such a state of things as this should have existed it would have been necessary that she should have trusted him she should have leaned upon him andthough he did not exactly say so in talking over the matter with himself still he thought iton him and on him only but she had declined to lean upon him at all she had gone away to strangersshe who should hardly have spoken to a stranger during these sad months she would not have his care and under those circumstances he could only stand aloof hold up his head and look sternly as for her innocence that was a matter of course he knew that she was innocent he wanted no one to tell him that his own mother was not a thief a forger a castaway among the worlds worst wretches he thanked no one for such an assurance every honest man must sympathise with a woman so injured it would be a necessity of his manhood and of his honesty but he would have valued most a sympathy which would have abstained from all expression till after that trial should be over it should have been for him to act and for him to speak during this terrible period but his mother who was a free agent had willed it otherwise  and there had been one other scene mr furnival had introduced lady mason to mr solomon aram having explained to her that it would be indispensable that mr aram should see her probably once or twice before the trial came on  but cannot it be done through you said lady mason though of course i should not expect that you can so sacrifice your valuable time  pray believe me that that is not the consideration said mr furnival we have engaged the services of mr aram because he is supposed to understand difficulties of this sort better than any other man in the profession and his chance of rescuing you from this trouble will be much better if you can bring yourself to have confidence in himfull confidence and mr furnival looked into her face as he spoke with an expression of countenance that was very eloquent you must not suppose that i shall not do all in my power in my proper capacity i shall be acting for you with all the energy that i can use but the case has now assumed an aspect which requires that it should be in an attorneys hands and then mr furnival introduced her to mr solomon aram  mr solomon aram was not in outward appearance such a man as lady mason sir peregrine orme or others quite ignorant in such matters would have expected he was not a dirty old jew with a hooked nose and an imperfect pronunciation of english consonants mr chaffanbrass the barrister bore more resemblance to a jew of that ancient type mr solomon aram was a goodlooking man about forty perhaps rather overdressed but bearing about him no other sign of vulgarity nor at first sight would it probably have been discerned that he was of the hebrew persuasion he had black hair and a wellformed face but his eyes were closer than is common with most of us and his nose seemed to be somewhat swollen about the bridge when one knew that he was a jew one saw that he was a jew but in the absence of such previous knowledge he might have been taken for as good a christian as any other attorney  mr aram raised his hat and bowed as mr furnival performed the ceremony of introduction this was done while she was still seated in the carriage and as lucius was waiting at the door to hand her down into the house where the magistrates were sitting i am delighted to have the honour of making your acquaintance said mr aram  lady mason essayed to mutter some word but no word was audible nor was any necessary i have no doubt continued the attorney that we shall pull through this little difficulty without any ultimate damage whatsoever in the mean time it is of course disagreeable to a lady of your distinction and then he made another bow we are peculiarly happy in having such a tower of strength as mr furnival and then he bowed to the barrister  and my old friend mr chaffanbrass is another tower of strength eh mr furnival and so the introduction was over  lady mason had quite understood mr furnivalhad understood both his words and his face when he told her how indispensable it was that she should have full confidence in this attorney he had meant that she should tell him all she must bring herself to confess everything to this absolute stranger and thenfor the first timeshe felt sure that mr furnival had guessed her secret he also knew it but it would not suit him that any one should know that he knew it alas alas would it not be better that all the world should know it and that there might be an end had not her doom been told to her even if the paraphernalia of justicethe judge and the jury and the lawyers could be induced to declare her innocent before all men must she not confess her guilt to himto that onefor whose verdict alone she cared if he knew her to be guilty what matter who might think her innocent and she had been told that all must be declared to him that property was hisbut his only through her guilt and that property must be restored to its owner so much sir peregrine orme had declared to be indispensablesir peregrine orme who in other matters concerning this case was now dark enough in his judgment on that point however there need be no darkness though the heaven should fall on her devoted head that tardy justice must be done  when this piece of business had been completed at doddinghurst lady mason returned to the cleeve whither mr furnival accompanied her he had offered his seat in the postchaise to lucius but the young man had declared that he was unwilling to go to the cleeve and consequently there was no opportunity for conversation between lady mason and her son on her arrival she went at once to her room and there she continued to live as she had done for the last few days till the morning of her departure came to mrs orme she told all that had occurred as mr furnival did also to sir peregrine on that occasion sir peregrine said very little to the barrister merely bowing his head courteously as each different point was explained in intimation of his having heard and understood what was said to him mr furnival could not but see that his manner was entirely altered there was no enthusiasm now no violence of invective against that wretch at groby park no positive assurance that his guests innocence must come out at the trial bright as the day he showed no inclination to desert lady masons cause and indeed insisted on hearing the particulars of all that had been done but he said very little and those few words adverted to the terrible sadness of the subject he seemed too to be older than he had been and less firm in his gait that terrible sadness had already told greatly upon him those about him had observed that he had not once crossed the threshold of his hall door since the morning on which lady mason had taken to her own room  he has altered his mind said the lawyer to himself as he was driven back to the hamworth station he also now believes her to be guilty as to his own belief mr furnival held no argument within his own breast but we may say that he was no longer perplexed by much doubt upon the matter  and then the morning came for lady masons departure sir peregrine had not seen her since she had left him in the library after her confession although as may be remembered he had undertaken to do so but he had not then known how mrs orme might act when she heard the story as matters had turned out mrs orme had taken upon herself the care of their guest and all intercourse between lady mason and sir peregrine had passed through his daughterinlaw but now on this morning he declared that he would go to her up stairs in mrs ormes room and himself hand her down through the hall into the carriage against this lady mason had expostulated but in vain  it will be better so dear mrs orme had said it will teach the servants and people to think that he still respects and esteems you  but he does not said she speaking almost sharply how would it be possible ah merespect and esteem are gone from me for ever  no not for ever replied mrs orme you have much to bear but no evil lasts for ever  will not sin last for eversin such as mine  not if you repentrepent and make such restitution as is possible lady mason say that you have repented tell me that you have asked him to pardon you and then as had been so often the case during these last days lady mason sat silent with hard fixed eyes with her hands clasped and her lips compressed never as yet had mrs orme induced her to say that she had asked for pardon at the cost of telling her son that the property which he called his own had been procured for him by his mothers fraud that punishment and that only was too heavy for her neck to bear her acquittal in the law court would be as nothing to her if it must be followed by an avowal of her guilt to her own son  sir peregrine did come up stairs and handed her down through the hall as he had proposed when he came into the room she did not look at him but stood leaning against the table with her eyes fixed upon the ground  i hope you find yourself better he said as he put out his hand to her she did not even attempt to make a reply but allowed him just to touch her fingers  perhaps i had better not come down said mrs orme it will be easier to say goodbye here  goodbye said lady mason and her voice sounded in sir peregrines ears like a voice from the dead  god bless you and preserve you said mrs orme and restore you to your son god will bless you if you will ask him no you shall not go without a kiss and she put out her arms that lady mason might come to her  the poor broken wretch stood for a moment as though trying to determine what she would do and then almost with a shriek she threw herself on to the bosom of the other woman and burst into a flood of tears she had intended to abstain from that embrace she had resolved that she would do so declaring to herself that she was not fit to be held against that pure heart but the tenderness of the offer had overcome her and now she pressed her friend convulsively in her arms as though there might yet be comfort for her as long as she could remain close to one who was so good to her  i shall come and see you very often said mrs ormealmost daily  no no no exclaimed the other hardly knowing the meaning of her own words  but i shall my father is waiting now dear and you had better go  sir peregrine had turned to the window where he stood shading his eyes with his hand when he heard his daughterinlaws last words he again came forward and offered lady mason his arm edith is right he said you had better go now when you are at home you will be more composed and then he led her forth and down the stairs and across the hall and with infinite courtesy put her into the carriage it was a moment dreadful to lady mason but to sir peregrine also it was not pleasant the servants were standing round officiously offering their aidthose very servants who had been told about ten days since that this lady was to become their masters wife and their mistress they had been told so with no injunction as to secrecy and the tidings had gone quickly through the whole country now it was known that the match was broken off that the lady had been living up stairs secluded for the last week and that she was to leave the house this morning having been committed during the last day or two to stand her trial at the assizes for some terrible offence he succeeded in his task he handed her into the carriage and then walked back through his own servants to the library without betraying to them the depth of his sorrow but he knew that the last task had been too heavy for him when it was done he shut himself up and sat there for hours without moving he also declared to himself that the world was too hard for him and that it would be well for him that he should die never till now had he come into close contact with crime and now the criminal was one whom as a woman he had learned to love and whom he had proposed to the world as his wife the criminal was one who had declared her crime in order to protect him and whom therefore he was still bound in honour to protect  when lady mason arrived at orley farm her son was waiting at the door to receive her it should have been said that during the last two daysthat is ever since the committalmrs orme had urged upon her very strongly that it would be well for her to tell everything to her son what now at once the poor woman had said yes dear at once mrs orme had answered he will forgive you for i know he is good he will forgive you and then the worst of your sorrow will be over but towards doing this lady mason had made no progress even in her mind in the violence of her own resolution she had brought herself to tell her guilt to sir peregrine that effort had nearly destroyed her and now she knew that she could not frame the words which should declare the truth to lucius what tell him the tale whereas her whole life had been spent in an effort to conceal it from him no she knew that she could not do it but the idea of doing so made her tremble at the prospect of meeting him  i am very glad you have come home mother said lucius as he received her believe me that for the present this will be the best place for both of us and then he led her into the house  dear lucius it would always be best for me to be with you if it were possible  he did not accuse her of hypocrisy in saying this but he could not but think that had she really thought and felt as she now spoke nothing need have prevented her remaining with him had not his house ever been open to her had he not been willing to make her defence the first object of his life had he not longed to prove himself a good son but she had gone from him directly that troubles came upon her and now she said that she would fain be with him alwaysif it were possible where had been the impediment in what way had it been not possible he thought of this with bitterness as he followed her into the house but he said not a word of it he had resolved that he would be a pattern son and even now he would not rebuke her  she had lived in this house for some fourandtwenty years but it seemed to her in no way like her home was it not the property of her enemy joseph mason and did she not know that it must go back into that enemys hands how then could it be to her like a home the room in which her bed was laid was that very room in which her sin had been committed there in the silent hours of the night while the old man lay near his death in the adjoining chamber had she with infinite care and much slow preparation done that deed to undo which were it possible she would now give away her existenceay her very body and soul and yet for years she had slept in that room if not happily at least tranquilly it was matter of wonder to her now as she looked back at her past life that her guilt had sat so lightly on her shoulders the black unwelcome guest the spectre of coming evil had ever been present to her but she had seen it indistinctly and now and then the power had been hers to close her eyes never again could she close them nearer to her and still nearer the spectre came and now it sat upon her pillow and put its claw upon her plate it pressed upon her bosom with its fiendish strength telling her that all was over for her in this worlday and telling her worse even than that her return to her old home brought with it but little comfort  and yet she was forced to make an effort at seeming glad that she had come therea terrible effort he her son was not gay or disposed to receive from her a show of happiness but he did think that she should compose herself and be tranquil and that she should resume the ordinary duties of her life in her ordinarily quiet way in all this she was obliged to conform herself to his wishesor to attempt so to conform herself though her heart should break in the struggle if he did but know it all then he would suffer her to be quietsuffer her to lie motionless in her misery once or twice she almost said to herself that she would make the effort but when she thought of him and his suffering of his pride of the respect which he claimed from all the world as the honest son of an honest mother of his stubborn will and stiff neck which would not bend but would break beneath the blow she had done all for himto raise him in the world and now she could not bring herself to undo the work that had cost her so dearly  that evening she went through the ceremony of dinner with him and he was punctilious in waiting upon her as though bread and meat could comfort her or wine could warm her heart there was no warmth for her in all the vintages of the south no comfort though gods should bring to her their banquets she was heavy ladenladen to the breaking of her back and did not know where to lay her burden down  mother he said to her that night lifting his head from the books over which he had been poring there must be a few words between us about this affair they might as well be spoken now  yes lucius of courseif you desire it  there can be no doubt now that this trial will take place  no doubt she said there can be no doubt  is it your wish that i should take any part in it  she remained silent for some moments before she answered him thinkingstriving to think how best she might do him pleasure what part she said at last  a mans part and a sons part shall i see these lawyers and learn from them what they are at have i your leave to tell them that you want no subterfuge no legal quibblesthat you stand firmly on your own clear innocence and that you defy your enemies to sully it mother those who have sent you to such men as that cunning attorney have sent you wronghave counselled you wrong  it cannot be changed now lucius  it can be changed if you will tell me to change it  and then again she paused ah think of her anguish as she sought for words to answer him no lucius she said it cannot be changed now  so be it mother i will not ask again and then he moodily returned to his books while she returned to her thoughts ah think of her misery     chapter liv  telling all that happened beneath the lamppost   when felix graham left noningsby and made his way up to london he came at least to one resolution which he intended to be an abiding one that idea of a marriage with a moulded wife should at any rate be abandoned whether it might be his great destiny to be the husband of madeline staveley or whether he might fail in achieving this purpose he declared to himself that it would be impossible that he should ever now become the husband of mary snow and the ease with which his conscience settled itself on this matter as soon as he had received from the judge that gleam of hope astonished even himself he immediately declared to himself that he could not marry mary snow without perjury how could he stand with her before the altar and swear that he would love her seeing that he did not love her at allseeing that he altogether loved some one else he acknowledged that he had made an ass of himself in this affair of mary snow this moulding of a wife had failed with him he said as it always must fail with every man but he would not carry his folly further he would go to mary snow tell her the truth and then bear whatever injury her angry father might be able to inflict on him independently of that angry father he would of course do for mary snow all that his circumstances would admit  perhaps the gentleman of a poetic turn of mind whom mary had consented to meet beneath the lamppost might assist him in his views but whether this might be so or not he would not throw that meeting ungenerously in her teeth he would not have allowed that offence to turn him from his proposed marriage had there been nothing else to turn him and therefore he would not plead that offence as the excuse for his broken troth that the breaking of that troth would not deeply wound poor marys heartso much he did permit himself to believe on the evidence of that lamppost  he had written to mrs thomas telling her when he would be at peckham but in his letter he had not said a word as to those terrible tidings which she had communicated to him he had written also to mary assuring her that he accused her of no injury against him and almost promising her forgiveness but this letter mary had not shown to mrs thomas in these days marys anger against mrs thomas was very strong that mrs thomas should have used all her vigilance to detect such goings on as those of the lamppost was only natural what woman in mrs thomass positionor in any other positionwould not have done so mary snow knew that had she herself been the duenna she would have left no corner of a box unturned but she would have found those letters and having found them she would have used her power over the poor girl she knew that but she would not have betrayed her to the man truth between woman and woman should have prevented that were not the stockings which she had darned for mrs thomas legion in number had she not consented to eat the veriest scraps of food in order that those three brats might be fed into sleekness to satisfy their mothers eyes had she not reported well of mrs thomas to her lord though that house of peckham was nauseous to her had she ever told to mr graham any one of those little tricks which were carried on to allure him into a belief that things at peckham were prosperous had she ever exposed the borrowing of those teacups when he came and the fact that those knobs of white sugar were kept expressly on his behoof no she would have scorned to betray any woman and that woman whom she had not betrayed should have shown the same feeling towards her therefore there was enmity at peckham and the stockings of those infants lay unmended in the basket  mary i have done it all for the best said mrs thomas driven to defend herself by the obdurate silence of her pupil  no mrs thomas you didnt you did it for the worst said mary and then there was again silence between them  it was on the morning following this that felix graham was driven to the door in a cab he still carried his arm in a sling and was obliged to be somewhat slow in his movements but otherwise he was again well his accident however was so far a godsend to both the women at peckham that it gave them a subject on which they were called upon to speak before that other subject was introduced mary was very tender in her inquiriesbut tender in a bashful retiring way to look at her one would have said that she was afraid to touch the wounded man lest he should be again broken  oh im all right said he trying to assume a look of goodhumour i shant go hunting again in a hurry you may be sure of that  we have all great reason to be thankful that providence interposed to save you said mrs thomas in her most serious tone had providence interposed to break mrs thomass collarbone or at least to do her some serious outward injury what a comfort it would be thought mary snow  have you seen your father lately asked graham  not since i wrote to you about the money that heborrowed said mary  i told her that she should not have given it to him said mrs thomas  she was quite right said graham who could refuse assistance to a father in distress whereupon mary put her handkerchief up to her eyes and began to cry  thats true of course said mrs thomas but it would never do that he should be a drain in that way he should feel that if he had any feeling  so he has said mary and you are driven close enough yourself sometimes mrs thomas theres days when youd like to borrow nineteen and sixpence if anybody would lend it you  very well said mrs thomas crossing her hands over each other in her lap and assuming a look of resignation i suppose all this will be changed now i have endeavoured to do my duty and very hard it has been  felix felt that the sooner he rushed into the middle of the subject which brought him there the better it would be for all parties that the two ladies were not very happy together was evident and then he made a little comparison between madeline and mary was it really the case that for the last three years he had contemplated making that poor child his wife would it not be better for him to tie a millstone round his neck and cast himself into the sea that was now his thought respecting mary snow  mrs thomas he said i should like to speak to mary alone for a few minutes if you could allow it  oh certainly by all means it will be quite proper and gathering up a bundle of the unfortunate stockings she took herself out of the room  mary as soon as graham had spoken became almost pale and sat perfectly still with her eyes fixed on her betrothed husband while mrs thomas was there she was prepared for war and her spirit was hot within her but all that heat fled in a moment when she found herself alone with the man to whom it belonged to speak her doom he had almost said that he would forgive her but yet she had a feeling that that had been done which could not altogether be forgiven if he asked her whether she loved the hero of the lamppost what would she say had he asked her whether she loved him felix graham she would have sworn that she did and have thought that she was swearing truly but in answer to that other question if it were asked she felt that her answer must be false she had no idea of giving up felix of her own accord if he were still willing to take her she did not even wish that he would not take her it had been the lesson of her life that she was to be his wife and by becoming so provide for herself and for her wretched father nevertheless a dream of something different from that had come across her young heart and the dream had been so pleasant how painfully but yet with what a rapture had her heart palpitated as she stood for those ten wicked minutes beneath the lamppost  mary said felix as soon as they were aloneand as he spoke he came up to her and took her hand i trust that i may never be the cause to you of any unhappinessthat i may never be the means of making you sad  oh mr graham i am sure that you never will it is i that have been bad to you  no mary i do not think you have been bad at all i should have been sorry that that had happened and that i should not have known it  i suppose she was right to tell only in truth mary did not at all understand what might be the nature of grahams thoughts and feelings on such a subject she had a strong womans idea that the man whom she ought to love would not be gratified by her meeting another man at a private assignation especially when that other man had written to her a loveletter but she did not at all know how far such a sin might be regarded as pardonable according to the rules of the world recognised on such subjects at first when the letters were discovered and the copies of them sent off to noningsby she thought that all was over according to her ideas as existing at that moment the crime was conceived to be one admitting of no pardon and in the hours spent under that conviction all her consolation came from the feeling that there was still one who regarded her as an angel of light but then she had received grahams letter and as she began to understand that pardon was possible that other consolation waxed feeble and dim if felix graham chose to take her of course she was there for him to take it never for a moment occurred to her that she could rebel against such taking even though she did shine as an angel of light to one dear pair of eyes  i suppose she was right to tell you only  do not think mary that i am going to scold you or even that i am angry with you  oh but i know you must be angry  indeed i am not if i pledge myself to tell you the truth in everything will you be equally frank with me  yes said mary but it was much easier for felix to tell the truth than for mary to be frank i believe that schoolmasters often tell fibs to schoolboys although it would be so easy for them to tell the truth but how difficult it is for the schoolboy always to tell the truth to his master mary snow was now as a schoolboy before her tutor and it may almost be said that the telling of the truth was to her impossible but of course she made the promise who ever said that she would not tell the truth when so asked  have you ever thought mary that you and i would not make each other happy if we were married  no i have never thought that said mary innocently she meant to say exactly that which she thought graham would wish her to say but she was slow in following his lead  it has never occurred to you that though we might love each other very warmly as friendsand so i am sure we always shallyet we might not suit each other in all respects as man and wife  i mean to do the very best i can that is ififif you are not too much offended with me now  but mary it should not be a question of doing the best you can between man and wife there should be no need of such effort it should be a labour of love  so it willand im sure ill labour as hard as i can  felix began to perceive that the line he had taken would not answer the required purpose and that he must be somewhat more abrupt with herperhaps a little less delicate in coming to the desired point mary he said what is the name of that gentleman whomwhom you met out of doors you know  albert fitzallen said mary hesitating very much as she pronounced the name but nevertheless rather proud of the sound  and you arefond of him asked graham  poor girl what was she to say no im not very fond of him  are you not then why did you consent to that secret meeting  oh mr grahami didnt mean it indeed i didnt and i didnt tell him to write to me nor yet to come looking after me upon my word i didnt but then i thought when he sent me that letter that he didnt knowabout you i mean and so i thought id better tell him and thats why i went indeed that was the reason  mrs thomas could have told him that  but i dont like mrs thomas and i wouldnt for worlds that she should have had anything to do with it i think mrs thomas has behaved very bad to me so i do and you dont half know herthat you dont  i will ask you one more question mary and before answering it i want to make you believe that my only object in asking it is to ascertain how i may make you happy when you did meet mrthis gentleman  albert fitzallen  when you did meet mr fitzallen did you tell him nothing else except that you were engaged to me did you say nothing to him as to your feelings towards himself  i told him it was very wrong of him to write me that letter  and what more did you tell him  oh mr graham i wont see him any more indeed i wont i give you my most solemn promise indeed i wont and i will never write a line to himor look at him and if he sends anything ill send it to you indeed i will there was never anything of the kind before upon my word there wasnt i did let him take my hand but i didnt know how to help it when i was there and he kissed meonly once there ive told it all now as though you were looking at me and i aint a bad girl whatever she may say of me indeed i aint and then poor mary snow burst out into an agony of tears  felix began to perceive that he had been too hard upon her he had wished that the first overtures of a separation should come from her and in wishing this he had been unreasonable he walked for a while about the room and then going up to her he stood close by her and took her hand mary he said im sure youre not a bad girl  no she said no i aint still sobbing convulsively i didnt mean anything wrong and i couldnt help it  i am sure you did not and nobody has said you did  yes they have she has said so she said that i was a bad girl she told me so up to my face  she was very wrong if she said so  she did then and i couldnt bear it  i have not said so and i dont think so indeed in all this matter i believe that i have been more to blame than you  noi know i was wrong i know i shouldnt have gone to see him  i wont even say as much as that mary what you should have doneonly the task would have been too hard for any young girlwas to have told me openly that youliked this young gentleman  but i dont want ever to see him again  look here mary he said but now he had dropped her hand and taken a chair opposite to her he had begun to find that the task which he had proposed to himself was not so easy even for him look here mary i take it that you do like this young gentleman dont answer me till i have finished what i am going to say i suppose you do like himand if so it would be very wicked in you to marry me  oh mr graham  wait a moment mary but there is nothing wicked in your liking him it may be presumed that mr graham would hold such an opinion as this seeing that he had allowed himself the same latitude of liking it was perhaps only natural that you should learn to do so you have been taught to regard me rather as a master than as a lover  oh mr graham im sure ive loved you i have indeed and i will i wont even think of al  but i want you to think of himthat is if he be worth thinking of  hes a very good young man and always lives with his mother  it shall be my business to find out that and now mary tell me truly if he be a good young man and if he loves you well enough to marry you would you not be happier as his wife than you would as mine  there the question that he wished to ask her had got itself asked at last but if the asking had been difficult how much more difficult must have been the answer he had been thinking over all this for the last fortnight and had hardly known how to come to a resolution now he put the matter before her without a moments notice and expected an instant decision speak the truth marywhat you think about itwithout minding what anybody may say of you but mary could not say anything so she again burst into tears  surely you know the state of your own heart mary  i dont know she answered  my only object is to secure your happinessthe happiness of both of us that is  ill do anything you please said mary  well then ill tell you what i think i fear that a marriage between us would not make either of us contented with our lives im too old and too grave for you yet mary snow was not younger than madeline staveley you have been told to love me and you think that you do love me because you wish to do what you think to be your duty but i believe that people can never really love each other merely because they are told to do so of course i cannot say what sort of a young man mr fitzallen may be but if i find that he is fit to take care of you and that he has means to support youwith such little help as i can givei shall be very happy to promote such an arrangement  everybody will of course say that felix graham was base in not telling her that all this arose not from her love affair with albert fitzallen but from his own love affair with madeline staveley but i am inclined to think that everybody will be wrong had he told her openly that he did not care for her but did care for some one else he would have left her no alternative as it was he did not mean that she should have any alternative but he probably consulted her feelings best in allowing her to think that she had a choice and then though he owed much to her he owed nothing to her father and had he openly declared his intention of breaking off the match because he had attached himself to some one else he would have put himself terribly into her fathers power he was willing to submit to such pecuniary burden in the matter as his conscience told him that he ought to bear but mr snows ideas on the subject of recompense night be extravagant and thereforeas regarded snow the fatherhe thought that he might make some slight and delicate use of the meeting under the lamppost in doing so he would be very careful to guard mary from her fathers anger indeed mary would be surrendered out of his own care not to that of her father but to the fostering love of the gentleman in the medical line of life  ill do anything that you please said mary upon whose mind and heart all these changes had come with a suddenness which prevented her from thinkingmuch less speaking her thoughts  perhaps you had better mention it to mrs thomas  oh mr graham id rather not talk to her i dont love her a bit  well i will not press it on you if you do not wish it and have i your permission to speak to mr fitzallenand if he approves to speak to his mother  ill do anything you think best mr graham said poor mary she was poor mary for though she had consented to meet a lover beneath the lamppost she had not been without ambition and had looked forward to the glory of being wife to such a man as felix graham she did not however for one moment entertain any idea of resistance to his will  and then felix left her having of course an interview with mrs thomas before he quitted the house to her however he said nothing when anything is settled mrs thomas i will let you know the words were so lacking in confidence that mrs thomas when she heard them knew that the verdict had gone against her  felix for many months had been accustomed to take leave of mary snow with a kiss but on this day he omitted to kiss her and then mary knew that it was all over with her ambition but love still remained to her there is some one else who will be proud to kiss me she said to herself as she stood alone in the room when he closed the door behind him     chapter lv  what took place in harley street   tom ive come back again said mrs furnival as soon as the diningroom door was closed behind her back  im very glad to see you i am indeed said he getting up and putting out his hand to her but i really never knew why you went away  oh yes you know im sure you know why i went but  ill be shot if i did then  i went away because i did not like lady mason going to your chambers  psha  yes i know i was wrong tom that is i was wrongabout that  of course you were kitty  well dont i say i was and ive come back again and i beg your pardonthat is about the lady  very well then theres an end of it  but tom you know ive been provoked havent i now how often have you been home to dinner since you have been member of parliament for that place  i shall be more at home now kitty  shall you indeed then ill not say another word to vex you what on earth can i want tom except just that you should sit at home with me sometimes on evenings as you used to do always in the old days and as for martha biggs  is she come back too  oh dear no shes in red lion square and im sure tom i never had her here except when you wouldnt dine at home i wonder whether you know how lonely it is to sit down to dinner all by oneself  why i do it every other day of my life and i never think of sending for martha biggs i promise you that  she isnt very nice i know said mrs furnivalthat is for gentlemen  i should say not said mr furnival then the reconciliation had been effected and mrs furnival went up stairs to prepare for dinner knowing that her husband would be present and that martha biggs would not and just as she was taking her accustomed place at the head of the table almost ashamed to look up lest she should catch spooners eye who was standing behind his master rachel went off in a cab to orange street commissioned to pay what might be due for the lodgings to bring back her mistresss boxes and to convey the necessary tidings to miss biggs  well i never said martha as she listened to rachels story  and theyre quite loving i can assure you said rachel  itll never last said miss biggs triumphantlynever its been done too sudden to last  so ill say goodnight if you please miss biggs said rachel who was in a hurry to get back to harley street  i think she might have come here before she went there especially as it wasnt anything out of her way she couldnt have gone shorter than bloomsbury square and russell square and over tottenham court road  missus didnt think of that i dare say  she used to know the way about these parts well enough but give her my love rachel then martha biggs was again alone and she sighed deeply  it was well that mrs furnival came back so quickly to her own house as it saved the scandal of any domestic quarrel before her daughter on the following day sophia returned and as harmony was at that time reigning in harley street there was no necessity that she should be presumed to know anything of what had occurred that she did knowknow exactly what her mother had done and why she had done it and how she had come back leaving martha biggs dumfounded by her return is very probable for sophia furnival was a clever girl and one who professed to understand the inns and outs of her own familyand perhaps of some other families but she behaved very prettily to her papa and mamma on the occasion never dropping a word which could lead either of them to suppose that she had interrogated rachel been confidential with the housemaid conversed on the subjecteven with spooner and made a morning call on martha biggs herself  there arose not unnaturally some conversation between the mother and daughter as to lady masonnot as to lady masons visits to lincolns inn and their impropriety as formerly presumednot at all as to that but in respect to her present lamentable position and that engagement which had for a time existed between her and sir peregrine orme on this latter subject mrs furnival had of course heard nothing during her interview with mrs orme at noningsby at that time lady mason had formed the sole subject of conversation but in explaining to mrs furnival that there certainly could be no unhallowed feeling between her husband and the lady mrs orme had not thought it necessary to allude to sir peregrines past intentions mrs furnival however had heard the whole matter discussed in the railway carriage had since interrogated her husbandlearning however not very much from himand now inquired into all the details from her daughter  and she and sir peregrine were really to be married mrs furnival as she asked the question thought with confusion of her own unjust accusations against the poor woman under such circumstances as those lady mason must of course have been innocent as touching mr furnival  yes said sophia there is no doubt whatsoever that they were engaged sir peregrine told lady staveley so himself  and now its all broken off again  oh yes it is all broken off now i believe the fact to be this lord alston who lives near noningsby is a very old friend of sir peregrines when he heard of it he went to the cleevei know that for certainand i think he talked sir peregrine out of it  but my conscience sophiaafter he had made her the offer  i fancy that mrs orme arranged it all whether lord alston saw her or not i dont know my belief is that lady mason behaved very well all through though they say very bitter things against her at noningsby  poor thing said mrs furnival the feelings of whose heart were quite changed as regarded lady mason  i never knew a woman so badly treated sophia had her own reasons for wishing to make the best of lady masons case and for myself i do not see why sir peregrine should not have married her if he pleased  he is rather old my dear  people dont think so much about that nowadays as they used if he liked it and she too who had a right to say anything my idea is that a man with any spirit would have turned lord alston out of the house what business had he to interfere  but about the trial sophia  that will go on theres no doubt about that but they all say that its the most unjust thing in the world and that she must be proved innocent i heard the judge say so myself  but why are they allowed to try her then  oh papa will tell you that  i never like to bother your papa about law business particularly not mrs furnival when he has a pretty woman for his client  my wonder is that she should make herself so unhappy about it continued sophia it seems that she is quite broken down  but wont she have to go and sit in the courtwith all the people staring at her  that wont kill her said sophia who felt that she herself would not perish under any such process if i was sure that i was in the right i think that i could hold up my head against all that but they say that she is crushed to the earth  poor thing said mrs furnival i wish that i could do anything for her and in this way they talked the matter over very comfortably  two or three days after this sophia furnival was sitting alone in the drawingroom in harley street when spooner answered a double knock at the door and lucius mason was shown up stairs mrs furnival had gone to make her peace in red lion square and there may perhaps be ground for supposing that lucius had cause to expect that miss furnival might be seen at this hour without interruption be that as it may she was found alone and he was permitted to declare his purpose unmolested by father mother or family friends  you remember how we parted at noningsby said he when their first greetings were well over  oh yes i remember it very well i do not easily forget words such as were spoken then  you said that you would never turn away from me  nor will ithat is with reference to the matter as to which we were speaking  is our friendship then to be confined to one subject  by no means friendship cannot be so confined mr mason friendship between true friends must extend to all the affairs of life what i meant to say was this but i am quite sure that you understand me without any explanation  he did understand her she meant to say that she had promised to him her sympathy and friendship but nothing more but then he had asked for nothing more the matter of doubt within his own heart was this should he or should he not ask for more and if he resolved on answering this question in the affirmative should he ask for it now he had determined that morning that he would come to some fixed purpose on this matter before he reached harley street as he crossed out of oxford street from the omnibus he had determined that the present was no time for lovemakingwalking up regent street he had told himself that if he had one faithful heart to bear him company he could bear his troubles betteras he made his way along the north side of cavendish square he pictured to himself what would be the wound to his pride if he were rejectedand in passing the ten or twelve houses which intervened in harley street between the corner of the square and the abode of his mistress he told himself that the question must be answered by circumstances  yes i understand you he said and believe me in thisi would not for worlds encroach on your kindness i knew that when i pressed your hand that night i pressed the hand of a friendand nothing more  quite so said sophia sophias wit was usually ready enough but at that moment she could not resolve with what words she might make the most appropriate reply to herfriend what she did say was rather lame but it was not dangerous  since that i have suffered a great deal said lucius of course you know that my mother has been staying at the cleeve  oh yes i believe she left it only a day or two since  and you heard perhaps of her i hardly know how to tell you if you have not heard it  if you mean about sir peregrine i have heard of that  of course you have all the world has heard of it and lucius mason got up and walked about the room holding his hand to his brow all the world are talking about it miss furnival you have never known what it is to blush for a parent  miss furnival at the moment felt a sincere hope that mr mason might never hear of mrs furnivals visit to the neighbourhood of orange street and of the causes which led to it and by no means thought it necessary to ask for her friends sympathy on that subject no said she i never have nor need you do so for yours why should not lady mason have married sir peregrine orme if they both thought such a marriage fitting  what at such a time as this with these dreadful accusations running in her ears surely this was no time for marrying and what has come of it people now say that he has rejected her and sent her away  oh no they cannot say that  but they do it is reported that sir peregrine has sent her away because he thinks her to be guilty that i do not believe no honest man no gentleman could think her guilty but is it not dreadful that such things should be said  will not the trial take place very shortly now when that is once over all these troubles will be at an end  miss furnival i sometimes think that my mother will hardly have strength to sustain the trial she is so depressed that i almost fear her mind will give way and the worst of it is that i am altogether unable to comfort her  surely that at present should specially be your task  i cannot do it what should i say to her i think that she is wrong in what she is doing thoroughly absolutely wrong she has got about her a parcel of lawyers i beg your pardon miss furnival but you know i do not mean such as your father  but has not he advised it  if so i cannot but think he is wrong they are the very scum of the gaols men who live by rescuing felons from the punishment they deserve what can my mother require of such services as theirs it is they that frighten her and make her dread all manner of evils why should a woman who knows herself to be good and just fear anything that the law can do to her  i can easily understand that such a position as hers must be very dreadful you must not be hard upon her mr mason because she is not as strong as you might be  hard upon her ah miss furnival you do not know me if she would only accept my love i would wait upon her as a mother does upon her infant no labour would be too much for me no care would be too close but her desire is that this affair should never be mentioned between us we are living now in the same house and though i see that this is killing her yet i may not speak of it then he got up from his chair and as he walked about the room he took his handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his eyes  i wish i could comfort you said she and in saying so she spoke the truth by nature she was not tender hearted but now she did sympathise with him by nature too she was not given to any deep affection but she did feel some spark of love for lucius mason i wish i could comfort you and as she spoke she also got up from her chair  and you can said he suddenly stopping himself and coming close to her you can comfort mein some degree you and you only can do so i know this is no time for declarations of love were it not that we are already so much to each other i would not indulge myself at such a moment with such a wish but i have no one whom i can love andit is very hard to bear and then he stood waiting for her answer as though he conceived that he had offered her his hand  but miss furnival well knew that she had received no offer if my warmest sympathy can be of service to you  it is your love i want he said taking her hand as he spoke your love so that i may look on you as my wifeyour acceptance of my love so that we may be all in all to each other there is my hand i stand before you now as sad a man as there is in all london but there is my handwill you take it and give me yours in pledge of your love  i should be unjust to lucius mason were i to omit to say that he played his part with a becoming air unhappiness and a melancholy mood suited him perhaps better than the worlds ordinary goodhumour he was a man who looked his best when under a cloud and shone the brightest when everything about him was dark and sophia also was not unequal to the occasion there was however this difference between them lucius was quite honest in all that he said and did upon the occasion whereas miss furnival was only half honest perhaps she was not capable of a higher pitch of honesty than that  there is my hand said she and they stood holding each other palm to palm  and with it your heart said lucius  and with it my heart answered sophia nor as she spoke did she hesitate for a moment or become embarrassed or lose her command of feature had augustus staveley gone through the same ceremony at noningsby in the same way i am inclined to think that she would have made the same answer had neither done so she would not on that account have been unhappy what a blessed woman would lady staveley have been had she known what was being done in harley street at this moment  in some short rhapsody of love it may be presumed that lucius indulged himself when he found that the affair which he had in hand had so far satisfactorily arranged itself but he was in truth too wretched at heart for any true enjoyment of the delights of a favoured suitor they were soon engaged again on that terrible subject seated side by side indeed and somewhat close but the tone of their voices and their very words were hardly different from what they might have been had no troth been plighted between them his present plan was that sophia should visit orley farm for a time and take that place of dear and bosom friend which a woman circumstanced as was his mother must so urgently need we my readers know well who was now that loving friend and we know also which was best fitted for such a task sophia furnival or mrs orme but we have had i trust better means of reading the characters of those ladies than had fallen to the lot of lucius mason and should not be angry with him because his eyes were dark  sophia hesitated a moment before she answered this propositionnot as though she were slack in her love or begrudged her services to his mother but it behoved her to look carefully at the circumstances before she would pledge herself to such an arrangement as that if she went to orley farm on such a mission would it not be necessary to tell her father and mothernay to tell all the world that she was engaged to lucius mason and would it be wise to make such a communication at the present moment lucius said a word to her of going into court with his mother and sitting with her hand in hand while that ordeal was passing by in the publicity of such sympathy there was something that suited the bearings of miss furnivals mind the idea that lady mason was guilty had never entered her head and therefore on this she thought there could be no disgrace in such a proceeding but neverthelessmight it not be prudent to wait till that trial were over  if you are my wife you must be her daughter and how can you better take a daughters part pleaded lucius  no no and i would do it with my whole heart but lucius does she know me well enough it is of her that we must think after all that you have told me can we think that she would wish me to be there  it was his desire that his mother should learn to have such a wish and this he explained to her he himself could do but little at home because he could not yield his opinion on those matters of importance as to which he and his mother differed so vitally but if she had a woman with her in the housesuch a woman as his own sophiathen he thought her heart would be softened and part of her sorrow might be assuaged  sophia at last said that she would think about it it would be improper she said to pledge herself to anything rashly it might be that as her father was to defend lady mason he might on that account object to his daughter being in the court lucius declared that this would be unreasonableunless indeed mr furnival should object to his daughters engagement and might he not do so sophia thought it very probable that he might it would make no difference in her she said her engagement would be equally bindingas permanently binding let who would object to it and as she made this declaration there was of course a little love scene but for the present it might be best that in this matter she should obey her father and then she pointed out how fatal it might be to avert her father from the cause while the trial was still pending upon the whole she acted her part very prudently and when lucius left her she was pledged to nothing but that one simple fact of a marriage engagement     chapter lvi  how sir peregrine did business with mr round   in the mean time sir peregrine was sitting at home trying to determine in what way he should act under the present emergency actuated as he was on one side by friendship and on the other by duty for the first day or twonay for the first week after the confession had been made to himhe had been so astounded had been so knocked to the earth and had remained in such a state of bewilderment that it had been impossible for him to form for himself any line of conduct his only counsellor had been mrs orme and though he could not analyze the matter he felt that her womans ideas of honour and honesty were in some way different from his ideas as a man to her the sorrows and utter misery of lady mason seemed of greater weight than her guilt at least such was the impression which her words left mrs ormes chief anxiety in the matter still was that lady mason should be acquittedas strongly so now as when they both believed her to be as guiltless as themselves but sir peregrine could not look at it in this light he did not say that he wished that she might be found guiltynor did he wish it but he did announce his opinion to his daughterinlaw that the ends of justice would so be best promoted and that if the matter were driven to a trial it would not be for the honour of the court that a false verdict should be given nor would he believe that such a false verdict could be obtained an english judge and an english jury were to him the palladium of discerning truth in an english court of law such a matter could not remain darknor ought it let whatever misery betide it was strange how that old man should have lived so near the world for seventy years should have taken his place in parliament and on the bench should have rubbed his shoulders so constantly against those of his neighbours and yet have retained so strong a reliance on the purity of the world in general here and there such a man may still be found but the number is becoming very few  as for the property that must of necessity be abandoned lady mason had signified her agreement to this and therefore he was so far willing that she should be saved from further outward punishment if that were still possible his plan was this and to his thinking it was the only plan that was feasible let the estate be at once given up to the proper ownereven now before the day of trial should come and then let them trust not to joseph mason but to joseph masons advisers to abstain from prosecuting the offender even this course he knew to be surrounded by a thousand difficulties but it might be possible of mr round old mr round he had heard a good report he was a kind man and even in this very matter had behaved in a way that had shamed his client might it not be possible that mr round would engage to drop the prosecution if the immediate return of the property were secured but to effect this must he not tell mr round of the womans guilt and could he manage it himself must he not tell mr furnival and by so doing would he not rob lady mason of her sole remaining tower of strengthfor if mr furnival knew that she was guilty mr furnival must of course abandon her cause and then sir peregrine did not know how to turn himself as he thus argued the matter within his own bosom  and then too his own disgrace sat very heavy on him whether or no the law might pronounce lady mason to have been guilty all the world would know her guilt when that property should be abandoned and her wretched son turned out to earn his bread it would be well understood that she had been guilty and this was the woman this midnight forger whom he had taken to his bosom and asked to be his wife he had asked her and she had consented and then he had proclaimed the triumph of his love to all the world when he stood there holding her to his breast he had been proud of her affection when lord alston had come to him with his caution he had scorned his old friend and almost driven him from his door when his grandson had spoken a word not to him but to another he had been full of wrath he had let it be known widely that he would feel no shame in showing her to the world as lady orme and now she was a forger and a perjurer and a thiefa thief who for long years had lived on the proceeds of her dexterous theft and yet was he not under a deep obligation to herunder the very deepest had she not saved him from a worse disgracesaved him at the cost of all that was left to herself was he not still bound to stand by her and did he not still love her  poor sir peregrine may we not say that it would have been well for him if the world and all its trouble could have now been ended so that he might have done with it  mrs orme was his only counsellor and though she could not be brought to agree with him in all his feelings yet she was of infinite comfort to him had she not shared with him this terrible secret his mind would have given way beneath the burden on the day after lady masons departure from the cleeve he sat for an hour in the library considering what he would do and then he sent for his daughterinlaw if it behoved him to take any step to stay the trial he must take it at once the matter had been pressed on by each side and now the days might be counted up to that day on which the judges would arrive in alston that trial would be very terrible to him in every way he had promised during those pleasant hours of his love and sympathy in which he had felt no doubt as to his friends acquittal that he would stand by her when she was arraigned that was now impossible and though he had not dared to mention it to lady mason he knew that she would not expect that he should do so but to mrs orme he had spoken on the matter and she had declared her purpose of taking the place which it would not now become him to fill sir peregrine had started from his chair when she had so spoken what his daughter she the purest of the pure to whom the very air of a court of law would be a contaminationshe whose whiteness had never been sullied by contact with the worlds dust she set by the side of that terrible criminal hand in hand with her present to all the world as her bosom friend there had been but few words between them on the matter but sir peregrine had felt strongly that that might not be permitted far better than that it would be that he should humble his gray hairs and sit there to be gazed at by the crowd but on all accounts how much was it to be desired that there should be no trial  sit down edith he said as with her soft step she came up to him i find that the assizes will be here in alston at the end of next month  so soon as that father  yes look here the judges will come in on the 25th of march  ah methis is very sudden but father will it not be best for her that it should be over  mrs orme still thought had always thought that the trial itself was unavoidable indeed she had thought and she did think that it afforded to lady mason the only possible means of escape her mind on the subject if it could have been analyzed would probably have been this as to the property that question must for the present stand in abeyance it is quite right that it should go to its detestable ownersthat it should be made over to them at some day not very distant but for the present the trial for that old longdistant crime was the subject for them to consider could it be wrong to wish for an acquittal for the sinneran acquittal before this worlds bar seeing that a true verdict had undoubtedly been given before another bar mrs orme trusted that no jury would convict her friend let lady mason go through that ordeal and then when the law had declared her innocent let restitution be made  it will be very terrible to all if she be condemned said sir peregrine  very terrible but mr furnival  edith if it comes to that she will be condemned mr furnival is a lawyer and will not say so but from his countenance when he speaks of her i know that he expects it  oh father do not say so  but if it is so my love what is the purport of these courts of law if it be not to discover the truth and make it plain to the light of day poor sir peregrine his innocence in this respect was perhaps beautiful but it was very simple mr aram could he have been induced to speak out his mind plainly would have expressed probably a different opinion  but she escaped before said mrs orme who was clearly at present on the same side with mr aram  yes she didby perjury edith and now the penalty of that further crime awaits her there was an old poet who said that the wicked man rarely escapes at last i believe in my heart that he spoke the truth  father that old poet knew nothing of our faith  sir peregrine could not stop to explain even if he knew how to do so that the old poet spoke of punishment in this world whereas the faith on which his daughter relied is efficacious for pardon beyond the grave it would be much ay in one sense everything if lady mason could be brought to repent of the sin she had committed but no such repentance would stay the bitterness of joseph mason or of samuel dockwrath if the property were at once restored then repentance might commence if the property were at once restored then the trial might be stayed it might be possible that mr round might so act he felt all this but he could not argue on it i think my dear he said that i had better see mr round  but you will not tell him said mrs orme sharply  no i am not authorised to do that  but he will entice it from you he is a lawyer and he will wind anything out from a plain chivalrous man of truth and honour  my dear mr round i believe is a good man  but if he asks you the question what will you say  i will tell him to ask me no such question  oh father be careful for her sake be careful how is it that you know the truthor that i know it she told it here because in that way only could she save you from that marriage father she has sacrificed herself forfor us  sir peregrine when this was said to him got up from his chair and walked away to the window he was not angry with her that she so spoke to him nay he acknowledged inwardly the truth of her words and loved her for her constancy but nevertheless they were very bitter how had it come to pass that he was thus indebted to so deep a criminal what had he done for her but good  do not go from me she said following him do not think me unkind  no no no he answered striving almost ineffectually to repress a sob you are not unkind  for two days after that not a word was spoken between them on the subject and then he did go to mr round not a word on the subject was spoken between sir peregrine and mrs orme but she was twice at orley farm during the time and told lady mason of the steps which her fatherinlaw was taking he wont betray me lady mason had said mrs orme had answered this with what best assurance she should give but in her heart of hearts she feared that sir peregrine would betray the secret  it was not a pleasant journey for sir peregrine indeed it may be said that no journeys could any longer be pleasant for him he was old and worn and feeble very much older and much more worn than he had been at the period spoken of in the commencement of this story though but a few months had passed over his head since that time for him now it would have been preferable to remain in the armchair by the fireside in his own library receiving such comfort in his old age as might come to him from the affection of his daughterinlaw and grandson but he thought that it behoved him to do this work and therefore old and feeble as he was he set himself to his task he reached the station in london had himself driven to bedford row in a cab and soon found himself in the presence of mr round  illustration sir peregrine at mr rounds office  there was much ceremonial talk between them before sir peregrine could bring himself to declare the purport which had brought him there mr round of course protested that he was very sorry for all this affair the case was not in his hands personally he had hoped many years since that the matter was closed his client mr mason of groby park had insisted that it should be reopened and now he mr round really hardly knew what to say about it  but mr round do you think it is quite impossible that the trial should even now be abandoned asked sir peregrine very carefully  well i fear it is mason thinks that the property is his and is determined to make another struggle for it i am imputing nothing wrong to the lady i really am not in a position to have any opinion of my own  no no no i understand of course your firm is bound to do the best it can for its client but mr roundi know i am quite safe with you  well safe in one way i hope you are but sir peregrine you must of course remember that i am the attorney for the other sidefor the side to which you are opposed  but stillall that you can want is your clients interest  of course we desire to serve his interest  and with that view mr round is it not possible that we might come to some compromise  whatby giving up part of the property  by giving up all the property said sir peregrine with considerable emphasis  whewww mr round at the moment made no other answer than this which terminated in a low whistle  better that at once than that she should die brokenhearted said sir peregrine  there was then silence between them for a minute or two after which mr round turning himself round in his chair so as to face his visitor more fully spoke as follows i told you just now sir peregrine that i was mr masons attorney and i must now tell you that as regards this interview between you and me i will not hold myself as being in that position what you have said shall be as though it had not been said and as i am not myself taking any part in the proceedings this may with absolute strictness be the case but  if i have said anything that i ought not to have said began sir peregrine  allow me for one moment continued mr round the fault is mine if there be a fault as i should have explained to you that the matter could hardly be discussed with propriety between us  mr round i offer you my apology from the bottom of my heart  no sir peregrine you shall offer me no apology nor will i accept any i know no words strong enough to convey to you my esteem and respect for your character  sir  but i will ask you to listen to me for a moment if any compromise be contemplated it should be arranged by the advice of mr furnival and of mr chaffanbrass and the terms should be settled between mr aram and my son but i cannot myself say that i see any possibility of such a result it is not however for me to advise if on that matter you wish for advice i think that you had better see mr furnival  ah said sir peregrine telling more and more of the story by every utterance he made  and now it only remains for me to assure you once more that the words which have been spoken in this room shall be as though they had not been spoken and then mr round made it very clear that there was nothing more to be said between them on the subject of lady mason sir peregrine repeated his apology collected his hat and gloves and with slow step made his way down to his cab while mr round absolutely waited upon him till he saw him seated within the vehicle  so mat is right after all said the old attorney to himself as he stood alone with his back to his own fire thrusting his hands into his trouserspockets so mat is right after all the meaning of this exclamation will be plain to my readers mat had declared to his father his conviction that lady mason had forged the codicil in question and the father was now also convinced that she had done so unfortunate woman he said poor wretched woman and then he began to calculate what might yet be her chances of escape on the whole he thought that she would escape twenty years of possession he said to himself and so excellent a character but nevertheless he repeated to himself over and over again that she was a wretched miserable woman  we may say that all the persons most concerned were convinced or nearly convinced of lady masons guilt among her own friends mr furnival had no doubt of it and mr chaffanbrass and mr aram but very little whereas sir peregrine and mrs orme of course had none on the other side mr mason and mr dockwrath were both fully sure of the truth and the two rounds father and son were quite of the same mind and yet except with dockwrath and sir peregrine the most honest and the most dishonest of the lot the opinion was that she would escape these were five lawyers concerned not one of whom gave to the course of justice credit that it would ascertain the truth and not one of whom wished that the truth should be ascertained surely had they been honestminded in their profession they would all have so wishedhave so wished or else have abstained from all professional intercourse in the matter i cannot understand how any gentleman can be willing to use his intellect for the propagation of untruth and to be paid for so using it as to mr chaffanbrass and mr solomon aramto them the escape of a criminal under their auspices would of course be a matter of triumph to such work for many years had they applied their sharp intellects and legal knowledge but of mr furnivalwhat shall we say of him  sir peregrine went home very sad at heart and crept silently back into his own library in the evening when he was alone with mrs orme he spoke one word to her edith he said i have seen mr round we can do nothing for her there  i feared not said she  no we can do nothing for her there  after that sir peregrine took no step in the matter what step could he take but he sat over his fire in his library day after day thinking over it all and waiting till those terrible assizes should have come     chapter lvii  the loves and hopes of albert fitzallen   felix graham when he left poor mary snow did not go on immediately to the doctors shop he had made up his mind that mary snow should never be his wife and therefore considered it wise to lose no time in making such arrangements as might be necessary both for his release and for hers but nevertheless he had not the heart to go about the work the moment that he left her he passed by the apothecarys and looking in saw a young man working sedulously at a pestle if albert fitzallen were fit to be her husband and willing to be so poor as he was himself he would still make some pecuniary sacrifice by which he might quiet his own conscience and make marys marriage possible he still had a sum of £1200 belonging to him that being all his remaining capital and the half of that he would give to mary as her dower so in two days he returned and again looking in at the doctors shop again saw the young man at his work  yes sir my name is albert fitzallen said the medical aspirant coming round the counter there was no one else in the shop and felix hardly knew how to accost him on so momentous a subject while he was still in charge of all that store of medicine and liable to be called away at any moment to relieve the ailments of clapham albert fitzallen was a palefaced lighthaired youth with an incipient moustache with his hair parted in equal divisions over his forehead with elaborate shirtcuffs elaborately turned back and with a white apron tied round him so that he might pursue his vocation without injury to his nether garments his face however was not bad nor mean and had there not been about him a little air of pretension assumed perhaps to carry off the combined apron and beard felix would have regarded him altogether with favourable eyes  is it in the medical way asked fitzallen when graham suggested that he should step out with him for a few minutes graham explained that it was not in the medical waythat it was in a way altogether of a private nature and then the young man pulling off his apron and wiping his hands on a thoroughly medicated towel invoked the master of the establishment from an inner room and in a few minutes mary snows two lovers were walking together side by side along the causeway  i believe you know miss snow said felix rushing at once into the middle of all those delicate circumstances  albert fitzallen drew himself up and declared that he had that honour  i also know her said felix my name is felix graham  oh sir very well said albert the street in which they were standing was desolate and the young man was able to assume a look of decided hostility without encountering any other eyes than those of his rival if you have anything to say to me sir i am quite prepared to listen to youto listen to you and to answer you i have heard your name mentioned by miss snow and albert fitzallen stood his ground as though he were at once going to cover himself with his pistol arm  yes i know you have mary has told me what has passed between you you may regard me mr fitzallen as marys best and surest friend  i know you have been a friend to her i am aware of that but mr graham if you will allow me to say so friendship is one thing and the warm love of a devoted bosom is another  quite so said felix  a womans heart is a treasure not to be bought by any efforts of friendship said fitzallen  i fully agree with you there said graham  far be it from me to make any boast continued the other or even to hint that i have gained a place in that ladys affections i know my own position too well and say proudly that i am existing only on hope here to show his pride he hit himself with his closed fist on his shirtfront but mr graham i am free to declare even in your presence though you may be her best and surest friendand there was not wanting from the tone of his voice a strong flavour of scorn as he repeated these wordsthat i do exist on hope let your claims be what they will if you desire to make such hope on my part a cause of quarrel i have nothing to say against it and then he twirled all that he could twirl of that incipient moustache  by no means said graham  oh very well said fitzallen then we understand that the arena of love is open to us both i do not fail to appreciate the immense advantages which you enjoy in this struggle and then fitzallen looked up into grahams ugly face and thought of his own appearance in the lookingglass  what i want to know is this said felix if you marry mary snow what means have you of maintaining her would your mother receive her into her house i presume you are not a partner in that shop but would it be possible to get you in as a partner supposing mary were to marry you and had a little money as her fortune  eh said albert dropping his look of pride allowing his hand to fall from his lips and standing still before his companion with his mouth wide open  of course you mean honestly by dear mary  oh sir yes on the honour of a gentleman my intentions sir are mr graham i love that young lady with a devotion of heart thatthatthat then you dont mean to marry her yourself eh mr graham  no mr fitzallen i do not and now if you will so far confide in me we will talk over your prospects  oh very well im sure you are very kind but miss snow did tell me  yes i know she did and she was quite right but as you said just now a womans heart cannot be bought by friendship i have not been a bad friend to mary but i had no right to expect that i could win her love in that way whether or no you may be able to succeed i will not say but i have abandoned the pursuit in all which graham intended to be exceedingly honest but was in truth rather hypocritical  then the course is open to me said fitzallen  yes the course is open answered graham  but the race has still to be run dont you think that miss snow is of her nature veryvery cold  felix remembered the one kiss beneath the lamppostthe one kiss given and received he remembered also that marys acquaintance with the gentleman must necessarily have been short and he made no answer to this question but he made a comparison what would madeline have said and done had he attempted such an iniquity and he thought of her flashing eyes and terrible scorn of the utter indignation of all the staveley family and of the wretched abyss into which the offender would have fallen  he brought back the subject at once to the young mans means to his mother and to the doctors shop and though he learned nothing that was very promising neither did he learn anything that was the reverse albert fitzallen did not ride a very high horse when he learned that his supposed rival was so anxious to assist him he was quite willing to be guided by graham and in that matter of the proposed partnership was sure that old balsam the owner of the business would be glad to take a sum of money down he has a son of his own said albert but he dont take to it at all hes gone into wine and spirits but he dont sell half as much as he drinks  felix then proposed that he should call on mrs fitzallen and to this albert gave a blushing consent mother has heard of it said albert but i dont exactly know how perhaps mrs fitzallen was as attentive as mrs thomas had been to stray documents packed away in odd places and i suppose i may call ononmary asked the lover as graham took his leave but felix could give no authority for this and explained that mrs thomas might be found to be a dragon still guarding the hesperides would it not be better to wait till marys father had been informed and then if all things went well he might prosecute the affair in due form and as an acknowledged lover  all this was very nice and as it was quite unexpected fitzallen could not but regard himself as a fortunate young man he had never contemplated the possibility of mary snow being an heiress and when his mother had spoken to him of the hopelessness of his passion she had suggested that he might perhaps marry his mary in five or six years now the dearest wish of his heart was brought close within his reach and he must have been a happy man but yet though this certainly was so nevertheless there was a feeling of coldness about his love and almost of disappointment as he again took his place behind the counter the sorrows of lydia in the play when she finds that her passion meets with general approbation are very absurd but nevertheless are quite true to nature lovers would be great losers if the path of love were always to run smooth under such a dispensation indeed there would probably be no lovers the matter would be too tame albert did not probably bethink himself of a becoming disguise as did lydiaof an amiable ladder of ropes of a conscious moon or a scotch parson but he did feel in some undefined manner that the romance of his life had been taken away from him five minutes under a lamppost with mary snow was sweeter to him than the promise of a whole bevy of evenings spent in the same society with all the comforts of his mothers drawingroom around him ah yes dear readersmy male readers of course i meanwere not those minutes under the lamppost always very pleasant  but graham encountered none of this feeling when he discussed the same subject with alberts mother she was sufficiently alive to the material view of the matter and knew how much of a mans married happiness depends on his supplies of bread and butter six hundred pounds mr graham was very kindvery kind indeed she hadnt a word to say against mary snow she had seen her and thought her very pretty and modest looking albert was certainly warmly attached to the young lady of that she was quite certain and she would say this of albertthat a betterdisposed young man did not exist anywhere he came home quite regular to his meals and spent ten hours a day behind the counter in mr balsams shopten hours a day sundays included which mrs fitzallen regarded as a great drawback to the medical lineas should i also most undoubtedly but six hundred pounds would make a great difference mrs fitzallen little doubted but that sum would tempt mr balsam into a partnership or perhaps the five hundred leaving one hundred for furniture in such a case albert would spend his sundays at home of course after that so much having been settled felix graham got into an omnibus and took himself back to his own chambers  so far was so good this idea of a model wife had already become a very expensive idea and in winding it up to its natural conclusion poor graham was willing to spend almost every shilling that he could call his own but there was still another difficulty in his way what would snow père say snow père was he knew a man with whom dealings would be more difficult than with albert fitzallen and then seeing that he had already promised to give his remaining possessions to albert fitzallen with what could he bribe snow père to abandon that natural ambition to have a barrister for his soninlaw in these days too snow père had derogated even from the position in which graham had first known him and had become but little better than a drunken begging impostor what a fatherinlaw to have had and then felix graham thought of judge staveley  he sent however to the engraver and the man was not long in obeying the summons in latter days graham had not seen him frequently having bestowed his alms through mary and was shocked at the unmistakable evidence of the ginshop which the mans appearance and voice betrayed how dreadful to the sight are those watery eyes that red uneven pimpled nose those fallen cheeks and that hanging slobbered mouth look at the uncombed hair the beard half shorn the weak impotent gait of the man and the tattered raiment all eloquent of gin you would fain hold your nose when he comes nigh you he carries with him so foul an evidence of his only and his hourly indulgence you would do so had you not still a respect for his feelings which he himself has entirely forgotten to maintain how terrible is that absolute loss of all personal dignity which the drunkard is obliged to undergo and then his voice every tone has been formed by gin and tells of the havoc which the compound has made within his throat i do not know whether such a man as this is not the vilest thing which grovels on gods earth there are women whom we affect to scorn with the full power of our contempt but i doubt whether any woman sinks to a depth so low as that she also may be a drunkard and as such may more nearly move our pity and affect our hearts but i do not think she ever becomes so nauseous a thing as the man that has abandoned all the hopes of life for gin you can still touch heray and if the task be in ones way can touch her gently striving to bring her back to decency but the other well one should be willing to touch him too to make that attempt of bringing back upon him also i can only say that the task is both nauseous and unpromising look at him as he stands there before the foul reeking sloppy bar with the glass in his hand which he has just emptied see the grimace with which he puts it down as though the dram had been almost too unpalatable it is the last touch of hypocrisy with which he attempts to cover the offenceas though he were to say i do it for my stomachs sake but you know how i abhor it then he skulks sullenly away speaking a word to no oneshuffling with his feet shaking himself in his foul rags pressing himself into a heapas though striving to drive the warmth of the spirit into his extremities and there he stands lounging at the corner of the street till his short patience is exhausted and he returns with his last penny for the other glass when that has been swallowed the policeman is his guardian  reader such as you and i have come to that when abandoned by the respect which a man owes to himself may god in his mercy watch over us and protect us both  such a man was snow père as he stood before graham in his chambers in the temple he could not ask him to sit down so he himself stood up as he talked to him at first the man was civil twirling his old hat about and shifting from one foot to the othervery civil and also somewhat timid for he knew that he was half drunk at the moment but when he began to ascertain what was grahams object in sending for him and to understand that the gentleman before him did not propose to himself the honour of being his soninlaw then his civility left him and drunk as he was he spoke out his mind with sufficient freedom  you mean to say mr grahamand under the effect of gin he turned the name into gormthat you are going to throw that young girl over  i mean to say no such thing i shall do for her all that is in my power and if that is not as much as she deserves it will at any rate be more than you deserve for her  and you wont marry her  no i shall not marry her nor does she wish it i trust that she will be engaged with my full approbation  and what the deuce sir is your full approbation to me whose child is she i should like to know look here mr gorm perhaps you forget that you wrote me this letter when i allowed you to have the charge of that young girl and he took out from his breast a very greasy pocketbook and displayed to felix his own muchworn letterholding it however at a distance so that it should not be torn from his hands by any sudden raid do you think sir i would have given up my child if i didnt know she was to be married respectable my child is as dear to me as another mans  i hope she is and you are a very lucky fellow to have her so well provided for ive told you all ive got to say and now you may go  mr gorm  ive nothing more to say and if i had i would not say it to you now your child shall be taken care of  thats what i call pretty cool on the part of any genleman and youre to break your worda regular breach of promise and nothing aint to come of it ill tell you what mr gorm youll find that something will come of it what do you think i took this letter for  you took it i hope for marys protection  and by  she shall be protected  she shall undoubtedly but i fear not by you for the present i will protect her and i hope that soon a husband will do so who will love her now mr snow ive told you all ive got to say and i must trouble you to leave me  nevertheless there were many more words between them before graham could find himself alone in his chambers though snow père might be a thought tipsya sheet or so in the wind as folks say he was not more tipsy than was customary with him and knew pretty well what he was about and what am i to do with myself mr gorm he asked in a snivelling voice when the idea began to strike him that it might perhaps be held by the courts of law that his intended soninlaw was doing well by his daughter  work said graham turning upon him sharply and almost fiercely  thats all very well its very well to say work  youll find it well to do it too work and dont drink you hardly think i suppose that if i had married your daughter i should have found myself obliged to support you in idleness  it would have been a great comfort in my old age to have had a daughters house to go to said snow naïvely and now reduced to lachrymose distress  but when he found that felix would do nothing for him that he would not on the present occasion lend him a sovereign or even half a crown he again became indignant and paternal and in this state of mind was turned out of the room  heaven and earth said felix to himself clenching his hands and striking the table with both of them at the same moment that was the man with whom he had proposed to link himself in the closest ties of family connection albert fitzallen did not know mr snow but it might be a question whether it would not be grahams duty to introduce them to each other     chapter lviii  miss staveley declines to eat minced veal   the house at noningsby was now very quiet all the visitors had gone including even the arbuthnots felix graham and sophia furnival that terrible pair of guests had relieved mrs staveley of their presence but alas the mischief they had done remained behind them the house was very quiet for augustus and the judge were up in town during the greater part of the week and madeline and her mother were alone the judge was to come back to noningsby but once before he commenced the circuit which was to terminate at alston and it seemed to be acknowledged now on all sides that nothing more of importance was to be done or said in that locality until after lady masons trial  it may be imagined that poor madeline was not very happy felix had gone away having made no sign and she knew that her mother rejoiced that he had so gone she never accused her mother of cruelty even within her own heart she seemed to realise to herself the assurance that a marriage with the man she loved was a happiness which she had no right to expect she knew that her father was rich she was aware that in all probability her own fortune would be considerable she was quite sure that felix graham was clever and fit to make his way through the world and yet she did not think it hard that she should be separated from him she acknowledged from the very first that he was not the sort of man whom she ought to have loved and therefore she was prepared to submit  it was no doubt the fact that felix graham had never whispered to her a word of love and that therefore on that ground she had no excuse for hope but had that been all she would not have despaired had that been all she might have doubted but her doubt would have been strongly mingled with the sweetness of hope he had never whispered a syllable of love but she had heard the tone of his voice as she spoke a word to him at his chamber door she had seen his eyes as they fell on her when he was lifted into the carriage she had felt the tremor of his touch on that evening when she walked up to him across the drawingroom and shook hands with him such a girl as madeline staveley does not analyze her feelings on such a matter and then draw her conclusions but a conclusion is drawn the mind does receive an impression and the conclusion and impression are as true as though they had been reached by the aid of logical reasoning had the match been such as her mother would have approved she would have had a hope as to felix grahams lovestrong enough for happiness  as it was there was no use in hoping and therefore she resolvedhaving gone through much logical reasoning on this headthat by her all ideas of love must be abandoned as regarded herself she must be content to rest by her mothers side as a flower ungathered that she could marry no man without the approval of her father and mother was a thing to her quite certain but it was at any rate as certain that she could marry no man without her own approval felix graham was beyond her reach that verdict she herself pronounced and to it she submitted but peregrine orme was still more distant from herperegrine orme or any other of the curled darlings who might come that way playing the part of a suitor she knew what she owed to her mother but she also knew her own privileges  there was nothing said on the subject between the mother and child during three days lady staveley was more than ordinarily affectionate to her daughter and in that way made known the thoughts which were oppressing her but she did so in no other way all this madeline understood and thanked her mother with the sweetest smiles and the most constant companionship nor was she even now absolutely unhappy or wretchedly miserable as under such circumstances would be the case with many girls she knew all that she was prepared to abandon but she understood also how much remained to her her life was her own and with her life the energy to use it her soul was free and her heart though burdened with love could endure its load without sinking let him go forth on his career she would remain in the shade and be contented while she watched it  so strictly wise and philosophically serene had madeline become within a few days of grahams departure that she snubbed poor mrs baker when that goodnatured and sharpwitted housekeeper said a word or two in praise of her late patient  we are very lonely aint we miss without mr graham to look after said mrs baker  im sure we are all very glad that he has so far recovered as to be able to be moved  thats in coursethough i still say that he went before he ought he was such a nice gentleman where theres one better theres twenty worse and as full of cleverness as an eggs full of meat in answer to which madeline said nothing  at any rate miss madeline you ought to say a word for him continued mrs baker for he used to worship the sound of your voice ive known him lay there and listen listen listen for your very footfall  how can you talk such stuff mrs baker you have never known anything of the kindand even if he had how could you know it you should not talk such nonsense to me and i beg you wont again then she went away and began to read a paper about sick people written by florence nightingale  but it was by no means lady staveleys desire that her daughter should take to the florence nightingale line of life the charities of noningsby were done on a large scale in a quiet handsome methodical manner and were regarded by the mistress of the mansion as a very material part of her lifes duty but she would have been driven distracted had she been told that a daughter of hers was about to devote herself exclusively to charity her ideas of general religion were the same morning and evening prayers church twice on sundays attendance at the lords table at any rate once a month were to herselfand in her estimation for her own familyessentials of life and they had on her their practical effects she was not given to backbitingthough when stirred by any motive near to her own belongings she would say an illnatured word or two she was mild and forbearing to her inferiors her hand was open to the poor she was devoted to her husband and her children in no respect was she selfseeking or selfindulgent but nevertheless she appreciated thoroughly the comforts of a good incomefor herself and for her children she liked to see nicedressed and nicemannered people about her preferring those whose fathers and mothers were nice before them she liked to go about in her own carriage comfortably she liked the feeling that her husband was a judge and that he and she were therefore above other lawyers and other lawyers wives she would not like to have seen mrs furnival walk out of a room before her nor perhaps to see sophia furnival when married take precedence of her own married daughter she liked to live in a large place like noningsby and preferred country society to that of the neighbouring town  it will be said that i have drawn an impossible character and depicted a woman who served both god and mammon to this accusation i will not plead but will ask my accusers whether in their lifes travail they have met no such ladies as lady staveley  but such as she was whether good or bad she had no desire whatever that her daughter should withdraw herself from the world and give up to sick women what was meant for mankind her idea of a womans duties comprehended the birth bringing up education and settlement in life of children also due attendance upon a husband with a close regard to his special taste in cookery there was her granddaughter marian she was already thinking what sort of a wife she would make and what commencements of education would best fit her to be a good mother it is hardly too much to say that marians future children were already a subject of care to her such being her disposition it was by no means matter of joy to her when she found that madeline was laying out for herself little ways of life tending in some slight degree to the monastic nothing was said about it but she fancied that madeline had doffed a ribbon or two in her usual evening attire that she read during certain fixed hours in the morning was very manifest as to that daily afternoon service at four oclockshe had very often attended that and it was hardly worthy of remark that she now went to it every day but there seemed at this time to be a monotonous regularity about her visits to the poor which told to lady staveleys mindshe hardly knew what tale she herself visited the poor seeing some of them almost daily if it was foul weather they came to her and if it was fair weather she went to them but madeline without saying a word to any one had adopted a plan of going out exactly at the same hour with exactly the same object in all sorts of weather all this made lady staveley uneasy and then by way of counterpoise she talked of balls and offered madeline carte blanche as to a new dress for that special one which would grace the assizes i dont think i shall go said madeline and thus lady staveley became really unhappy would not felix graham be better than no soninlaw when some one had once very strongly praised florence nightingale in lady staveleys presence she had stoutly declared her opinion that it was a young womans duty to get married for myself i am inclined to agree with her then came the second friday after grahams departure and lady staveley observed as she and her daughter sat at dinner alone that madeline would eat nothing but potatoes and seakale my dear you will be ill if you dont eat some meat  oh no i shall not said madeline with her prettiest smile  but you always used to like minced veal  so i do but i wont have any today mamma thank you  then lady staveley resolved that she would tell the judge that felix graham bad as he might be might come there if he pleased even felix graham would be better than no soninlaw at all  on the following day the saturday the judge came down with augustus to spend his last sunday at home before the beginning of his circuit and some little conversation respecting felix graham did take place between him and his wife  if they are both really fond of each other they had better marry said the judge curtly  but it is terrible to think of their having no income said his wife  we must get them an income youll find that graham will fall on his legs at last  hes a very long time before he begins to use them said lady staveley and then you know the cleeve is such a nice property and mr orme is  but my love it seems that she does not like mr orme  no she doesnt said the poor mother in a tone of voice that was very lachrymose but if she would only wait she might like himmight she not now he is such a very handsome young man  if you ask me i dont think his beauty will do it  i dont suppose she cares for that sort of thing said lady staveley almost crying but im sure of this if she were to go and make a nun of herself it would break my heartit would indeed i should never hold up my head again  what could lady staveleys idea have been of the sorrows of some other mothers whose daughters throw themselves away after a different fashion  after lunch on sunday the judge asked his daughter to walk with him and on that occasion the second church service was abandoned she got on her bonnet and gloves her walkingboots and winter shawl and putting her arm happily and comfortably within his started for what she knew would be a long walk  well get as far as the bottom of cleeve hill said the judge  now the bottom of cleeve hill by the path across the fields and the common was five miles from noningsby  oh as for that ill walk to the top if you like said madeline  if you do my dear youll have to go up alone said the judge and so they started  there was a crisp sharp enjoyment attached to a long walk with her father which madeline always loved and on the present occasion she was willing to be very happy but as she started with her arm beneath his she feared she knew not what she had a secret and her father might touch upon it she had a sore though it was not an unwholesome festering sore and her father might probe the wound there was therefore the slightest shade of hypocrisy in the alacrity with which she prepared herself and in the pleasant tone of her voice as she walked down the avenue towards the gate  but by the time that they had gone a mile when their feet had left the road and were pressing the grassy fieldpath there was no longer any hypocrisy in her happiness madeline believed that no human being could talk as did her father and on this occasion he came out with his freshest thoughts and his brightest wit nor did he by any means have the talk all to himself the delight of judge staveleys conversation consisted chiefly in thatthat though he might bring on to the carpet all the wit and all the information going he rarely uttered much beyond his own share of words and now they talked of pictures and politicsof the new gallery that was not to be built at charing cross and the great onslaught which was not to end in the dismissal of ministers and then they got to booksto novels new poetry magazines essays and reviews and with the slightest touch of pleasant sarcasm the judge passed sentence on the latest efforts of his literary contemporaries and thus at last they settled down on a certain paper which had lately appeared in a certain quarterlya paper on a grave subject which had been much discussedand the judge on a sudden stayed his hand and spared his raillery you have not heard i suppose who wrote that said he no madeline had not heard she would much like to know when young people begin their world of reading there is nothing so pleasant to them as knowing the little secrets of literature who wrote this and that of which folk are then talkingwho manages this periodical and puts the salt and pepper into those reviews the judge always knew these events of the inner literary world and would communicate them freely to madeline as they walked no there was no longer the slightest touch of hypocrisy in her pleasant manner and eager voice as she answered no papa i have not heard was it mr soandso and she named an ephemeral literary giant of the day no said the judge it was not soandso but yet you might guess as you know the gentleman then the slight shade of hypocrisy came upon her again in a moment she couldnt guess she said she didnt know but as she thus spoke the tone of her voice was altered that article said the judge was written by felix graham it is uncommonly clever and yet there are a great many people who abuse it  and now all conversation was stopped poor madeline who had been so ready with her questions so eager with her answers so communicative and so inquiring was stricken dumb on the instant she had ceased for some time to lean upon his arm and therefore he could not feel her hand tremble and he was too generous and too kind to look into her face but he knew that he had touched the fibres of her heart and that all her presence of mind had for the moment fled from her of course such was the case and of course he knew it had he not brought her out there that they might be alone together when he subjected her to the violence of this showerbath  yes he continued that was written by our friend graham do you remember madeline the conversation which you and i had about him in the library some time since  yes she said she remembered it  and so do i said the judge and have thought much about it since a very clever fellow is felix graham there can be no doubt of that  is he said madeline  i am inclined to think that the judge also had lost something of his presence of mind or at least of his usual power of conversation he had brought his daughter out there with the express purpose of saying to her a special word or two he had beat very wide about the bush with the view of mentioning a certain name and now that his daughter was there and the name had been mentioned it seemed that he hardly knew how to proceed  yes he is clever enough repeated the judge clever enough and of high principles and an honest purpose the fault which people find with him is thisthat he is not practical he wont take the world as he finds it if he can mend it well and good we all ought to do something to mend it but while we are mending it we must live in it  yes we must live in it said madeline who hardly knew at the moment whether it would be better to live or die in it had her father remarked that they must all take wings and fly to heaven she would have assented  then the judge walked on a few paces in silence bethinking himself that he might as well speak out at once the words which he had to say madeline my darling said he have you the courage to tell me openly what you think of felix graham  what i think of him papa  yes my child it may be that you are in some difficulty at this moment and that i can help you it may be that your heart is sadder than it would be if you knew all my thoughts and wishes respecting you and all your mothers i have never had many secrets from my children madeline and i should be pleased now if you could see into my mind and know all my thoughts and wishes as they regard you  dear papa  to see you happyyou and augustus and isabellathat is now our happiness not to see you rich or great high position and a plentiful income are great blessings in this world so that they be achieved without a stain but even in this world they are not the greatest blessings there are things much sweeter than them as he said this madeline did not attempt to answer him but she put her arm once more within his and clung to his side  money and rank are only good if every step by which they are gained be good also i should never blush to see my girl the wife of a poor man whom she loved but i should be stricken to the core of my heart if i knew that she had become the wife of a rich man whom she did not love  papa she said clinging to him she had meant to assure him that that sorrow should never be his but she could not get beyond the one word  if you love this man let him come said the judge carried by his feelings somewhat beyond the point to which he had intended to go i know no harm of him i know nothing but good of him if you are sure of your own heart let it be so he shall be to me as another sonto me and to your mother tell me madeline shall it be so  she was sure enough of her own heart but how was she to be sure of that other heart it shall be so said her father but a man could not be turned into a lover and a husband because she and her father agreed to desire itnot even if her mother would join in that wish she had confessed to her mother that she loved this man and the confession had been repeated to her father but she had never expressed even a hope that she was loved in return but he has never spoken to me papa she said whispering the words ever so softly lest the winds should carry them  no i know he has never spoken to you said the judge he told me so himself i like him the better for that  so then there had been other communications made besides that which she had made to her mother mr graham had spoken to her father and had spoken to him about her in what way had he done this and how had he spoken what had been his object and when had it been done had she been indiscreet and allowed him to read her secret and then a horrid thought came across her mind was he to come there and offer her his hand because he pitied and was sorry for her the friday fastings and the evening church and the sick visits would be better far than that she could not however muster courage to ask her father any question as to that interview between him and mr graham  well my love he said i know it is impertinent to ask a young lady to speak on such a subject but fathers are impertinent be frank with me i have told you what i think and your mamma agrees with me young mr orme would have been her favourite  oh papa that is impossible  so i perceive my dear and therefore we will say no more about it i only mention his name because i want you to understand that you may speak to your mamma quite openly on the subject he is a fine young fellow is peregrine orme  im sure he is papa  but that is no reason you should marry him if you dont like him  i could never like himin that way  very well my dear there is an end of that and im sorry for him i think that if i had been a young man at the cleeve i should have done just the same and now let us decide this important question when master grahams ribs arms and collar bones are a little stronger shall we ask him to come back to noningsby  if you please papa  very well well have him here for the assize week poor fellow hell have a hard job of work on hand just then and wont have much time for philandering with chaffanbrass to watch him on his own side and leatherham on the other i dont envy him his position i almost think i should keep my arm in the sling till the assizes were over by way of exciting a little pity  is mr graham going to defend lady mason  to help to do so my dear  but papa she is innocent dont you feel sure of that  the judge was not quite so sure as he had been once however he said nothing of his doubts to madeline mr grahams task on that account will only be the more trying if it becomes difficult to establish her innocence  poor lady said madeline you wont be the judge will you papa  no certainly not i would have preferred to have gone any other circuit than to have presided in a case affecting so near a neighbour and i may almost say a friend baron maltby will sit in that court  and will mr graham have to do much papa  it will be an occasion of very great anxiety to him no doubt and then they began to return homemadeline forming a little plan in her mind by which mr furnival and mr chaffanbrass were to fail absolutely in making out that ladys innocence but the fact was to be established to the satisfaction of the whole court and of all the world by the judicious energy of felix graham  on their homeward journey the judge again spoke of pictures and books of failures and successes and madeline listened to him gratefully but she did not again take much part in the conversation she could not now express a very fluent opinion on any subject and to tell the truth could have been well satisfied to have been left entirely to her own thoughts but just before they came out again upon the road her father stopped her and asked a direct question tell me madeline are you happy now  illustration tell me madeline are you happy now  yes papa  that is right and what you are to understand is this mr graham will now be privileged by your mother and me to address you he has already asked my permission to do so and i told him that i must consider the matter before i either gave it or withheld it i shall now give him that permission whereupon madeline made her answer by a slight pressure upon his arm  but you may be sure of this my dear i shall be very discreet and commit you to nothing if he should choose to ask you any question you will be at liberty to give him any answer that you may think fit but madeline at once confessed to herself that no such liberty remained to her if mr graham should choose to ask her a certain question it would be in her power to give him only one answer had he been kept away had her father told her that such a marriage might not be she would not have broken her heart she had already told herself that under such circumstances she could live and still live contented but nownow if the siege were made the town would have to capitulate at the first shot was it not an understood thing that the governor had been recommended by the king to give up the keys as soon as they were asked for  you will tell your mamma of this my dear said the judge as they were entering their own gate  yes said madeline but she felt that in this matter her father was more surely her friend than her mother and indeed she could understand her mothers opposition to poor felix much better than her fathers acquiescence  do my dear what is anything to us in this world if we are not all happy together she thinks that you have become sad and she must know that you are so no longer  but i have not been sad papa said madeline thinking with some pride of her past heroism  when they reached the halldoor she had one more question to ask but she could not look in her fathers face as she asked  papa is that review you were speaking of here at noningsby  you will find it on my study table but remember madeline i dont above half go along with him  the judge went into his study before dinner and found that the review had been taken     chapter lix  no surrender   sir peregrine orme had gone up to london had had his interview with mr round and had failed he had then returned home and hardly a word on the subject had been spoken between him and mrs orme indeed little or nothing was now said between them as to lady mason or the trial what was the use of speaking on a subject that was in every way the cause of so much misery he had made up his mind that it was no longer possible for him to take any active step in the matter he had become bail for her appearance in court and that was the last trifling act of friendship which he could show her how was it any longer possible that he could befriend her he could not speak up on her behalf with eager voice and strong indignation against her enemies as had formerly been his practice he could give her no counsel his counsel would have taught her to abandon the property in the first instance let the result be what it might he had made his little effort in that direction by seeing the attorney and his little effort had been useless it was quite clear to him that there was nothing further for him to donothing further for him who but a week or two since was so actively putting himself forward and letting the world know that he was lady masons champion  would he have to go into court as a witness his mind was troubled much in his endeavour to answer that question he had been her great friend for years he had been her nearest neighbour his daughterinlaw still clung to her she had lived at his house she had been chosen to be his wife who could speak to her character if he could not do so and yet what could he say if so called on mr furnival mr chaffanbrassall those who would have the selection of the witnesses believing themselves in their clients innocence as no doubt they did would of course imagine that he believed in it also could he tell them that it would not be in his power to utter a single word in her favour  in these days mrs orme went daily to the farm indeed she never missed a day from that on which lady mason left the cleeve up to the time of the trial it seemed to sir peregrine that his daughters affection for this woman had grown with the knowledge of her guilt but as i have said before no discussion on the matter now took place between them mrs orme would generally take some opportunity of saying that she had been at orley farm but that was all  sir peregrine during this time never left the house once except for morning service on sundays he hung his hat up on its accustomed peg when he returned from that illomened visit to mr round and did not move it for days ay for weeksexcept on sunday mornings at first his groom would come to him suggesting to him that he should ride and the woodman would speak to him about the young coppices but after a few days they gave up their efforts his grandson also strove to take him out speaking to him more earnestly than the servants would do but it was of no avail peregrine indeed gave up the attempt sooner for to him his grandfather did in some sort confess his own weakness i have had a blow said he peregrine i have had a blow i am too old to bear up against ittoo old and too weak peregrine knew that he alluded in some way to that proposed marriage but he was quite in the dark as to the manner in which his grandfather had been affected by it  people think nothing of that now sir said he groping in the dark as he strove to administer consolation  people will think of itand i think of it but never mind my boy i have lived my life and am contented with it i have lived my life and have great joy that such as you are left behind to take my place if i had really injured you i should have broken my hearthave broken my heart  peregrine of course assured him that let what would come to him the pride which he had in his grandfather would always support him i dont know anybody else that i could be so proud of said peregrine for nobody else that i see thinks so much about other people and i always was even when i didnt seem to think much about italways  poor peregrine circumstances had somewhat altered him since that day now not more than six months ago in which he had pledged himself to abandon the delights of cowcross street as long as there was a hope for him with madeline staveley all this might be very well he preferred madeline to cowcross street with all its delights but when there should be no longer any hopeand indeed as things went now there was but little ground for hopingwhat then might it not be that his trial had come on him too early in life and that he would solace himself in his disappointment if not with carroty bob with companionships and pursuits which would be as objectionable and perhaps more expensive  on three or four occasions his grandfather asked him how things were going at noningsby striving to interest himself in something as to which the outlook was not altogether dismal and by degrees learnednot exactly all the truthbut as much of the truth as peregrine knew  do as she tells you said the grandfather referring to lady staveleys last words  i suppose i must said peregrine sadly theres nothing else for it but if theres anything that i hate in this world its waiting  you are both very young said his grandfather  yes we are what people call young i suppose but i dont understand all that why isnt a fellow to be happy when hes young as well as when hes old  sir peregrine did not answer him but no doubt thought that he might alter his opinion in a few years there is great doubt as to what may be the most enviable time of life with a man i am inclined to think that it is at that period when his children have all been born but have not yet began to go astray or to vex him with disappointment when his own pecuniary prospects are settled and he knows pretty well what his tether will allow him when the appetite is still good and the digestive organs at their full power when he has ceased to care as to the length of his girdle and before the doctor warns him against solid breakfasts and port wine after dinner when his affectations are over and his infirmities have not yet come upon him while he can still walk his ten miles and feel some little pride in being able to do so while he has still nerve to ride his horse to hounds and can look with some scorn on the ignorance of younger men who have hardly yet learned that noble art as regards men this i think is the happiest time of life but who shall answer the question as regards women in this respect their lot is more liable to disappointment with the choicest flowers that blow the sweetest aroma of their perfection lasts but for a moment the hour that sees them at their fullest glory sees also the beginning of their fall  on one morning before the trial sir peregrine rang his bell and requested that mr peregrine might be asked to come to him mr peregrine was out at the moment and did not make his appearance much before dark but the baronet had fully resolved upon having this interview and ordered that the dinner should be put back for half an hour tell mrs orme with my compliments he said that if it does not put her to inconvenience we will not dine till seven it put mrs orme to no inconvenience but i am inclined to agree with the cook who remarked that the compliments ought to have been sent to her  sit down peregrine he said when his grandson entered his room with his thick boots and muddy gaiters i have been thinking of something  i and samson have been cutting down trees all day said peregrine youve no conception how the water lies down in the bottom there and theres a fall every yard down to the river its a sin not to drain it  any sins of that kind my boy shall lie on your own head for the future i will wash my hands of them  then ill go to work at once said peregrine not quite understanding his grandfather  you must go to work on more than that peregrine and then the old man paused you must not think that i am doing this because i am unhappy for the hour or that i shall repent it when the moment has gone by  doing what asked peregrine  i have thought much of it and i know that i am right i cannot get out as i used to do and do not care to meet people about business  i never knew you more clearheaded in my life sir  well perhaps not well say nothing about that what i intend to do is thisto give up the property into your hands at ladyday you shall be master of the cleeve from that time forth  sir  the truth is you desire employment and i dont the property is small and therefore wants the more looking after i have never had a regular land steward but have seen to that myself if youll take my advice youll do the same there is no better employment for a gentleman so now my boy you may go to work and drain wherever you like about that crutchley bottom i have no doubt youre right i dont know why it has been neglected these last words the baronet uttered in a weak melancholy tone asking as it were forgiveness for his fault whereas he had spoken out the purport of his great resolution with a clear strong voice as though the saying of the words pleased him well  i could not hear of such a thing as that said his grandson after a short pause  but you have heard it perry and you may be quite sure that i should not have named it had i not fully resolved upon it i have been thinking of it for days and have quite made up my mind you wont turn me out of the house i know  all the same i will not hear of it said the young man stoutly  peregrine  i know very well what it all means sir and i am not at all astonished you have wished to do something out of sheer goodness of heart and you have been balked  we will not talk about that peregrine  but i must say a few words about it all that has made you unhappy andandand he wanted to explain that his grandfather was ashamed of his baffled attempt and for that reason was cowed and down at heart at the present moment but that in the three or four months when this trial would be over and the wonder passed away all that would be forgotten and he would be again as well as ever but peregrine though he understood all this was hardly able to express himself  my boy said the old man i know very well what you mean what you say is partly true and partly not quite true some day perhaps when we are sitting here together over the fire i shall be better able to talk over all this but not now perry god has been very good to me and given me so much that i will not repine at this sorrow i have lived my life and am content  oh yes of course all thats true enough and if god should choose that you shoulddie you know or i either some people would be sorry but we shouldnt complain ourselves but what i say is this you should never give up as long as you live theres a sort of feeling about it which i cant explain one should always say to oneself no surrender and peregrine as he spoke stood up from his chair thrust his hands into his trouserpockets and shook his head  illustration no surrender  sir peregrine smiled as he answered him but perry my boy we cant always say that when the heart and the spirit and the body have all surrendered why should the voice tell a foolish falsehood  but it shouldnt be a falsehood said peregrine nobody should ever knock under of his own accord  you are quite right there my boy you are quite right there stick to that yourself but remember that you are not to knock under to any of your enemies the worst that you will meet with are folly and vice and extravagance  thats of course said peregrine by no means wishing on the present occasion to bring under discussion his future contests with any such enemies as those now named by his grandfather  and now suppose you dress for dinner said the baronet ive got ahead of you there you see what ive told you today i have already told your mother  im sure she doesnt think you right  if she thinks me wrong she is too kind and wellbehaved to say sowhich is more than i can say for her son your mother perry never told me that i was wrong yet though she has had many occasionstoo many too many but come go and dress for dinner  you are wrong in this sir if ever you were wrong in your life said peregrine leaving the room his grandfather did not answer him again but followed him out of the door and walked briskly across the hall into the drawingroom  theres peregrine been lecturing me about draining he said to his daughterinlaw striving to speak in a halfbantering tone of voice as though things were going well with him  lecturing you said mrs orme  and hes right too theres nothing like it hell make a better farmer i take it than lucius mason youll live to see him know the value of an acre of land as well as any man in the county its the very thing that hes fit for hell do better with the property than ever i did  there was something beautiful in the effort which the old man was making when watched by the eyes of one who knew him as well as did his daughterinlaw she knew him and understood all the workings of his mind and the deep sorrow of his heart in very truth the star of his life was going out darkly under a cloud but he was battling against his sorrow and shamenot that he might be rid of them himself but that others might not have to share them that doctrine of no surrender was strong within his bosom and he understood the motto in a finer sense than that in which his grandson had used it he would not tell them that his heart was brokennot if he could help it he would not display his wound if it might be in his power to hide it he would not confess that lands and houses and seignorial functions were no longer of value in his eyes as far as might be possible he would bear his own load till that and the memory of his last folly might be hidden together in the grave  but he knew that he was no longer fit for a mans work and that it would be well that he should abandon it he had made a terrible mistake in his old age he had gambled for a large stake and had lost it all he had ventured to loveto increase the small number of those who were nearest and dearest to him to add one to those whom he regarded as best and purestand he had been terribly deceived he had for many years almost worshipped the one lady who had sat at his table and now in his old age he had asked her to share her place of honour with another what that other was need not now be told and the world knew that this woman was to have been his wife he had boasted loudly that he would give her that place and those rights he had ventured his all upon her innocence and her purity he had ventured his alland he had lost  i do not say that on this account there was any need that he should be stricken to the groundthat it behoved him as a man of high feeling to be brokenhearted he would have been a greater man had he possessed the power to bear up against all this and to go forth to the world bearing his burden bravely on his shoulders but sir peregrine orme was not a great man and possessed few or none of the elements of greatness he was a man of a singularly pure mind and endowed with a strong feeling of chivalry it had been everything to him to be spoken of by the world as a man free from reproachwho had lived with clean hands and with clean people around him all manner of delinquencies he could forgive in his dependents which did not tell of absolute baseness but it would have half killed him had he ever learned that those he loved had become false or fraudulent when his grandson had come to trouble about the rats he had acted not overcleverly a certain amount of paternal anger but had peregrine broken his promise to him no acting would have been necessary it may therefore be imagined what were now his feelings as to lady mason  her he could forgive for deceiving him he had told his daughterinlaw that he would forgive her and it was a thing done but he could not forgive himself in that he had been deceived he could not forgive himself for having mingled with the sweet current of his ediths life the foul waters of that criminal tragedy he could not now bid her desert lady mason for was it not true that the womans wickedness was known to them two through her resolve not to injure those who had befriended her but all this made the matter worse rather than better to him it is all very well to say no surrender but when the load placed upon the back is too heavy to be borne the back must break or bend beneath it  his load was too heavy to be borne and therefore he said to himself that he would put it down he would not again see lord alston and the old friends of former days he would attend no more at the magistrates bench but would send his grandson out into his place for the few days that remained to him in this world he might be well contented to abandon the turmoils and troubles of life it will not be for long he said to himself over and over again and then he would sit in his armchair for hours intending to turn his mind to such solemn thoughts as might befit a dying man but as he sat there he would still think of lady mason he would remember her as she had leaned against his breast on that day that he kissed her and then he would remember her as she was when she spoke those horrid words to himyes i did it at night when i was alone and this was the woman whom he had loved this was the woman whom he still lovedif all the truth might be confessed  his grandson though he read much of his grandfathers mind had failed to read it all he did not know how often sir peregrine repeated to himself those words no surrender or how gallantly he strove to live up to them lands and money and seats of honour he would surrender as a man surrenders his tools when he has done his work but his tone of feeling and his principle he would not surrender though the maintenance of them should crush him with their weight the woman had been very vile desperately false wicked beyond belief with premeditated villany for years and yearsand this was the woman whom he had wished to make the bosom companion of his latter days  samson is happy now i suppose that he has got the axe in his hand he said to his grandson  pretty well for that sir i think  that man will cut down every tree about the place if youll let him and in that way he strove to talk about the affairs of the property     chapter lx  what rebekah did for her son   every day mrs orme went up to orley farm and sat for two hours with lady mason we may say that there was now no longer any secret between them and that she whose life had been so innocent so pure and so good could look into the inmost heart and soul of that other woman whose career had been supported by the proceeds of one terrible lifelong iniquity and now by degrees lady mason would begin to plead for herself or rather to put in a plea for the deed she had done acknowledging however that she the doer of it had fallen almost below forgiveness through the crime was he not his son as much as that other one and had i not deserved of him that he should do this thing for me and again never once did i ask of him any favour for myself from the day that i gave myself to him because he had been good to my father and mother up to the very hour of his death i never asked him to spend a shilling on my own account but i asked him to do this thing for his child and when at last he refused me i told him that i myself would cause it to be done  you told him so  i did and i think that he believed me he knew that i was one who would act up to my word i told him that orley farm should belong to our babe  and what did he say  he bade me beware of my soul my answer was very terrible and i will not shock you with it ah me it is easy to talk of repentance but repentance will not come with a word  in these days mrs orme became gradually aware that hitherto she had comprehended but little of lady masons character there was a power of endurance about her and a courage that was almost awful to the mind of the weaker softer and better woman lady mason during her sojourn at the cleeve had seemed almost to sink under her misfortune nor had there been any hypocrisy any pretence in her apparent misery she had been very wretchedas wretched a human creature we may say as any crawling gods earth at that time but she had borne her load and bearing it had gone about her work still striving with desperate courage as the ground on which she trod continued to give way beneath her feet inch by inch they had known and pitied her misery they had loved her for miseryas it is in the nature of such people to dobut they had little known how great had been the cause for it they had sympathised with the female weakness which had succumbed when there was hardly any necessity for succumbing had they then known all they would have wondered at the strength which made a struggle possible under such circumstances  even now she would not yield i have said that there had been no hypocrisy in her misery during those weeks last past and i have said so truly but there had perhaps been some pretences some acting of a part some almost necessary pretence as to her weakness was she not bound to account to those around her for her great sorrow and was it not above all things needful that she should enlist their sympathy and obtain their aid she had been obliged to cry to them for help though obliged also to confess that there was little reason for such crying i am a woman and weak she had said and therefore cannot walk alone now that the way is stony but what had been the truth with her how would she have cried had it been possible for her to utter the sharp cry of her heart the waters had been closing over her head and she had clutched at a hand to save her but the owner of that hand might not know how imminent how close was the danger  but in these days as she sat in her own room with mrs orme the owner of that hand might know everything the secret had been told and there was no longer need for pretence as she could now expose to view the whole load of her wretchedness so also could she make known the strength that was still left for endurance and these two women who had become endeared to each other under such terrible circumstances came together at these meetings with more of the equality of friendship than had ever existed at the cleeve it may seem strange that it should be sostrange that the acknowledged forger of her husbands will should be able to maintain a better claim for equal friendship than the lady who was believed to be innocent and true but it was so now she stood on true groundnow as she sat there with mrs orme she could speak from her heart pouring forth the real workings of her mind from mrs orme she had no longer aught to fear nor from sir peregrine everything was known to them and she could now tell of every incident of her crime with an outspoken boldness that in itself was incompatible with the humble bearing of an inferior in the presence of one above her  and she did still hope the one point to be gained was this that her son her only son the child on whose behalf this crime had been committed should never know her shame or live to be disgraced by her guilt if she could be punished she would say and he left in ignorance of her punishment she would not care what indignities they might heap upon her she had heard of penal servitude of years terribly long passed in all the misery of vile companionship of solitary confinement and the dull madness which it engenders of all the terrors of a life spent under circumstances bearable only by the uneducated the rude and the vile but all this was as nothing to her compared with the loss of honour to her son i should live she would say but he would die you cannot ask me to become his murderer  it was on this point that they differed always mrs orme would have had her confess everything to lucius and strove to make her understand that if he were so told the blow would fall less heavily than it would do if the knowledge came to him from her conviction at the trial but the mother would not bring herself to believe that it was absolutely necessary that he should ever know it there was the property yes but let the trial come and if she were acquitted then let some arrangement be made about that the lawyers might find out some cause why it should be surrendered but mrs orme feared that if the trial were over and the criminal saved from justice the property would not be surrendered and then how would that wish of repentance be possible after all was not that the one thing necessary  i will not say that mrs orme in these days ever regretted that her sympathy and friendship had been thus bestowed but she frequently acknowledged to herself that the position was too difficult for her there was no one whose assistance she could ask for she felt that she could not in this matter ask counsel from sir peregrine she herself was good and pure and straightminded and simple in her perception of right and wrong but lady mason was greater than she in force of charactera stronger woman in every way endowed with more force of will with more power of mind with greater energy and a swifter flow of words sometimes she almost thought it would be better that she should stay away from orley farm but then she had promised to be true to her wretched friend and the mothers solicitude for her son still softened the mothers heart  in these days till the evening came lucius mason never made his way into his mothers sittingroom which indeed was the drawingroom of the houseand he and mrs orme as a rule hardly ever met each other if he saw her as she entered or left the place he would lift his hat to her and pass by without speaking he was not admitted to those councils of his mothers and would not submit to ask after his mothers welfare or to inquire as to her affairs from a stranger on no other subject was it possible that he should now speak to the daily visitor and the only visitor at orley farm all this mrs orme understood and saw that the young man was alone and comfortless he passed his hours below in his own room and twice a day his mother found him in the parlour and then they sat through their silent miserable meals she would then leave him always saying some soft words of motherly love and putting her hand either upon his shoulder or his arm on such occasions he was never rough to her but he would never respond to her caress she had illtreated him preferring in her trouble the assistance of a stranger to his assistance she would ask him neither for his money nor his counsel and as she had thus chosen to stand aloof from him he also would stand aloof from her not for alwaysas he said to himself over and over again for his heart misgave him when he saw the lines of care so plainly written on his mothers brow not for always should it be so the day of the trial would soon be present and the day of the trial would soon be over then again would they be friends poor young man unfortunate young man  mrs orme saw all this and to her it was very terrible what would be the world to her if her boy should frown at her and look black when she caressed him and she thought that it was the fault of the mother rather than of the son as indeed was not all that wretchedness the mothers fault but then again there was the one great difficulty how could any step be taken in the right direction till the whole truth had been confessed to him  the two women were sitting together in that up stairs room and the day of the trial was now not a full week distant from them when mrs orme again tried to persuade the mother to intrust her son with the burden of all her misery on the preceding day mr solomon aram had been down at orley farm and had been with lady mason for an hour  he knows the truth lady mason had said to her friend i am sure of that  but did he ask you  oh no he did not ask me that he asked of little things that happened at the time but from his manner i am sure he knows it all he saysthat i shall escape  did he say escape  no not that word but it was the same thing he spoke to lucius for i saw them on the lawn together  you do not know what he said to him  no for lucius would not speak to me and i could not ask him and then they both were silent for mrs orme was thinking how she could bring about that matter that was so near her heart lady mason was seated in a large oldfashioned armchair in which she now passed nearly all her time the table was by her side but she rarely turned herself to it she sat leaning with her elbow on her arm supporting her face with her hand and opposite to her so close that she might look into her face and watch every movement of her eyes sat mrs ormeintent upon that one thing that the woman before her should be brought to repent the evil she had done  and you have not spoken to lucius  no she answered no more than i have told you what could i say to him about the man  not about mr aram it might not be necessary to speak of him he has his work to do and i suppose that he must do it in his own way  yes he must do it in his own way lucius would not understand  unless you told him everything of course he could not understand  that is impossible  no lady mason it is not impossible dear lady mason do not turn from me in that way it is for your sakebecause i love you that i press you to do this if he knew it all  could you tell your son such a tale said lady mason turning upon her sharply and speaking almost with an air of anger  mrs orme was for a moment silenced for she could not at once bring herself to conceive it possible that she could be so circumstanced but at last she answered yes she said i think i could if and then she paused  if you had done such a deed ah you do not know for the doing of it would be impossible to you you can never understand what was my childhood and how my young years were passed i never loved anything but himthat is till i knew you andand but instead of finishing her sentence she pointed down towards the cleeve how then can i tell him mrs orme i would let them pull me to pieces bit by bit if in that way i could save him  not in that way said mrs orme not in that way  but lady mason went on pouring forth the pentup feelings of her bosom not regarding the faint words of her companion till he lay in my arms i had loved nothing from my earliest years i had been taught to love money wealth and property but as to myself the teachings had never come home to me when they bade me marry the old man because he was rich i obeyed themnot caring for his riches but knowing that it behoved me to relieve them of the burden of my support he was kinder to me than they had been and i did for him the best i could but his money and his wealth were little to me he told me over and over again that when he died i should have the means to live and that was enough i would not pretend to him that i cared for the grandeur of his children who despised me but then came my baby and the world was all altered for me what could i do for the only thing that i had ever called my own money and riches they had told me were everything  but they had told you wrong said mrs orme as she wiped the tears from her eyes  they had told me falsely i had heard nothing but falsehoods from my youth upwards she answered fiercely for myself i had not cared for these things but why should not he have money and riches and land his father had them to give over and above what had already made those sons and daughters so rich and proud why should not this other child also be his fathers heir was he not as well born as they was he not as fair a child what did rebekah do mrs orme did she not do worse and did it not all go well with her why should my boy be an ishmael why should i be treated as the bondwoman and see my little one perish of thirst in this worlds wilderness  no saviour had lived and died for the world in those days said mrs orme  and no saviour had lived and died for me said the wretched woman almost shrieking in her despair the lines of her face were terrible to be seen as she thus spoke and an agony of anguish loaded her brow upon which mrs orme was frightened to look she fell on her knees before the wretched woman and taking her by both her hands strove all she could to find some comfort for her  ah do not say so do not say that whatever may come that miserythat worst of miseries need not oppress you if that indeed were true  it was trueand how should it be otherwise  but nownow it need not be true now lady mason for your souls sake say that it is so now  mrs orme she said speaking with a singular quiescence of tone after the violence of her last words it seems to me that i care more for his soul than for my own for myself i can bear even that but if he were a castaway  i will not attempt to report the words that passed between them for the next halfhour for they concerned a matter which i may not dare to handle too closely in such pages as these but mrs orme still knelt there at her feet pressing lady masons hands pressing against her knees as with all the eagerness of true affection she endeavoured to bring her to a frame of mind that would admit of some comfort but it all ended in thislet everything be told to lucius so that the first step back to honesty might be takenand then let them trust to him whose mercy can ever temper the wind to the shorn lamb  but as lady mason had once said to herself repentance will not come with a word i cannot tell him she said at last it is a thing impossible i should die at his feet before the words were spoken  i will do it for you said mrs orme offering from pure charity to take upon herself a task perhaps as heavy as any that a human creature could perform i will tell him  no no screamed lady mason taking mrs orme by both her arms as she spoke you will not do so say that you will not remember your promise to me remember why it is that you know it all yourself  i will not surely unless you bid me said mrs orme  no no i do not bid you mind i do not bid you i will not have it done better anything than that while it may yet be avoided i have your promise have i not  oh yes of course i should not do it unless you told me and then after some further short stay during which but little was said mrs orme got up to go  you will come to me tomorrow said lady mason  yes certainly said mrs orme  because i feared that i had offended you  oh no i will take no offence from you  you should not for you know what i have to bear you know and no one else knows sir peregrine does not know he cannot understand but you know and understand it all and mrs orme what you do now will be counted to you for great treasurefor very great treasure you are better than the samaritan for he went on his way but you will stay till the last yes i know you will stay and the poor creature kissed her only friendkissed her hands and her forehead and her breast then mrs orme went without speaking for her heart was full and the words would not come to her but as she went she said to herself that she would stay till the last  standing alone on the steps before the front door she found lucius mason all alone and some feeling moved her to speak a word to him as she passed i hope all this does not trouble you much mr mason she said offering her hand to him she felt that her words were hypocritical as she was speaking them but under such circumstances what else could she say to him  well mrs orme such an episode in ones family history does give one some trouble i am unhappyvery unhappy but not too much so to thank you for your most unusual kindness to my poor mother and then having been so far encouraged by her speaking to him he accompanied her round the house on to the lawn from whence a path led away through a shrubbery on to the road which would take her by the village of coldharbour to the cleeve  mr mason she said as they walked for a few steps together before the house do not suppose that i presume to interfere between you and your mother  you have a right to interfere now he said  but i think you might comfort her if you would be more with her would it not be better if you could talk freely together about all this  it would be better he said but i fear that that is no longer possible when this trial is over and the world knows that she is innocent when people shall see how cruelly she has been used  mrs orme might not tell the truth to him but she could with difficulty bear to hear him dwell thus confidently on hopes which were so false the future is in the hands of god mr mason but for the present  the present and the future are both in his hands mrs orme i know my mothers innocence and would have done a sons part towards establishing itbut she would not allow me all this will soon be over now and then i trust she and i will once again understand each other till then i doubt whether i shall be wise to interfere good morning mrs orme and pray believe that i appreciate at its full worth all that you are doing for her then he again lifted his hat and left her  lady mason from her window saw them as they walked together and her heart for a moment misgave her could it be that her friend was treacherous to her was it possible that even now she was telling everything that she had sworn that she would not tell why were they two together seeing that they passed each other day by day without intercourse and so she watched with anxious eyes till they parted and then she saw that lucius stood idly on the terrace swinging his stick as he looked down the hill towards the orchard below him he would not have stood thus calmly had he already heard his mothers shame this she knew and having laid aside her immediate fears she retreated back to her chair no she would not tell him at any rate till the trial should be over     chapter lxi  the state of public opinion   the day of the trial was now quickly coming on and the london world especially the world of lawyers was beginning to talk much on the subject men about the inns of court speculated as to the verdict offering to each other very confident opinions as to the result and offering on some occasions bets as well as opinions the younger world of barristers was clearly of opinion that lady mason was innocent but a portion an unhappy portion was inclined to fear that in spite of her innocence she would be found guilty the elder world of barristers was not perhaps so demonstrative but in that world the belief in her innocence was not so strong and the fear of her condemnation much stronger the attorneys as a rule regarded her as guilty to the policemans mind every man not a policeman is a guilty being and the attorneys perhaps share something of this feeling but the attorneys to a man expected to see her acquitted great was their faith in mr furnival great their faith in solomon aram but greater than in all was their faith in mr chaffanbrass if mr chaffanbrass could not pull her through with a prescription of twenty years on her side things must be very much altered indeed in our english criminal court to the outer world that portion of the world which had nothing to do with the administration of the law the idea of lady mason having been guilty seemed preposterous of course she was innocent and of course she would be found to be innocent and of course also that joseph mason of groby park was and would be found to be the meanest the lowest the most rapacious of mankind  and then the story of sir peregrines attachment and proposed marriage joined as it was to various hints of the manner in which that marriage had been broken off lent a romance to the whole affair and added much to lady masons popularity everybody had now heard of it and everybody was also aware that though the idea of a marriage had been abandoned there had been no quarrel the friendship between the families was as close as ever and sir peregrineso it was understoodhad pledged himself to an acquittal it was felt to be a public annoyance that an affair of so exciting a nature should be allowed to come off in the little town of alston the courthouse too was very defective in its arrangements and ill qualified to give accommodation to the great body of wouldbe attendants at the trial one leading newspaper went so far as to suggest that in such a case as this the antediluvian prejudices of the british grandmothermeaning the constitutionshould be set aside and the trial should take place in london but i am not aware that any step was taken towards the carrying out of so desirable a project  down at hamworth the feeling in favour of lady mason was not perhaps so strong as it was elsewhere dockwrath was a man not much respected but nevertheless many believed in him and down there in the streets of hamworth he was not slack in propagating his view of the question he had no doubt he said how the case would go he had no doubt although he was well aware that mr masons own lawyers would do all they could to throw over their own client but he was too strong he said even for that the facts as he would bring them forward would confound round and crook and compel any jury to find a verdict of guilty i do not say that all hamworth believed in dockwrath but his energy and confidence did have its effect and lady masons case was not upheld so strongly in her own neighbourhood as elsewhere  the witnesses in these days were of course very important persons and could not but feel the weight of that attention which the world would certainly pay to them there would be four chief witnesses for the prosecution dockwrath himself who would be prepared to speak as to the papers left behind him by old usbech the man in whose possession now remained that deed respecting the partnership which was in truth executed by old sir joseph on that fourteenth of july bridget bolster and john kenneby of the manner in which mr dockwrath used his position we already know enough the man who held the deed one torrington was a relative of martock sir josephs partner and had been one of his executors it was not much indeed that he had to say but that little sent him up high in the social scale during those days he lived at kennington and he was asked out to dinner in that neighbourhood every day for a week running on the score of his connection with the great orley farm case bridget bolster was still down at the hotel in the west of england and being of a solid sensible and somewhat unimaginative turn of mind probably went through her duties to the last without much change of manner but the effect of the coming scenes upon poor john kenneby was terrible it was to him as though for the time they had made of him an atlas and compelled him to bear on his weak shoulders the weight of the whole world men did talk much about lady mason and the coming trial but to him it seemed as though men talked of nothing else at hubbles and greases it was found useless to put figures into his hands till all this should be over indeed it was doubted by many whether he would ever recover his ordinary tone of mind it seemed to be understood that he would be crossexamined by chaffanbrass and there were those who thought that john kenneby would never again be equal to a days work after that which he would then be made to endure that he would have been greatly relieved could the whole thing have been wiped away from him there can be no manner of doubt but i fancy that he would also have been disappointed it is much to be great for a day even though the days greatness should cause the shipwreck of a whole life  i shall endeavour to speak the truth said john kenneby solemnly  the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth said moulder  yes moulder that will be my endeavour and then i may lay my hand upon my bosom and think that i have done my duty by my country and as kenneby spoke he suited the action to the word  quite right john said mrs smiley thems the sentiments of a man and i as a woman having a right to speak where you are concerned quite approve of them  theyll get nothing but the truth out of john said mrs moulder not if he knows it these last words she added actuated by admiration of what she had heard of mr chaffanbrass and perhaps with some little doubt as to her brothers firmness  thats where it is said moulder lord bless you john theyll turn you round their finger like a bit of red tape truth gammon what do they care for truth  but i care moulder said kenneby i dont suppose they can make me tell falsehoods if i dont wish it  not if youre the man i take you to be said mrs smiley  gammon said moulder  mr moulder thats an objectionable word said mrs smiley if john kenneby is the man i take him to beand whos a right to speak if i havent seeing that i am going to commit myself for this world into his handsand mrs smiley as she spoke simpered and looked down with averted head on the fulness of her irish tabinetif hes the man that i take him to be he wont say on this thrilling occasion no more than the truth nor yet no less now that isnt gammonif i know what gammon is  it will have been already seen that the party in question were assembled at mr moulders room in great st helens there had been a little supper party there to commemorate the final arrangements as to the coming marriage and the four were now sitting round the fire with their glasses of hot toddy at their elbows moulder was armed with his pipe and was enjoying himself in that manner which most delighted him when last we saw him he had somewhat exceeded discretion in his cups and was not comfortable but at the present nothing ailed him the supper had been good the tobacco was good and the toddy was good therefore when the lovely thais sitting beside himthais however on this occasion having been provided not for himself but for his brotherinlawwhen thais objected to the use of his favourite word he merely chuckled down in the bottom of his fat throat and allowed her to finish her sentence  poor john kenneby had moremuch more on his hands than this dreadful trial since he had declared that the adriatic was free to wed another he had found himself devoted and given up to mrs smiley for some days after that auspicious evening there had been considerable wrangling between mrs moulder and mrs smiley as to the proceeds of the brickfield and on this question moulder himself had taken a part the moulder interest had of course desired that all right of management in the brickfield should be vested in the husband seeing that according to the usages of this country brickfields and their belongings appertain rather to men than to women but mrs smiley had soon made it evident that she by no means intended to be merely a sleeping partner in the firm at one time kenneby had entertained a hope of escape for neither would the moulder interest give way nor would the smiley but two hundred a year was a great stake and at last the thing was arranged very much in accordance with the original smiley view and now at this most trying period of his life poor kenneby had upon his mind all the cares of a lover as well as the cares of a witness  i shall do my best said john i shall do my best and then throw myself upon providence  and take a little drop of something comfortable in your pocket said his sister so as to sperrit you up a little when your names called  sperrit him up said moulder why i suppose hell be standing in that box the best part of a day i knowed a man was a witness it was a case of horsestealing and the man who was the witness was the man whod took the horse  and he was witness against hisself said mrs smiley  no hed paid for it that is to say either he had or he hadnt that was what they wanted to get out of him and im blessed if he didnt take em till the judge wouldnt set there any longer and then they hadnt got it out of him  but john kenneby aint one of that sort said mrs smiley  i suppose that man did not want to unbosom himself said kenneby  well no the likes of him seldom do like to unbosom themselves said moulder  but that will be my desire if they will only allow me to speak freely whatever i know about this matter i will give them no trouble  you mean to act honest john said his sister  i always did mary anne  well now ill tell you what it is said moulder as mrs smiley dont like it i wont say anything more about gammonnot just at present that is  ive no objection to gammon mr moulder when properly used said mrs smiley but i look on it as disrespectful and seeing the position which i hold as regards john kenneby anything disrespectful to him is hurtful to my feelings  all right said moulder and now john ill just tell you what it is youve no more chance of being allowed to speak freely there thanthanthanno more than if you was in church what are them fellows paid for if youre to say whatever you pleases out in your own way  he only wants to say the truth m said mrs moulder who probably knew less than her husband of the general usages of courts of law  truth be  said moulder  mr moulder said mrs smiley theres ladies by if youll please to remember  to hear such nonsense sets one past oneself continued he as if all those lawyers were brought together therethe cleverest and sharpest fellows in the kingdom mind youto listen to a man like john here telling his own story in his own way youll have to tell your story in their way that is in two different ways therell be one fellowll make you tell it his way first and another fellowll make you tell it again his way afterwards and its odds but what the first ll be at you again after that till you wont know whether you stand on your heels or your head  that cant be right said mrs moulder  and why cant it be right said moulder theyre paid for it its their duties just as its my duty to sell hubbles and greases sugar its not for me to say the sugars bad or the samples not equal to the last my duty is to sell and i selland its their duty to get a verdict  but the truth moulder said kenneby  gammon said moulder begging your pardon mrs smiley for making use of the expression look you here john if youre paid to bring a man off not guilty wont you bring him off if you can ive been at trials times upon times and listened till ive wished from the bottom of my heart that id been brought up a barrister not that i think much of myself and i mean of course with education and all that accordingly its beautiful to hear them youll see a little fellow in a wig and hell get up and therell be a man in the box before himsome swell dressed up to his eyes who thinks no end of strong beer of himself and in about ten minutes hell be as flabby as wet paper and hell sayon his oath mind youjust anything that that little fellow wants him to say thats power mind you and i call it beautiful  but it aint justice said mrs smiley  why not i say it is justice you can have it if you choose to pay for it and so can i if i buy a greatcoat against the winter and you go out at night without having one is it injustice because youre perished by the cold while im as warm as a toast i say its a grand thing to live in a country where one can buy a greatcoat  the argument had got so far mr moulder certainly having the best of it when a ring at the outer door was heard  now who on earth is that said moulder  snengkeld i shouldnt wonder said his wife  i hope it aint no stranger said mrs smiley situated as john and i are now strangers is so disagreeable and then the door was opened by the maidservant and mr kantwise was shown into the room  halloo kantwise said mr moulder not rising from his chair or giving any very decided tokens of welcome i thought you were down somewhere among the iron foundries  so i was mr moulder but i came up yesterday mrs moulder allow me to have the honour i hope i see you quite well but looking at you i need not ask mr kenneby sir your very humble servant the days coming on fast isnt it mr kenneby maam your very obedient i believe i havent the pleasure of being acquainted  mrs smiley mr kantwise mr kantwise mrs smiley said the lady of the house introducing her visitors to each other in the appropriate way  quite delighted im sure said kantwise  smiley as is and kenneby as will be this day three weeks said moulder and then they all enjoyed that little joke mrs smiley by no means appearing bashful in the matter although mr kantwise was a stranger  i thought i should find mr kenneby here said kantwise when the subject of the coming nuptials had been sufficiently discussed and therefore i just stepped in no intrusion i hope mr moulder  all right said moulder make yourself at home theres the stuff on the table you know what the tap is  ive just parted frommr dockwrath said kantwise speaking in a tone of voice which implied the great importance of the communication and looking round the table to see the effect of it upon the circle  then youve parted from a very lowlived party let me tell you that said moulder he had not forgotten dockwraths conduct in the commercial room at leeds and was fully resolved that he never would forgive it  thats as may be said kantwise i say nothing on that subject at the present moment either one way or the other but i think youll all agree as to this that at the present moment mr dockwrath fills a conspicuous place in the public eye  by no means so conspicuous as john kenneby said mrs smiley if i may be allowed in my position to hold an opinion  thats as may be maam i say nothing about that what i hold by is that mr dockwrath does hold a conspicuous place in the public eye ive just parted with him in grays inn lane and he saysthat its all up now with lady mason  gammon said moulder and on this occasion mrs smiley did not rebuke him what does he know about it more than any one else will he bet two to one because if so ill take itonly i must see the money down  i dont know what hell bet mr moulder only he says its all up with her  will he back his side even handed  i aint a betting man mr moulder i dont think its right and on such a matter as this touching the liberty and almost life of a lady whom ive had the honour of seeing and acquainted as i am with the lady of the other party mrs mason that is of groby park i should rather if its no offence to you decline the subject ofbetting  bother  now m in your own house you know said his wife  so it is bother but never mind that go on kantwise what is this you were saying about dockwrath  oh thats about all i thought you would like to know what they were doingparticularly mr kenneby i do hear that they mean to be uncommonly hard upon him  the unfortunate witness shifted uneasily in his seat but at the moment said nothing himself  well now i cant understand it said mrs smiley sitting upright in her chair and tackling herself to the discussion as though she meant to express her opinion let who might think differently how is any one to put words into my mouth if i dont choose to speak then theres johns waistcoat is silk upon which they all looked at kennebys waistcoat and with the exception of kantwise acknowledged the truth of the assertion  thats as may be said he looking round at it from the corner of his eyes  and do you mean to say that all the barristers in london will make me say that its made of cloth its ridiclousnothing short of ridiclous  youve never tried my dear said moulder  i dont know about being your dear mr moulder  nor yet dont i neither mrs smiley said the wife  mr kennebys my dear and i aint ashamed to own himbefore men and women but if he allows hisself to be hocussed in that way i dont know but what i shall be ashamed i call it hocussingjust hocussing  so it is maam said kantwise only this you know if i hocus you why you hocus me in return so it isnt so very unfair you know  unfair said moulder its the fairest thing that is its the bulwark of the british constitution  what being badgered and browbeat asked kenneby who was thinking within himself that if this were so he did not care if he lived somewhere beyond the protection of that blessed Ægis  trial by jury is said moulder and how can you have trial by jury if the witnesses are not to be crossquestioned  to this position no one was at the moment ready to give an answer and mr moulder enjoyed a triumph over his audience that he lived in a happy and blessed country moulder was well aware and with those blessings he did not wish any one to tamper mother said a fastidious child to his parent the bread is gritty and the butter tastes of turnips turnips indeedand gritty said the mother is it not a great thing to have bread and butter at all i own that my sympathies are with the child bread and butter is a great thing but i would have it of the best if that be possible  after that mr kantwise was allowed to dilate upon the subject which had brought him there mr dockwrath had been summoned to bedford row and there had held a council of war together with mr joseph mason and mr matthew round according to his own story mr matthew had quite come round and been forced to acknowledge all that dockwrath had done for the cause in bedford row there was no doubt whatever as to the verdict that woman bolster is quite clear that she only signed one deed said kantwise  i shall say nothingnothing here said kenneby  quite right john said mrs smiley your feelings on the occasion become you  ill lay an even bet shes acquitted said moulder and ill do it in a tenpund note     chapter lxii  what the four lawyers thought about it   i have spoken of the state of public opinion as to lady masons coming trial and have explained that for the most part mens thoughts and sympathies took part with her but i cannot say that such was the case with the thoughts of those who were most closely concerned with her in the matterwhatever may have been their sympathies of the state of mr furnivals mind on the matter enough has been said but if he had still entertained any shadow of doubt as to his clients guilt or innocence none whatever was entertained either by mr aram or by mr chaffanbrass from the day on which they had first gone into the real circumstances of the case looking into the evidence which could be adduced against their client and looking also to their means of rebutting that evidence they had never felt a shadow of doubt upon the subject but yet neither of them had ever said that she was guilty aram in discussing with his clerks the work which it was necessary that they should do in the matter had never expressed such an opinion nor had chaffanbrass done so in the consultations which he had held with aram as to the verdict they had very often expressed an opiniondiffering considerably mr aram was strongly of opinion that lady mason would be acquitted resting that opinion mainly on his great confidence in the powers of mr chaffanbrass but mr chaffanbrass would shake his head and sometimes say that things were not now as they used to be  that may be so in the city said mr aram but you wont find a city jury down at alston  its not the juries aram its the judges it usednt to be so but it is now when a man has the last word and will take the trouble to use it thats everything if i were asked what point id best like to have in my favour id say a deaf judge or if not that one regularly tired out ive sometimes thought id like to be a judge myself merely to have the last word  that wouldnt suit you at all mr chaffanbrass for youd be sick of it in a week  at any rate im not fit for it said the great man meekly ill tell you what aram i can look back on life and think that ive done a deal of good in my way ive prevented unnecessary bloodshed ive saved the country thousands of pounds in the maintenance of men whove shown themselves well able to maintain themselves and ive made the crown lawyers very careful as to what sort of evidence they would send up to the old bailey but my chances of life have been such that they havent made me fit to be a judge i know that  i wish i might see you on the bench tomorrowonly that we shouldnt know what to do without you said the civil attorney it was no more than the fair everyday flattery of the world for the practice of mr solomon aram in his profession was quite as surely attained as was that of mr chaffanbrass and it could hardly be called flattery for mr solomon aram much valued the services of mr chaffanbrass and greatly appreciated the peculiar turn of that gentlemans mind  the above conversation took place in mr solomon arams private room in bucklersbury in that muchnoted city thoroughfare mr aram rented the first floor of a house over an eating establishment he had no great paraphernalia of books and boxes and clerks desks as are apparently necessary to attorneys in general three clerks he did employ who sat in one room and he himself sat in that behind it so at least they sat when they were to be found at the parent establishment but as regarded the attorney himself and his senior assistant the work of their lives was carried on chiefly in the courts of law the room in which mr aram was now sitting was furnished with much more attention to comfort than is usual in lawyers chambers mr chaffanbrass was at present lying with his feet up on a sofa against the wall in a position of comfort never attained by him elsewhere till the afterdinner hours had come to him and mr aram himself filled an easy loungingchair some few law papers there were scattered on the library table but none of those piles of dusty documents which give to a stranger on entering an ordinary attorneys room so terrible an idea of the difficulty and dreariness of the profession there were no tin boxes with old names labelled on them there were no piles of letters and no pigeonholes loaded with old memoranda on the whole mr arams private room was smart and attractive though like himself it had an air rather of pretence than of steady and assured wellbeing  illustration mr chaffanbrass and mr solomon aram  it is not quite the thing for a barrister to wait upon an attorney and therefore it must not be supposed that mr chaffanbrass had come to mr aram with any view to immediate business but nevertheless as the two men understood each other they could say what they had to say as to this case of lady masons although their present positions were somewhat irregular they were both to meet mr furnival and felix graham on that afternoon in mr furnivals chambers with reference to the division of those labours which were to be commenced at alston on the day but one following and they both thought that it might be as well that they should say a word to each other on the subject before they went there  i suppose you know nothing about the panel down there eh said chaffanbrass  well i have made some inquiries but i dont think theres anything especial to knownothing that matters if i were you mr chaffanbrass i wouldnt have any hamworth people on the jury for they say that a prophet is never a prophet in his own country  but do you know the hamworth people  oh yes i can tell you as much as that but i dont think it will matter much who is or is not on the jury  and why not  if those two witnesses break downthat is kenneby and bolster no jury can convict her and if they dont  then no jury can acquit her but let me tell you aram that its not every man put into a jurybox who can tell whether a witness has broken down or not  but from what i hear mr chaffanbrass i dont think either of these can stand a chancethat is if they both come into your hands  but they wont both come into my hands said the anxious hero of the old bailey  ah thats where it is thats where we shall fail mr furnival is a great man no doubt  a very great manin his way said mr chaffanbrass  but if he lets one of those two slip through his fingers the things over  you know my opinion said chaffanbrass i think it is all over if youre right in what you saythat theyre both ready to swear in their direct evidence that they only signed one deed on that day no vacillation afterwards would have any effect on the judge its just possible you know that their memory might deceive them  possible i should think so ill tell you what mr chaffanbrass if the matter was altogether in your hands i should have no fearliterally no fear  ah youre partial aram  it couldnt be so managed could it mr chaffanbrass it would be a great thing a very great thing but mr chaffanbrass said that he thought it could not be managed the success or safety of a client is a very great thingin a professional point of view a very great thing indeed but there is a matter which in legal eyes is greater even than that professional etiquette required that the crossexamination of these two most important witnesses should not be left in the hands of the same barrister  and then the special attributes of kenneby and bridget bolster were discussed between them and it was manifest that aram knew with great accuracy the characters of the persons with whom he had to deal that kenneby might be made to say almost anything was taken for granted with him there would be very great scope for that peculiar skill with which mr chaffanbrass was so wonderfully gifted in the hands of mr chaffanbrass it was not improbable that kenneby might be made to swear that he had signed two three fourany number of documents on that fourteenth of july although he had before sworn that he had only signed one mr chaffanbrass indeed might probably make him say anything that he pleased had kenneby been unsupported the case would have been made safeso said mr solomon aramby leaving kenneby in the hands of mr chaffanbrass but then bridget bolster was supposed to be a witness of altogether a different class of character to induce her to say exactly the reverse of that which she intended to say might no doubt be within the power of man mr aram thought that it would be within the power of mr chaffanbrass he thought however that it would as certainly be beyond the power of mr furnival and when the great man lying on the sofa mentioned the name of mr felix graham mr aram merely smiled the question with him was thiswhich would be the safest courseto make quite sure of kenneby by leaving him with chaffanbrass or to go for the double stake by handing kenneby over to mr furnival and leaving the task of difficulty to the great master  when so much depends upon it i do detest all this etiquette and precedence said aram with enthusiasm in such a case mr furnival ought not to think of himself  my dear aram said mr chaffanbrass men always think of themselves first and if we were to go out of the usual course do you conceive that the gentlemen on the other side would fail to notice it  which shall it be then  im quite indifferent if the memory of either of these two persons is doubtfuland after twenty years it may be somr furnival will discover it  then on the whole im disposed to think that id let him take the man  just as you please aram that is if hes satisfied also  im not going to have my client overthrown you know said aram and then youll take dockwrath also of course i dont know that it will have much effect upon the case but i shall like to see dockwrath in your hands i shall indeed  i doubt hell be too many for me  ha ha ha aram might well laugh for when had any one shown himself able to withstand the powers of mr chaffanbrass  they say he is a sharp fellow said mr chaffanbrass well we must be off when those gentlemen at the west end get into parliament it does not do to keep them waiting let one of your fellows get a cab and then the barrister and the attorney started from bucklersbury for the general meeting of their forces to be held in the old square lincolns inn  we have heard how it came to pass that felix graham had been induced to become one of that legal phalanx which was employed on behalf of lady mason it was now some days since he had left noningsby and those days with him had been very busy he had never yet undertaken the defence of a person in a criminal court and had much to learnor perhaps he rather fancied that he had and then that affair of mary snows new lover was not found to arrange itself altogether easily when he came to the details of his dealings with the different parties every one wanted from him twice as much money as he had expected the chemist was very willing to have a partner but then a partnership in his business was according to his view of the matter a peculiarly expensive luxury snow père moreover came forward with claims which he rested on various arguments that graham found it almost impossible to resist them at firstthat is immediately subsequent to the interview between him and his patron described in a preceding chapter graham had been visited by a very repulsive attorney who had talked loudly about the cruel wrongs of his illused client this phasis of the affair would have been by far the preferable one but the attorney and his client probably disagreed snow wanted immediate money and as no immediate money was forthcoming through the attorney he threw himself repentant at grahams feet and took himself off with twenty shillings but his penitence and his wants and his tears and the thwarted ambition of his parental mind were endless and poor felix hardly knew where to turn himself without seeing him it seemed probable that every denizen of the courts of law in london would be told before long the sad tale of mary snows injuries and then mrs thomas wanted moneymore money than she had a right to want in accordance with the terms of their mutual agreement she had been very much put about she saiddreadfully put about she had had to change her servant three times there was no knowing the trouble mary snow had given her she had in a great measure been forced to sacrifice her school poor woman she thought she was telling the truth while making these false plaints she did not mean to be dishonest but it is so easy to be dishonest without meaning it when one is very poor mary snow herself made no claim on her lost lover no claim for money or for aught besides when he parted from her on that day without kissing her mary snow knew that all that was over but not the less did graham recognise her claim the very bonnet which she must wear when she stood before the altar with fitzallen must be paid for out of grahams pocket that hobby of moulding a young lady is perhaps of all hobbies the most expensive to which a young gentleman can apply himself  and in these days he heard no word from noningsby augustus staveley was up in town and once or twice they saw each other but as may easily be imagined nothing was said between them about madeline as augustus had once declared a man does not talk to his friend about his own sister and then hearing nothingas indeed how could he have heard anythinggraham endeavoured to assure himself that that was all over his hopes had ran high at that moment when his last interview with the judge had taken place but after all to what did that amount he had never even asked madeline to love him he had been such a fool that he had made no use of those opportunities which chance had thrown in his way he had been told that he might fairly aspire to the hand of any lady and yet when he had really loved and the girl whom he had loved had been close to him he had not dared to speak to her how could he now expect that she in his absence should care for him  with all these little troubles around him he went to work on lady masons case and at first felt thoroughly well inclined to give her all the aid in his power he saw mr furnival on different occasions and did much to charm that gentleman by his enthusiasm in this matter mr furnival himself could no longer be as enthusiastic as he had been the skill of a lawyer he would still give if necessary but the ardour of the loving friend was waxing colder from day to day would it not be better if such might be possible that the whole affair should be given up to the hands of chaffanbrass who could be energetic without belief and of graham who was energetic because he believed so he would say to himself frequently but then he would think again of her pale face and acknowledge that this was impossible he must go on till the end but nevertheless if this young man could believe would it not be well that he should bear the brunt of the battle that fighting of a battle without belief is i think the sorriest task which ever falls to the lot of any man  but as the day grew nigh a shadow of unbelief a dim passing shadea shade which would pass and then return and then pass againflitted also across the mind of felix graham his theory had been and still was that those two witnesses kenneby and bolster were suborned by dockwrath to swear falsely he had commenced by looking at the matter with a full confidence in his clients innocence a confidence which had come from the outer world from his social convictions and the knowledge which he had of the confidence of others then it had been necessary for him to reconcile the stories which kenneby and bolster were prepared to tell with this strong confidence and he could only do so by believing that they were both false and had been thus suborned but what if they were not false what if he were judging them wrongfully i do not say that he had ceased to believe in lady mason but a shadow of doubt would occasionally cross his mind and give to the whole affair an aspect which to him was very tragical  he had reached mr furnivals chambers on this day some few minutes before his new allies and as he was seated there discussing the matter which was now so interesting to them all he blurted out a question which nearly confounded the elder barrister  i suppose there can really be no doubt as to her innocence  what was mr furnival to say mr chaffanbrass and mr aram had asked no such question mr round had asked no such question when he had discussed the whole matter confidentially with him it was a sort of question never put to professional men and one which felix graham should not have asked nevertheless it must be answered  eh he said  i suppose we may take it for granted that lady mason is really innocentthat is free from all falsehood or fraud in this matter  really innocent oh yes i presume we take that for granted as a matter of course  but you yourself mr furnival you have no doubt about it you have been concerned in this matter from the beginning and therefore i have no hesitation in asking you  but that was exactly the reason why he should have hesitated at least so mr furnival thought who i no i have no doubt none in the least said he and thus the lie which he had been trying to avoid was at last told  the assurance thus given was very complete as far as the words were concerned but there was something in the tone of mr furnivals voice which did not quite satisfy felix graham it was not that he thought that mr furnival had spoken falsely but the answer had not been made in a manner to set his own mind at rest why had not mr furnival answered him with enthusiasm why had he not on behalf of his old friend shown something like indignation that any such doubt should have been expressed his words had been words of assurance but considering the subject his tone had contained no assurance and thus the shadow of doubt flitted backwards and forwards before grahams mind  then the general meeting of the four lawyers was held and the various arrangements necessary for the coming contest were settled no such impertinent questions were asked then nor were there any communications between them of a confidential nature mr chaffanbrass and solomon aram might whisper together as might also mr furnival and felix graham but there could be no whispering when all the four were assembled the programme of their battle was settled and then they parted with the understanding that they were to meet again in the courthouse at alston     chapter lxiii  the evening before the trial   the eve of the trial had now come and still there had been no confidence between the mother and the son no words of kindness had been spoken with reference to that terrible event which was so near at hand lucius had in his manner been courteous to his mother but he had at the same time been very stern he had seemed to make no allowance for her sorrows never saying to her one of those soft words which we all love to hear from those around us when we are suffering why should she suffer thus had she chosen to lean upon him he would have borne on her behalf all this trouble and vexation as to her being guiltyas to her being found guilty by any twelve jurymen in englandno such idea ever entered his head i have said that many people had begun to suspect but no such suspicions had reached his ears what man unless it should be dockwrath would whisper to the son the possibility of his mothers guilt dockwrath had done more than whisper it but the words of such a man could have no avail with him against his mothers character  on that day mrs orme had been with lady mason for some hours and had used all her eloquence to induce the mother even then to divulge her secret to her son mrs orme had suggested that sir peregrine should tell him she had offered to tell him herself she had proposed that lady mason should write to lucius but all had been of no avail lady mason had argued and had argued with some truth that it was too late to tell him now with the view of obtaining from him support during the trial if he were now told he would not recover from the first shock of the blow in time to appear in court without showing on his brow the perturbation of his spirit his terrible grief would reveal the secret to every one when it is overshe had whispered at last as mrs orme continued to press upon her the absolute necessity that lucius should give up the propertywhen it is over you shall do it  with this mrs orme was obliged to rest contented she had not the heart to remind lady mason how probable it was that the truth might be told out to all the world during the next two or three daysthat a verdict of guilty might make any further telling unnecessary and indeed it was not needed that she should do so in this respect lady mason was fully aware of the nature of the ground on which she stood  mrs orme had sat with her the whole afternoon only leaving herself time to be ready for sir peregrines dinner and as she left her she promised to be with her early on the following morning to go with her down to the court mr aram was also to come to the farm for her and a closed carriage had been ordered from the inn for the occasion  you wont let him prevent you were the last words she spoke as mrs orme then left her  he will not wish to do so said mrs orme he has already given me his permission he never goes back from his word you know  this had been said in allusion to sir peregrine when mrs orme had first proposed to accompany lady mason to the court and to sit by her side during the whole trial he had been much startled he had been startled and for a time had been very unwilling to accede to such a step the place which she now proposed to fill was one which he had intended to fill himselfbut he had intended to stand by an innocent injured lady not a perpetrator of midnight forgery he had intended to support a spotless being who would then be his wifenot a woman who for years had lived on the proceeds of fraud and felony committed by herself  edith he had said you know that i am unwilling to oppose you but i think that in this your feelings are carrying you too far  no father she answered not giving way at all or showing herself minded to be turned from her purpose by anything he might say do not think so think of her misery how could she endure it by herself  think of her guilt edith  i will leave others to think of that but father her guilt will not stain me are we not bound to remember what injury she might have done to us and how we might still have been ignorant of all this had not she herself confessed itfor our sakesfor our sakes father  and then sir peregrine gave way when this argument was used to him he was forced to yield it was true that had not that woman been as generous as she was guilty he would now have been bound to share her shame the whole of this affair taken together had nearly laid him prostrate but that which had gone the farthest towards effecting this ruin was the feeling that he owed so much to lady mason as regarded the outer world the injury to him would have been much more terrible had he married her men would then have declared that all was over with him but as regards the inner man i doubt whether he would not have borne that better it was easier for him to sustain an injury than a favourthan a favour from one whom his judgment compelled him to disown as a friend  but he had given way and it was understood at the cleeve that mrs orme was to remain by lady masons side during the trial to the general household there was nothing in this that was wonderful they knew only of the old friendship to them the question of her guilt was still an open question as others had begun to doubt so had they but no one then presumed that sir peregrine or mrs orme had any doubt that they were assured of her innocence was the conviction of all hamworth and its neighbourhood  he never goes back from his word you know mrs orme had said and then she kissed lady mason and went her way she had never left her without a kiss had never greeted her without a warm pressure of the hand since that day on which the secret had been told in sir peregrines library it would be impossible to describe how great had been the worth of this affection to lady mason but it may almost be said that it had kept her alive she herself had said but little about it uttering but few thanks but not the less had she recognised the value of what had been done for her she had even become more free herself in her intercourse with mrs ormemore open in her mode of speechhad put herself more on an equality with her friend since there had ceased to be anything hidden between them previously lady mason had felt and had occasionally expressed the feeling that she was hardly fit to associate on equal terms with mrs orme but now there was none of thisnow as they sat together for hours and hours they spoke and argued and lived together as though they were equal but nevertheless could she have shown her love by any great deed there was nothing which lady mason would not have done for mrs orme  she was now left alone and according to her daily custom would remain there till the servant told her that mr lucius was waiting for her in the diningroom in an early part of this story i have endeavoured to describe how this woman sat alone with deep sorrow in her heart and deep thought on her mind when she first learned what terrible things were coming on her the idea however which the reader will have conceived of her as she sat there will have come to him from the skill of the artist and not from the words of the writer if that drawing is now near him let him go back to it lady mason was again sitting in the same roomthat pleasant room looking out through the verandah on to the sloping lawn and in the same chair one hand again rested open on the arm of the chair while the other supported her face as she leaned upon her elbow and the sorrow was still in her heart and the deep thought in her mind but the lines of her face were altered and the spirit expressed by it was changed there was less of beauty less of charm less of softness but in spite of all that she had gone through there was more of strengthmore of the power to resist all that this world could do to her  it would be wrong to say that she was in any degree a hypocrite a man is no more a hypocrite because his manner and gait when he is alone are different from those which he assumes in company than he is for wearing a dressinggown in the morning whereas he puts on a black coat in the evening lady mason in the present crisis of her life endeavoured to be true in all her dealings with mrs orme but nevertheless mrs orme had not yet read her character as she now sat thinking of what the morrow would bring upon herthinking of all that the malice of that man dockwrath had brought upon hershe resolved that she would still struggle on with a bold front it had been brought home to her that he her son the being for whom her soul had been imperilled and all her hopes for this world destroyedthat he must be told of his mothers guilt and shame let him be told and then let him leave her while his anguish and the feeling of his shame were hot upon him should she be still a free woman when this trial was over she would move herself away at once and then let him be told but still it would be wellwell for his sake that his mother should not be found guilty by the law it was still worth her while to struggle the world was very hard to her bruising her to the very soul at every turn allowing her no hope offering to her no drop of cool water in her thirst but still for him there was some future career and that career perhaps need not be blotted by the public notice of his mothers guilt she would still fight against her foesstill show to that court and to the world that would then gaze at her a front on which guilt should not seem to have laid its hideous defacing hand  there was much that was wonderful about this woman while she was with those who regarded her with kindness she could be so soft and womanly and then when alone she could be so stern and hard and it may be said that she felt but little pity for herself though she recognised the extent of her misery she did not complain of it even in her inmost thoughts her plaint was thisthat he her son should be doomed to suffer so deeply for her sin sometimes she would utter to that other mother a word of wailing in that he would not be soft to her but even in that she did not mean to complain of him she knew in her heart of hearts that she had no right to expect such softness she knew that it was better that it should be as it now was had he stayed with her from morn till evening speaking kind words to her how could she have failed to tell him in sickness it may irk us because we are not allowed to take the cool drink that would be grateful but what man in his senses would willingly swallow that by which his very life would be endangered it was thus she thought of her son and what his love might have been to her  yes she would still bear up as she had borne up at that other trial she would dress herself with care and go down into the court with a smooth brow men as they looked at her should not at once say behold the face of a guilty woman there was still a chance in the battle though the odds were so tremendously against her it might be that there was but little to which she could look forward even though the verdict of the jury should be in her favour but all that she regarded as removed from her by a great interval she had promised that lucius should know all after the trialthat he should know all so that the property might be restored to its rightful owner and she was fully resolved that this promise should be kept but nevertheless there was a long interval if she could battle through this first dangerif by the skill of her lawyers she could avert the public declaration of her guilt might not the chances of war still take some further turn in her favour and thus though her face was pale with suffering and thin with care though she had realised the fact that nothing short of a miracle could save herstill she would hope for that miracle  but the absolute bodily labour which she was forced to endure was so hard upon her she would dress herself and smooth her brow for the trial but that dressing herself and that maintenance of a smooth brow would impose upon her an amount of toil which would almost overtask her physical strength o reader have you ever known what it is to rouse yourself and go out to the world on your daily business when all the inner man has revolted against work when a day of rest has seemed to you to be worth a year of life if she could have rested now it would have been worth many years of lifeworth all her life she longed for restto be able to lay aside the terrible fatigue of being ever on the watch from the burden of that necessity she had never been free since her crime had been first committed she had never known true rest she had not once trusted herself to sleep without the feeling that her first waking thought would be one of horror as the remembrance of her position came upon her in every word she spoke in every trifling action of her life it was necessary that she should ask herself how that word and action might tell upon her chances of escape she had striven to be true and honesttrue and honest with the exception of that one deed but that one deed had communicated its poison to her whole life truth and honestyfair unblemished truth and openhanded fearless honestyhad been impossible to her before she could be true and honest it would be necessary that she should go back and cleanse herself from the poison of that deed such cleansing is to be done men have sinned deep as she had sinned and lepers though they have been they have afterwards been clean but that task of cleansing oneself is not an easy onethe waters of that jordan in which it is needful to wash are scalding hot the cool neighbouring streams of lifes pleasant valleys will by no means suffice  since she had been home at orley farm she had been very scrupulous as to going down into the parlour both at breakfast and at dinner so that she might take her meals with her son she had not as yet omitted this on one occasion although sometimes the task of sitting through the dinner was very severe upon her on the present occasion the last day that remained to her before the trialperhaps the last evening on which she would ever watch the sun set from those windows she thought that she would spare herself tell mr lucius she said to the servant who came to summon her that i would be obliged to him if he would sit down without me tell him that i am not ill but that i would rather not go down to dinner but before the girl was on the stairs she had changed her mind why should she now ask for this mercy what did it matter so she gathered herself up from the chair and going forth from the room stopped the message before it was delivered she would bear on to the end  she sat through the dinner and answered the ordinary questions which lucius put to her with her ordinary voice and then as was her custom she kissed his brow as she left the room it must be remembered that they were still mother and son and that there had been no quarrel between them and now as she went up stairs he followed her into the drawingroom his custom had been to remain below and though he had usually seen her again during the evening there had seldom or never been any social intercourse between them on the present occasion however he followed her and closing the door for her as he entered the room he sat himself down on the sofa close to her chair  mother he said putting out his hand and touching her arm things between us are not as they should be  she shuddered not at the touch but at the words things were not as they should be between them no she said but i am sure of this lucius that you never had an unkind thought in your heart towards me  never mother how could ito my own mother who has ever been so good to me but for the last three months we have been to each other nearly as though we were strangers  but we have loved each other all the same said she  but love should beget close social intimacy and above all close confidence in times of sorrow there has been none such between us  what could she say to him it was on her lips to promise him that such love should again prevail between them as soon as this trial should be over but the words stuck in her throat she did not dare to give him so false an assurance dear lucius she said if it has been my fault i have suffered for it  i do not say that it is your faultnor will i say that it has been my own if i have seemed harsh to you i beg your pardon  no lucius no you have not been harsh i have understood you through it all  i have been grieved because you did not seem to trust mebut let that pass now mother i wish that there may be no unpleasant feeling between us when you enter on this ordeal tomorrow  there is nonethere shall be none  no one can feel more keenlyno one can feel so keenly as i do the cruelty with which you are treated the sight of your sorrow has made me wretched  oh lucius  i know how pure and innocent you are  no lucius no  but i say yes and knowing that it has cut me to the quick to see them going about a defence of your innocence by quips and quibbles as though they were struggling for the escape of a criminal  lucius and she put her hands up praying for mercy though she could not explain to him how terribly severe were his words  wait a moment mother to me such men as mr chaffanbrass and his comrades are odious i will not and do not believe that their services are necessary to you  but lucius mr furnival  yes mr furnival it is he that has done it all in my heart i wish that you had never known mr furnivalnever known him as a lawyer that is he added thinking of his own strong love for the lawyers daughter  do not upbraid me now lucius wait till it is all over  upbraid you no i have come to you now that we may be friends as things have gone so far this plan of defence must of course be carried on i will say no more about that but mother i will go into the court with you tomorrow that support i can at any rate give you and they shall see that there is no quarrel between us  but lady mason did not desire this she would have wished that he might have been miles away from the court had that been possible mrs orme is to be with me she said  then again there came a black frown upon his browa frown such as there had often been there of late and will mrs ormes presence make the attendance of your own son improper  oh no of course not i did not mean that lucius  do you not like to have me near you he asked and as he spoke he rose up and took her hand as he stood before her  she gazed for a moment into his face while the tears streamed down from her eyes and then rising from her chair she threw herself on to his bosom and clasped him in her arms my boy my boy she said oh if you could be near me and away from thisaway from this  she had not intended thus to give way but the temptation had been too strong for her when she had seen mrs orme and peregrine togetherwhen she had heard peregrines mother with words expressed in a joyful tone affect to complain of the inroads which her son made upon her she had envied her that joy oh if it could be so with me also she always thought and the words too had more than once been spoken now at last in this last moment as it might be of her life at home he had come to her with kindly voice and she could not repress her yearning  lucius she said dearest lucius my own boy and then the tears from her eyes streamed hot on to his bosom  mother he said it shall be so i will be with you  but she was now thinking of more than thisof much more was it possible for her to tell him now as she held him in her arms hiding her face upon his breast she struggled hard to speak the word then in the midst of that struggle while there was still something like a hope within her that it might be done she raised her head and looked up into his face it was not a face pleasant to look at as was that of peregrine orme it was hard in its outlines and perhaps too manly for his age but she was his mother and she loved it well she looked up at it and raising her hands she stroked his cheeks she then kissed him again and again with warm clinging kisses she clung to him holding him close to her while the sobs which she had so long repressed came forth from her with a violence that terrified him then again she looked up into his face with one long wishful gaze and after that she sank upon the sofa and hid her face within her hands she had made the struggle but it had been of no avail she could not tell him that tale with her own voice  mother he said what does this mean i cannot understand such grief as this but for a while she was quite unable to answer the floodgates were at length opened and she could not restrain the torrent of her sobbings  you do not understand how weak a woman can be she said at last  but in truth he understood nothing of a womans strength he sat down by her now and then taking her by the hand when she would leave it to him and in his way endeavoured to comfort her all comfort we may say was out of the question but by degrees she again became tranquil it shall be tomorrow as you will have it you will not object to her being with me also  he did object but he could not say so he would have much preferred to be the only friend near to her but he felt that he could not deny her the solace of a womans aid and a womans countenance oh no he said if you wish it he would have found it impossible to define even to himself the reason for his dislike to any assistance coming from the family of the ormes but the feeling was there strong within his bosom  and when this is over mother we will go away he said if you would wish to live elsewhere i will sell the property it will be better perhaps after all that has passed we will go abroad for a while  she could make no answer to this except pressing his hand ah if he had been toldif she had allowed mrs orme to do that kindness for her how much better for her would it now have been sell the property ah me were they not words of fearful sound in her earswords of terrible import  yes it shall be so she said putting aside that last proposition of his we will go together tomorrow mr aram said that he would sit at my side but he cannot object to your being there between us mr arams name was odious to lucius mason his close presence would be odious to him but he felt that he could urge nothing against an arrangement that had now become necessary mr aram with all his quibbles had been engaged and the trial must now be carried through with all the aram tactics  after that lucius left his mother and took himself out into the dark night walking up and down on the road between his house and the outer gate endeavouring to understand why his mother should be so despondent that she must fear the result of the trial he thought was certain but he could not bring himself to have any such fear as to any suspicion of her guiltno such idea had even for one moment cast a shadow upon his peace of mind     chapter lxiv  the first journey to alston   at that time sir richard leatherham was the solicitorgeneral and he had been retained as leading counsel for the prosecution it was quite understood by all men who did understand what was going on in the world that this trial had been in truth instituted by mr mason of groby with the hope of recovering the property which had been left away from him by his fathers will the whole matter had now been so much discussed that the true bearings of it were publicly known if on the former trial lady mason had sworn falsely then there could be no doubt that that will or the codicil to the will was an untrue document and the property would in that case revert to mr mason after such further legal exercitations on the subject as the lawyers might find necessary and profitable as far as the public were concerned and as far as the masons were concerned it was known and acknowledged that this was another struggle on the part of the groby park family to regain the orley farm estate but then the question had become much more interesting than it had been in the days of the old trial through the allegation which was now made of lady masons guilt had the matter gone against her in the former trial her child would have lost the property and that would have been all but the present issue would be very different it would be much more tragical and therefore of much deeper interest  as alston was so near to london sir richard mr furnival mr chaffanbrass and others were able to go up and down by trainwhich arrangement was at ordinary assizes a great heartsore to the hotelkeepers and owners of lodginghouses in alston but on this occasion the town was quite full in spite of this facility the attorneys did not feel it safe to run up and down in that way nor did the witnesses mr aram remained as did also mr mat round special accommodation had been provided for john kenneby and bridget bolster and mr mason of groby had lodgings of his own  mr mason of groby had suggested to the attorneys in bedford row that his services as a witness would probably be required but they had seemed to think otherwise we shall not call you mr round had said and i do not suppose that the other side will do so they cant if they do not first serve you but in spite of this mr mason had determined to be at alston if it were true that this woman had robbed himif it could be proved that she had really forged a will and then by crime of the deepest dye taken from him for years that which was his own should he not be there to see should he not be a witness to her disgrace should he not be the first to know and feel his own tardy triumph pity pity for her when such a word was named to him it seemed to him as though the speaker were becoming to a certain extent a partner in her guilt pity yes such pity as an englishman who had caught the nana sahib might have felt for his victim he had complained twenty times since this matter had been mooted of the folly of those who had altered the old laws that folly had probably robbed him of his property for twenty years and would now rob him of half his revenge not that he ever spoke even to himself of revenge vengeance is mine saith the lord he would have been as able as any man to quote the words and as willing justice outraged justice was his theme whom had he ever robbed to whom had he not paid all that was owing all that have i done from my youth upwards such were his thoughts of himself and with such thoughts was it possible that he should willingly be absent from alston during such a trial  i really would stay away if i were you mat round had said to him  i will not stay away he had replied with a look black as a thundercloud could there really be anything in those suspicions of dockwrath that his own lawyer had wilfully thrown him over once and was now anxious to throw him over again i will not stay away he said and dockwrath secured his lodgings for him about this time he was a good deal with mr dockwrath and almost regretted that he had not followed that gentlemans advice at the commencement of the trial and placed the management of the whole concern in his hands  thus alston was quite alive on the morning of the trial and the doors of the courthouse were thronged long before they were opened they who were personally concerned in the matter whose presence during the ceremony would be necessary or who had legal connection with the matter in hand were of course not driven to this tedious manner of obtaining places mr dockwrath for instance did not stand waiting at the door nor did his friend mr mason mr dockwrath was a great man as far as this day was concerned and could command admittance from the doorkeepers and others about the court but for the outer world for men and women who were not lucky enough to be lawyers witnesses jurymen or high sheriff there was no means of hearing and seeing the events of this stirring day except what might be obtained by exercise of an almost unlimited patience  there had been much doubt as to what arrangement for her attendance at the court it might be best for lady mason to make and some difficulty too as to who should decide as to these arrangements mr aram had been down more than once and had given a hint that it would be well that something should be settled it had ended in his settling it himselfhe with the assistance of mrs orme what would sir peregrine have said had he known that on any subject these two had been leagued in council together  she can go from hence in a carriagea carriage from the inn mrs orme had said  certainly certainly a carriage from the inn yes but in the evening maam  when the trial is over said mrs orme inquiring from him his meaning  we can hardly expect that it shall be over in one day maam she will continue to be on bail and can return home i will see that she is not annoyed as she leaves the town  annoyed said mrs orme  by the people i mean  will there be anything of that sir she asked turning pale at the idea i shall be with her you know  through the whole affair maam  yes through the whole affair  theyll want to have a look at her of course butmrs orme well see that you are not annoyed yes she had better come back home the first day the expense wont be much will it  oh no said mrs orme i must return home you know how many days will it be sir  well perhaps twoperhaps three it may run on all the week of course you know mrs orme  know what she asked  when the trial is over ifif it should go against usthen you must return alone  and so the matter had been settled and mr aram himself had ordered the carriage from the inn sir peregrines carriage would have been at their disposalor rather mrs ormes own carriage but she had felt that the cleeve arms on the cleeve panels would be out of place in the streets of hamworth on such an occasion it would of course be impossible that she should not be recognised in the court but she would do as little as possible to proclaim her own presence  when the morning came the very morning of the terrible day mrs orme came down early from her room as it was necessary that she should breakfast two hours before the usual time she had said nothing of this to sir peregrine hoping that she might have been able to escape in the morning without seeing him she had told her son to be there but when she made her appearance in the breakfast parlour she found that his grandfather was already with him she sat down and took her cup of tea almost in silence for they all felt that on such a morning much speech was impossible for them  edith my dear said the baronet you had better eat something think of the day that is before you  yes father i have said she and she lifted a morsel of bread to her mouth  you must take something with you said he or you will be faint in the court have you thought how many hours you will be there  i will see to that said peregrine speaking with a stern decision in his voice that was by no means natural to him  will you be there perry said his mother  of course i shall i will see that you have what you want you will find that i will be near you  but how will you get in my boy asked his grandfather  let me alone for that i have spoken to the sheriff already there is no knowing what may turn up so if anything does turn up you may be sure that i am near you  then another slight attempt at eating was made the cup of tea was emptied and the breakfast was finished is the carriage there perry asked mrs orme  yes it is at the door  goodbye father i am so sorry to have disturbed you  goodbye edith god bless you and give you strength to bear it and edith  sir and she held his hand as he whispered to her  say to her a word of kindness from mea word of kindness tell her that i have forgiven her but tell her also that mans forgiveness will avail her nothing  yes father i will  teach her where to look for pardon but tell her all the same that i have forgiven her  and then he handed her into the carriage peregrine as he stood aside had watched them as they whispered and to his mind also as he followed them to the carriage a suspicion of what the truth might be now made its way surely there would be no need of all this solemn mourning if she were innocent had she been esteemed as innocent sir peregrine was not the man to believe that any jury of his countrymen could find her guilty had this been the reason for that sudden changefor that breaking off of the intended marriage even peregrine as he went down the steps after his mother had begun to suspect the truth and we may say that he was the last within all that household who did so during the last week every servant at the cleeve had whispered to her fellowservant that lady mason had forged the will  i shall be near you mother said peregrine as he put his hand into the carriage remember that the judge and the other fellows will go out in the middle of the day to get a glass of wine ill have something for both of you near the court  poor mrs orme as she pressed her sons hand felt much relieved by the assurance it was not that she feared anything but she was going to a place that was absolutely new to herto a place in which the eyes of many would be fixed on herto a place in which the eyes of all would be fixed on the companion with whom she would be joined her heart almost sank within her as the carriage drove away she would be alone till she reached orley farm and there she would take up not only lady mason but mr aram also how would it be with them in that small carriage while mr aram was sitting opposite to them mrs orme by no means regretted this act of kindness which she was doing but she began to feel that the task was not a light one as to mr arams presence in the carriage she need have been under no uneasiness he understood very well when his presence was desirable and also when it was not desirable  when she arrived at the door of orley farm house she found mr aram waiting there to receive her i am sorry to say said he raising his hat that lady masons son is to accompany us  she did not tell me said mrs orme not understanding why this should make him sorry  it was arranged between them last night and it is very unfortunate i cannot explain this to her but perhaps  why is it unfortunate sir  things will be said whichwhichwhich would drive me mad if they were said about my mother and immediately there was a touch of sympathy between the highbred lady and the old bailey jew lawyer  yes yes said mrs orme it will be dreadful  and then if they find her guilty it may be so you know and how is he to sit there and hear the judges chargeand then the verdict and the sentence if he is there he cannot escape ill tell you what mrs orme he should not be there at all  but what could she do had it been possible that she should be an hour alone with lady mason she would have explained all this to heror if not all would have explained much of it but now with no minutes to spare how could she make this understood but all that will not come today will it sir  not allnot the charge or the verdict but he should not be there even today he should have gone away or if he remained at home he should not have shown himself out of the house  but this was too late now for as they were still speaking lady mason appeared at the door leaning on her sons arm she was dressed from head to foot in black and over her face there was a thick black veil mr aram spoke no word further as she stepped up the steps from the hall door to the carriage but stood back holding the carriagedoor open in his hand lucius merely bowed to mrs orme as he assisted his mother to take her place and then following her he sat himself down in silence opposite to them mr aram who had carefully arranged his own programme shut the door and mounted on to the box beside the driver  mrs orme had held out her own hand and lady mason having taken it still held it after she was seated then they started and for the first mile no word was spoken between them mrs orme was most anxious to speak if it might only be for the sake of breaking the horrid stillness of their greeting but she could think of no word which it would be proper on such an occasion to say either to lucius or even before him had she been alone with lady mason there would have been enough of words that she could have spoken sir peregrines message was as a burden upon her tongue till she could deliver it but she could not deliver it while lucius mason was sitting by her  lady mason herself was the first to speak i did not know yesterday that lucius would come she said or i should have told you  i hope it does not inconvenience you he said  oh no by no means  i could not let my mother go out without me on such an occasion as this but i am grateful to you mrs orme for coming also  i thought it would be better for her to have some lady with her said mrs orme  oh yes it is bettermuch better and then no further word was spoken by any of them till the carriage drove up to the courthouse door it may be hoped that the journey was less painful to mr aram than to the others seeing that he solaced himself on the coachbox with a cigar  there was still a great crowd round the front of the courthouse when they reached it although the doors were open and the court was already sitting it had been arranged that this casethe great case of the assizeshould come on first on this day most of the criminal business having been completed on that preceding and mr aram had promised that his charge should be forthcoming exactly at ten oclock exactly at ten the carriage was driven up to the door and mr aram jumping from his seat directed certain policemen and sheriffs servants to make a way for the ladies up to the door and through the hall of the courthouse had he lived in alston all his life and spent his days in the purlieus of that court he could not have been more at home or have been more promptly obeyed  and now i think we may go in he said opening the door and letting down the steps with his own hands  at first he took them into a small room within the building and then bustled away himself into the court i shall be back in half a minute he said and in half a dozen halfminutes he was back we are all ready now and shall have no trouble about our places if you have anything to leaveshawls or things of that sortthey will be quite safe here mrs hitcham will look after them and then an old woman who had followed mr aram into the room on the last occasion curtsied to them but they had nothing to leave and their little procession was soon made  lucius at first offered his arm to his mother and she had taken it till she had gone through the door into the hall mr aram also had with some hesitation offered his arm to mrs orme but she in spite of that touch of sympathy had managed without speaking to decline it in the hall however when all the crowd of gazers had turned their eyes upon them and was only kept off from pressing on them by the policemen and sheriffs officers lady mason remembered herself and suddenly dropping her sons arm she put out her hand for mrs orme mr aram was now in front of them and thus they two followed him into the body of the court the veils of both of them were down but mrs ormes veil was not more than ordinarily thick and she could see everything that was around her so they walked up through the crowded way and lucius followed them by himself  they were very soon in their seats the crowd offering them no impediment the judge was already on the benchnot our old acquaintance justice staveley but his friend and colleague baron maltby judge staveley was sitting in the other court mrs orme and lady mason soon found themselves seated on a bench with a slight standing desk before them much as though they were seated in a narrow pew up above them on the same seat were the three barristers employed on lady masons behalf nearest to the judge was mr furnival then came felix graham and below him sat mr chaffanbrass somewhat out of the line of precedence in order that he might more easily avail himself of the services of mr aram lucius found himself placed next to mr chaffanbrass and his mother sat between him and mrs orme on the bench below them immediately facing a large table which was placed in the centre of the court sat mr aram and his clerk  illustration the court  mrs orme as she took her seat was so confused that she could hardly look around her and it may be imagined that lady mason must have suffered at any rate as much in the same way but they who were looking at herand it may be said that every one in the court was looking at herwere surprised to see that she raised her veil as soon as she was seated she raised her veil and never lowered it again till she left the court and repassed out into the hall she had thought much of this dayeven of the little incidents which would occurand she was aware that her identification would be necessary nobody should tell her to unveil herself nor would she let it be thought that she was afraid to face her enemies so there she sat during the whole day bearing the gaze of the court  she had dressed herself with great care it may be said of most women who could be found in such a situation that they would either give no special heed to their dress on such a morning or that they would appear in garments of sorrow studiously unbecoming and lachrymose or that they would attempt to outface the world and have appeared there in bright trappings fit for happier days but lady mason had dressed herself after none of these fashions never had her clothes been better made or worn with a better grace but they were all black from her bonnetribbon down to her boot and were put on without any attempt at finery or smartness as regards dress she had never looked better than she did now and mr furnival when his eye caught her as she turned her head round towards the judge was startled by the grace of her appearance her face was very pale and somewhat hard but no one on looking at it could say that it was the countenance of a woman overcome either by sorrow or by crime she was perfect mistress of herself and as she looked round the court not with defiant gaze but with eyes half raised and a look of modest but yet conscious intelligence those around her hardly dared to think that she could be guilty  as she thus looked her gaze fell on one face that she had not seen for years and their eyes met it was the face of joseph mason of groby who sat opposite to her and as she looked at him her own countenance did not quail for a moment her own countenance did not quail but his eyes fell gradually down and when he raised them again she had averted her face     chapter lxv  felix graham returns to noningsby   if you love the man let him come it was thus that the judge had declared to his daughter his opinion of what had better be done in that matter of felix graham then he had gone on to declare that he had given his permission to felix graham to say anything that he had got to say and finally had undertaken to invite felix graham to spend the assize week at noningsby of course in the mind of the judge all this amounted to an actual giving away of his daughter he regarded the thing now as done looking upon the young people as betrothed and his reflections mainly ran on the material part of the business how should graham be made to earn an income and what allowance must be made to him till he did so there was a certain sum set apart for madelines fortune but that would by no means suffice for the livelihood of a married barrister in london graham no doubt earned something as it was but that was done by his pen rather than by his wig and the judge was inclined to think that the pen must be abandoned before the wig could be made profitable such were the directions which his thoughts took regarding madelines lot in life with him the next week or two with their events did not signify much whereas the coming years did signify a great deal  at that time on that sunday afternoon there still remained to madeline the best part of a month to think of it all before felix should reappear upon the scene but then she could not think of it by herself in silence her father had desired her to tell her mother what had passed and she felt that a great difficulty still lay before her she knew that her mother did not wish her to marry felix graham she knew that her mother did wish her to marry peregrine orme and therefore though no mother and child had ever treated each other with a sweeter confidence or loved each other with warmer hearts there was as it were a matter of disunion between them but nevertheless she must tell her mother and the dread of this telling weighed heavy upon her as she sat that night in the drawingroom reading the article which felix had written  but she need not have been under any alarm her father when he told her to discuss the matter with her mother had by no means intended to throw on her shoulders the burden of converting lady staveley to the graham interest he took care to do this himself effectually so that in fact there should be no burden left for madelines shoulders well my dear he said that same sunday evening to his wife i have had it all out with madeline this afternoon  about mr graham do you mean  yes about mr graham i have promised that he shall come here for the assize week  oh dear  its done my love and i believe we shall find it all for the best the bishops daughters always marry clergymen and the judges daughters ought to marry lawyers  but you cant give him a practice the bishops have livings to give away  perhaps i may show him how to make a practice for himself which would be better take my word for it that it will be best for her happiness you would not have liked to be disappointed yourself when you made up your mind to be married  no i should not said lady staveley  and she will have a will of her own quite as strong as you had and then there was silence in the room for some time  youll be kind to him when he comes said the judge  oh yes said lady staveley in a voice that was by no means devoid of melancholy  nobody can be so kind as you when you please and as it is to be  i always did like him said lady staveley although he is so very plain  youll soon get used to that my dear  and as for poor young mr orme  as for poor young mr orme as you call him he will not die of a broken heart poor young mr orme has all the world before him and will soon console himself  but he is so attached to her and then the cleeve is so near  we must give up all that my dear  very well said lady staveley and from that moment it may be said that she had given in her adhesion to the graham connection when some time after she gave her orders to baker as to preparing a room for mr graham it was made quite clear to that excellent woman by her mistresss manner and anxiety as to the airing of the sheets that miss madeline was to have her own way in the matter  but long previous to these preparations madeline and her mother had discussed the matter fully papa says that mr graham is to come here for the assize week said lady staveley  yes so he told me madeline replied very bashfully  i suppose its all for the best  i hope it is said madeline what could she do but hope so  your papa understands everything so very well that i am sure he would not let him come if it were not proper  i suppose not said madeline  and now i look upon the matter as all settled  what matter mamma  that hethat he is to come here as your lover  oh no mamma pray dont imagine that it is not so at all what should i do if you were to say anything to make him think so  but you told me that you loved him  so i do mamma  and he told your papa that he was desperately in love with you  i dont know mamma  but he didyour papa told me so and thats why he asked him to come down here again he never would have done it without  madeline had her own idea about this believing that her father had thought more of her wants in the matter than he had of those of felix graham but as to this she said nothing nevertheless mamma you must not say that to any one she answered mr graham has never spoken to menot a word i should of course have told you had he done so  yes i am sure of that but madeline i suppose its all the same he asked papa for permission to speak to you and your papa has given it  im sure i dont know mamma  it was a quarter of an hour after that when lady staveley again returned to the subject i am sure mr graham is very clever and all that  papa says that he is very clever indeed  im quite sure he is and he makes himself very nice in the house always talking when there are people to dinner mr arbuthnot never will talk when there are people to dinner but mr arbuthnot has got a very nice place in warwickshire and they say hell come in for the county some day  of course mamma if there should be anything of that sort we should not be rich people like isabella and mr arbuthnot  not at first dear  neither first nor last but i dont care about that if you and papa will like him andandif it should come to thatoh mamma he is so good and so clever and he understands things and talks about things as though he knew how to make himself master of them and he is honest and proud oh mamma if it should be so i do hope you will love him  and then lady staveley promised that she would love him thinking nevertheless that had things gone differently she would have extended a more motherly warmth of affection to peregrine orme  and about this time peregrine orme made another visit to noningsby his intention was to see the judge explaining what steps his grandfather had taken as to the cleeve property and then once more to have thrown himself at madelines feet but circumstances as they turned out prevented this although he had been at some trouble to ascertain when the judge would be at noningsby nevertheless on his arrival the judge was out he would be home the servant said to dinner but not before and therefore he had again seen lady staveley and after seeing her had not thrown himself at madelines feet  he had made up his mind to give a systematic and detailed account of his pecuniary circumstances and had selected nearly the very words in which this should be made not actuated by any idea that such a process would have any weight with madeline or by any means assist him with her but hoping that he might thus procure the judges permission to press his suit but all this preparation and all his chosen words were of no use to him when he saw lady staveleys face he at once knew that she had no comfort to offer to him well he said is there any chance for me he had intended to speak in a very different tone but words which have been prepared seldom manage to fit themselves into their appropriate places  oh mr orme she said taking him by the hand and holding it i wish it were different i wish it could be different  there is no hope then and as he spoke there was a sound in his voice as though the tidings would utterly unman him  i should be wicked to deceive you she said there is no hope and then as she looked up at the sorrow so plainly written in the lines of his young handsome face tears came into her eyes and rolled down her cheeks how could it be that a daughter of hers should be indifferent to the love of such a suitor as this  but peregrine when he saw her sorrow repressed his own very well said he i will at any rate know how to take an answer and for your kindness to me in the matter i am much obliged i ought to have known myself better than to have supposed she could have cared for me  i am sure she feels that you have done her great honour  psha honour but never mindgoodbye lady staveley  will you not see her  no why should i see her give her my lovemy best love  i willi will  and tell her that i hope she may be happy and make some fellow happy who is more fortunate than i am i shall get out of the way somewhere so that i shall not make a fool of myself when i see it and then he took his departure and rode back again to the cleeve this happened two days before the commencement of the trial and the day before that on which graham was to arrive at noningsby  when graham received the judges note asking him to put up at noningsby for the assize week he was much astonished it was very short      dear graham     as you are coming down to alston special in lady masons    case you may as well come and stay here lady staveley    bids me say that she will be delighted your elder    brethren will no doubt go back to london each night so    that you will not be expected to remain with them     yours always c   what could be the intention of the judge in taking so strange a step as this the judge had undertaken to see him in three months having given him some faint idea that there then might be a chance of hope but now before one month was over he was actually sending for him to the house and inviting him to stay there what would all the bar world say when they found that a young barrister was living at the judges house during the assizes would it not be in every mans mouth that he was a suitor accepted both by the judges daughter and by the judge there would be nothing in that to go against the grain with him if only the fact were so that the fact should be so he could not venture to hope even on this hint but he accepted the judges invitation sent his grateful thanks to lady staveleyas to lady staveleys delight he was sure that the judge must have romanced a little for he had clearly recognised lady staveley as his enemyand then he prepared himself for the chances of war  on the evening before the trial he arrived at noningsby just in time for dinner he had been obliged to remain an hour or two at alston in conference with mr aram and was later than he had expected he would be he had been afraid to come early in the day lest by doing so he might have seemed to overstep the margin of his invitation when he did arrive the two ladies were already dressing and he found the judge in the hall  a pretty fellow you are said the judge its dinnertime already and of course you take an hour to dress  mr aram began felix  oh yes mr aram ill give you fifteen minutes but not a moment more and so felix was hurried on up to his bedroomthe old bedroom in which he had passed so many hours and been so very uneasy as he entered the room all that conversation with augustus staveley returned upon his memory he had seen his friend in london and told him that he was going down to noningsby augustus had looked grave but had said nothing about madeline augustus was not in his fathers confidence in this matter and had nothing to do but to look grave on that very morning moreover some cause had been given to himself for gravity of demeanour  at the door of his room he met mrs baker and hurried though he was by the judges strict injunction he could not but shake hands with his old and very worthy friend  quite strong again said he in answer to her tender inquiries  so you are i do declare i will say this mr graham for wholesomeness of flesh you beat anything i ever come nigh theres a many would have been weeks and weeks before they could have been moved  it was your good nursing mrs baker  well i think we did take care of you among us do you remember the pheasant mr graham  remember it i should think so and how i improved the occasion  yes you did improve fast enough and the seakale mr graham laws the row i had with john gardener about that and mr graham do you remember how a certain friend used to come and ask after you at the door dear dear dear i nearly caught it about that  but graham in his present frame of mind could not well endure to discuss his remembrances on that subject with mrs baker so he goodhumouredly pushed her out of the room saying that the judge would be mad if he delayed  thats true too mr graham and it wont do for you to take up mr augustuss tricks in the house yet will it and then she left the room what does she mean by yet felix said to himself as he went through the ceremony of dressing with all the haste in his power  he was in the drawingroom almost within the fifteen minutes and there he found none but the judge and his wife and daughter he had at first expected to find augustus there but had been told by mrs baker that he was to come down on the following morning his first greeting from lady staveley was something like that he had already received up stairs only made in less exuberant language he was congratulated on his speedy recovery and made welcome by a kind smile then he shook hands with madeline and as he did so he observed that the judge was at the trouble to turn away so that he should not watch the greeting this he did see but into madelines face he hardly ventured to look he touched her hand however and said a word and she also murmured something about his injury and now well go to dinner said the judge give your arm that is not broken to lady staveley and so the meeting was over augustus will be in alston tomorrow when the court is opened said the judge that is to say if he finds it possible to get up so soon but today he had some engagements in town the truth however was that the judge had chosen to be alone with felix after dinner  the dinner was very pleasant but the judge talked for the whole party madeline hardly spoke at all nor did lady staveley say much felix managed to put in a few words occasionally as it always becomes a good listener to do but the brunt of the battle lay with the host one thing felix observed painfullythat not a word was spoken about lady mason or orley farm when he had been last there the judge had spoken of it openly before the whole party expressing his opinion that she was a woman much injured but now neither did he say anything nor did lady staveley he would probably not have observed this had not a feeling crept upon him during the last fortnight that that thorough conviction which men had felt as to her innocence was giving way while the ladies were there however he did not himself allude to the subject  when they had left the room and the door had been closed behind them the judge began the campaignbegan it and as far as he was concerned ended it in a very few minutes graham said he i am glad to see you  thank you judge said he  of course you know and i know what that amounts to now my idea is that you acted as an honest man when you were last here you are not a rich man  anything but that  and therefore i do not think it would have been well had you endeavoured to gain my daughters affections without speaking to meor to her mother judge staveley always spoke of his wife as though she were an absolute part of himself she and i have discussed the matter nowand you are at liberty to address yourself to madeline if you please  my dear judge  of course you understand that i am not answering for her  oh of course not  thats your look out you must fight your own battle there what you are allowed to understand is thisthat her father and mother will give their consent to an engagement if she finds that she can bring herself to give hers if you are minded to ask her you may do so  of course i shall ask her  she will have five thousand pounds on her marriage settled upon herself and her childrenand as much more when i die settled in the same way now fill your glass and in his own easy way he turned the subject round and began to talk about the late congress at birmingham  felix felt that it was not open to him at the present moment to say anything further about madeline and though he was disappointed at thisfor he would have wished to go on talking about her all the eveningperhaps it was better for him the judge would have said nothing further to encourage him and he would have gradually been taught to think that his chance with madeline was little and then less he must have been a fool my readers will say not to have known that madeline was now his own probably but then modestminded young men are fools  at last he contrived to bring the conversation round from the birmingham congress to the affairs of his new client and indeed he contrived to do so in spite of the judge who was not particularly anxious to speak on the subject after all that we said and did at birmingham it is odd that i should so soon find myself joined with mr furnival  not at all odd of course you must take up your profession as others have taken it up before you very many young men dream of a themis fit for utopia you have slept somewhat longer than others and your dreams have been more vivid  and now i wake to find myself leagued with the empson and dudley of our latterday law courts  fie graham fie do not allow yourself to speak in that tone of men whom you know to be zealous advocates and whom you do not know to be dishonest opponents  it is they and such as they that make so many in these days feel the need of some utopiaas it was in the old days of our history but i beg your pardon for nicknaming them and certainly ought not to have done so in your presence  well if you repent yourself and will be more charitable for the future i will not tell of you  i have never yet even seen mr chaffanbrass in court said felix after a pause  the more shame for you never to have gone to the court in which he practises a barrister intending to succeed at the common law bar cannot have too wide an experience in such matters  but then i fear that i am a barrister not intending to succeed  i am very sorry to hear it said the judge and then again the conversation flagged for a minute or two  have you ever seen him at a country assize town before judge asked felix  whom chaffanbrass i do not remember that i have  his coming down in this way is quite unusual i take it  rather so i should say the old bailey is his own ground  and why should they think it necessary in such a case as this to have recourse to such a proceeding  it would be for me to ask you that seeing that you are one of the counsel  do you mean to say judge that between you and me you are unwilling to give an opinion on such a subject  well you press me hard and i think i may fairly say that i am unwilling i would sooner discuss the matter with you after the verdict than before it come we will go into the drawingroom  there was not much in this indeed if it were properly looked at there was nothing in it but nevertheless graham as he preceded the judge out of the diningroom felt that his heart misgave him about lady mason when first the matter had been spoken of at noningsby judge staveley had been fully convinced of lady masons innocence and had felt no reserve in expressing his opinion he had expressed such an opinion very openly why should he now affect so much reticence seeing that the question had been raised in the presence of them two alone it was he who had persuaded graham to undertake this work and now he went back from what he had done and refused even to speak upon the subject it must be that he thinks she is guilty said graham to himself as he lay down that night in bed  but there had been something more for him to do before bedtime came he followed the judge into the drawingroom and in five minutes perceived that his host had taken up a book with the honest intention of reading it some reference was made to him by his wife but he showed at once that he did not regard graham as company and that he conceived himself to be entitled to enjoy the full luxury of home upon my word i dont know he answered without taking his eye off the page and then nobody spoke to him another word  after another short interval lady staveley went to sleep when felix graham had before been at noningsby she would have rebelled against nature with all her force rather than have slept while he was left to whisper what he would to her darling but now he was authorised to whisper and why should not lady staveley sleep if she wished it she did sleep and felix was left alone with his love  illustration the drawingroom at noningsby  and yet he was not altogether alone he could not say to her those words which he was now bound to say which he longed to say in order that he might know whether the next stage of his life was to be light or dark there sat the judge closely intent no doubt upon his book but wide awake there also sat lady staveley fast asleep certainly but with a wondrous power of hearing even in her sleep and yet how was he to talk to his love unless he talked of love he wished that the judge would help them to converse he wished that some one else was there he wished at last that he himself was away madeline sat perfectly tranquil stitching a collar upon her there was incumbent no duty of doing anything beyond that but he was in a measure bound to talk had he dared to do so he also would have taken up a book but that he knew to be impossible  your brother will be down tomorrow he said at last  yes he is to go direct to alston he will be here in the eveningto dinner  ah yes i suppose we shall all be late tomorrow  papa always is late when the assizes are going on said madeline  alston is not very far said felix  only two miles she answered  and during the whole of that long evening the conversation between them did not reach a more interesting pitch than that  she must think me an utter fool said felix to himself as he sat staring at the fire how well her brother would have made the most of such an opportunity and then he went to bed by no means in a good humour with himself  on the next morning he again met her at breakfast but on that occasion there was no possible opportunity for private conversation the judge was all alive and talked enough for the whole party during the twenty minutes that was allowed to them before they started for alston and now we must be off well say halfpast seven for dinner my dear and then they also made their journey to alston     chapter lxvi  showing how miss furnival treated her lovers   it is a great thing for young ladies to live in a household in which free correspondence by letter is permitted two for mamma four for amelia three for fanny and one for papa when the postman has left his budget they should be dealt out in that way and no more should be said about itexcept what each may choose to say papas letter is about money of course and interests nobody mammas contain the character of a cook and an invitation to dinner and as they interest everybody are public property but fannys letters and amelias should be private and a wellbred mamma of the present day scorns even to look at the handwriting of the addresses now in harley street things were so managed that nobody did see the handwriting of the addresses of sophias letters till they came into her own handthat is neither her father nor her mother did so that both spooner and mrs ball examined them closely is probable enough  this was well for her now for she did not wish it to be known as yet that she had accepted an offer from lucius mason and she did wish to have the privilege of receiving his letters she fancied that she loved him she told herself over and over again that she did so she compared him within her own mind to augustus staveley and always gave the preference to lucius she liked augustus also and could have accepted him as well had it been the way of the world in england for ladies to have two accepted lovers such is not the way of the world in england and she therefore had been under the necessity of choosing one she had taken the better of the two she declared to herself very often but nevertheless was it absolutely necessary that the other should be abandoned altogether would it not be well at any rate to wait till this trial should be over but then the young men themselves were in such a hurry  lucius like an honest man had proposed to go at once to mr furnival when he was accepted but to this sophia had objected the peculiar position in which my father stands to your mother at the present moment said she would make it very difficult for him to give you an answer now lucius did not quite understand the reasoning but he yielded it did not occur to him for a moment that either mr or miss furnival could doubt the validity of his title to the orley farm property  but there was no reason why he should not write to her shall i address here he had asked oh yes said sophia my letters are quite private and he had written very frequently and she had answered him his last letter before the trial i propose to publish together with sophias answer giving it as my opinion that the gentlemans production affords by no means a good type of a lovers letter but then his circumstances were peculiar miss furnivals answer was i think much better      orley farm        my own sophia     my only comforti may really say my only comfort nowis    in writing to you it is odd that at my age and having    begun the world early as i did i should now find myself    so much alone were it not for you i should have no    friend i cannot describe to you the sadness of this    house nor the wretched state in which my mother exists i    sometimes think that had she been really guilty of those    monstrous crimes which people lay to her charge she could    hardly have been more miserable i do not understand it    nor can i understand why your father has surrounded her    with lawyers whom he would not himself trust in a case of    any moment to me she never speaks on the subject which    makes the matter worseworse for both of us i see her    at breakfast and at dinner and sometimes sit with her    for an hour in the evening but even then we have no    conversation the end of it is i trust soon coming and    then i hope that the sun will again be bright in these    days it seems as though there were a cloud over the whole    earth     i wish with all my heart that you could have been here    with her i think that your tone and strength of mind    would have enabled her to bear up against these troubles    with more fortitude after all it is but the shadow of    a misfortune which has come across her if she would but    allow herself so to think as it is mrs orme is with    her daily and nothing i am sure can be more kind but i    can confess to you though i could do so to no one else    that i do not willingly see an intimacy kept up between    my mother and the cleeve why was there that strange    proposition as to her marriage and why when it was once    made was it abandoned i know that my mother has been    not only guiltless but guileless in these matters as to    which she is accused but nevertheless her affairs will    have been so managed that it will be almost impossible for    her to remain in this neighbourhood     when all this is over i think i shall sell this place    what is there to bind meto bind me or you to orley    farm sometimes i have thought that i could be happy here    devoting myself to agriculture  fiddlesticks sophia exclaimed as she read this     and doing something to lessen the dense ignorance of    those around me but for such work as that a man should    be able to extend himself over a larger surface than that    which i can influence my dream of happiness now carries    me away from this to other countriesto the sunny    south could you be happy there a friend of mine whom i    well knew in germany has a villa on the lake of como  indeed sir ill do no such thing said sophia to herself     and there i think we might forget all this annoyance     i shall not write again now till the trial is over i have    made up my mind that i will be in court during the whole    proceedings if my mother will admit it i will remain    there close to her as her son should do in such an    emergency if she will not have this still i will be    there no one shall say that i am afraid to see my mother    in any position to which fortune can bring her or that i    have ever doubted her innocence     god bless you my own one     yours     l m   taking this letter as a whole perhaps we may say that there was not as much nonsense in it as young gentlemen generally put into their loveletters to young ladies but i am inclined to think that it would have been a better loveletter had there been more nonsense at any rate there should have been less about himself and more about the lady he should have omitted the agriculture altogether and been more sure of his loved ones tastes before he suggested the sunny south and the como villa it is true that he was circumstanced as few lovers are with reference to his mother but still i think he might have been less lachrymose sophias answer which was sent after the lapse of a day or two was as follows      harley street        my dear lucius     i am not surprised that you should feel somewhat    lowspirited at the present moment but you will find    i have no doubt that the results of the next week will    cure all that your mother will be herself again when this    trial is over and you will then wonder that it should    ever have had so depressing an influence either upon you    or upon her i cannot but suppose that papa has done the    best as to her advisers i know how anxious he is about    it and they say that he is very clever in such matters    pray give your mother my love i cannot but think she    is lucky to have mrs orme with her what can be more    respectable than a connection at such a time with such    people     as to your future residence do not make up your mind    to anything while your spirits are thus depressed if    you like to leave orley farm why not let it instead of    selling it as for me if it should be fated that our lots    are to go together i am inclined to think that i should    prefer to live in england in london papas position might    probably be of some service and i should like no life    that was not active but it is too early in the day to    talk thus at present you must not think me cold hearted    if i say that what has as yet been between us must not be    regarded as an absolute and positive engagement i on my    part hope that it may become so my heart is not cold    and i am not ashamed to own that i esteem you favourably    but marriage is a very serious thing and there is so much    to be considered i regard myself as a free agent and in    a great measure independent of my parents on such a matter    as that but still i think it well to make no positive    promise without consulting them when this trial is over    i will speak to my father and then you will come up to    london and see us     mind you give my love to your mother andif it have any    value in your eyesaccept it yourself     your affectionate friend     sophia furnival   i feel very confident that mrs furnival was right in declining to inquire very closely into the circumstances of her daughters correspondence a young lady who could write such a letter to her lover as that requires but little looking after and in those points as to which she may require it willif she be so mindedelude it such as miss furnival was no care on her mothers part would i think have made her better much care might have made her worse as had she been driven to such resources she would have received her letters under a false name at the bakers shop round the corner  but the last letter was not written throughout without interruption she was just declaring how on her part she hoped that her present uncertain tenure of her lovers hand might at some future time become certain when augustus staveley was announced sophia who was alone in the drawingroom rose from her table gracefully slipped her note under the cover of the desk and courteously greeted her visitor and how are they all at dear noningsby she asked  illustration and how are they all at noningsby  dear noningsby is nearly deserted there is no one there but my mother and madeline  and who more would be wanting to make it still dearunless it be the judge i declare mr staveley i was quite in love with your father when i left talk of honey falling from peoples mouthshe drops nothing less than champagne and pineapples  how very difficult of digestion his conversation must be  by no means if the wine be good and the fruit ripe nothing can be more wholesome and is everybody else gone let me seemr graham was still there when i left  he came away shortly afterwardsas soon that is as his arm would allow him  what a happy accident that was for him mr staveley  happybreaking three of his ribs his arm and his collarbone i thought it very unhappy  ah thats because your character is so deficient in true chivalry i call it a very happy accident which gives a gentleman an opportunity of spending six weeks under the same roof with the lady of his love mr graham is a man of spirit and i am by no means sure that he did not break his bones on purpose  augustus for a moment thought of denying the imputation with regard to his sister but before he had spoken he had changed his mind he was already aware that his friend had been again invited down to noningsby and if his father chose to encourage graham why should he make difficulties he had conceived some general idea that felix graham was not a guest to be welcomed into a rich mans family as a soninlaw he was poor and crotchety and as regards professional matters unsteady but all that was a matter for his father to consider not for him so he held his peace as touching graham and contrived to change the subject veering round towards that point of the compass which had brought him into harley street  perhaps then miss furnival it might answer some purpose if i were to get myself run over outside there i could get one of pickfords vans or a dray from barclay and perkins if that might be thought serviceable  it would be of no use in the world mr staveley those very charitable middleaged ladies opposite the miss mac codies would have you into their house in no time and when you woke from your first swoon you would find yourself in their best bedroom with one on each side of you  and you in the mean time  i should send over every morning at ten oclock to inquire after youin mammas name mrs furnivals compliments and hopes mr staveley will recover the use of his legs and the man would bring back word the doctor hopes he may miss but his left eye is gone for ever it is not everybody that can tumble discreetly now you i fancy would only disfigure yourself  then i must try what fortune can do for me without the brewers dray  fortune has done quite enough for you mr staveley i do not advise you to tempt her any further  miss furnival i have come to harley street today on purpose to tempt her to the utmost there is my hand  mr staveley pray keep your hand for a while longer in your own possession  undoubtedly i shall do so unless i dispose of it this morning when we were at noningsby together i ventured to tell you what i felt for you  did you mr staveley if your feelings were anything beyond the common i dont remember the telling  and then he continued without choosing to notice her words you affected to believe that i was not in earnest in what i said to you  and you must excuse me if i affect to believe the same thing of you still  augustus staveley had come into harley street with a positive resolve to throw his heart and hand and fortune at the feet of miss furnival i fear that i shall not raise him in the estimation of my readers by saying so but then my readers will judge him unfairly they will forget that they have had a much better opportunity of looking into the character of miss furnival than he had had and they will also forget that they have had no such opportunity of being influenced by her personal charms i think i remarked before that miss furnival well understood how best to fight her own battle had she shown herself from the first anxious to regard as a definite offer the first words tending that way which augustus had spoken to her he would at once have become indifferent about the matter as a consequence of her judicious conduct he was not indifferent we always want that which we cant get easily sophia had made herself difficult to be gotten and therefore augustus fancied that he wanted her since he had been in town he had been frequently in harley street and had been arguing with himself on the matter what match could be more discreet or better not only was she very handsome but she was clever also and not only was she handsome and clever but moreover she was an heiress what more could his friends want for him and what more could he want for himself his mother did in truth regard her as a nasty sly girl but then his mother did not know sophia and in such matters mothers are so ignorant  miss furnival on his thus repeating his offer again chose to affect a belief that he was not in earnest i am inclined to think that she rather liked this kind of thing there is an excitement in the game and it is one which may be played without great danger to either party if it be played cautiously and with some skill as regards augustus at the present moment i have to saywith some regretthat he abandoned all idea of caution and that he showed very little skill  then said he i must beg you to lay aside an affectation which is so very injurious both to my honour and to my hopes of happiness  your honour mr staveley is quite safe i am certain  i wish that my happiness were equally so said he but at any rate you will let me have an answer sophia  and now he stood up looking at her with something really like love in his eyes and miss furnival began to understand that if she so chose it the prize was really within her reach but then was it a prize was not the other thing the better prize the other thing was the better prizeif only that affair about the orley farm were settled augustus staveley was a goodlooking handsome fellow but then there was that in the manner and gait of lucius mason which better suited her taste there are ladies who prefer worcester ware to real china and moreover the order for the worcester ware had already been given  sophia let a man be ever so lighthearted there will come to him moments of absolute and almost terrible earnestness  even to you mr staveley  i have at any rate done nothing to deserve your scorn  fie now you to talk of my scorn you come here with soft words which run easily from your tongue feeling sure that i shall be proud in heart when i hear them whispered into my ears and now you pretend to be angry because i do not show you that i am elated do you think it probable that i should treat with scorn anything of this sort that you might say to me seriously  i think you are doing so  have you generally found yourself treated with scorn when you have been out on this pursuit  by heavens you have no right to speak to me so in what way shall i put my words to make them sound seriously to you do you want me to kneel at your feet as our grandfathers used to do  oh certainly not our grandmothers were very stupid in desiring that  if i put my hand on my heart will you believe me better  not in the least  then through what formula shall i go  go through no formula mr staveley in such affairs as these very little as i take it depends on the words that are uttered when heart has spoken to heart or even head to head very little other speaking is absolutely necessary  and my heart has not spoken to yours  wellnonot with that downright plain open language which a heart in earnest always knows how to use i suppose you think you like me  sophia i love you well enough to make you my wife tomorrow  yes and to be tired of your bargain on the next day has it ever occurred to you that giving and taking in marriage is a very serious thing  a very serious thing but i do not think that on that account it should be avoided  no but it seems to me that you are always inclined to play at marriage do not be angry with me but for the life of me i can never think you are in earnest  but i shall be angryvery angryif i do not get from you some answer to what i have ventured to say  what now todaythis morning if you insist upon that the answer can only be of one sort if i am driven to decide this morning on the question that you have asked me great as the honour isand coming from you mr staveley it is very greati must decline it i am not able at any rate at the present moment to trust my happiness altogether in your hands when we think of the halfwritten letter which at this moment miss furnival had within her desk this was not wonderful  and then without having said anything more that was of note augustus staveley went his way as he walked up harley street he hardly knew whether or no he was to consider himself as bound to miss furnival nor did he feel quite sure whether or no he wished to be so bound she was handsome and clever and an heiress but yet he was not certain that she possessed all those womanly charms which are desirable in a wife he could not but reflect that she had never yet said a soft word to him     chapter lxvii  mr moulder backs his opinion   as the day of the trial drew nigh the perturbation of poor john kennebys mind became very great moulder had not intended to frighten him but had thought it well to put him up to what he believed to be the truth no doubt he would be badgered and bullied and as moulder said to his wife afterwards wasnt it better that he should know what was in store for him the consequence was that had it been by any means possible kenneby would have run away on the day before the trial  but it was by no means possible for dockwrath had hardly left him alone for an instant dockwrath at this time had crept into a sort of employment in the case from which matthew round had striven in vain to exclude him mr round had declared once or twice that if mr mason encouraged dockwrath in interfering he round would throw the matter up but professional men cannot very well throw up their business and round went on although dockwrath did interfere and although mr mason did encourage him on the eve of the trial he went down to alston with kenneby and bolster and mr moulder at the express instance of kenneby accompanied them  what can i do i cant stop the fellows gab moulder had said but kenneby pleaded hard that some friend might be near him in the day of his trouble and moulder at last consented  i wish it was me mrs smiley had said when they talked the matter over in great st helens id let the barrister know what was what when he came to knock me about kenneby wished it also with all his heart  mr mason went down by the same train but he travelled by the first class dockwrath who was now holding his head up would have gone with him had he not thought it better to remain with kenneby he might jump out of the carriage and destroy himself he said to mr mason  if he had any of the feelings of an englishman within his breast said mason he would be anxious to give assistance towards the punishment of such a criminal as that  he has only the feelings of a tomtit said dockwrath  lodgings had been taken for the two chief witnesses together and moulder and dockwrath shared the accommodation with them as they sat down to tea together these two gentlemen doubtless felt that bridget bolster was not exactly fitting company for them but the necessities of an assize week and of such a trial as this level much of these distinctions and they were both prepared to condescend and become affable  well mrs bolster and how do you find yourself asked dockwrath  bridget was a solid squarelooking woman somewhat given to flesh and now not very quick in her movements but the nature of her past life had given to her a certain amount of readiness and an absence of that dread of her fellowcreatures which so terribly afflicted poor kenneby and then also she was naturally not a stupid woman or one inclined to be muddleheaded perhaps it would be too much to say that she was generally intelligent but what she did understand she understood thoroughly  pretty well i thank you mr dockwrath i shant be sorry to have a bit of something to my tea  bridget bolster perfectly understood that she was to be well fed when thus brought out for work in her countrys service to have everything that she wanted to eat and drink at places of public entertainment and then to have the bills paid for her behind her back was to bridget bolster the summit of transitory human bliss  and you shall have something to your tea said dockwrath whats it to be  a steaks as good as anything at these places suggested moulder  or some ham and eggs suggested dockwrath  kidneys is nice said bridget  what do you say kenneby asked dockwrath  it is nothing to me said kenneby i have no appetite i think ill take a little brandyandwater  mr moulder possessed the most commanding spirit and the steak was ordered they then made themselves as comfortable as circumstances would admit and gradually fell into a general conversation about the trial it had been understood among them since they first came together that as a matter of etiquette the witnesses were not to be asked what they had to say kenneby was not to divulge his facts in plain language nor bridget bolster those which belonged to her but it was open to them all to take a general view of the matter and natural that at the present moment they should hardly be able to speak of anything else and there was a very divided opinion on the subject in dispute dockwrath of course expressing a strong conviction in favour of a verdict of guilty and moulder being as certain of an acquittal at first moulder had been very unwilling to associate with dockwrath for he was a man who maintained his animosities long within his breast but dockwrath on this occasion was a great man and there was some slight reflection of greatness on the associates of dockwrath it was only by the assistance of dockwrath that a place could be obtained within the court and upon the whole it became evident to moulder that during such a crisis as this the society of dockwrath must be endured  they cant do anything to one if one do ones best said kenneby who was sitting apart from the table while the others were eating  of course they cant said dockwrath who wished to inspirit the witnesses on his own side  it aint what they do but what they say said moulder and then everybody is looking at you i remember a case when i was young on the road it was at nottingham there had been some sugars delivered and the rats had got at it im blessed if they didnt ask me backwards and forwards so often that i forgot whether they was seconds or thirds though id sold the goods myself and then the lawyer said hed have me prosecuted for perjury well i was that frightened i could not stand in the box i aint so green now by a good deal  im sure youre not mr moulder said bridget who well understood the class to which moulder belonged  after that i met that lawyer in the street and was ashamed to look him in the face im blessed if he didnt come up and shake hands with me and tell me that he knew all along that his client hadnt a leg to stand on now i call that beautiful  beautiful said kenneby  yes i do he fought that battle just as if he was sure of winning though he knew he was going to lose give me the man that can fight a losing battle anybody can play whist with four by honours in his own hands  i dont object to four by honours either said dockwrath and thats the game we are going to play tomorrow  and lose the rubber after all said moulder  no im blessed if we do mr moulder if i know anything of my own profession  humph ejaculated moulder  and i shouldnt be here in such a case as this if i didntbut if i do lady mason has no more chance of escape thanthanthan that bit of muffin has and as he spoke the savoury morsel in question disappeared from the fingers of the commercial traveller  for a moment or two moulder could not answer him the portion of food in question was the last on his plate it had been considerable in size and required attention in mastication then the remaining gravy had to be picked up on the blade of the knife and the particles of pickles collected and disposed of by the same process but when all this had been well done moulder replied  that may be your opinion mr dockwrath and i dare say you may know what youre about  well i rather think i do mr moulder  mines different now when one gentleman thinks one thing and another thinks another theres nothing for it in my mind but for each gentleman to back his own thats about the ticket in this country i believe  thats just as a gentleman may feel disposed said dockwrath  no it aint whats the use of a man having an opinion if he wont back it hes bound to back it or else he should give way and confess he aint so sure about it as he said he was theres no coming to an end if you dont do that now theres a tenpound note and moulder produced that amount of the root of all evil ill put that in john kennebys hands and do you cover it and then he looked as though there were no possible escape from the proposition which he had made  i decline to have anything to do with it said kenneby  gammon said moulder two tenpound notes wont burn a hole in your pocket  suppose i should be asked a question about it tomorrow where should i be then  dont trouble yourself mr kenneby said dockwrath im not going to bet  you aint aint you said moulder  certainly not mr moulder if you understood professional matters a little better youd know that a professional gentleman couldnt make a bet as to a case partly in his own hands without very great impropriety and dockwrath gathered himself up endeavouring to impress a sense of his importance on the two witnesses even should he fail of doing so upon mr moulder  moulder repocketed his tenpound note and laughed with a long low chuckle according to his idea of things he had altogether got the better of the attorney upon that subject as he himself put it so plainly what criterion is there by which a man can test the validity of his own opinion if he be not willing to support it by a bet a man is bound to do so or else to give way and apologise for many years he had insisted upon this in commercial rooms as a fundamental law in the character and conduct of gentlemen and never yet had anything been said to him to show that in such a theory he was mistaken  during all this bridget bolster sat there much delighted it was not necessary to her pleasure that she should say much herself there she was seated in the society of gentlemen and of men of the world with a cup of tea beside her and the expectation of a little drop of something warm afterwards what more could the world offer to her or what more had the world to offer to anybody as far as her feelings went she did not care if lady mason were tried every month in the year not that her feelings towards lady mason were cruel it was nothing to her whether lady mason should be convicted or acquitted but it was much to her to sit quietly on her chair and have nothing to do to eat and drink of the best and be made much of and it was very much to her to hear the conversation of her betters  on the following morning dockwrath breakfasted by appointment with mr masonpromising however that he would return to his friends whom he left behind him and introduce them into the court in proper time as i have before hinted mr masons confidence in dockwrath had gone on increasing day by day since they had first met each other at groby park till he now wished that he had altogether taken the advice of the hamworth attorney and put this matter entirely into his hands by degrees joseph mason had learned to understand and thoroughly to appreciate the strong points in his own case and now he was so fully convinced of the truth of those surmises which dockwrath had been the first to make that no amount of contrary evidence could have shaken him and why had not round and crook found this out when the matter was before investigated why had they prevented him from appealing to the lord chancellor when through their own carelessness the matter had gone against him in the inferior court and why did they now even in these latter days when they were driven to reopen the case by the clearness of the evidence submitted to themwhy did they even now wound his ears irritate his temper and oppose the warmest feelings of his heart by expressing pity for this wicked criminal whom it was their bounden duty to prosecute to the very utmost was it not by their fault that orley farm had been lost to him for the last twenty years and yet young round had told him with the utmost composure that it would be useless for him to look for any of those moneys which should have accrued to him during all those years after what had passed young round should have been anxious to grind lucius mason into powder and make money of his very bones must he not think when he considered all these things that round and crook had been wilfully dishonest to him and that their interest had been on the side of lady mason he did so think at last under the beneficent tutelage of his new adviser and had it been possible would have taken the case out of the hands of round and crook even during the week before the trial  we mustnt do it now dockwrath had said in his triumph if we did the whole thing would be delayed but they shall be so watched that they shall not be able to throw the thing over ive got them in a vice mr mason and ill hold them so tight that they must convict her whether they will or no  and the nature and extent of mr dockwraths reward had been already settled when lucius mason should be expelled from orley farm with ignominy he dockwrath should become the tenant the very rent was settled with the understanding that it should be remitted for the first year it would be pleasant to him to have back his two fields in this wayhis two fields and something else beyond it may be remembered that lucius mason had once gone to his office insulting him it would now be his turn to visit lucius mason at his domicile he was disposed to think that such visit would be made by him with more effect than had attended that other  well sir were all right he said as he shook hands with mr mason of groby theres no screw loose that i can find  and will that man be able to speak mr mason was alluding to john kenneby  i think he will as corroborating the woman bolster thats all we shall want we shall put up the woman first that is after i have done i dont think theyll make much of her mr mason  they cant make her say that she signed two deeds if she is willing to tell the truth theres no danger you think that shes been tampered withthat she has taken money  no no theres been nothing of that  theyd do anything you know said mr mason think of such a man as solomon aram hes been used to it all his life you know  they could not do it mr mason ive been too sharp on them and i tell you whatthey know it now there isnt one of them that doesnt know we shall get a verdict and then for a few minutes there was silence between the two friends  ill tell you what dockwrath said mr mason after a while ive so set my heart upon thisupon getting justice at lastthat i do think it would kill me if i were to be beaten i do indeed ive known this you know all my life and think what ive felt for twentytwo years dockwrath by  in all that i have read i dont think i ever heard of such a hardship that she should have robbed me for twoandtwenty yearsand now they say that she will be imprisoned for twelve months  shell get more than that mr mason  i know what would have been done to her thirty years ago when the country was in earnest about such matters what did they do to fauntleroy  things are changed since then aint they said dockwrath with a laugh and then he went to look up his flock and take them into court ill meet you in the hall mr mason in twenty minutes from this time  and so the play was beginning on each side     chapter lxviii  the first day of the trial   and now the judge was there on the bench the barristers and the attorneys were collected the prisoner was seated in their presence and the trial was begun as is usual in cases of much public moment when a person of mark is put upon his purgation or the offence is one which has attracted notice a considerable amount of time was spent in preliminaries but we who are not bound by the necessities under which the court laboured will pass over these somewhat rapidly the prisoner was arraigned on the charge of perjury and pleaded not guilty in a voice which though low was audible to all the court at that moment the hum of voices had stayed itself and the two small words spoken in a clear silver tone reached the ears of all that then were there assembled some had surmised it to be possible that she would at the last moment plead guilty but such persons had not known lady mason and then by slow degrees a jury was sworn a considerable number of jurors having been set aside at the instance of lady masons counsel mr aram had learned to what part of the county each man belonged and upon his instructions those who came from the neighbourhood of hamworth were passed over  the comparative lightness of the offence divested the commencement of the trial of much of that importance and apparent dignity which attach themselves to most celebrated criminal cases the prisoner was not bidden to look upon the juror nor the juror to look upon the prisoner as though a battle for life and death were to be fought between them a true bill of perjury had come down to the court from the grand jury but the court officials could not bring themselves on such an occasion to open the case with all that solemnity and deference to the prisoner which they would have exhibited had she been charged with murdering her old husband nor was it even the same as though she had been accused of forgery though forgery be not now a capital crime it was so within our memories and there is still a certain grandeur in the name but perjury sounds small and petty and it was not therefore till the trial had advanced a stage or two that it assumed that importance which it afterwards never lost that this should be so cut mr mason of groby to the very soul even mr dockwrath had been unable to make him understand that his chance of regaining the property was under the present circumstances much greater than it would have been had lady mason been arraigned for forgery he would not believe that the act of forgery might possibly not have been proved could she have been first whipped through the street for the misdemeanour and then hung for the felony his spirit would not have been more than sufficiently appeased  the case was opened by one mr steelyard the junior counsel for the prosecution but his work on this occasion was hardly more than formal he merely stated the nature of the accusation against lady mason and the issue which the jury were called upon to try then got up sir richard leatherham the solicitorgeneral and at great length and with wonderful perspicuity explained all the circumstances of the case beginning with the undoubted will left by sir joseph mason the will independently of the codicil and coming down gradually to the discovery of that document in mr dockwraths office which led to the surmise that the signature of those two witnesses had been obtained not to a codicil to a will but to a deed of another character in doing this sir richard did not seem to lean very heavily upon lady mason nor did he say much as to the wrongs suffered by mr mason of groby when he alluded to mr dockwrath and his part in these transactions he paid no compliment to the hamworth attorney but in referring to his learned friend on the other side he protested his conviction that the defence of lady mason would be conducted not only with zeal but in that spirit of justice and truth for which the gentlemen opposite to him were so conspicuous in their profession all this was wormwood to joseph mason but nevertheless though sir richard was so moderate as to his own side and so courteous to that opposed to him he made it very clear before he sat down that if those witnesses were prepared to swear that which he was instructed they would swear either they must be utterly unworthy of credita fact which his learned friends opposite were as able to elicit as any gentlemen who had ever graced the english baror else the prisoner now on her trial must have been guilty of the crime of perjury now imputed to her  of all those in court now attending to the proceedings none listened with greater care to the statement made by sir richard than joseph mason lady mason herself and felix graham to joseph mason it appeared that his counsel was betraying him sir richard and round were in a boat together and were determined to throw him over yet once again had it been possible he would have stopped the proceedings and in this spirit he spoke to dockwrath to joseph mason it would have seemed right that sir richard should begin by holding up lady mason to the scorn and indignation of the twelve honest jurymen before him mr dockwrath whose intelligence was keener in such matters endeavoured to make his patron understand that he was wrong but in this he did not succeed if he lets her escape me said mason i think it will be the death of me  to lady mason it appeared as though the man who was now showing to all the crowd there assembled the chief scenes of her past life had been present and seen everything that she had ever done he told the jury of all who had been present in the room when that true deed had been signed he described how old usbech had sat there incapable of action how that affair of the partnership had been brought to a close how those two witnesses had thereupon appended their name to a deed how those witnesses had been deceived or partially deceived as to their own signatures when called upon to give their testimony at a former trial and he told them also that a comparison of the signatures on the codicil with those signatures which were undoubtedly true would lead an expert and professional judge of writing to tell them that the one set of signatures or the other must be forgeries then he went on to describe how the pretended codicil must in truth have been executedspeaking of the solitary room in which the bad work had been done of the midnight care and terrible solicitude for secrecy and then with apparent mercy he attempted to mitigate the iniquity of the deed by telling the jury that it had not been done by that lady with any view to selfaggrandisement but had been brought about by a lamentable infatuated mad idea that she might in this way do that justice to her child which that childs father had refused to do at her instance he also when he told of this spoke of rebekah and her son and mrs orme when she heard him did not dare to raise her eyes from the table lucius mason when he had listened to this lifted his clenched hand on high and brought it down with loud violence on the raised desk in front of him i know the merits of that young man said sir richard looking at him i am told that he is a gentleman good industrious and high spirited i wish he were not here i wish with all my heart he were not here and then a tear an absolute and true drop of briny moisture stood in the eye of that old experienced lawyer lucius when he heard this for a moment covered his face it was but for a moment and then he looked up again turning his eyes slowly round the entire court and as he did so grasping his mother by the arm hell look in a different sort of fashion by tomorrow evening i guess said dockwrath into his neighbours ear during all this time no change came over lady masons face when she felt her sons hand upon her arm her muscles had moved involuntarily but she recovered herself at the moment and then went on enduring it all with absolute composure nevertheless it seemed to her as though that man who stood before her telling his tale so calmly had read the secrets of her very soul what chance could there be for her when everything was thus known  to every word that was spoken felix graham gave all his mind while mr chaffanbrass sat fidgeting or reading or dreaming caring nothing for all that his learned brother might say graham listened to every fact that was stated and to every surmise that was propounded to him the absolute truth in this affair was matter of great moment but yet he felt that he dreaded to know the truth would it not be better for him that he should not know it but yet he listened and his active mind intent on the various points as they were evolved would not restrain itself from forming opinions with all his ears he listened and as he did so mr chaffanbrass amidst his dreaming reading and fidgeting kept an attentive eye upon him to him it was a matter of course that lady mason should be guilty had she not been guilty he mr chaffanbrass would not have been required mr chaffanbrass well understood that the defence of injured innocence was no part of his mission  then at last sir richard leatherham brought to a close his long tale and the examination of the witnesses was commenced by this time it was past two oclock and the judge went out of court for a few minutes to refresh himself with a glass of wine and a sandwich and now young peregrine orme in spite of all obstacles made his way up to his mother and led her also out of court he took his mothers arm and lady mason followed with her son and so they made their way into the small outer room which they had first entered not a word was said between them on the subject which was filling the minds of all of them lucius stood silent and absorbed while peregrine offered refreshment to both the ladies lady mason doing as she was bid essayed to eat and to drink what was it to her whether she ate and drank or was ahungered to maintain by her demeanour the idea in mens minds that she might still possibly be innocentthat was her work and therefore in order that those two young men might still think so she ate and drank as she was bidden  on their return to court mr steelyard got up to examine dockwrath who was put into the box as the first witness the attorney produced certain documents supposed to be of relevancy which he had found among his fatherinlaws papers and then described how he had found that special document which gave him to understand that bolster and kenneby had been used as witnesses to a certain signature on that 14th of july he had known all the circumstances of the old trial and hence his suspicions had been aroused acting upon this he had gone immediately down to mr mason in yorkshire and the present trial was the result of his care and intelligence this was in effect the purport of his direct evidence and then he was handed over to the tender mercies of the other side  on the other side mr chaffanbrass rose to begin the battle mr furnival had already been engaged in sundry of those preliminary skirmishes which had been found necessary before the fight had been commenced in earnest and therefore the turn had now come for mr chaffanbrass all this however had been arranged beforehand and it had been agreed that if possible dockwrath should be made to fall into the clutches of the old bailey barrister it was pretty to see the meek way in which mr chaffanbrass rose to his work how gently he smiled how he fidgeted about a few of the papers as though he were not at first quite master of his situation and how he arranged his old wig in a modest becoming manner bringing it well forward over his forehead his voice also was low and softso low that it was hardly heard through the whole court and persons who had come far to listen to him began to feel themselves disappointed and it was pretty also to see how dockwrath armed himself for the encounterhow he sharpened his teeth as it were and felt the points of his own claws the little devices of mr chaffanbrass did not deceive him he knew what he had to expect but his pluck was good as is the pluck of a terrier when a mastiff prepares to attack him let mr chaffanbrass do his worst that would all be over in an hour or so but when mr chaffanbrass had done his worst orley farm would still remain  i believe you were a tenant of lady masons at one time mr dockwrath asked the barrister  i was and she turned me out if you will allow me i will tell you how all that happened and how i was angered by the usage i received mr dockwrath was determined to make a clean breast of it and rather go before his tormentor in telling all that there was to be told than lag behind as an unwilling witness  do said mr chaffanbrass that will be very kind of you when i have learned all that and one other little circumstance of the same nature i do not think i shall want to trouble you any more and then mr dockwrath did tell it allhow he had lost the two fields how he had thus become very angry how this anger had induced him at once to do that which he had long thought of doingsearch namely among the papers of old mr usbech with the view of ascertaining what might be the real truth as regarded that doubtful codicil  and you found what you searched for mr dockwrath  i did said dockwrath  without very much delay apparently  i was two or three days over the work  but you found exactly what you wanted  i found what i expected to find  and that although all those papers had been subjected to the scrutiny of messrs round and crook at the time of that other trial twenty years ago  i was sharper than them mr chaffanbrassa deal sharper  so i perceive said chaffanbrass and now he had pushed back his wig a little and his eyes had begun to glare with an ugly red light yes he said it will be long i think before my old friends round and crook are as sharp as you are mr dockwrath  upon my word i agree with you mr chaffanbrass  yes round and crook are babies to you mr dockwrath and now mr chaffanbrass began to pick at his chin with his finger as he was accustomed to do when he warmed to his subject babies to you you have had a good deal to do with them i should say in getting up this case  i have had something to do with them  and very much they must have enjoyed your society mr dockwrath and what wrinkles they must have learned from you what a pleasant oasis it must have been in the generally somewhat dull course of their monotonous though profitable business i quite envy round and crook having you alongside of them in their inner councilchamber  i know nothing about that sir  no i dare say you dontbut theyll remember it well when youd turned over your fatherinlaws papers for three days you found what you looked for  yes i did  you had been tolerably sure that you would find it before you began eh  well i had expected that something would turn up  i have no doubt you didand something has turned up that gentleman sitting next to you therewho is he  joseph mason esquire of groby park said dockwrath  so i thought it is he that is to have orley farm if lady mason and her son should lose it  in that case he would be the heir  exactly he would be the heir how pleasant it must be to you to find yourself on such affectionate terms withthe heir and when he comes into his inheritance who is to be tenant can you tell us that  dockwrath here paused for a moment not that he hesitated as to telling the whole truth he had fully made up his mind to do so and to brazen the matter out declaring that of course he was to be considered worthy of his reward but there was that in the manner and eye of chaffanbrass which stopped him for a moment and his enemy immediately took advantage of this hesitation come sir said he out with it if i dont get it from you i shall from somebody else youve been very plainspoken hitherto dont let the jury think that your heart is failing you at last  there is no reason why my heart should fail me said dockwrath in an angry tone  is there not i must differ from you there mr dockwrath the heart of any man placed in such a position as that you now hold must i think fail him but never mind that who is to be the tenant of orley farm when my client has been deprived of it  i am  just so you were turned out from those two fields when young mason came home from germany  i was  you immediately went to work and discovered this document  i did  you put up joseph mason to this trial  i told him my opinion  exactly and if the result be successful you are to be put in possession of the land  i shall become mr masons tenant at orley farm  yes you will become mr masons tenant at orley farm upon my word mr dockwrath you have made my work today uncommonly easy for meuncommonly easy i dont know that i have anything else to ask you and then mr chaffanbrass as he sat down looked up to the jury with an expression of countenance which was in itself worth any fee that could be paid to him for that days work his face spoke as plain as a face could speak and what his face said was this after that gentlemen of the jury very little more can be necessary you now see the motives of our opponents and the way in which those motives have been allowed to act we who are altogether upon the square in what we are doing desire nothing more than that all which mr chaffanbrass said by his look his shrug and his gesture much more eloquently than he could have done by the use of any words  mr dockwrath as he left the box and went back to his seatin doing which he had to cross the table in the middle of the courtendeavoured to look and move as though all were right with him he knew that the eyes of the court were on him and especially the eyes of the judge and jury he knew also how mens minds are unconsciously swayed by small appearances he endeavoured therefore to seem indifferent but in doing so he swaggered and was conscious that he swaggered and he felt as he gained his seat that mr chaffanbrass had been too much for him  then one mr torrington from london was examined by sir richard leatherham and he proved apparently beyond all doubt that a certain deed which he produced was genuine that deed bore the same date as the codicil which was now questioned had been executed at orley farm by old sir joseph and bore the signatures of john kenneby and bridget bolster as witnesses sir richard holding the deeds in his hands explained to the jury that he did not at the present stage of the proceedings ask them to take it as proved that those names were the true signatures of the two persons indicated i should think not said mr furnival in a loud voice but he asked them to satisfy themselves that the document as now existing purported to bear those two signatures it would be for them to judge when the evidence brought before them should be complete whether or no that deed were a true document and then the deed was handed up into the jurybox and the twelve jurymen all examined it the statement made by this mr torrington was very simple it had become his business to know the circumstances of the late partnership between mason and martock and these circumstances he explained then sir richard handed him over to be crossexamined  it was now grahams turn to begin his work but as he rose to do so his mind misgave him not a syllable that this torrington had said appeared to him to be unworthy of belief the man had not uttered a word of the truth of which graham did not feel himself positively assured and more than thatthe man had clearly told all that was within him to tell all that it was well that the jury should hear in order that they might thereby be assisted in coming to a true decision it had been hinted in his hearing both by chaffanbrass and aram that this man was probably in league with dockwrath and aram had declared with a sneer that he was a puzzlepated old fellow he might be puzzlepated and had already shown that he was bashful and unhappy in his present position but he had shown also as graham thought that he was anxious to tell the truth  and moreover graham had listened with all his mind to the crossexamination of dockwrath and he was filled with disgustwith disgust not so much at the part played by the attorney as at that played by the barrister as graham regarded the matter what had the iniquities and greed of dockwrath to do with it had reason been shown why the statement made by dockwrath was in itself unworthy of beliefthat that statement was in its own essence weakthen the character of the man making it might fairly affect its credibility but presuming that statement to be wrongpresuming that it was corroborated by other evidence how could it be affected by any amount of villainy on the part of dockwrath all that chaffanbrass had done or attempted was to prove that dockwrath had had his own end to serve who had ever doubted it but not a word had been said not a spark of evidence elicited to show that the man had used a falsehood to further those views of his of all this the mind of felix graham had been full and now as he rose to take his own share of the work his wit was at work rather in opposition to lady mason than on her behalf  this torrington was a little old man and graham had watched how his hands had trembled when sir richard first addressed him but sir richard had been very kindas was natural to his own witness and the old man had gradually regained his courage but now as he turned his face round to the side where he knew that he might expect to find an enemy that tremor again came upon him and the stick which he held in his hand was heard as it tapped gently against the side of the witnessbox graham as he rose to his work saw that mr chaffanbrass had fixed his eye upon him and his courage rose the higher within him as he felt the gaze of the man whom he so much disliked was it within the compass of his heart to bully an old man because such a one as chaffanbrass desired it of him by heaven no  he first asked mr torrington his age and having been told that he was over seventy graham went on to assure him that nothing which could be avoided should be said to disturb his comfort and now mr torrington he asked will you tell me whether you are a friend of mr dockwraths or have had any acquaintance with him previous to the affairs of this trial this question he repeated in various forms but always in a mild voice and without the appearance of any disbelief in the answers which were given to him all these questions torrington answered by a plain negative he had never seen dockwrath till the attorney had come to him on the matter of that partnership deed he had never eaten or drunk with him nor had there ever been between them any conversation of a confidential nature that will do mr torrington said graham and as he sat down he again turned round and looked mr chaffanbrass full in the face  after that nothing further of interest was done that day a few unimportant witnesses were examined on legal points and then the court was adjourned     chapter lxix  the two judges   felix graham as he left the alston courthouse on the close of the first day of the trial was not in a happy state of mind he did not actually accuse himself of having omitted any duty which he owed to his client but he did accuse himself of having undertaken a duty for which he felt himself to be manifestly unfit would it not have been better as he said to himself for that poor lady to have had any other possible advocate than himself then as he passed out in the company of mr furnival and mr chaffanbrass the latter looked at him with a scorn which he did not know how to return in his heart he could do so and should words be spoken between them on the subject he would be well able and willing enough to defend himself but had he attempted to bandy looks with mr chaffanbrass it would have seemed even to himself that he was proclaiming his resolution to put himself in opposition to his colleagues  he felt as though he were engaged to fight a battle in which truth and justice nay heaven itself must be against him how can a man put his heart to the proof of an assertion in the truth of which he himself has no belief that though guilty this lady should be treated with the utmost mercy compatible with the lawfor so much had her guilt stood forward as acknowledged he could have pleaded with all the eloquence that was in him he could still pity her sympathise with her fight for her on such ground as that but was it possible that he believing her to be false should stand up before the crowd assembled in that court and use such intellect as god had given him in making others think that the false and the guilty one was true and innocent and that those accusers were false and guilty whom he knew to be true and innocent  it had been arranged that baron maltby should stay that night at noningsby the brotherjudges therefore occupied the noningsby carriage together and graham was driven back in a dogcart by augustus staveley  well old boy said augustus you did not soil your conscience much by bullying that fellow  no i did not said graham and then he was silent  chaffanbrass made an uncommonly ugly show of the hamworth attorney said augustus after a pause but to this graham at first made no answer  if i were on the jury continued the other i would not believe a single word that came from that fellows mouth unless it were fully supported by other testimony nor will the jury believe him  i tell you what staveley said graham you will oblige me greatly in this matter if you will not speak to me of the trial till it is over  i beg your pardon  no dont do that nothing can be more natural than that you and i should discuss it together in all its bearings but there are reasons which i will explain to you afterwards why i would rather not do so  all right said augustus ill not say another word  and for my part i will get through the work as well as i may and then they both sat silent in the gig till they came to the corner of noningsby wall  and is that other subject tabooed also said augustus  what other subject  that as to which we said something when you were last heretouching my sister madeline  graham felt that his face was on fire but he did not know how to answer in that it is for you to decide whether or no there should be silence between us he said at last  i certainly do not wish that there should be any secret between us said augustus  then there shall be none it is my intention to make an offer to her before i leave noningsby i can assure you for your satisfaction that my hopes do not run very high  for my satisfaction felix i dont know why you should suppose me to be anxious that you should fail and as he so spoke he stopped his horse at the halldoor and there was no time for further speech  papa has been home a quarter of an hour said madeline meeting them in the hall  yes he had the pull of us by having his carriage ready said her brother we had to wait for the ostler  he says that if you are not ready in ten minutes he will go to dinner without you mamma and i are dressed and as she spoke she turned round with a smile to felix making him feel that both she and her father were treating him as though he were one of the family  ten minutes will be quite enough for me said he  if the governor only would sit down said augustus it would be all right but thats just what he wont do mad do send somebody to help me to unpack and then they all bustled away so that the pair of judges might not be kept waiting for their food  felix graham hurried up stairs three steps at a time as though all his future success at noningsby depended on his being down in the drawingroom within the period of minutes stipulated by the judge as he dressed himself with the utmost rapidity thinking perhaps not so much as he should have done of his appearance in the eyes of his ladylove he endeavoured to come to some resolve as to the task which was before him how was he to find an opportunity of speaking his mind to madeline if during the short period of his sojourn at noningsby he left the house every morning directly after breakfast and returned to it in the evening only just in time for dinner  when he entered the drawingroom both the judges were there as was also lady staveley and madeline augustus alone was wanting ring the bell graham the judge said as felix took his place on the corner of the rug augustus will be down about suppertime and then the bell was rung and the dinner ordered  papa ought to remember said madeline that he got his carriage first at alston  i heard the wheels of the gig said the judge they were just two minutes after us  i dont think augustus takes longer than other young men said lady staveley  look at graham there he cant be supposed to have the use of all his limbs for he broke half a dozen of them a month ago and yet hes ready brother maltby give your arm to lady staveley graham if youll take madeline ill follow alone he did not call her miss staveley as felix specially remarked and so remarking pressed the little hand somewhat closer to his side it was the first sign of love he had ever given her and he feared that some mark of anger might follow it there was no return to his pressurenot the slightest answer was made with those sweet finger points but there was no anger is your arm quite strong again she asked him as they sat down as soon as the judges short grace had been uttered  fifteen minutes to the second said augustus bustling into the room and i think that an unfair advantage has been taken of me but what can a juvenile barrister expect in the presence of two judges and then the dinner went on and a very pleasant little dinnerparty it was  not a word was said either then or during the evening or on the following morning on that subject which was engrossing so much of the mind of all of them not a word was spoken as to that trial which was now pending nor was the name of lady mason mentioned it was understood even by madeline that no allusion could with propriety be made to it in the presence of the judge before whom the cause was now pending and the ground was considered too sacred for feet to tread upon it were it not that this feeling is so general an english judge and english counsellors would almost be forced to subject themselves in such cases to the close custody which jurymen are called upon to endure but as a rule good taste and good feeling are as potent as locks and walls  do you know mr graham said madeline in that sort of whisper which a dinnertable allows that mrs baker says you have cut her since you got well  i i cut one of my very best friends how can she say anything so untrue if i knew where she lived id go and pay her a visit after dinner  i dont think you need do thatthough she has a very snug little room of her own you were in it on christmasday when we had the snapdragonwhen you and marion carried away the dishes  i remember and she is base enough to say that i have cut her i did see her for a moment yesterday and then i spoke to her  ah but you should have had a long chat with her she expects you to go back over all the old ground how you were brought in helpless how the doctor came to you and how you took all the messes she prepared for you like a good boy im afraid mr graham you dont understand old women  nor young ones either it was on his tongue to say but he did not say it  when i was a young man said the baron carrying on some conversation which had been general at the table i never had an opportunity of breaking my ribs out hunting  perhaps if you had said augustus you might have used it with more effect than my friend here and have deprived the age of one of its brightest lights and the bench of one of its most splendid ornaments  hear hear hear said his father  augustus is coming out in a new character said his mother  i am heartily obliged to him said the baron but as i was saying before these sort of things never came in my way if i remember right my father would have thought i was mad had i talked of going out hunting did you hunt staveley  when the ladies were gone the four lawyers talked about law though they kept quite clear of that special trial which was going on at alston judge staveley as we know had been at the birmingham congress but not so his brother the baron baron maltby indeed thought but little of the birmingham doings and was inclined to be a little hard upon his brother in that he had taken a part in it  i think that the matter is one open to discussion said the host  well i hope so said graham at any rate i have heard no arguments which ought to make us feel that our mouths are closed  arguments on such a matter are worth nothing at all said the baron a man with what is called a logical turn of mind may prove anything or disprove anything but he never convinces anybody on any matter that is near to a mans heart he is convinced by the tenour of his own thoughts as he goes on living not by the arguments of a logician or even by the eloquence of an orator talkers are apt to think that if their listener cannot answer them they are bound to give way but nontalkers generally take a very different view of the subject  but does that go to show that a question should not be ventilated asked felix  i dont mean to be uncivil said the baron but of all words in the language there is none which i dislike so much as that word ventilation a man given to ventilating subjects is worse than a man who has a mission  bores of that sort however said graham will show themselves from time to time and are not easily put down some one will have a mission to reform our courts of law and will do it too  i only hope it may not be in my time said the baron  i cant go quite so far as that said the other judge but no doubt we all have the same feeling more or less i know pretty well what my friend graham is driving at  and in your heart you agree with me said graham  if you would carry mens heads with you they would do you more good than their hearts said the judge and then as the wine bottles were stationary the subject was cut short and they went into the drawingroom  graham had no opportunity that evening of telling his tale to madeline staveley the party was too large for such taletelling or else not large enough and then the evening in the drawingroom was over before it had seemed to begin and while he was yet hoping that there might be some turn in his favour lady staveley wished him goodnight and madeline of course did the same as he again pressed her hand he could not but think how little he had said to her since he had been in the house and yet it seemed to him as though that little had made him more intimate with her than he had ever found himself before he had made an attempt to separate himself from the company by proposing to go and call on mrs baker in her own quarters but madeline had declared it to be too late for such an expedition explaining that when mrs baker had no patient on hand she was accustomed to go early to her bed in the present instance however she had been wrong for when felix reached the door of his own room mrs baker was coming out of it  i was just looking if everything was right said she it seems natural to me to come and look after you you know  and it is quite as natural to me to be looked after  is it though but the worst of you gentlemen when you get well is that one has done with you you go away and then theres no more about it i always begrudge to see you get well for that reason  when you have a man in your power you like to keep him there  thats always the way with the women you know i hope we shall see one of them tying you by the leg altogether before long  i dont know anything about that said felix sheepishly  dont you well if you dont i suppose nobody dont but nevertheless i did hear a little bird sayeh mr graham  those little birds are the biggest liars in the world  are they now well perhaps they are and how do you think our miss madeline is looking she wasnt just well for one short time after you went away  has she been ill  well not ill not so that she came into my hands shes looking herself again now isnt she  she is looking as she always does uncommonly well  do you remember how she used to come and say a word to you standing at the door dear heart ill be bound now i care more for her than you do  do you said graham  of course i do and then how angry her ladyship was with meas though it were my fault i didnt do it did i mr graham but lord love you whats the use of being angry my lady ought to have remembered her own young days for it was just the same thing with her she had her own way and so will miss madeline and then with some further inquiries as to his fire his towels and his sheets mrs baker took herself off  felix graham had felt a repugnance to taking the gossiping old woman openly into his confidence and yet he had almost asked her whether he might in truth count upon madelines love such at any rate had been the tenour of his gossiping but nevertheless he was by no means certified he had the judges assurance in allowing him to be there he had the assurance given to him by augustus in the few words spoken to him at the door that evening and he ought to have known that he had received sufficient assurance from madeline herself but in truth he knew nothing of the kind there are men who are much too forward in believing that they are regarded with favour but there are others of whom it may be said that they are as much too backward the world hears most of the former and talks of them the most but i doubt whether the latter are not the more numerous  the next morning of course there was a hurry and fuss at breakfast in order that they might get off in time for the courts the judges were to take their seats at ten and therefore it was necessary that they should sit down to breakfast some time before nine the achievement does not seem to be one of great difficulty but nevertheless it left no time for lovemaking  but for one instant felix was able to catch madeline alone in the breakfastparlour miss staveley said he will it be possible that i should speak to you alone this eveningfor five minutes  speak to me alone she said repeating his words and as she did so she was conscious that her whole face had become suffused with colour  is it too much to ask  oh no  then if i leave the diningroom soon after you have done so  mamma will be there you know she said then others came into the room and he was able to make no further stipulation for the evening  madeline when she was left alone that morning was by no means satisfied with her own behaviour and accused herself of having been unnecessarily cold to him she knew the permission which had been accorded to him and she knew alsoknew wellwhat answer would be given to his request in her mind the matter was now fixed she had confessed to herself that she loved him and she could not now doubt of his love to her why then should she have answered him with coldness and doubt she hated the missishness of young ladies and had resolved that when he asked her a plain question she would give him a plain answer it was true that the question had not been asked as yet but why should she have left him in doubt as to her kindly feeling  it shall be but for this one day she said to herself as she sat alone in her room     chapter lxx  how am i to bear it   when the first days work was over in the court lady mason and mrs orme kept their seats till the greater part of the crowd had dispersed and the two young men lucius mason and peregrine remained with them mr aram also remained giving them sundry little instructions in a low voice as to the manner in which they should go home and return the next morningtelling them the hour at which they must start and promising that he would meet them at the door of the court to all this mrs orme endeavoured to give her best attention as though it were of the last importance but lady mason was apparently much the more collected of the two and seemed to take all mr arams courtesies as though they were a matter of course there she sat still with her veil up and though all those who had been assembled there during the day turned their eyes upon her as they passed out she bore it all without quailing it was not that she returned their gaze or affected an effrontery in her conduct but she was able to endure it without showing that she suffered as she did so  the carriage is there now said mr aram who had left the court for a minute and i think you may get into it quietly this accordingly they did making their way through an avenue of idlers who still remained that they might look upon the lady who was accused of having forged her husbands will  illustration lady mason leaving the court  i will stay with her tonight whispered mrs orme to her son as they passed through the court  do you mean that you will not come to the cleeve at all  not tonight not till the trial be over do you remain with your grandfather  i shall be here tomorrow of course to see how you go on  but do not leave your grandfather this evening give him my love and say that i think it best that i should remain at orley farm till the trial be over and peregrine if i were you i would not talk to him much about the trial  but why not  i will tell you when it is over but it would only harass him at the present moment and then peregrine handed his mother into the carriage and took his own way back to the cleeve  as he returned he was bewildered in his mind by what he had heard and he also began to feel something like a doubt as to lady masons innocence hitherto his belief in it had been as fixed and assured as that of her own son indeed it had never occurred to him as possible that she could have done the thing with which she was charged he had hated joseph mason for suspecting her and had hated dockwrath for his presumed falsehood in pretending to suspect her but what was he to think of this question now after hearing the clear and dispassionate statement of all the circumstances by the solicitorgeneral hitherto he had understood none of the particulars of the case but now the nature of the accusation had been made plain and it was evident to him that at any rate that farsighted lawyer believed in the truth of his own statement could it be possible that lady mason had forged the willthat this deed had been done by his mothers friend by the woman who had so nearly become lady orme of the cleeve the idea was terrible to him as he rode home but yet he could not rid himself of it and if this were so was it also possible that his grandfather suspected it had that marriage been stopped by any such suspicion as this was it this that had broken the old man down and robbed him of all his spirit that his mother could not have any such suspicion seemed to him to be made clear by the fact that she still treated lady mason as her friend and then why had he been specially enjoined not to speak to his grandfather as to the details of the trial  but it was impossible for him to meet sir peregrine without speaking of the trial when he entered the house which he did by some back entrance from the stables he found his grandfather standing at his own room door he had heard the sounds of the horse and was unable to restrain his anxiety to learn  well said sir peregrine what has happened  it is not over as yet it will last they say for three days  but come in peregrine and he shut the door anxious rather that the servants should not witness his own anxiety than that they should not hear tidings which must now be common to all the world they have begun it  oh yes they have begun it  well how far has it gone  sir richard leatherham told us the accusation they make against her and then they examined dockwrath and one or two others they have not got further than that  and thelady masonhow does she bear it  very well i should say she does not seem to be nearly as nervous now as she was while staying with us  ah indeed she is a wonderful womana very wonderful woman so she bears up and your mother peregrine  i dont think she likes it  likes it who could like such a task as that  but she will go through with it  i am sure she will she will go through with anything that she undertakes andandthe judge said nothingi suppose  very little sir  and sir peregrine again sat down in his armchair as though the work of conversation were too much for him but neither did he dare to speak openly on the subject and yet there was so much that he was anxious to know do you think she will escape that was the question which he longed to ask but did not dare to utter  and then after a while they dined together and peregrine determined to talk of other things but it was in vain while the servants were in the room nothing was said the meat was carved and the plates were handed round and young orme ate his dinner but there was a constraint upon them both which they were quite unable to dispel and at last they gave it up and sat in silence till they were alone  when the door was closed and they were opposite to each other over the fire in the way which was their custom when they two only were there sir peregrine could restrain his desire no longer it must be that his grandson who had heard all that had passed in court that day should have formed some opinion of what was going onshould have some idea as to the chance of that battle which was being fought he sir peregrine could not have gone into the court himself it would have been impossible for him to show himself there but there had been his heart all the day how had it gone with that woman whom a few weeks ago he had loved so well that he had regarded her as his wife  was your mother very tired he said again endeavouring to draw near the subject  she did looked fagged while sitting in court  it was a dreadful task for hervery dreadful  nothing could have turned her from it said peregrine  noyou are right there nothing would have turned her from it she thought it to be her duty to that poor lady but shelady masonshe bore it better you say  i think she bears it very wellconsidering what her position is  yes yes it is very dreadful the solicitorgeneral when he openedwas he very severe upon her  i do not think he wished to be severe  but he made it very strong against her  the story as he told it was very strong against herthat is you know it would be if we were to believe all that he stated  yes yes of course he only stated what he has been told by others you could not see how the jury took it  i did not look at them i was thinking more of her and of lucius  lucius was there  yes he sat next to her and sir richard said while he was telling the story that he wished her son were not there to hear it upon my word sir i almost wished so too  poor fellowpoor fellow it would have been better for him to stay away  and yet had it been my mother  your mother perry it could not have been your mother she could not have been so placed  if it be lady masons misfortune and not her fault  ah well we will not talk about that and there will be two days more you say  so said aram the attorney  god help hermay god help her it would be very dreadful for a man but for a woman the burden is insupportable  then they both sat silent for a while during which peregrine was engrossed in thinking how he could turn his grandfather from the conversation  and you heard no one express any opinion asked sir peregrine after a pause  you mean about lady mason and peregrine began to perceive that his mother was right and that it would have been well if possible to avoid any words about the trial  do they think that she willwill be acquitted of course the people there were talking about it  yes sir they were talking about it but i really dont know as to any opinion you see the chief witnesses have not been examined  and you perry what do you think  i sir well i was altogether on her side till i heard sir richard leatherham  and then  then i did not know what to think i suppose its all right but one never can understand what those lawyers are at when mr chaffanbrass got up to examine dockwrath he seemed to be just as confident on his side as the other fellow had been on the other side i dont think ill have any more wine sir thank you  but sir peregrine did not move he sat in his old accustomed way nursing one leg over the knee of the other and thinking of the manner in which she had fallen at his feet and confessed it all had he married her and gone with her proudly into the courtas he would have doneand had he then heard a verdict of guilty given by the jurynay had he heard such proof of her guilt as would have convinced himself it would have killed him he felt as he sat there safe over his own fireside that his safety was due to her generosity had that other calamity fallen upon him he could not have survived it his head would have fallen low before the eyes of those who had known him since they had known anything and would never have been raised again in his own spirit in his inner life the blow had come to him but it was due to her effort on his behalf that he had not been stricken in public when he had discussed the matter with mrs orme he had seemed in a measure to forget this it had not at any rate been the thought which rested with the greatest weight upon his mind then he had considered how she whose life had been stainless as driven snow should bear herself in the presence of such deep guilt but nownow as he sat alone he thought only of lady mason let her be ever so guiltyand her guilt had been very terribleshe had behaved very nobly to him from him at least she had a right to sympathy  and what chance was there that she should escape of absolute escape there was no chance whatever even should the jury acquit her she must declare her guilt to the worldmust declare it to her son by taking steps for the restoration of the property as to that sir peregrine felt no doubt whatever that joseph mason of groby would recover his right to orley farm was to him a certainty but how terrible would be the path over which she must walk before this deed of retribution could be done ah me ah me he said as he thought of all thisspeaking to himself as though he were unconscious of his grandsons presence poor woman poor woman then peregrine felt sure that she had been guilty and was sure also that his grandfather was aware of it  will you come into the other room sir he said  yes yes if you like it and then the one leg fell from the other and he rose to do his grandsons bidding to him now and henceforward one room was much the same as another  in the mean time the party bound for orley farm had reached that place and to them also came the necessity of wearing through that tedious evening on the mind of lucius mason not even yet had a shadow of suspicion fallen to him in spite of it all his mother was still pure but yet he was stern to her and his manner was very harsh it may be that had such suspicion crossed his mind he would have been less stern and his manner more tender as it was he could understand nothing that was going on and almost felt that he was kept in the dark at his mothers instance why was it that a man respected by all the world such as sir richard leatherham should rise in court and tell such a tale as that against his mother and that the power of answering that tale on his mothers behalf should be left to such another man as mr chaffanbrass sir richard had told his story plainly but with terrible force whereas chaffanbrass had contented himself with browbeating another lawyer with the lowest quirks of his cunning why had not some one been in court able to use the language of passionate truth and ready to thrust the lie down the throats of those who told it  tea and supper had been prepared for them and they sat down together but the nature of the meal may be imagined lady mason had striven with terrible effort to support herself during the day and even yet she did not give way it was quite as necessary that she should restrain herself before her son as before all those others who had gazed at her in court and she did sustain herself she took a knife and fork in her hand and ate a few morsels she drank her cup of tea and remembering that there in that house she was still hostess she made some slight effort to welcome her guest surely after such a day of trouble you will eat something she said to her friend to mrs orme it was marvellous that the woman should even be alivelet alone that she should speak and perform the ordinary functions of her daily life and now she saidlady mason saidas soon as that ceremony was over now as we are so tired i think we will go up stairs will you light our candles for us lucius and so the candles were lit and the two ladies went up stairs  a second bed had been prepared in lady masons room and into this chamber they both went at once mrs orme as soon as she had entered turned round and held out both her hands in order that she might comfort lady mason by taking hers but lady mason when she had closed the door stood for a moment with her face towards the wall not knowing how to bear herself it was but for a moment and then slowly moving round with her two hands clasped together she sank on her knees at mrs ormes feet and hid her face in the skirt of mrs ormes dress  my friendmy friend said lady mason  yes i am your friendindeed i am but dear lady mason and she endeavoured to think of words by which she might implore her to rise and compose herself  how is it you can bear with such a one as i am how is it that you do not hate me for my guilt  he does not hate us when we are guilty  i do not know sometimes i think that all will hate mehere and hereafterexcept you lucius will hate me and how shall i bear that oh mrs orme i wish he knew it  i wish he did he shall know it nowtonight if you will allow me to tell him  no it would kill me to bear his looks i wish he knew it and was away so that he might never look at me again  he too would forgive you if he knew it all  forgive how can he forgive and as she spoke she rose again to her feet and her old manner came upon her do you think what it is that i have done for him ihis motherfor my only child and after that is it possible that he should forgive me  you meant him no harm  but i have ruined him before all the world he is as proud as your boy and could he bear to think that his whole life would be disgraced by his mothers crime  had i been so unfortunate he would have forgiven me  we are speaking of what is impossible it could not have been so your youth was different from mine  god has been very good to me and not placed temptation in my waytemptation i mean to great faults but little faults require repentance as much as great ones  but then repentance is easy at any rate it is possible  oh lady mason is it not possible for you  but i will not talk of that now i will not hear you compare yourself with such a one as i am do you know i was thinking today that my mind would fail me and that i should be mad before this is over how can i bear it how can i bear it and rising from her seat she walked rapidly through the room holding back her hair from her brows with both her hands  illustration how can i bear it  and how was she to bear it the load on her back was too much for her shoulders the burden with which she had laden herself was too heavy to be borne her power of endurance was very great her strength in supporting the extreme bitterness of intense sorrow was wonderful but now she was taxed beyond her power how am i to bear it she said again as still holding her hair between her fingers she drew her hands back over her head  you do not know you have not tried it it is impossible she said in her wildness as mrs orme endeavoured to teach her the only source from whence consolation might be had i do not believe in the thief on the cross unless it was that he had prepared himself for that day by years of contrition i know i shock you she added after a while i know that what i say will be dreadful to you but innocence will always be shocked by guilt go go and leave me it has gone so far now that all is of no use then she threw herself on the bed and burst into a convulsive passion of tears  once again mrs orme endeavoured to obtain permission from her to undertake that embassy to her son had lady mason acceded or been near acceding mrs ormes courage would probably have been greatly checked as it was she pressed it as though the task were one to be performed without difficulty mrs orme was very anxious that lucius should not sit in the court throughout the trial she felt that if he did so the shockthe shock which was inevitablemust fall upon him there and than that she could conceive nothing more terrible and then also she believed that if the secret were once made known to lucius and if he were for a time removed from his mothers side the poor woman might be brought to a calmer perception of her true position the strain would be lessened and she would no longer feel the necessity of exerting so terrible a control over her feelings  you have acknowledged that he must know it sooner or later pleaded mrs orme  but this is not the timenot now during the trial had he known it before  it would keep him away from the court  yes and i should never see him again what will he do when he hears it perhaps it would be better that he should go without seeing me  he would not do that  it would be better if they take me to the prison i will never see him again his eyes would kill me do you ever watch him and see the pride that there is in his eye he has never yet known what disgrace means and now i his mother have brought him to this  it was all in vain as far as that night was concerned lady mason would give no such permission but mrs orme did exact from her a kind of promise that lucius should be told on the next evening if it then appeared from what mr aram should say that the result of the trial was likely to be against them  lucius mason spent his evening alone and though he had as yet heard none of the truth his mind was not at ease nor was he happy at heart though he had no idea of his mothers guilt he did conceive that after this trial it would be impossible that they should remain at orley farm his mothers intended marriage with sir peregrine and then the manner in which that engagement had been broken off the course of the trial and its celebrity the enmity of dockwrath and lastly his own inability to place himself on terms of friendship with those people who were still his mothers nearest friends made him feel that in any event it would be well for them to change their residence what could life do for him there at orley farm after all that had passed he had gone to liverpool and bought guano and now the sacks were lying in his barn unopened he had begun to drain and the ugly unfinished lines of earth were lying across his fields he had no further interest in it and felt that he could no longer go to work on that ground as though he were in truth its master  but then as he thought of his future hopes his place of residence and coming life there was one other beyond himself and his mother to whom his mind reverted what would sophia wish that he should dohis own sophiashe who had promised him that her heart should be with his through all the troubles of this trial before he went to bed that night he wrote to sophia and told her what were his troubles and what his hopes this will be over in two days more he said and then i will come to you you will see me i trust the day after this letter reaches you but nevertheless i cannot debar myself from the satisfaction of writing i am not happy for i am dissatisfied with what they are doing for my mother and it is only when i think of you and the assurance of your love that i can feel anything like content it is not a pleasant thing to sit by and hear ones mother charged with the foulest frauds that practised villains can conceive yet i have had to bear it and have heard no denial of the charge in true honest language today when the solicitorgeneral was heaping falsehoods on her name i could hardly refrain myself from rushing at his throat let me have a line of comfort from you and then i will be with you on friday  that line of comfort never came nor did lucius on the friday make his intended visit miss furnival had determined some day or two before this that she would not write to lucius again till this trial was over and even then it might be a question whether a correspondence with the heir of noningsby would not be more to her taste     chapter lxxi  showing how john kenneby and bridget bolster bore themselves in court   on the next morning they were all in their places at ten oclock and the crowd had been gathered outside the doors of the court from a much earlier hour as the trial progressed the interest in it increased and as people began to believe that lady mason had in truth forged a will so did they the more regard her in the light of a heroine had she murdered her husband after forging his will men would have paid half a crown apiece to have touched her garments or a guinea for the privilege of shaking hands with her lady mason had again taken her seat with her veil raised with mrs orme on one side of her and her son on the other the counsel were again ranged on the seats behind mr furnival sitting the nearest to the judge and mr aram again occupied the intermediate bench so placing himself that he could communicate either with his client or with the barristers these were now their established places and great as was the crowd they found no difficulty in reaching them an easy way is always made for the chief performers in a play  this was to be the great day as regarded the evidence it is a case that depends altogether on evidence one young lawyer said to another if the counsel know how to handle the witnesses i should say she is safe the importance of this handling was felt by every one and therefore it was understood that the real game would be played out on this middle day it had been all very well for chaffanbrass to bully dockwrath and make the wretched attorney miserable for an hour or so but that would have but little bearing on the verdict there were two persons there who were prepared to swear that on a certain day they had only signed one deed so much the solicitorgeneral had told them and nobody doubted that it would be so the question now was this would mr furnival and mr chaffanbrass succeed in making them contradict themselves when they had so sworn could they be made to say that they had signed two deeds or that they might have done so  it was again the duty of mr furnival to come first upon the stagethat is to say he was to do so as soon as sir richard had performed his very secondrate part of eliciting the evidence in chief poor john kenneby was to be the first victim and he was placed in the box before them all very soon after the judge had taken his seat why had he not emigrated to australia and escaped all thisescaped all this and mrs smiley also that was john kennebys reflection as he slowly mounted the two steps up into the place of his torture near to the same spot and near also to dockwrath who had taken these two witnesses under his special charge sat bridget bolster she had made herself very comfortable that morning with buttered toast and sausages and when at dockwraths instance kenneby had submitted to a slight infusion of dutch couragea bottle of brandy would not have sufficed for the purposebridget also had not refused the generous glass not that i wants it said she meaning thereby to express an opinion that she could hold her own even against the great chaffanbrass without any such extraneous aid she now sat quite quiet with her hands crossed on her knees before her and her eyes immovably fixed on the table which stood in the centre of the court in that position she remained till her turn came and one may say that there was no need for fear on account of bridget bolster  and then sir richard began what would be the nature of kennebys direct evidence the reader pretty well knows sir richard took a long time in extracting it for he was aware that it would be necessary to give his witness some confidence before he came to his main questions even to do this was difficult for kenneby would speak in a voice so low that nobody could hear him and on the second occasion of the judge enjoining him to speak out he nearly fainted it is odd that it never occurs to judges that a witness who is naturally timid will be made more so by being scolded when i hear a judge thus use his authority i always wish that i had the power of forcing him to some very uncongenial employmentjumping in a sack let us say and then when he jumped poorly as he certainly would i would crack my whip and bid him go higher and higher the more i so bade him the more he would limp and the world looking on would pity him and execrate me it is much the same thing when a witness is sternly told to speak louder  but john kenneby at last told his plain story he remembered the day on which he had met old usbech and bridget bolster and lady mason in sir josephs chamber he had then witnessed a signature by sir joseph and had only witnessed one on that dayof that he was perfectly certain he did not think that old usbech had signed the deed in question but on that matter he declined to swear positively he remembered the former trial he had not then been able to swear positively whether usbech had or had not signed the deed as far as he could remember that was the point to which his crossexamination on that occasion had chiefly been directed so much john kenneby did at last say in language that was sufficiently plain  and then mr furnival arose the reader is acquainted with the state of his mind on the subject of this trial the enthusiasm on behalf of lady mason which had been aroused by his belief in her innocence by his old friendship by his ancient adherence to her cause and by his admiration for her beauty had now greatly faded it had faded much when he found himself obliged to call in such fellowlabourers as chaffanbrass and aram and had all but perished when he learned from contact with them to regard her guilt as certain but nevertheless now that he was there the old fire returned to him he had wished twenty times that he had been able to shake the matter from him and leave his old client in the hands of her new advisers it would be better for her he had said to himself but on this dayon these three daysseeing that he had not shaken the matter off he rose to his work as though he still loved her as though all his mind was still intent on preserving that illgotten inheritance for her son it may almost be doubted whether at moments during these three days he did not again persuade himself that she was an injured woman aram as may be remembered had felt misgivings as to mr furnivals powers for such crossexamination but chaffanbrass had never doubted it he knew that mr furnival could do as much as himself in that way the difference being thisthat mr furnival could do something else besides  and now mr kenneby ill ask you a few questions he said and kenneby turned round to him the barrister spoke in a mild low voice but his eye transfixed the poor fellow at once and though kenneby was told a dozen times to look at the jury and speak to the jury he never was able to take his gaze away from mr furnivals face  you remember the old trial he said and as he spoke he held in his hand what was known to be an account of that transaction then there arose a debate between him and sir richard in which chaffanbrass and graham and mr steelyard all took part as to whether kenneby might be examined as to his former examination and on this point graham pleaded very volubly bringing up precedents without numberstriving to do his duty to his client on a point with which his own conscience did not interfere and at last it was ruled by the judge that this examination might go onwhereupon both sir richard and mr steelyard sat down as though they were perfectly satisfied kenneby on being again asked said that he did remember the old trial  it is necessary you know that the jury should hear you and if you look at them and speak to them they would stand a better chance kenneby for a moment allowed his eye to travel up to the jury box but it instantly fell again and fixed itself on the lawyers face you do remember that trial  yes sir i remember it whispered kenneby  do you remember my asking you then whether you had been in the habit of witnessing sir joseph masons signature  did you ask me that sir  that is the question which i put to you do you remember my doing so  i dare say you did sir  i did and i will now read your answer we shall give to the jury a copy of the proceedings of that trial my lord when we have proved itas of course we intend to do  and then there was another little battle between the barristers but as lady mason was now being tried for perjury alleged to have been committed at that other trial it was of course indispensable that all the proceedings of that trial should be made known to the jury  you said on that occasion continued furnival that you were sure you had witnessed three signatures of sir josephs that summerthat you had probably witnessed three in july that you were quite sure you had witnessed three in one week in july that you were nearly sure you had witnessed three in one day that you could not tell what day that might have been and that you had been used as a witness so often that you really did not remember anything about it can you say whether that was the purport of the evidence you gave then  if its down there said john kenneby and then he stopped himself  it is down here i have read it  i suppose its all right said kenneby  i must trouble you to speak out said the judge i cannot hear you and it is impossible that the jury should do so the judges words were not uncivil but his voice was harsh and the only perceptible consequence of the remonstrance was to be seen in the thick drops of perspiration standing on john kennebys brow  that is the evidence which you gave on the former trial may the jury presume that you then spoke the truth to the best of your knowledge  i tried to speak the truth sir  you tried to speak the truth but do you mean to say that you failed  no i dont think i failed  when therefore you told the jury that you were nearly sure that you had witnessed three signatures of sir josephs in one day that was truth  i dont think i ever did  ever did what  witness three papers in one day  you dont think you ever did  i might have done to be sure  but then at that trial about twelve months after the mans death you were nearly sure you had done so  was i  so you told the jury  then i did sir  then you did what  did witness all those papers  you think then now that it is probable you witnessed three signatures on the same day  no i dont think that  then what do you think  it is so long ago sir that i really dont know  exactly it is so long ago that you cannot depend on your memory  i suppose i cant sir  but you just now told the gentleman who examined you on the other side that you were quite sure you did not witness two deeds on the day he namedthe 14th of july now seeing that you doubt your own memory going back over so long a time do you wish to correct that statement  i suppose i do  what correction do you wish to make  i dont think i did  dont think you did what  i dont think i signed two  i really cannot hear the witness said the judge  you must speak out louder said mr furnival himself speaking very loudly  i mean to do it as well as i can said kenneby  i believe you do said furnival but in so meaning you must be very careful to state nothing as a certainty of the certainty of which you are not sure are you certain that on that day you did not witness two deeds  i think so  and yet you were not certain twenty years ago when the fact was so much nearer to you  i dont remember  you dont remember whether you were certain twelve months after the occurrence but you think you are certain now  i mean i dont think i signed two  it is then only a matter of thinking  noonly a matter of thinking  and you might have signed the two  i certainly might have done so  what you mean to tell the jury is this that you have no remembrance of signing twice on that special day although you know that you have acted as witness on behalf of sir joseph mason more than twice on the same day  yes  that is the intended purport of your evidence  yes sir  and then mr furnival travelled off to that other point of mr usbechs presence and alleged handwriting on that matter kenneby had not made any positive assertion though he had expressed a very strong opinion mr furnival was not satisfied with this but wished to show that kenneby had not on that matter even a strong opinion he again reverted to the evidence on the former trial and read various questions with their answers and the answers as given at that time certainly did not when so taken express a clear opinion on the part of the person who gave them although an impartial person on reading the whole evidence would have found that a very clear opinion was expressed when first asked kenneby had said that he was nearly sure that mr usbech had not signed the document but his very anxiety to be true had brought him into trouble mr furnival on that occasion had taken advantage of the word nearly and had at last succeeded in making him say that he was not sure at all evidence by means of torturethumbscrew and suchlikewe have for many years past abandoned as barbarous and have acknowledged that it is of its very nature useless in the search after truth how long will it be before we shall recognise that the other kind of torture is equally opposed both to truth and civilization  but mr usbech was certainly in the room on that day continued mr furnival  yes he was there  and knew what you were all doing i suppose  yes i suppose he knew  i presume it was he who explained to you the nature of the deed you were to witness  i dare say he did  as he was the lawyer that would be natural  i suppose it would  and you dont remember the nature of that special deed as explained to you on the day when bridget bolster was in the room  no i dont  it might have been a will  yes it might i did sign one or two wills for sir joseph i think  and as to this individual document mr usbech might have signed it in your presence for anything you know to the contrary  he might have done so  now on your oath kenneby is your memory strong enough to enable you to give the jury any information on this subject upon which they may firmly rely in convicting that unfortunate lady of the terrible crime laid to her charge then for a moment kenneby glanced round and fixed his eyes upon lady masons face think a moment before you answer and deal with her as you would wish another should deal with you if you were so situated can you say that you remember that usbech did not sign it  well sir i dont think he did  but he might have done so  oh yes he might  you do not remember that he did do so  certainly not  and that is about the extent of what you mean to say  yes sir  let me understand said the judgeand then the perspiration became more visible on poor kennebys facedo you mean to say that you have no memory on the matter whateverthat you simply do not remember whether usbech did or did not sign it  i dont think he signed it  but why do you think he did not seeing that his name is there  i didnt see him  do you mean continued the judge that you didnt see him or that you dont remember that you saw him  i dont remember that i saw him  but you may have done so he may have signed and you may have seen him do so only you dont remember it  yes my lord  and then kenneby was allowed to go down as he did so joseph mason who sat near to him turned upon him a look black as thunder mr mason gave him no credit for his timidity but believed that he had been bought over by the other side dockwrath however knew better they did not quite beat him about his own signature said he but i knew all along that we must depend chiefly upon bolster  then bridget bolster was put into the box and she was examined by mr steelyard she had heard kenneby instructed to look up and she therefore fixed her eyes upon the canopy over the judges seat there she fixed them and there she kept them till her examination was over merely turning them for a moment on to mr chaffanbrass when that gentleman became particularly severe in his treatment of her what she said in answer to mr steelyard was very simple she had never witnessed but one signature in her life and that she had done in sir josephs room the nature of the document had been explained to her but as she said she was young and giddy then and what went in at one year went out at another she didnt remember mr usbech signing but he might have done so she thought he did not as to the two signatures purporting to be hers she could not say which was hers and which was not but this she would swear positively that they were not both hers to this she adhered firmly and mr steelyard handed her over to mr chaffanbrass  illustration bridget bolster in court  then mr chaffanbrass rose from his seat and every one knew that his work was cut out for him mr furnival had triumphed it may be said that he had demolished his witness but his triumph had been very easy it was now necessary to demolish bridget bolster and the opinion was general that if anybody could do it mr chaffanbrass was the man but there was a doggedness about bridget bolster which induced many to doubt whether even chaffanbrass would be successful mr aram trusted greatly but the bar would have preferred to stake their money on bridget  chaffanbrass as he rose pushed back his small ugly wig from his forehead thrusting it rather on one side as he did so and then with his chin thrown forward and a wicked illmeaning smile upon his mouth he looked at bridget for some moments before he spoke to her she glanced at him and instantly fixed her eyes back upon the canopy she then folded her hands one on the other upon the rail before her compressed her lips and waited patiently  i think you say yourea chambermaid that was the first question which chaffanbrass asked and bridget bolster gave a little start as she heard his sharp angry disagreeable voice  yes i am sir at palmers imperial hotel plymouth devonshire and have been for nineteen years upper and under  upper and under what do upper and under mean  when i was under i had another above me and now as im upper why theres others under me so she explained her position at the hotel but she never took her eyes from the canopy  you hadnt begun beingchambermaid when you signed these documents  i didnt sign only one of em  well one of them you hadnt begun being chambermaid then  no i hadnt i was housemaid at orley farm  were you upper or under there  well i believe i was both that is the cook was upper in the house  oh the cook was upper why wasnt she called to sign her name  that i cant say she was a very decent womanthat i can sayand her name was martha mullens  so far mr chaffanbrass had not done much but that was only the preliminary skirmish as fencers play with their foils before they begin  and now bridget bolster if i understand you he said you have sworn that on the 14th of july you only signed one of these documents  i only signed once sir i didnt say nothing about the 14th of july because i dont remember  but when you signed the one deed you did not sign any other  neither then nor never  do you know the offence for which that lady is being triedlady mason  well i aint sure its for doing something about the will  no woman it is not and then as mr chaffanbrass raised his voice and spoke with savage earnestness bridget again started and gave a little leap up from the floor but she soon settled herself back in her old position no one has dared to accuse her of that continued mr chaffanbrass looking over at the lawyers on the other side the charge they have brought forward against her is that of perjuryof having given false evidence twenty years ago in a court of law now look here bridget bolster look at me i say she did look at him for a moment and then turned her eyes back to the canopy as sure as youre a living woman you shall be placed there and tried for the same offencefor perjuryif you tell me a falsehood respecting this matter  i wont say nothing but whats right said bridget  you had better not now look at these two signatures and he handed to her two deeds or rather made one of the servants of the court hold them for him which of those signatures is the one which you did not sign  i cant say sir  did you write that further onethat with your hand on it  i cant say sir  look at it woman before you answer me  bridget looked at it and then repeated the same words  i cant say sir  and now look at the other and she again looked down for a moment did you write that  i cant say sir  will you swear that you wrote either  i did write one once  dont prevaricate with me woman were either of those signatures there written by you  i suppose that one was  will you swear that you wrote either the one or the other  ill swear i did write one once  will you swear you wrote one of those you have before you you can read cant you  oh yes i can read  then look at them again she turned her eyes on them for half a moment will you swear that you wrote either of those  not if theres another anywhere else said bridget at last  another anywhere else said chaffanbrass repeating her words what do you mean by another  if youve got another that anybody else has done i wont say which of the three is mine but i did one and i didnt do no more  mr chaffanbrass continued at it for a long time but with very indifferent success that affair of the signatures which was indeed the only point on which evidence was worth anything he then abandoned and tried to make her contradict herself about old usbech but on this subject she could say nothing that usbech was present she remembered well but as to his signing the deed or not signing it she would not pretend to say anything  i know he was cram full of gout she said but i dont remember nothing more  but it may be explained that mr chaffanbrass had altogether altered his intention and the very plan of his campaign with reference to this witness as soon as he saw what was her nature and disposition he discovered very early in the affair that he could not force her to contradict herself and reduce her own evidence to nothing as furnival had done with the man nothing would flurry this woman or force her to utter words of which she herself did not know the meaning the more he might persevere in such an attempt the more dogged and steady she would become he therefore soon gave that up he had already given it up when he threatened to accuse her of perjury and resolved that as he could not shake her he would shake the confidence which the jury might place in her he could not make a fool of her and therefore he would make her out to be a rogue her evidence would stand alone or nearly alone and in this way he might turn her firmness to his own purpose and explain that her dogged resolution to stick to one plain statement arose from her having been specially instructed so to do with the object of ruining his client for more than half an hour he persisted in asking her questions with this object hinting that she was on friendly terms with dockwrath asking her what pay she had received for her evidence making her acknowledge that she was being kept at free quarters and on the fat of the land he even produced from her a list of the good things she had eaten that morning at breakfast and at last succeeded in obtaining information as to that small but indiscreet glass of spirits it was then and then only that poor bridget became discomposed beefsteaks sausages and pigs fry though they were taken three times a day were not disgraceful in her line of life but that little thimble of brandy taken after much pressing and in the openness of good fellowship went sorely against the grain with her when one has to be badgered like this one wants a drop of something more than ordinary she said at last and they were the only words which she did say which proved any triumph on the part of mr chaffanbrass but nevertheless mr chaffanbrass was not dissatisfied triumph immediate triumph over a poor maidservant could hardly have been the object of a man who had been triumphant in such matters for the last thirty years would it not be practicable to make the jury doubt whether that woman could be believed that was the triumph he desired as for himself mr chaffanbrass knew well enough that she had spoken nothing but the truth but had he so managed that the truth might be made to look like falsehoodor at any rate to have a doubtful air if he had done that he had succeeded in the occupation of his life and was indifferent to his own triumph     chapter lxxii  mr furnivals speech   all this as may be supposed disturbed felix graham not a little he perceived that each of those two witnesses had made a great effort to speak the truthan honest painful effort to speak the truth and in no way to go beyond it his gall had risen within him while he had listened to mr furnival and witnessed his success in destroying the presence of mind of that weak wretch who was endeavouring to do his best in the cause of justice and again when mr chaffanbrass had seized hold of that poor dram and used all his wit in deducing from it a selfcondemnation from the woman before himwhen the practised barrister had striven to show that she was an habitual drunkard dishonest unchaste evil in all her habits graham had felt almost tempted to get up and take her part no doubt he had evinced this for chaffanbrass had understood what was going on in his colleagues mind and had looked round at him from time to time with an air of scorn that had been almost unendurable  and then it had become the duty of the prosecutors to prove the circumstances of the former trial this was of course essentially necessary seeing that the offence for which lady mason was now on her defence was perjury alleged to have been committed at that trial and when this had been done at considerable length by sir richard leatherhamnot without many interruptions from mr furnival and much assistance from mr steelyardit fell upon felix graham to show by crossexamination of crook the attorney what had been the nature and effect of lady masons testimony as he arose to do this mr chaffanbrass whispered into his ear if you feel yourself unequal to it ill take it up i wont have her thrown over for any etiquettenor yet for any squeamishness to this graham vouchsafed no answer he would not even reply by a look but he got up and did his work at this point his conscience did not interfere with him for the questions which he asked referred to facts which had really occurred lady masons testimony at that trial had been believed by everybody the gentleman who had crossexamined her on the part of joseph mason and who was now dead had failed to shake her evidence the judge who tried the case had declared to the jury that it was impossible to disbelieve her evidence that judge was still living a poor old bedridden man and in the course of this latter trial his statement was given in evidence there could be no doubt that at the time lady masons testimony was taken as worthy of all credit she had sworn that she had seen the three witnesses sign the codicil and no one had then thrown discredit on her the upshot of all was this that the prosecuting side proved satisfactorily that such and such things had been sworn by lady mason and felix graham on the side of the defence proved that when she had so sworn her word had been considered worthy of credence by the judge and by the jury and had hardly been doubted even by the counsel opposed to her all this really had been so and felix graham used his utmost ingenuity in making clear to the court how high and unassailed had been the position which his client then held  all this occupied the court till nearly four oclock and then as the case was over on the part of the prosecution the question arose whether or no mr furnival should address the jury on that evening or wait till the following day if your lordship will sit till seven oclock said mr furnival i think i can undertake to finish what remarks i shall have to make by that time i should not mind sitting till nine for the pleasure of hearing mr furnival said the judge who was very anxious to escape from alston on the day but one following and thus it was decided that mr furnival should commence his speech  i have said that in spite of some previous hesitation his old fire had returned to him when he began his work in court on behalf of his client if this had been so when that work consisted in the crossexamination of a witness it was much more so with him now when he had to exhibit his own powers of forensic eloquence when a man knows that he can speak with ease and energy and that he will be listened to with attentive ears it is all but impossible that he should fail to be enthusiastic even though his cause be a bad one it was so with him now all his old fire came back upon him and before he had done he had almost brought himself again to believe lady mason to be that victim of persecution as which he did not hesitate to represent her to the jury  gentlemen of the jury he said i never rose to plead a clients cause with more confidence than i now feel in pleading that of my friend lady mason twenty years ago i was engaged in defending her rights in this matter and i then succeeded i little thought at that time that i should be called on after so long an interval to renew my work i little thought that the pertinacity of her opponent would hold out for such a period i compliment him on the firmness of his character on that equable temperament which has enabled him to sit through all this trial and to look without dismay on the unfortunate lady whom he has considered it to be his duty to accuse of perjury i did not think that i should live to fight this battle again but so it is and as i had but little doubt of victory thenso have i none now gentlemen of the jury i must occupy some of your time and of the time of the court in going through the evidence which has been adduced by my learned friend against my client but i almost feel that i shall be detaining you unnecessarily so sure i am that the circumstances as they have been already explained to you could not justify you in giving a verdict against her  as mr furnivals speech occupied fully three hours i will not trouble my readers with the whole of it he began by describing the former trial and giving his own recollections as to lady masons conduct on that occasion in doing this he fully acknowledged on her behalf that she did give as evidence that special statement which her opponents now endeavoured to prove to have been false if it were the case he said that that codicilor that pretended codicil was not executed by old sir joseph mason and was not witnessed by usbech kenneby and bridget bolsterthen in that case lady mason has been guilty of perjury mr furnival as he made this acknowledgement studiously avoided the face of lady mason but as he made this assertion almost everybody in the court except her own counsel did look at her joseph mason opposite and dockwrath fixed their gaze closely upon her sir richard leatherham and mr steelyard turned their eyes towards her probably without meaning to do so the judge looked over his spectacles at her even mr aram glanced round at her surreptitiously and lucius turned his face upon his mothers almost with an air of triumph but she bore it all without flinchingbore it all without flinching though the state of her mind at that moment must have been pitiable and mrs orme who held her hand all the while knew that it was so the hand which rested in hers was twitched as it were convulsively but the culprit gave no outward sign of her guilt  mr furnival then read much of the evidence given at the former trial and especially showed how the witnesses had then failed to prove that usbech had not been required to write his name it was quite true he said that they had been equally unable to prove that he had done so but that amounted to nothing the onus probandi lay with the accusing side there was the signature and it was for them to prove that it was not that which it pretended to be lady mason had proved that it was so and because that had then been held to be sufficient they now after twenty years took this means of invalidating her testimony from that he went to the evidence given at the present trial beginning with the malice and interested motives of dockwrath against three of them only was it needful that he should allege anything seeing that the statements made by the others were in no way injurious to lady masonif the statements made by those three were not credible torrington for instance had proved that other deed but what of that if on the fatal 14th of july sir joseph mason had executed two deeds as to dockwraththat his conduct had been interested and malicious there could be no doubt and he submitted to the jury that he had shown himself to be a man unworthy of credit as to kennebythat poor weak creature as mr furnival in his mercy called himhe mr furnival could not charge his conscience with saying that he believed him to have been guilty of any falsehood on the contrary he conceived that kenneby had endeavoured to tell the truth but he was one of those men whose minds were so inconsequential that they literally did not know truth from falsehood he had not intended to lie when he told the jury that he was not quite sure he had never witnessed two signatures by sir joseph mason on the same day nor did he lie when he told them again that he had witnessed three he had meant to declare the truth but he was unfortunately a man whose evidence could not be of much service in any case of importance and could be of no service whatever in a criminal charge tried as was done in this instance more than twenty years after the alleged commission of the offence with regard to bridget bolster he had no hesitation whatever in telling the jury that she was a woman unworthy of beliefunworthy of that credit which the jury must place in her before they could convict any one on her unaided testimony it must have been clear to them all that she had come into court drilled and instructed to make one pointblank statement and to stick to that she had refused to give any evidence as to her own signature she would not even look at her own name as written by herself but had contented herself with repeating over and over again those few words which she had been instructed so to saythe statement namely that she had never put her hand to more than one deed  then he addressed himself as he concluded his speech to that part of the subject which was more closely personal to lady mason herself and now gentlemen of the jury he said before i can dismiss you from your weary days work i must ask you to regard the position of the lady who has been thus accused and the amount of probability of her guilt which you may assume from the nature of her life i shall call no witnesses as to her character for i will not submit her friends to the annoyance of those questions which the gentlemen opposite might feel it their duty to put to them circumstances have occurredso much i will tell you and so much no doubt you all personally know though it is not in evidence before youcircumstances have occurred which would make it cruel on my part to place her old friend sir peregrine orme in that box the story could i tell it to you is one full of romance but full also of truth and affection but though sir peregrine orme is not here there sits his daughter by lady masons sidethere she has sat through this tedious trial giving comfort to the woman that she lovesand there she will sit till your verdict shall have made her further presence here unnecessary his lordship and my learned friend there will tell you that you cannot take that as evidence of character they will be justified in so telling you but i on the other hand defy you not to take it as such evidence let us make what laws we will they cannot take precedence of human nature there too sits my clients son you will remember that at the beginning of this trial the solicitorgeneral expressed a wish that he were not here i do not know whether you then responded to that wish but i believe i may take it for granted that you do not do so now had any woman dear to either of you been so placed through the malice of an enemy would you have hesitated to sit by her in her hour of trial had you doubted of her innocence you might have hesitated for who could endure to hear announced in a crowded court like this the guilt of a mother or a wife but he has no doubt nor i believe has any living being in this courtunless it be her kinsman opposite whose life for the last twenty years has been made wretched by a wicked longing after the patrimony of his brother  gentlemen of the jury there sits my client with as loving a friend on one side as ever woman had and with her only child on the other during the incidents of this trial the nature of the life she has led during the last twenty yearssince the period of that terrible crime with which she is chargedhas been proved before you i may fearlessly ask you whether so fair a life is compatible with the idea of guilt so foul i have known her intimately during all those yearsnot as a lawyer but as a friendand i confess that the audacity of this man dockwrath in assailing such a character with such an accusation strikes me almost with admiration what forgeryfor that gentlemen of the jury is the crime with which she is substantially charged look at her as she sits there that she at the age of twenty or not much moreshe who had so well performed the duties of her young life that she should have forged a willhave traced one signature after another in such a manner as to have deceived all those lawyers who were on her track immediately after her husbands death for mark you if this be true with her own hand she must have done it there was no accomplice there look at her was she a forger was she a woman to deceive the sharp bloodhounds of the law could she with that young baby on her bosom have wrested from such as himand as he spoke he pointed with his finger but with a look of unutterable scorn to joseph mason who was sitting opposite to himthat fragment of his old fathers property which he coveted so sorely where had she learned such skilled artifice gentlemen such ingenuity in crime as that has never yet been proved in a court of law even against those who have spent a life of wretchedness in acquiring such skill and now you are asked to believe that such a deed was done by a young wife of whom all that you know is that her conduct in every other respect had been beyond all praise gentlemen i might have defied you to believe this accusation had it even been supported by testimony of a high character even in such case you would have felt that there was more behind than had been brought to your knowledge but now having seen as you have of what nature are the witnesses on whose testimony she has been impeached it is impossible that you should believe this story had lady mason been a woman steeped in guilt from her infancy had she been noted for cunning and fraudulent ingenuity had she been known as an expert forger you would not have convicted her on this indictment having had before you the malice and greed of dockwrath the stupidityi may almost call it idiocy of kenneby and the dogged resolution to conceal the truth evinced by the woman bolster with strong evidence you could not have believed such a charge against so excellent a lady with such evidence as you have had before you you could not have believed the charge against a previously convicted felon  and what has been the object of this terrible persecutionof the dreadful punishment which has been inflicted on this poor lady for remember though you cannot pronounce her guilty her sufferings have been terribly severe think what it must have been for a woman with habits such as hers to have looked forward for long long weeks to such a martyrdom as this think what she must have suffered in being dragged here and subjected to the gaze of all the county as a suspected felon think what must have been her feelings when i told her not knowing how deep an ingenuity might be practised against her that i must counsel her to call to her aid the unequalled talents of my friend mr chaffanbrassunequalled no longer but far surpassed whispered chaffanbrass in a voice that was audible through all the centre of the court her punishment has been terrible continued mr furnival after what she has gone through it may well be doubted whether she can continue to reside at that sweet spot which has aroused such a feeling of avarice in the bosom of her kinsman you have heard that sir joseph mason had promised his eldest son that orley farm should form a part of his inheritance it may be that the old man did make such a promise if so he thought fit to break it but is it not wonderful that a man wealthy as is mr masonfor his fortune is large who has never wanted anything that money can buy a man for whom his father did so muchthat he should be stirred up by disappointed avarice to carry in his bosom for twenty years so bitter a feeling of rancour against those who are nearest to him by blood and ties of family gentlemen it has been a fearful lesson but it is one which neither you nor i will ever forget  and now i shall leave my clients case in your hands as to the verdict which you will give i have no apprehension you know as well as i do that she has not been guilty of this terrible crime that you will so pronounce i do not for a moment doubt but i do hope that that verdict will be accompanied by some expression on your part which may show to the world at large how great has been the wickedness displayed in the accusation  and yet as he sat down he knew that she had been guilty to his ear her guilt had never been confessed but yet he knew that it was so and knowing that he had been able to speak as though her innocence were a thing of course that those witnesses had spoken truth he also knew and yet he had been able to hold them up to the execration of all around them as though they had committed the worst of crimes from the foulest of motives and more than this stranger than this worse than thiswhen the legal world knewas the legal world soon did knowthat all this had been so the legal world found no fault with mr furnival conceiving that he had done his duty by his client in a manner becoming an english barrister and an english gentleman     chapter lxxiii  mrs orme tells the story   it was late when that second days work was over and when mrs orme and lady mason again found themselves in the hamworth carriage they had sat in court from ten in the morning till past seven with a short interval of a few minutes in the middle of the day and were weary to the very soul when they left it lucius again led out his mother and as he did so he expressed to her in strong language his approval of mr furnivals speech at last some one had spoken out on his mothers behalf in that tone which should have been used from the first he had been very angry with mr furnival thinking that the barrister had lost sight of his mothers honour and that he was playing with her happiness but now he was inclined to forgive him now at last the truth had been spoken in eloquent words and the persecutors of his mother had been addressed in language such as it was fitting that they should hear to him the last two hours had been two hours of triumph and as he passed through the hall of the court he whispered in his mothers ear that now at last as he hoped her troubles were at an end  and another whisper had been spoken as they passed through that hall mrs orme went out leaning on the arm of her son but on the other side of her was mr aram he had remained in his seat till they had begun to move and then he followed them mrs orme was already half way across the court when he made his way up to her side and very gently touched her arm  sir said she looking round  do not let her be too sure he said do not let her be over confident all that may go for nothing with a jury then he lifted his hat and left her  all that go for nothing with a jury she hardly understood this but yet she felt that it all should go for nothing if right were done her mind was not argumentative nor yet perhaps was her sense of true justice very acute when sir peregrine had once hinted that it would be well that the criminal should be pronounced guilty because in truth she had been guilty mrs orme by no means agreed with him but now having heard how those wretched witnesses had been denounced knowing how true had been the words they had spoken knowing how false were those assurances of innocence with which mr furnival had been so fluent she felt something of that spirit which had actuated sir peregrine and had almost thought that justice demanded a verdict against her friend  do not let her be overconfident mr aram had said but in truth mrs orme as she had listened to mr furnivals speech had become almost confident that lady mason would be acquitted it had seemed to her impossible that any jury should pronounce her to be guilty after that speech the state of her mind as she listened to it had been very painful lady masons hand had rested in her own during a great portion of it and it would have been natural that she should give some encouragement to her companion by a touch by a slight pressure as the warm words of praise fell from the lawyers mouth but how could she do so knowing that the praise was false it was not possible to her to show her friendship by congratulating her friend on the success of a lie lady mason also had no doubt felt this for after a while her hand had been withdrawn and they had both listened in silence giving no signs to each other as to their feelings on the subject  but as they sat together in the carriage lucius did give vent to his feelings i cannot understand why all that should not have been said before and said in a manner to have been as convincing as it was today  i suppose there was no opportunity before the trial said mrs orme feeling that she must say something but feeling also how impossible it was to speak on the subject with any truth in the presence both of lady mason and her son  but an occasion should have been made said lucius it is monstrous that my mother should have been subjected to this accusation for months and that no one till now should have spoken out to show how impossible it is that she should have been guilty  ah lucius you do not understand said his mother  and i hope i never may said he why did not the jury get up in their seats at once and pronounce their verdict when mr furnivals speech was over why should they wait there giving another day of prolonged trouble knowing as they must do what their verdict will be to me all this is incomprehensible seeing that no good can in any way come from it  and so he went on striving to urge his companions to speak upon a subject which to them did not admit of speech in his presence it was very painful to them for in addressing mrs orme he almost demanded from her some expression of triumph you at least have believed in her innocence he said at last and have not been ashamed to show that you did so  lucius said his mother we are very weary do not speak to us now let us rest till we are at home then they closed their eyes and there was silence till the carriage drove up to the door of orley farm house  the two ladies immediately went up stairs but lucius with more cheerfulness about him than he had shown for months past remained below to give orders for their supper it had been a joy to him to hear joseph mason and dockwrath exposed and to listen to those words which had so clearly told the truth as to his mothers history all that torrent of indignant eloquence had been to him an enumeration of the simple factsof the facts as he knew them to beof the facts as they would now be made plain to all the world at last the day had come when the cloud would be blown away he looking down from the height of his superior intellect on the folly of those below him had been indignant at the great delaybut that he would now forgive  they had not been long in the house perhaps about fifteen minutes when mrs orme returned down stairs and gently entered the diningroom he was still there standing with his back to the fire and thinking over the work of the day  your mother will not come down this evening mr mason  not come down  no she is very tiredvery tired indeed i fear you hardly know how much she has gone through  shall i go to her said lucius  no mr mason do not do that i will return to her now andbutin a few minutes mr mason i will come back to you again for i shall have something to say to you  you will have tea here  i dont know i think not when i have spoken to you i will go back to your mother i came down now in order that you might not wait for us and then she left the room and again went up stairs it annoyed him that his mother should thus keep away from him but still he did not think that there was any special reason for it mrs ormes manner had been strange but then everything around them in these days was strange and it did not occur to him that mrs orme would have aught to say in her promised interview which would bring to him any new cause for sorrow  lady mason when mrs orme returned to her was sitting exactly in the position in which she had been left her bonnet was off and was lying by her side and she was seated in a large armchair again holding both her hands to the sides of her head no attempt had been made to smooth her hair or to remove the dust and soil which had come from the days long sitting in the court she was a woman very careful in her toilet and scrupulously nice in all that touched her person but now all that had been neglected and her whole appearance was haggard and dishevelled  you have not told him she said  no i have not told him yet but i have bidden him expect me he knows that i am coming to him  and how did he look  i did not see his face and then there was silence between them for a few minutes during which mrs orme stood at the back of lady masons chair with her hand on lady masons shoulder shall i go now dear said mrs orme  no stay a moment not yet oh mrs orme  you will find that you will be stronger and better able to bear it when it has been done  stronger why should i wish to be stronger how will he bear it  it will be a blow to him of course  it will strike him to the ground mrs orme i shall have murdered him i do not think that he will live when he knows that he is so disgraced  he is a man and will bear it as a man should do shall i do anything for you before i go  stay a moment why must it be tonight  he must not be in the court tomorrow and what difference will one day make he must know it when the property is given up  then there was a knock at the door and a girl entered with a decanter two wineglasses and a slice or two of bread and butter you must drink that said mrs orme pouring out a glass of wine  and you  yes i will take some too there i shall be stronger now nay lady mason you shall drink it and now if you will take my advice you will go to bed  you will come to me again  yes directly it is over of course i shall come to you am i not to stay here all night  but himi will not see him he is not to come  that will be as he pleases  no you promised that i cannot see him when he knows what i have done for him  not to hear him say that he forgives you  he will not forgive me you do not know him could you bear to look at your boy if you had disgraced him for ever  whatever i might have done he would not desert me nor will lucius desert you shall i go now  ah me would that i were in my grave  then mrs orme bent over her and kissed her pressed both her hands then kissed her again and silently creeping out of the room made her way once more slowly down the stairs  mrs orme as will have been seen was sufficiently anxious to perform the task which she had given herself but yet her heart sank within her as she descended to the parlour it was indeed a terrible commission and her readiness to undertake it had come not from any feeling on her own part that she was fit for the work and could do it without difficulty but from the eagerness with which she had persuaded lady mason that the thing must be done by some one and now who else could do it in sir peregrines present state it would have been a cruelty to ask him and then his feelings towards lucius in the matter were not tender as were those of mrs orme she had been obliged to promise that she herself would do it or otherwise she could not have urged the doing and now the time had come immediately on their return to the house mrs orme had declared that the story should be told at once and then lady mason sinking into the chair from which she had not since risen had at length agreed that it should be so the time had now come and mrs orme whose footsteps down the stairs had not been audible stood for a moment with the handle of the door in her hand  had it been possible she also would now have put it off till the morrowwould have put it off till any other time than that which was then present all manner of thoughts crowded on her during those few seconds in what way should she do it what words should she use how should she begin she was to tell this young man that his mother had committed a crime of the very blackest dye and now she felt that she should have prepared herself and resolved in what fashion this should be done might it not be well she asked herself for one moment that she should take the night to think of it and then see him in the morning the idea however only lasted her for a moment and then fearing lest she might allow herself to be seduced into some weakness she turned the handle and entered the room  he was still standing with his back to the fire leaning against the mantelpiece and thinking over the occurrences of the day that was past his strongest feeling now was one of hatred to joseph masonof hatred mixed with thorough contempt what must men say of him after such a struggle on his part to ruin the fame of a lady and to steal the patrimony of a brother is she still determined not to come down he said as soon as he saw mrs orme  no she will not come down tonight mr mason i have something that i must tell you  what is she ill has it been too much for her  mr mason she said i hardly know how to do what i have undertaken and he could see that she actually trembled as she spoke to him  what is it mrs orme is it anything about the property i think you need hardly be afraid of me i believe i may say i could bear anything of that kind  mr mason and then again she stopped herself  how was she to speak this horrible word  is it anything about the trial he was now beginning to be frightened feeling that something terrible was coming but still of the absolute truth he had no suspicion  oh mr mason if it were possible that i could spare you i would do so if there were any escapeany way in which it might be avoided  what is it said he and now his voice was hoarse and low for a feeling of fear had come upon him i am a man and can bear it whatever it is  you must be a man then for it is very terrible mr mason that will you know  you mean the codicil  the will that gave you the property  yes  it was not done by your father  who says so  it is too sure it was not done by himnor by themthose other people who were in the court today  but who says so how is it known if my father did not sign it it is a forgery and who forged it those wretches have bought over some one and you have been deceived mrs orme it is not of the property i am thinking but of my mother if it were as you say my mother must have known it  ah yes  and you mean that she did know it that she knew it was a forgery  oh mr mason  heaven and earth let me go to her if she were to tell me so herself i would not believe it of her ah she has told you  yes she has told me  then she is mad this has been too much for her and her brain has gone with it let me go to her mrs orme  no no you must not go to her and mrs orme put herself directly before the door she is not madnot now then at that time we must think she was so it is not so now  i cannot understand you and he put his left hand up to his forehead as though to steady his thoughts i do not understand you if the will be a forgery who did it  this question she could not answer at the moment she was still standing against the door and her eyes fell to the ground who did it he repeated whose hand wrote my fathers name  you must be merciful mr mason  mercifulto whom  to your mother  merciful to my mother mrs orme speak out to me if the will was forged who forged it you cannot mean to tell me that she did it  she did not answer him at the moment in words but coming close up to him she took both his hands in hers and then looked steadfastly up into his eyes his face had now become almost convulsed with emotion and his brow was very black do you wish me to believe that my mother forged the will herself then again he paused but she said nothing woman its a lie he exclaimed and then tearing his hands from her shaking her off and striding away with quick footsteps he threw himself on a sofa that stood in the furthest part of the room  she paused for a moment and then followed him very gently she followed him and stood over him in silence for a moment as he lay with his face from her mr mason she said at last you told me that you would bear this like a man  but he made her no answer and she went on mr mason it is as i tell you years and years ago when you were a baby and when she thought that your father was unjust to youfor your saketo remedy that injustice she did this thing  what forged his name it must be a lie though an angel came to tell me so it would be a lie what my mother and now he turned round and faced her still however lying on the sofa  it is true mr mason oh how i wish that it were not but you must forgive her it is years ago and she has repented of it sir peregrine has forgiven herand i have done so  and then she told him the whole story she told him why the marriage had been broken off and described to him the manner in which the truth had been made known to sir peregrine it need hardly be said that in doing so she dealt as softly as was possible with his mothers name but yet she told him everything she wrote it herself in the night  what all all the names herself  yes all  mrs orme it cannot be so i will not believe it to me it is impossible that you believe it i do not doubt but i cannot let me go to her i will go to her myself but even should she say so herself i will not believe it  but she would not let him go up stairs even though he attempted to move her from the door almost with violence no not till you say that you will forgive her and be gentle with her and it must not be tonight we will be up early in the morning and you can see her before we goif you will be gentle to her  he still persisted that he did not believe the story but it became clear to her by degrees that the meaning of it all had at last sunk into his mind and that he did believe it over and over again she told him all that she knew explaining to him what his mother had suffered making him perceive why she had removed herself out of his hands and had leant on others for advice and she told him also that though they still hoped that the jury might acquit her the property must be abandoned  i will leave the house this night if you wish it he said  when it is all over when she has been acquitted and shall have gone away then let it be done mr mason you will go with her will you not and then again there was a pause  mrs orme it is impossible that i should say now what i may do it seems to me as though i could not live through it i do not believe it i cannot believe it  as soon as she had exacted a promise from him that he would not go to his mother at any rate without further notice she herself went up stairs and found lady mason lying on her bed at first mrs orme thought that she was asleep but no such comfort had come to the poor woman does he know it she asked  mrs ormes task for that night was by no means yet done after remaining for a while with lady mason she again returned to lucius and was in this way a bearer of messages between them there was at last no question as to doubting the story he did believe it he could not avoid the necessity for such belief yes he said when mrs orme spoke again of his leaving the place i will go and hide myself and as for her  but you will go with herif the jury do not say that she was guilty  oh mrs orme  if they do you will come back for her when the time of her punishment is over she is still your mother mr mason  at last the work of the night was done and the two ladies went to their beds the understanding was that lucius should see his mother before they started in the morning but that he should not again accompany them to the court mrs ormes great object had beenher great object as regarded the present momentto prevent his presence in court when the verdict should be given in this she had succeeded she could now wish for an acquittal with a clear conscience and could as it were absolve the sinner within her own heart seeing that there was no longer any doubt as to the giving up of the property whatever might be the verdict of the jury joseph mason of groby would without doubt obtain the property which belonged to him  goodnight mr mason mrs orme said at last as she gave him her hand  goodnight i believe that in my madness i spoke to you tonight like a brute  no no it was nothing i did not think of it  when you think of how it was with me you will forgive me  she pressed his hand and again told him that she had not thought of it it was nothing and indeed it had been as nothing to her there may be moments in a mans life when any words may be forgiven even though they be spoken to a woman  when mrs orme was gone he stood for a while perfectly motionless in the diningroom and then coming out into the hall he opened the front door and taking his hat went out into the night it was still winter but the night though cold and very dark was fine and the air was sharp with the beginning frost leaving the door open he walked forth and passing out on to the road went down from thence to the gate it had been his constant practice to walk up and down from his own hall door to his own gate on the high road perhaps comforting himself too warmly with the reflection that the ground on which he walked was all his own he had no such comfort now as he made his way down the accustomed path and leaned upon the gate thinking over what he had heard  illustration lucius mason as he leaned on the gate that was no longer his own  a forger at some such hour as this with patient premeditated care she had gone to work and committed one of the vilest crimes known to man and this was his mother and he he lucius mason had been living for years on the fruit of this villainyhad been so living till this terrible day of retribution had come upon him i fear that at that moment he thought more of his own misery than he did of hers and hardly considered as he surely should have done that mothers love which had led to all this guilt and for a moment he resolved that he would not go back to the house his head he said to himself should never again rest under a roof which belonged of right to joseph mason he had injured joseph masonhad injured him innocently indeed as far as he himself was concerned but he had injured him greatly and therefore now hated him all the more he shall have it instantly he said and walked forth into the high road as though he would not allow his feet to rest again on his brothers property  but he was forced to remember that this could not be so his mothers trial was not yet over and even in the midst of his own personal trouble he remembered that the verdict to her was still a matter of terrible import he would not let it be known that he had abandoned the property at any rate till that verdict had been given and then as he moved back to the house he tried to think in what way it would become him to behave to his mother she can never be my mother again he said to himself they were terrible wordsbut then was not his position very terrible  and when at last he had bolted the front door going through the accustomed task mechanically and had gone up stairs to his own room he had failed to make up his mind on this subject perhaps it would be better that he should not see her what could he say to her what word of comfort could he speak it was not only that she had beggared him nay it was not that at all but she had doomed him to a life of disgrace which no effort of his own could wipe away and then as he threw himself on his bed he thought of sophia furnival would she share his disgrace with him was it possible that there might be solace there  quite impossible we should say who know her well     chapter lxxiv  young lochinvar   judge staveley whose court had not been kept sitting to a late hour by any such eloquence as that of mr furnival had gone home before the business of the other court had closed augustus who was his fathers marshal remained for his friend and had made his way in among the crowd so as to hear the end of the speech  dont wait dinner for us he had said to his father if you do you will be hating us all the time and we shant be there till between eight and nine  i should be sorry to hate you said the judge and so i wont when therefore felix graham escaped from the court at about halfpast seven the two young men were able to take their own time and eat their dinner together comfortably enjoying their bottle of champagne between them perhaps more thoroughly than they would have done had the judge and mrs staveley shared it with them  but felix had something of which to think besides the champagnesomething which was of more consequence to him even than the trial in which he was engaged madeline had promised that she would meet him that eveningor rather had not so promised when asked to do so she had not refused but even while not refusing had reminded him that her mother would be there her manner to him had he thought been cold though she had not been ungracious upon the whole he could not make up his mind to expect success then he must have been a fool the reader learned in such matters will say the reader learned in such matters is i think right in that respect he was a fool  i suppose we must give the governor the benefit of our company over his wine said augustus as soon as their dinner was over  i suppose we ought to do so  and why not is there any objection  to tell the truth said graham i have an appointment which i am very anxious to keep  an appointment where here at noningsby do you mean  in this house but yet i cannot say that it is absolutely an appointment i am going to ask your sister what my fate is to be  and that is the appointment very well my dear fellow and may god prosper you if you can convince the governor that it is all right i shall make no objection i wish for madelines sake that you had not such a terrible bee in your bonnet  and you will go to the judge alone  oh yes ill tell him what shall i tell him  the truth if you will goodbye old fellow you will not see me again tonight nor yet tomorrow in this house unless i am more fortunate than i have any right to hope to be  faint heart never won fair lady you know said augustus  my heart is faint enough then but nevertheless i shall say what i have got to say and then he got up from the table  if you dont come down to us said augustus i shall come up to you but may god speed you and now ill go to the governor  felix made his way from the small breakfastparlour in which they had dined across the hall into the drawingroom and there he found lady staveley alone so the trial is not over yet mr graham she said  no there will be another day of it  and what will be the verdict is it possible that she really forged the will  ah that i cannot say you know that i am one of her counsel lady staveley  yes i should have remembered that and been more discreet if you are looking for madeline mr graham i think that she is in the library  oh thank youin the library and then felix got himself out of the drawingroom into the hall again not in the most graceful manner he might have gone direct from the drawingroom to the library but this he did not remember it was very odd he thought that lady staveley of whose dislike to him he had felt sure should have thus sent him direct to her daughter and have become a party as it were to an appointment between them but he had not much time to think of this before he found himself in the room there sure enough was madeline waiting to listen to his story she was seated when he entered with her back to him but as she heard him she rose and after pausing for a moment she stepped forward to meet him  you and augustus were very late today she said  yes i was kept there and he was good enough to wait for me  you said you wanted tospeak to me she said hesitating a little but yet very little to speak to me alone and so mamma said i had better come in here i hope you are not vexed that i should have told her  certainly not miss staveley  because i have no secrets from mamma  nor do i wish that anything should be secret i hate all secrecies miss staveley your father knows of my intention  on this point madeline did not feel it to be necessary to say anything of course her father knew of the intention had she not received her fathers sanction for listening to mr graham she would not have been alone with him in the library it might be that the time would come in which she would explain all this to her lover but that time had not come yet so when he spoke of her father she remained silent and allowing her eyes to fall to the ground she stood before him waiting to hear his question  miss staveley he saidand he was conscious himself of being very awkward much more so indeed than there was any need for madeline was not aware that he was awkward in her eyes he was quite master of the occasion and seemed to have everything his own way he had already done all that was difficult in the matter and had done it without any awkwardness he had already made himself master of her heart and it was only necessary now that he should enter in and take possession the ripe fruit had fallen as miss furnival had once chosen to express it and there he was to pick it upif only he considered it worth his trouble to do so that manner of the picking would not signify much as madeline thought that he desired to take it into his garner and preserve it for his lifes use was everything to her but the method of his words at the present moment was not much he was her lord and master he was the one man who had conquered and taken possession of her spirit and as to his being awkward there was not much in that nor do i say that he was awkward he spoke his mind in honest plain terms and i do not know he could have done better  miss staveley he said in asking you to see me alone i have made a great venture i am indeed risking all that i most value and then he paused as though he expected that she would speak but she still kept her eyes upon the ground and still stood silent before him i cannot but think you must guess my purpose he said though i acknowledge that i have had nothing that can warrant me in hoping for a favourable answer there is my hand if you can take it you need not doubt that you have my heart with it and then he held out to her his broad right hand  madeline still stood silent before him and still fixed her eyes upon the ground but very slowly she raised her little hand and allowed her soft slight fingers to rest upon his open palm it was as though she thus affixed her legal signature and seal to the deed of gift she had not said a word to him not a word of love or a word of assent but no such word was now necessary  madeline my own madeline he said and then taking unfair advantage of the fingers which she had given him he drew her to his breast and folded her in his arms  it was nearly an hour after this when he returned to the drawingroom do go in now she said you must not wait any longer indeed you must go  and you you will come in presently  it is already nearly eleven no i will not show myself again tonight mamma will soon come up to me i know goodnight felix do you go now and i will follow you and then after some further little ceremony he left her  when he entered the drawingroom lady staveley was there and the judge with his teacup beside him and augustus standing with his back to the fire felix walked up to the circle and taking a chair sat down but at the moment said nothing  you didnt get any wine after your days toil master graham said the judge  indeed i did sir we had some champagne  champagne had you then i ought to have waited for my guest for i got none you had a long day of it in court  yes indeed sir  and i am afraid not very satisfactory to this graham made no immediate answer but he could not refrain from thinking that the day taken altogether had been satisfactory to him  and then baker came into the room and going close up to lady staveley whispered something in her ear oh ah yes said lady staveley i must wish you good night mr graham and she took his hand pressing it very warmly but though she wished him good night then she saw him again before he went to bed it was a family in which all home affairs were very dear and a new son could not be welcomed into it without much expression of affection  well sir and how have you sped since dinner the judge asked as soon as the door was closed behind his wife  i have proposed to your daughter and she has accepted me and as he said so he rose from the chair in which he had just now seated himself  then my boy i hope you will make her a good husband and the judge gave him his hand  i will try to do so i cannot but feel however how little right i had to ask her seeing that i am likely to be so poor a man  well well wellwe will talk of that another time at present we will only sing your triumphs      so faithful in love and so dauntless in war     there never was knight like the young lochinvar   felix my dear fellow i congratulate you with all my heart said augustus but i did not know you were good as a warrior  ah but he is though said the judge what do you think of his wounds and if all that i hear be true he has other battles on hand but we must not speak about that till this poor ladys trial is over  i need hardly tell you sir said graham with that sheeplike air which a man always carries on such occasions that i regard myself as the most fortunate man in the world  quite unnecessary said the judge on such occasions that is taken as a matter of course and then the conversation between them for the next ten minutes was rather dull and flat  up stairs the same thing was going on in a manner somewhat more animated between the mother and daughterfor ladies on such occasions can be more animated than men  oh mamma you must love him madeline said  yes my dear of course i shall love him now your papa says that he is very clever  i know papa likes him i knew that from the very first i think that was the reason why  and i suppose clever people are the bestthat is to say if they are good  and isnt he good  welli hope so indeed im sure he is mr orme was a very good young man toobut its no good talking about him now  mamma that never could have come to pass  very well my dear its over now and of course all that i looked for was your happiness  i know that mamma and indeed i am very happy im sure i could not ever have liked any one else since i first knew him  lady staveley still thought it very odd but she had nothing else to say as regarded the pecuniary considerations of the affair she left them altogether to her husband feeling that in this way she could relieve herself from misgivings which might otherwise make her unhappy and after all i dont know that his ugliness signifies she said to herself and so she made up her mind that she would be loving and affectionate to him and sat up till she heard his footsteps in the passage in order that she might speak to him and make him welcome to the privileges of a soninlaw  mr graham she said opening her door as he passed by  of course she has told you said felix  oh yes she has told me we dont have many secrets in this house and im sure i congratulate you with all my heart and i think you have got the very best girl in all the world of course im her mother but i declare if i was to talk of her for a week i could not say anything of her but good  i know how fortunate i am  yes you are fortunate for there is nothing in the world equal to a loving wife who will do her duty and im sure youll be good to her  i will endeavour to be so  a man must be very bad indeed who would be bad to herand i dont think that of you and its a great thing mr graham that madeline should have loved a man of whom her papa is so fond i dont know what you have done to the judge im sure this she said remembering in the innocence of her heart that mr arbuthnot had been a soninlaw rather after her own choice and that the judge always declared that his eldest daughters husband had seldom much to say for himself  and i hope that madelines mother will receive me as kindly as madelines father said he taking lady staveleys hand and pressing it  indeed i will i will love you very dearly if you will let me my girls husbands are the same to me as sons then she put up her face and he kissed it and so they wished each other good night  he found augustus in his own room and they two had hardly sat themselves down over the fire intending to recall the former scenes which had taken place in that very room when a knock was heard at the door and mrs baker entered  and so its all settled mr felix said she  yes said he all settled  well now didnt i know it from the first  then what a wicked old woman you were not to tell said augustus  thats all very well master augustus how would you like me to tell of youfor i could you know  you wicked old woman you couldnt do anything of the kind  oh couldnt i but i defy all the world to say a word of miss madeline but whats goodonly i did know all along which way the wind was blowing lord love you mr graham when you came in here all of a smash like i knew it wasnt for nothing  you think he did it on purpose then said staveley  did it on purpose what make up to miss madeline why of course he did it on purpose hes been athinking of it ever since christmas night when i saw you master augustus and a certain young lady when you came out into the dark passage together  thats a downright falsehood mrs baker  ohvery well perhaps i was mistaken but now mr graham if you dont treat our miss madeline well  thats just what ive been telling him said her brother if he uses her ill as he did his former wifebreaks her heart as he did with that one  his former wife said mrs baker  havent you heard of that why hes had two already  two wives already oh now master augustus what an old fool i am ever to believe a word that comes out of your mouth then having uttered her blessing and having had her hand cordially grasped by this new scion of the staveley family the old woman left the young men to themselves and went to her bed  now that it is done said felix  you wish it were undone  no by heaven i think i may venture to say that it will never come to me to wish that but now that it is done i am astonished at my own impudence almost as much as at my success why should your father have welcomed me to his house as his soninlaw seeing how poor are my prospects  just for that reason and because he is so different from other men i have no doubt that he is proud of madeline for having liked a man with an ugly face and no money  if i had been beautiful like you i shouldnt have had a chance with him  not if youd been weighted with money also now as for myself i confess im not nearly so magnanimous as my father and for mads sake i do hope you will get rid of your vagaries an income i know is a very commonplace sort of thing but when a man has a family there are comforts attached to it  i am at any rate willing to work said graham somewhat moodily  yes if you may work exactly in your own way but men in the world cant do that a man as i take it must through life allow himself to be governed by the united wisdom of others around him he cannot take upon himself to judge as to every step by his own lights if he does he will be dead before he has made up his mind as to the preliminaries and in this way augustus staveley from the depth of his lifes experience spoke words of worldly wisdom to his future brotherinlaw  on the next morning before he started again for alston and his now odious work graham succeeded in getting madeline to himself for five minutes i saw both your father and mother last night said he and i shall never forget their goodness to me  yes they are good  it seems like a dream to me that they should have accepted me as their soninlaw  but it is no dream to me felixor if so i do not mean to wake any more i used to think that i should never care very much for anybody out of my own familybut now and she then pressed her little hand upon his arm  and felix she said as he prepared to leave her you are not to go away from noningsby when the trial is over i wanted mamma to tell you but she said id better do it     chapter lxxv  the last day   mrs orme was up very early on that last morning of the trial and had dressed herself before lady mason was awake it was now march but yet the morning light was hardly sufficient for her as she went through her toilet they had been told to be in the court very punctually at ten and in order to do so they must leave orley farm at nine before that as had been arranged over night lucius was to see his mother  you havent told him he doesnt know were the first words which lady mason spoke as she raised her head from the pillow but then she remembered ah yes she said as she again sank back and hid her face he knows it all now  yes dear he knows it all and is it not better so he will come and see you and when that is over you will be more comfortable than you have been for years past  lucius also had been up early and when he learned that mrs orme was dressed he sent up to her begging that he might see her mrs orme at once went to him and found him seated at the breakfasttable with his head resting on his arm his face was pale and haggard and his hair was uncombed he had not been undressed that night and his clothes hung on him as they always do hang on a man who has passed a sleepless night in them to mrs ormes inquiry after himself he answered not a word nor did he at first ask after his mother that was all true that you told me last night  yes mr mason it was true  and she and i must be outcasts for ever i will endeavour to bear it mrs orme as i did not put an end to my life last night i suppose that i shall live and bear it does she expect to see me  i told her that you would come to her this morning  and what shall i say i would not condemn my own mother but how can i not condemn her  tell her at once that you will forgive her  but it will be a lie i have not forgiven her i loved my mother and esteemed her as a pure and excellent woman i was proud of my mother how can i forgive her for having destroyed such feelings as those  there should be nothing that a son would not forgive his mother  ah that is so easily spoken men talk of forgiveness when their anger rankles deepest in their hearts in the course of years i shall forgive her i hope i shall but to say that i can forgive her now would be a farce she has broken my heart mrs orme  and has not she suffered herself is not her heart broken  i have been thinking of that all night i cannot understand how she should have lived for the last six months well is it time that i should go to her  mrs orme again went up stairs and after another interval of half an hour returned to fetch him she almost regretted that she had undertaken to bring them together on that morning thinking that it might have been better to postpone the interview till the trial should be over she had expected that lucius would have been softer in his manner but it was too late for any such thought  you will find her dressed now mr mason said she but i conjure you as you hope for mercy yourself to be merciful to her she is your mother and though she has injured you by her folly her heart has been true to you through it all go now and remember that harshness to any woman is unmanly  i can only act as i think best he replied in that low stern voice which was habitual to him and then with slow steps he went up to his mothers room  when he entered it she was standing with her eyes fixed upon the door and her hands clasped together so she stood till he had closed the door behind him and had taken a few steps on towards the centre of the room then she rushed forward and throwing herself on the ground before him clasped him round the knees with her arms my boy my boy she said and then she lay there bathing his feet with her tears  oh mother what is this that she has told me  but lady mason at the moment spoke no further words it seemed as though her heart would have burst with sobs and when for a moment she lifted up her face to his the tears were streaming down her cheeks had it not been for that relief she could not have borne the sufferings which were heaped upon her  mother get up he said let me raise you it is dreadful that you should lie there mother let me lift you but she still clung to his knees grovelling on the ground before him lucius lucius she said and she then sank away from him as though the strength of her muscles would no longer allow her to cling to him she sank away from him and lay along the ground hiding her face upon the floor  mother he said taking her gently by the arm as he knelt at her side if you will rise i will speak to you  your words will kill me she said i do not dare to look at you oh lucius will you ever forgive me  and yet she had done it all for him she had done a rascally deed an hideous cutthroat deed but it had been done altogether for him no thought of her own aggrandisement had touched her mind when she resolved upon that forgery as rebekah had deceived her lord and robbed esau the firstborn of his birthright so had she robbed him who was as esau to her how often had she thought of that while her conscience was pleading hard against her had it been imputed as a crime to rebekah that she had loved her own son well and loving him had put a crown upon his head by means of her matchless guile did she love lucius her babe less than rebekah had loved jacob and had she not striven with the old man struggling that she might do this just thing without injustice till in his anger he had thrust her from him i will not break my promise for the brat the old man had saidand then she did the deed but all that was as nothing now she felt no comfort now from that bible story which had given her such encouragement before the thing was finished now the result of evildoing had come full home to her and she was seeking pardon with a broken heart while burning tears furrowed her cheeksnot from him whom she had thought to injure but from the child of her own bosom for whose prosperity she had been so anxious  then she slowly arose and allowed him to place her upon the sofa mother he said it is all over here  ah yes  whither we had better go i cannot yet sayor when we must wait till this day is ended  lucius i care nothing for myselfnothing it is nothing to me whether or no they say that i am guilty it is of you only that i am thinking  our lot mother must still be together if they find you guilty you will be imprisoned and then i will go and come back when they release you for you and me the future world will be very different from the past  it need not be sofor you lucius i do not wish to keep you near me now  but i shall be near you where you hide your shame there will i hide mine in this world there is nothing left for us but there is another world before youif you can repent of your sin this too he said very sternly standing somewhat away from her and frowning the while with those gloomy eyebrows sad as was her condition he might have given her solace could he have taken her by the hand and kissed her peregrine orme would have done so or augustus staveley could it have been possible that they should have found themselves in that position though lucius mason could not do so he was not less just than they and it may be not less loving in his heart he could devote himself for his mothers sake as absolutely as could they but to some is given and to some is denied that cruse of heavenly balm with which all wounds can be assuaged and sore hearts ever relieved of some portion of their sorrow of all the virtues with which man can endow himself surely none other is so odious as that justice which can teach itself to look down upon mercy almost as a vice  i will not ask you to forgive me she said plaintively  mother he answered were i to say that i forgave you my words would be a mockery i have no right either to condemn or to forgive i accept my position as it has been made for me and will endeavour to do my duty  it would have been almost better for her that he should have upbraided her for her wickedness she would then have fallen again prostrate before him if not in body at least in spirit and her weakness would have stood for her in place of strength but now it was necessary that she should hear his words and bear his looksbear them like a heavy burden on her back without absolutely sinking it had been that necessity of bearing and never absolutely sinking which during years past had so tried and tested the strength of her heart and soul seeing that she had not sunk we may say that her strength had been very wonderful  and then she stood up and came close to him but you will give me your hand lucius  yes mother there is my hand i shall stand by you through it all but he did not offer to kiss her and there was still some pride in her heart which would not allow her to ask him for an embrace  and now he said it is time that you should prepare to go mrs orme thinks it better that i should not accompany you  no lucius no you must not hear them proclaim my guilt in court  that would make but little difference but nevertheless i will not go had i known this before i should not have gone there it was to testify my belief in your innocence nay my conviction  oh lucius spare me  well i will speak of it no more i shall be here tonight when you come back  but if they say that i am guilty they will take me away  if so i will come to youin the morning if they will let me but mother in any case i must leave this house tomorrow then again he gave her his hand but he left her without touching her with his lips  when the two ladies appeared in court together without lucius mason there was much question among the crowd as to the cause of his absence both dockwrath and joseph mason looked at it in the right light and accepted it as a ground for renewed hope he dare not face the verdict said dockwrath and yet when they had left the court on the preceding evening after listening to mr furnivals speech their hopes had not been very high dockwrath had not admitted with words that he feared defeat but when mason had gnashed his teeth as he walked up and down his room at alston and striking the table with his clenched fist had declared his fears by heavens they will escape me again dockwrath had not been able to give him substantial comfort the jury are not such fools as to take all that for gospel he had said but he had not said it with that tone of assured conviction which he had always used till mr furnivals speech had been made there could have been no greater attestation to the power displayed by mr furnival than mr masons countenance as he left the court on that evening i suppose it will cost me hundreds of pounds he said to dockwrath that evening orley farm will pay for it all dockwrath had answered but his answer had shown no confidence and if we think well of it joseph mason was deserving of pity he wanted only what was his own and that orley farm ought to be his own he had no smallest doubt mr furnival had not in the least shaken him but he had made him feel that others would be shaken if it could only be left to the judge thought mr mason to himself and then he began to consider whether this british palladium of an unanimous jury had not in it more of evil than of good  young peregrine orme again met his mother at the door of the court and at her instance gave his arm to lady mason mr aram was also there but mr aram had great tact and did not offer his arm to mrs orme contenting himself with making a way for her and walking beside her i am glad that her son has not come today he said not bringing his head suspiciously close to hers but still speaking so that none but she might hear him he has done all the good that he could do and as there is only the judges charge to hear the jury will not notice his absence of course we hope for the best mrs orme but it is doubtful  as felix graham took his place next to chaffanbrass the old lawyer scowled at him turning his red old savage eyes first on him and then from him growling the while so that the whole court might notice it the legal portion of the court did notice it and were much amused good morning mr chaffanbrass said graham quite aloud as he took his seat and then chaffanbrass growled again considering the lights with which he had been lightened there was a species of honesty about mr chaffanbrass which certainly deserved praise he was always true to the man whose money he had taken and gave to his customer with all the power at his command that assistance which he had professed to sell but we may give the same praise to the hired bravo who goes through with truth and courage the task which he has undertaken i knew an assassin in ireland who professed that during twelve years of practice in tipperary he had never failed when he had once engaged himself for truth and honesty to their customerswhich are great virtuesi would bracket that man and mr chaffanbrass together  and then the judge commenced his charge and as he went on with it he repeated all the evidence that was in any way of moment pulling the details to pieces and dividing that which bore upon the subject from that which did not this he did with infinite talent and with a perspicuity beyond all praise but to my thinking it was remarkable that he seemed to regard the witnesses as a dissecting surgeon may be supposed to regard the subjects on which he operates for the advancement of science with exquisite care he displayed what each had said and how the special saying of one bore on that special saying of another but he never spoke of them as though they had been live men and women who were themselves as much entitled to justice at his hands as either the prosecutor in this matter or she who was being prosecuted who indeed if anything were better entitled unless he could show that they were false and suborned for unless they were suborned or false they were there doing a painful duty to the public for which they were to receive no pay and from which they were to obtain no benefit of whom else in that court could so much be said the judge there had his ermine and his canopy his large salary and his seat of honour and the lawyers had their wigs and their own loud voices and their places of precedence the attorneys had their seats and their big tables and the somewhat familiar respect of the tipstaves the jury though not much to be envied were addressed with respect and flattery had their honourable seats and were invariably at least called gentlemen but why should there be no seat of honour for the witnesses to stand in a box to be bawled after by the police to be scowled at and scolded by the judge to be browbeaten and accused falsely by the barristers and then to be condemned as perjurers by the jurythat is the fate of the one person who during the whole trial is perhaps entitled to the greatest respect and is certainly entitled to the most public gratitude let the witness have a big armchair and a canopy over him and a man behind him with a red cloak to do him honour and keep the flies off let him be gently invited to come forward from some inner room where he can sit before a fire then he will be able to speak out making himself heard without scolding and will perhaps be able to make a fair fight with the cocks who can crow so loudly on their own dunghills  the judge in this case did his work with admirable skill blowing aside the froth of mr furnivals eloquence and upsetting the sophistry and false deductions of mr chaffanbrass the case for the jury as he said hung altogether upon the evidence of kenneby and the woman bolster as far as he could see the evidence of dockwrath had little to do with it and alleged malice and greed on the part of dockwrath could have nothing to do with it the jury might take it as proved that lady mason at the former trial had sworn that she had been present when her husband signed the codicil and had seen the different signatures affixed to it they might also take it as proved that that other deedthe deed purporting to close a partnership between sir joseph mason and mr martockhad been executed on the 14th of july and that it had been signed by sir joseph and also by those two surviving witnesses kenneby and bolster the question therefore for the consideration of the jury had narrowed itself to this had two deeds been executed by sir joseph mason both bearing the same date if this had not been done and if that deed with reference to the partnership were a true deed then must the other be false and fraudulent and if false and fraudulent then must lady mason have sworn falsely and been guilty of that perjury with which she was now charged there might perhaps be one loophole to this argument by which an escape was possible though both deeds bore the date of 14th july there might have been error in this it was possible though no doubt singular that that date should have been inserted in the partnership deed and the deed itself be executed afterwards but then the woman bolster told them that she had been called to act as witness but once in her life and if they believed her in that statement the possibility of error as to the date would be of little or no avail on behalf of lady mason for himself he could not say that adequate ground had been shown for charging bolster with swearing falsely no doubt she had been obstinate in her method of giving her testimony but that might have arisen from an honest resolution on her part not to allow herself to be shaken the value of her testimony must however be judged by the jury themselves as regarded kenneby he must say that the man had been very stupid no one who had heard him would accuse him for a moment of having intended to swear falsely but the jury might perhaps think that the testimony of such a man could not be taken as having much value with reference to circumstances which happened more than twenty years since  the charge took over two hours but the substance of it has been stated then the jury retired to consider their verdict and the judge and the barristers and some other jury proceeded to the business of some other and less important trial lady mason and mrs orme sat for a while in their seatsperhaps for a space of twenty minutesand then as the jury did not at once return into court they retired to the sittingroom in which they had first been placed here mr aram accompanied them and here they were of course met by peregrine orme  his lordships charge was very goodvery good indeed said mr aram  was it asked peregrine  and very much in our favour continued the attorney  you think then said mrs orme looking up into his face you think that but she did not know how to go on with her question  yes i do i think we shall have a verdict i do indeed i would not say so before lady mason if my opinion was not very strong the jury may disagree that is not improbable but i cannot anticipate that the verdict will be against us  there was some comfort in this but how wretched was the nature of the comfort did not the attorney in every word which he spoke declare his own conviction of his clients guilt even peregrine orme could not say out boldly that he felt sure of an acquittal because no other verdict could be justly given and then why was not mr furnival there taking his friend by the hand and congratulating her that her troubles were so nearly over mr furnival at this time did not come near her and had he done so what could he have said to her  he and sir richard leatherham left the court together and the latter went at once back to london without waiting to hear the verdict mr chaffanbrass also and felix graham retired from the scene of their labours and as they did so a few words were spoken between them  mr graham said the ancient hero of the old bailey you are too great for this kind of work i take it if i were you i would keep out of it for the future  i am very much of the same way of thinking mr chaffanbrass said the other  if a man undertakes a duty he should do it thats my opinion though i confess its a little old fashioned especially if he takes money for it mr graham and then the old man glowered at him with his fierce eyes and nodded his head and went on what could graham say to him his answer would have been ready enough had there been time or place in which to give it but he had no answer ready which was fit for the crowded hall of the courthouse and so mr chaffanbrass went on his way he will now pass out of our sight and we will say of him that he did his duty well according to his lights  there in that little room sat lady mason and mrs orme till late in the evening and there with them remained peregrine some sort of refreshment was procured for them but of the three days they passed in the court that perhaps was the most oppressive there was no employment for them and then the suspense was terrible that suspense became worse and worse as the hours went on for it was clear that at any rate some of the jury were anxious to give a verdict against her they say that theres eight and four said mr aram at one of the many visits which he made to them but theres no saying how true that may be  eight and four said peregrine  eight to acquit and four for guilty said aram if so were safe at any rate till the next assizes  but it was not fated that lady mason should be sent away from the court in doubt at eight oclock mr aram came to them hot with haste and told them that the jury had sent for the judge the judge had gone home to his dinner but would return to court at once when he heard that the jury had agreed  and must we go into court again said mrs orme  lady mason must do so  then of course i shall go with her are you ready now dear  lady mason was unable to speak but she signified that she was ready and then they went into court the jury were already in the box and as the two ladies took their seats the judge entered but few of the gaslights were lit so that they in the court could hardly see each other and the remaining ceremony did not take five minutes  not guilty my lord said the foreman then the verdict was recorded and the judge went back to his dinner joseph mason and dockwrath were present and heard the verdict i will leave the reader to imagine with what an appetite they returned to their chamber     chapter lxxvi  i love her still   it was all over now and as lucius had said to his mother there was nothing left for them but to go and hide themselves the verdict had reached him before his mothers return and on the moment of his hearing it he sat down and commenced the following letter to mr furnival      orley farm march  18     dear sir     i beg to thank you in my mothers name for your great    exertions in the late trial i must acknowledge that i    have been wrong in thinking that you gave her bad advice    and am now convinced that you acted with the best judgment    on her behalf may i beg that you will add to your great    kindness by inducing the gentlemen who undertook the    management of the case as my mothers attorneys to let    me know as soon as possible in what sum i am indebted to    them     i believe i need trouble you with no preamble as to my    reasons when i tell you that i have resolved to abandon    immediately any title that i may have to the possession of    orley farm and to make over the property at once in any    way that may be most efficacious to my halfbrother    mr joseph mason of groby park i so strongly feel the    necessity of doing this at once without even a days    delay that i shall take my mother to lodgings in london    tomorrow and shall then decide on what steps it may be    best that we shall take my mother will be in possession    of about £200 a year subject to such deduction as the    cost of the trial may make from it     i hope that you will not think that i intrude upon you    too far when i ask you to communicate with my brothers    lawyers on the subject of this surrender i do not know    how else to do it and of course you will understand that    i wish to screen my mothers name as much as may be in my    power with due regard to honesty i hope i need not insist    on the factfor it is a factthat nothing will change    my purpose as to this if i cannot have it done through    you i must myself go to mr round i am moreover aware    that in accordance with strict justice my brother should    have upon me a claim for the proceeds of the estate since    the date of our fathers death if he wishes it i will    give him such claim making myself his debtor by any    form that may be legal he must however in such case    be made to understand that his claim will be against a    beggar but nevertheless it may suit his views to have    such a claim upon me i cannot think that under the    circumstances i should be justified in calling on my    mother to surrender her small income but should you be of    a different opinion it shall be done     i write thus to you at once as i think that not a day    should be lost i will trouble you with another line from    london to let you know what is our immediate address     pray believe me to be    yours faithfully and obliged     lucius mason     t furnival esq    old square lincolns inn fields   as soon as he had completed this letter which was sufficiently good for its purpose and clearly explained what was the writers will on the subject of it he wrote another which i do not think was equally efficacious the second was addressed to miss furnival and being a love letter was not so much within the scope of the writers peculiar powers      dearest sophia     i hardly know how to address you or what i should tell    you or what conceal were we together and was that    promise renewed which you once gave me i should tell you    allbut this i cannot do by letter my mothers trial is    over and she is acquitted but that which i have learned    during the trial has made me feel that i am bound to    relinquish to my brotherinlaw all my title to orley    farm and i have already taken the first steps towards    doing so yes sophia i am now a beggar on the face of    the world i have nothing belonging to me save those    powers of mind and body which god has given me and i am    moreover a man oppressed with a terribly heavy load of    grief for some short time i must hide myself with my    mother and then when i shall have been able to brace    my mind to work i shall go forth and labour in whatever    field may be open to me     but before i go sophia i wish to say a word of farewell    to you that i may understand on what terms we part of    course i make no claim i am aware that that which i now    tell you must be held as giving you a valid excuse for    breaking any contract that there may have been between    us but nevertheless i have hope that i love you very    dearly i need hardly now say and i still venture to think    that the time may come when i shall again prove myself    to be worthy of your hand if you have ever loved me you    cannot cease to do so merely because i am unfortunate and    if you love me still perhaps you will consent to wait if    you will do soif you will say that i am rich in that    respecti shall go to my banishment not altogether a    downcast man     may i say that i am still your own     lucius mason   no he decidedly might not say so but as the letter was not yet finished when his mother and mrs orme returned i will not anticipate matters by giving miss furnivals reply  mrs orme came back that night to orley farm but without the intention of remaining there her task was over and it would be well that she should return to the cleeve her task was over and as the hour must come in which she would leave the mother in the hands of her son the present hour would be as good as any  they again went together to the room which they had shared for the last night or two and there they parted they had not been there long when the sound of wheels was heard on the gravel and mrs orme got up from her seat there is peregrine with the carriage said she  and you are going said lady mason  if i could do you good i would stay said mrs orme  no no of course you must go oh my darling oh my friend and she threw herself into the others arms  of course i will write to you said mrs orme i will do so regularly  may god bless you for ever but it is needless to ask for blessings on such as you you are blessed  and you tooif you will turn to him you will be blessed  ah me well i can try now i feel that i can at any rate try  and none who try ever fail and now dear goodbye  goodbye my angel but mrs orme i have one word i must first say a message that i must send to him tell him this that never in my life have i loved any man as well as i have loved him and as i do love him that on my knees i beg his pardon for the wrong i have done him  but he knows how great has been your goodness to him  when the time came i was not quite a devil to drag him down with me to utter destruction  he will always remember what was your conduct then  but tell him that though i loved him and though i loved you with all my heartwith all my heart i knew through it all as i know now that i was not a fitting friend for him or you no do not interrupt me i always knew it and though it was so sweet to me to see your faces i would have kept away but that he would not have it i came to him to assist me because he was great and strong and he took me to his bosom with his kindness till i destroyed his strength though his greatness nothing can destroy  no no he does not think that you have injured him  but tell him what i say and tell him that a poor bruised broken creature who knows at least her own vileness will pray for him night and morning and now goodbye of my heart towards you i cannot speak  goodbye then and lady mason never despair there is always room for hope and where there is hope there need not be unhappiness  then they parted and mrs orme went down to her son  mother the carriage is here he said  yes i heard it where is lucius goodbye mr mason  god bless you mrs orme believe me i know how good you have been to us  as she gave him her hand she spoke a few words to him my last request to you mr mason is to beg that you will be tender to your mother  i will do my best mrs orme  all her sufferings and your own have come from her great love for you  that i know and feel but had her ambition for me been less it would have been better for both of us and there he stood bareheaded at the door while peregrine orme handed his mother into the carriage thus mrs orme took her last leave of orley farm and was parted from the woman she had loved with so much truth and befriended with so much loyalty  very few words were spoken in the carriage between peregrine and his mother while they were being taken back through hamworth to the cleeve to peregrine the whole matter was unintelligible he knew that the verdict had been in favour of lady mason and yet there had been no signs of joy at orley farm or even of contentment he had heard also from lucius while they had been together for a few minutes that orley farm was to be given up  youll let it i suppose peregrine had asked  it will not be mine to let it will belong to my brother lucius had answered then peregrine had asked no further question nor had lucius offered any further information  but his mother as he knew was worn out with the work she had done and at the present moment he felt that the subject was one which would hardly bear questions so he sat by her side in silence and before the carriage had reached the cleeve his mind had turned away from the cares and sorrows of lady mason and was once more at noningsby after all as he said to himself who could be worse off than he was he had nothing to hope  they found sir peregrine standing in the hall to receive them and mrs orme though she had been absent only three days could not but perceive the havoc which this trial had made upon him it was not that the sufferings of those three days had broken him down but that now after that short absence she was able to perceive how great had been upon him the effect of his previous sufferings he had never held up his head since the day on which lady mason had made to him her first confession up to that time he had stood erect and though as he walked his steps had shown that he was no longer young he had walked with a certain air of strength and manly bearing till lady mason had come to the cleeve no one would have said that sir peregrine looked as though his energy and life had passed away but now as he put his arm round his daughters waist and stooped down to kiss her cheek he was a wornout tottering old man  during these three days he had lived almost altogether alone and had been ashamed to show to those around him the intense interest which he felt in the result of the trial his grandson had on each day breakfasted alone and had left the house before his grandfather was out of his room and on each evening he had returned lateas he now returned with his motherand had dined alone then he had sat with his grandfather for an hour or two and had been constrained to talk over the events of the day without being allowed to ask sir peregrines opinion as to lady masons innocence or to express his own these three days had been dreadful to sir peregrine he had not left the house but had crept about from room to room ever and again taking up some book or paper and putting it down unread as his mind reverted to the one subject which now for him bore any interest on the second of these three days a note had been brought to him from his old friend lord alston dear orme the note had run i am not quite happy as i think of the manner in which we parted the other day if i offended in any degree i send this as a peacemaker and beg to shake your hand heartily let me have a line from you to say that it is all right between us neither you nor i can afford to lose an old friend at our time of life yours always alston but sir peregrine had not answered it lord alstons servant had been dismissed with a promise that an answer should be sent but at the end of the three days it had not yet been written his mind indeed was still sore towards lord alston the counsel which his old friend had given him was good and true but it had been neglected and its very truth and excellence now made the remembrance of it unpalatable he had nevertheless intended to write but the idea of such exertion from hour to hour had become more distressing to him  he had of course heard of lady masons acquittal and indeed tidings of the decision to which the jury had come went through the country very quickly there is a telegraphic wire for such tidings which has been very long in use and which though always used is as yet but very little understood how is it that information will spread itself quicker than men can travel and make its way like water into all parts of the world it was known all through the country that night that lady mason was acquitted and before the next night it was as well known that she had acknowledged her guilt by giving up the property  little could be said as to the trial while peregrine remained in the room with his mother and his grandfather but this he had the tact to perceive and soon left them together i shall see you mother up stairs before you go to bed he said as he sauntered out  but you must not keep her up said his grandfather remember all that she has gone through with this injunction he went off and as he sat alone in his mothers room he tried to come to some resolution as to noningsby he knew he had no ground for hopeno chance as he would have called it and if so would it not be better that he should take himself off nevertheless he would go to noningsby once more he would not be such a coward but that he would wish her goodbye before he went and hear the end of it all from her own lips  when he had left the room lady masons last message was given to sir peregrine poor soul poor soul he said as mrs orme began her story her son knows it all then now  i told him last nightwith her consent so that he should not go into the court today it would have been very bad you know if they hadfound her guilty  yes yes very badvery bad indeed poor creature and so you told him how did he bear it  on the whole well at first he would not believe me  as for me i could not have done it i could not have told him  yes sir you wouldyou would if it had been required of you  i think it would have killed me but a woman can do things for which a mans courage would never be sufficient and he bore it manfully  he was very stern  yesand he will be stern poor souli pity her from my very heart but he will not desert her he will do his duty by her  i am sure he will in that respect he is a good young man  yes my dear he is one of those who seem by nature created to bear adversity no trouble or sorrow would i think crush him but had prosperity come to him it would have made him odious to all around him you were not present when they met  noi thought it better to leave them  yes yes and he will give up the place at once  tomorrow he will do so in that at any rate he has true spirit tomorrow early they will go to london and she i suppose will never see orley farm again and then mrs orme gave sir peregrine that last messagei tell you everything as she told me mrs orme said seeing how deeply he was affected perhaps i am wrong  no no no he said  coming at such a moment her words seemed to be almost sacred  they are sacred they shall be sacred poor soul poor soul  she did a great crime  yes yes  but if a crime can be forgivencan be excused on account of its motives  it cannot my dear nothing can be forgiven on that ground  no we know that we all feel sure of that but yet how can one help loving her for myself i shall love her always  and i also love her and then the old man made his confession i loved her wellbetter than i had ever thought to love any one again but you and perry i loved her very dearly and felt that i should have been proud to have called her my wife how beautiful she was in her sorrow when we thought that her life had been pure and good  and it had been goodfor many years past  no for the stolen property was still there but yet how graceful she was and how well her sorrows sat upon her what might she not have done had the world used her more kindly and not sent in her way that sore temptation she was a woman for a man to have loved to madness  and yet how little can she have known of love  i loved her and as the old man said so he rose to his feet with some show of his old energy i loved herwith all my heart it is foolish for an old man so to say but i did love her nay i love her still but that i knew that it would be wrongfor your sake and for perrys and then he stopped himself as though he would fain hear what she might say to him  yes it is all over now she said in the softest sweetest lowest voice she knew that she was breaking down a last hope but she knew also that that hope was vain and then there was silence in the room for some ten minutes space  it is all over he then said repeating her last words  but you have us stillperry and me can any one love you better than we do and she got up and went over to him and stood by him and leaned upon him  edith my love since you came to my house there has been an angel in it watching over me i shall know that always and when i turn my face to the wall as i soon shall that shall be my last earthly thought and so in tears they parted for that night but the sorrow that was bringing him to his grave came from the love of which he had spoken it is seldom that a young man may die from a broken heart but if an old man have a heart still left to him it is more fragile     chapter lxxvii  john kennebys doom   on the evening but one after the trial was over mr moulder entertained a few friends to supper at his apartments in great st helens and it was generally understood that in doing so he intended to celebrate the triumph of lady mason through the whole affair he had been a strong partisan on her side had expressed a very loud opinion in favour of mr furnival and had hoped that that scoundrel dockwrath would get all that he deserved from the hands of mr chaffanbrass when the hour of mr dockwraths punishment had come he had been hardly contented but the inadequacy of kennebys testimony had restored him to good humour and the verdict had made him triumphant  didnt i know it old fellow he had said slapping his friend snengkeld on the back when such a low scoundrel as dockwrath is pitted against a handsome woman like lady mason hell not find a jury in england to give a verdict in his favour then he asked snengkeld to come to his little supper and kantwise also he invited though kantwise had shown dockwrath tendencies throughout the whole affairbut moulder was fond of kantwise as a butt for his own sarcasm mrs smiley too was asked as was natural seeing that she was the betrothed bride of one of the heroes of the day and moulder in the kindness of his heart swore that he never was proud and told bridget bolster that she would be welcome to take a share of what was going  laws m said mrs moulder when she was told of this a chambermaid from an inn what will mrs smiley say  i aint going to trouble myself with what mother smiley may say or think about my friends if she dont like it she may do the other thing what was she herself when you first knew her  yes moulder but then money do make a difference you know  bridget bolster however was invited and she came in spite of the grandeur of mrs smiley kenneby also of course was there but he was not in a happy frame of mind since that wretched hour in which he had heard himself described by the judge as too stupid to be held of any account by the jury he had become a melancholy misanthropic man the treatment which he received from mr furnival had been very grievous to him but he had borne with that hoping that some word of eulogy from the judge would set him right in the public mind but no such word had come and poor john kenneby felt that the cruel hard world was too much for him he had been with his sister that morning and words had dropped from him which made her fear that he would wish to postpone his marriage for another space of ten years or so brickfields he had said what can such a one as i have to do with landed property i am better as i am  mrs smiley however did not at all seem to think so and welcomed john kenneby back from alston very warmly in spite of the disgrace to which he had been subjected it was nothing to her that the judge had called her future lord a fool nor indeed was it anything to any one but himself according to moulders views it was a matter of course that a witness should be abused for what other purpose was he had into the court but deep in the mind of poor kenneby himself the injurious words lay festering he had struggled hard to tell the truth and in doing so had simply proved himself to be an ass i aint fit to live with anybody else but myself he said to himself as he walked down bishopsgate street  at this time mrs smiley was not yet there bridget had arrived and had been seated in a chair at one corner of the fire mrs moulder occupied one end of a sofa opposite leaving the place of honour at the other end for mrs smiley moulder sat immediately in front of the fire in his own easy chair and snengkeld and kantwise were on each side of him they were of course discussing the trial when mrs smiley was announced and it was well that she made a diversion by her arrival for words were beginning to run high  a jury of her countrymen has found her innocent moulder had said with much heat and any one who says shes guilty after that is a libeller and a coward to my way of thinking if a jury of her countrymen dont make a woman innocent what does  of course shes innocent said snengkeld from the very moment the words was spoken by the foreman if any newspaper was to say she wasnt shed have her action  thats all very well said kantwise looking up to the ceiling with his eyes nearly shut but youll see whatll you bet me mr moulder that joseph mason dont get the property  gammon answered moulder  well it may be gammon but youll see  gentlemen gentlemen said mrs smiley sailing into the room upon my word one hears all you say ever so far down the street  and i didnt care if they heard it right away to the mansion house said moulder we aint talking treason nor yet highway robbery  then mrs smiley was welcomedher bonnet was taken from her and her umbrella and she was encouraged to spread herself out over the sofa oh mrs bolster the witness she said when mrs moulder went through some little ceremony of introduction and from the tone of her voice it appeared that she was not quite satisfied that mrs bolster should be there as a companion for herself  yes maam i was the witness as had never signed but once said bridget getting up and curtsying then she sat down again folding her hands one over the other on her lap  oh indeed said mrs smiley but wheres the other witness mrs moulder hes the one who is a deal more interesting to me ha ha ha but as you all know it here whats the good of not telling the truth ha ha ha  johns here said mrs moulder come john why dont you show yourself  hes just alive and thats about all you can say for him said moulder  why whats there been to kill him said mrs smiley well john i must say youre rather backward in coming forward considering what theres been between us you might have come and taken my shawl im thinking  yes i might said kenneby gloomily i hope i see you pretty well mrs smiley  pretty bobbish thank you only i think it might have been maria between friends like us  hes sadly put about by this trial whispered mrs moulder you know he is so tenderhearted that he cant bear to be put upon like another  but you didnt want her to be found guilty did you john  that im sure he didnt said moulder why it was the way he gave his evidence that brought her off  it wasnt my wish to bring her off said kenneby nor was it my wish to make her guilty all i wanted was to tell the truth and do my duty but it was no use i believe it never is any use  i think you did very well said moulder  im sure lady mason ought to be very much obliged to you said kantwise  nobody neednt care for whats said to them in a court said snengkeld i remember when once they wanted to make out that id taken a parcel of teas  stolen you mean sir suggested mrs smiley  yes stolen but it was only done by the opposite side in court and i didnt think a halfporth of it they knew where the teas was well enough  speaking for myself said kenneby i must say i dont like it  but the paper as we signed said bridget wasnt the old gentlemans willno more than this is and she lifted up her apron im rightly sure of that  then again the battle raged hot and furious and moulder became angry with his guest bridget bolster kantwise finding himself supported in his views by the principal witness at the trial took heart against the tyranny of moulder and expressed his opinion while mrs smiley with a womans customary dislike to another woman sneered illnaturedly at the idea of lady masons innocence poor kenneby had been forced to take the middle seat on the sofa between his bride and sister but it did not appear that the honour of his position had any effect in lessening his gloom or mitigating the severity of the judgment which had been passed on him  wasnt the old gentlemans will said moulder turning on poor bridget in his anger with a growl but i say it was the old gentlemans will you never dared say as much as that in court  i wasnt asked said bridget  you werent asked yes you was asked often enough  ill tell you what it is said kantwise mrs bolsters right in what she says as sure as your names moulder  then as sure as my names moulder shes wrong i suppose were to think that a chap like you knows more about it than the jury we all know who your friend is in the matter i havent forgot our dinner at leeds nor shant in a hurry  now john said mrs smiley nobody can know the truth of this so well as you do youve been as close as wax as was all right till the lady was out of her troubles thats done and over and let us hear among friends how the matter really was and then there was silence among them in order that his words might come forth freely  come my dear said mrs smiley with a tone of encouraging love there cant be any harm now can there  out with it john said moulder youre honest anyways  there aint no gammon about you said snengkeld  mr kenneby can speak if he likes no doubt said kantwise though maybe it maynt be very pleasant to him to do so after all thats come and gone  theres nothing thats come and gone that need make our john hold his tongue said mrs moulder he maynt be just as bright as some of those lawyers but hes a deal more truehearted  but he cant say as how it was the old gentlemans will as we signed im well assured of that said bridget  but kenneby though thus called upon by the united strength of the company to solve all their doubts still remained silent come lovey said mrs smiley putting forth her hand and giving his arm a tender squeeze  if youve anything to say to clear that womans character said moulder you owe it to society to say it because she is a woman and because her enemies is villains and then again there was silence while they waited for him  i think it will go with him to his grave said mrs smiley very solemnly  i shouldnt wonder said snengkeld  then he must give up all idea of taking a wife said moulder  he wont do that im sure said mrs smiley  that he wont will you john said his sister  theres no knowing what may happen to me in this world said kenneby but sometimes i almost think i aint fit to live in it along with anybody else  youll make him fit wont you my dear said mrs moulder  i dont exactly know what to say about it said mrs smiley if mr kenneby aint willing im not the woman to bind him to his word because ive had his promise over and over again and could prove it by a number of witnesses before any jury in the land im an independent woman as neednt be beholden to any man and i should never think of damages smiley left me comfortable before all the world and i dont know but what im a fool to think of changing anyways if mr kenneby  come john why dont you speak to her said mrs moulder  and what am i to say said kenneby thrusting himself forth from between the ample folds of the two ladies dresses im a blighted man one on whom the finger of scorn has been pointed his lordship said that i wasstupid and perhaps i am  she dont think nothing of that john  certainly not said mrs smiley  as long as a man can pay twenty shillings in the pound and a trifle over what does it matter if all the judges in the land was to call him stupid said snengkeld  stupid is as stupid does said kantwise  stupid be d said moulder  mr moulder theres ladies present said mrs smiley  come john rouse yourself a bit said his sister nobody here thinks the worse of you for what the judge said  certainly not said mrs smiley and as it becomes me to speak ill say my mind im accustomed to speak freely before friends and as we are all friends here why should i be ashamed  for the matter of that nobody says you are said moulder  and i dont mean mr moulder why should i i can pay my way and do what i like with my own and has people to mind me when i speak and neednt mind nobody else myselfand thats more than everybody can say heres john kenneby and i is engaged as man and wife he wont say as its not so ill be bound  no said kenneby im engaged i know  when i accepted john kennebys hand and heartand well i remember the beauteous language in which he expressed his feelings and always shalli told him that i respected him as a man that would do his duty by a woman though perhaps he mightnt be so cute in the way of having much to say for himself as some others whats the good said i of a mans talking if so be hes ashamed to meet the baker at the end of the week so i listened to the vows he made me and have considered that he and i was as good as one now that hes been put upon by them lawyers im not the woman to turn my back upon him  that youre not said moulder  no i aint mr moulder and so john theres my hand again and youre free to take it if you like and so saying she put forth her hand almost into his lap  take it john said mrs moulder but poor kenneby himself did not seem to be very quick in availing himself of the happiness offered to him he did raise his right arm slightly but then he hesitated and allowed it to fall again between him and his sister  come john you know you mean it said mrs moulder and then with both her hands she lifted his and placed it bodily within the grasp of mrs smileys which was still held forth to receive it  i know im engaged said kenneby  theres no mistake about it said moulder  there neednt be none said mrs smiley softly blushing and i will say this of myselfas i have been tempted to give a promise im not the woman to go back from my word theres my hand john and i dont care though all the world hears me say so and then they sat hand in hand for some seconds during which poor kenneby was unable to escape from the grasp of his bride elect one may say that all chance of final escape for him was now gone by  but he cant say as how it was the old gentlemens will as we signed said bridget breaking the silence which ensued  and now ladies and gentlemen said kantwise as mrs bolster has come back to that matter ill tell you something that will surprise you my friend mr moulder here who is as hospitable a gentleman as i know anywhere wouldnt just let me speak before  thats gammon kantwise i never hindered you from speaking  how i do hate that word if you knew my aversion mr moulder  i cant pick my words for you old fellow  but what were you going to tell us mr kantwise said mrs smiley  something that will make all your hairs stand on end i think and then he paused and looked round upon them all it was at this moment that kenneby succeeded in getting his hand once more to himself something that will surprise you all or im very much mistaken lady mason has confessed her guilt  he had surprised them all you dont say so exclaimed mrs moulder  confessed her guilt said mrs smiley but what guilt mr kantwise  she forged the will said kantwise  i knew that all along said bridget bolster  im d if i believe it said moulder  you can do as you like about that said kantwise but she has and ill tell you whats more she and young mason have already left orley farm and given it all up into joseph masons hands  but didnt she get a verdict asked snengkeld  yes she got a verdict theres no doubt on earth about that  then its my opinion she cant make herself guilty if she wished it and as for the property she cant give it up the jury has found a verdict and nobody can go beyond that if anybody tries shell have her action against em that was the law as laid down by snengkeld  i dont believe a word of it said moulder dockwrath has told him ill bet a hat that kantwise got it from dockwrath  it turned out that kantwise had received his information from dockwrath but nevertheless there was that in his manner and in the nature of the story as it was told to them that did produce belief moulder for a long time held out but it became clear at last that even he was shaken and now even kenneby acknowledged his conviction that the signature to the will was not his own  i knowd very well that i never did it twice said bridget bolster triumphantly as she sat down to the supper table  i am inclined to think that upon the whole the company in great st helens became more happy as the conviction grew upon them that a great and mysterious crime had been committed which had baffled two courts of law and had at last thrust itself forth into the open daylight through the workings of the criminals conscience when kantwise had completed his story the time had come in which it behoved mrs moulder to descend to the lower regions and give some aid in preparation of the supper during her absence the matter was discussed in every way and on her return when she was laden with good things she found that all the party was contented except moulder and her brother  its a very terrible thing said mrs smiley later in the evening as she sat with her steaming glass of rum and water before her very terrible indeed aint it john i do wish now id gone down and seed her i do indeed dont you mrs moulder  if all this is true i should like just to have had a peep at her  at any rate we shall have pictures of her in all the papers said mrs smiley     chapter lxxviii  the last of the lawyers   i should have done my duty by you mr mason which those men have not and you would at this moment have been the owner of orley farm  it will easily be known that these words were spoken by mr dockwrath and that they were addressed to joseph mason the two men were seated together in mr masons lodgings at alston late on the morning after the verdict had been given and mr dockwrath was speaking out his mind with sufficient freedom on the previous evening he had been content to put up with the misery of the unsuccessful man and had not added any reproaches of his own he also had been cowed by the verdict and the two had been wretched and crestfallen together but the attorney since that had slept upon the matter and had bethought himself that he at any rate would make out his little bill he could show that mr mason had ruined their joint affairs by his adherence to those london attorneys had mr mason listened to the advice of his new adviser all would have been well so at least dockwrath was prepared to declare finding that by so doing he would best pave the way for his own important claim  but mr mason was not a man to be bullied with tame endurance the firm bears the highest name in the profession sir he said and i had just grounds for trusting them  and what has come of your just grounds mr mason where are you thats the question i say that round and crook have thrown you over they have been hand and glove with old furnival through the whole transaction and ill tell you whats more mr mason i told you how it would be from the beginning  ill move for a new trial  a new trial and this a criminal prosecution shes free of you now for ever and orley farm will belong to that son of hers till he chooses to sell it its a pity thats all i did my duty by you in a professional way mr mason and you wont put the loss on my shoulders  ive been robbeddamnably robbed thats all that i know  theres no mistake on earth about that mr mason you have been robbed and the worst of it is the costs will be so heavy youll be going down to yorkshire soon i suppose sir  i dont know where i shall go said the squire of groby not content to be crossquestioned by the attorney from hamworth  because its as well i suppose that we should settle something about the costs before you leave i dont want to press for my money exactly now but i shall be glad to know when im to get it  if you have any claim on me mr dockwrath you can send it to mr round  if i have any claim what do you mean by that sir and i shall send nothing in to mr round i have had quite enough of mr round already i told you from the beginning mr mason that i would have nothing to do with this affair as connected with mr round i have devoted myself entirely to this matter since you were pleased to engage my services at groby park it is not by my fault that you have failed i think mr mason you will do me the justice to acknowledge that and then dockwrath was silent for a moment as though waiting for an answer  i have nothing to say upon the subject mr dockwrath said mason  but by heaven something must be said that wont do at all mr mason i presume you do not think that i have been working like a slave for the last four months for nothing  mr mason was in truth an honest man and did not wish that any one should work on his account for nothingmuch less did he wish that such a one as dockwrath should do so but then on the other side in his present frame of mind he was by no means willing to yield anything to any one i neither deny nor allow your claim mr dockwrath said he but i shall pay nothing except through my regular lawyers you can send your account to me if you please but i shall send it on to mr round without looking at it  oh thats to be the way is it thats your gratitude very well mr mason i shall now know what to do and i think youll find  here mr dockwrath was interrupted by the lodginghouse servant who brought in a note for mr mason it was from mr furnival and the girl who delivered it said that the gentlemans messenger was waiting for an answer  sir said the note      a communication has been made to me this morning on the    part of your brother mr lucius mason which may make    it desirable that i should have an interview with you    if not inconvenient to you i would ask you to meet me    tomorrow morning at eleven oclock at the chambers of    your own lawyer mr round in bedford row i have    already seen mr round and find that he can meet us     i am sir    your very obedient servant     thomas furnival     j mason esq jp    of groby park   mr furnival when he wrote this note had already been over to orley farm and had seen lucius mason he had been at the farm almost before daylight and had come away with the assured conviction that the property must be abandoned by his client  we need not talk about it mr furnival lucius had said it must be so  you have discussed the matter with your mother  no discussion is necessary but she is quite aware of my intention she is prepared to leave the placefor ever  but the income  belongs to my brother joseph mr furnival i think you may understand that the matter is one in which it is necessary that i should act but as to which i trust i may not have to say many words if you cannot arrange this for me i must go to mr round  of course mr furnival did understand it all his client had been acquitted and he had triumphed but he had known for many a long day that the estate did belong of right to mr mason of groby and though he had not suspected that lucius would have been so told he could not be surprised at the result of such telling it was clear to him that lady mason had confessed and that restitution would therefore be made  i will do your bidding said he  and mr furnivalif it be possible spare my mother then the meeting was over and mr furnival returning to hamworth wrote his note to mr joseph mason  mr dockwrath had been interrupted by the messenger in the middle of his threat but he caught the name of furnival as the note was delivered then he watched mr mason as he read it and read it again  if you please sir i was to wait for an answer said the girl  mr mason did not know what answer it would behove him to give he felt that he was among philistines while dealing with all these lawyers and yet he was at a loss in what way to reply to one without leaning upon another look at that he said sulkily handing the note to dockwrath  you must see mr furnival by all means said dockwrath but  but what  in your place i should not see him in the presence of mr roundunless i was attended by an adviser on whom i could rely mr mason having given a few moments consideration to the matter sat himself down and wrote a line to mr furnival saying that he would be in bedford row at the appointed time  i think you are quite right said dockwrath  but i shall go alone said mr mason  oh very well you will of course judge for yourself i cannot say what may be the nature of the communication to be made but if it be anything touching the property you will no doubt jeopardise your own interests by your imprudence  good morning mr dockwrath said mr mason  oh very well good morning sir you shall hear from me very shortly mr mason and i must say that considering everything i do not know that i ever came across a gentleman who behaved himself worse in a peculiar position than you have done in yours and so they parted  punctually at eleven oclock on the following day mr mason was in bedford row mr furnival is with mr round said the clerk and will see you in two minutes then he was shown into the dingy office waitingroom where he sat with his hat in his hand for rather more than two minutes  at that moment mr round was describing to mr furnival the manner in which he had been visited some weeks since by sir peregrine orme of course mr furnival i knew which way the wind blew when i heard that  she must have told him everything  no doubt no doubt at any rate he knew it all  and what did you say to him  i promised to hold my tongueand i kept my promise mat knows nothing about it to this day  the whole history thus became gradually clear to mr furnivals mind and he could understand in what manner that marriage had been avoided mr round also understood it and the two lawyers confessed together that though the woman had deserved the punishment which had come upon her her character was one which might have graced a better destiny and now i suppose my fortunate client may come in said mr round whereupon the fortunate client was released from his captivity and brought into the sittingroom of the senior partner  mr mason mr furnival said the attorney as soon as he had shaken hands with his client you know each other very well by name gentlemen  mr mason was very stiff in his bearing and demeanour but remarked that he had heard of mr furnival before  all the world has heard of him said mr round he hasnt hid his light under a bushel whereupon mr mason bowed not quite understanding what was said to him  mr mason began the barrister i have a communication to make to you very singular in its nature and of great importance it is one which i believe you will regard as being of considerable importance to yourself and which is of still higher moment to mymy friend lady mason  lady mason sir began the other but mr furnival stopped him  allow me to interrupt you mr mason i think it will be better that you should hear me before you commit yourself to any expression as to your relative  she is no relative of mine  but her son is howeverif you will allow me i will go on having this communication to make i thought it expedient for your own sake that it should be done in the presence of your own legal adviser and friend  umph grunted the disappointed litigant  i have already explained to mr round that which i am about to explain to you and he was good enough to express himself as satisfied with the step which i am taking  quite so mr mason mr furnival is behaving and i believe has behaved throughout in a manner becoming the very high position which he holds in his profession  i suppose he has done his best on his side said mason  undoubtedly i haveas i should have done on yours had it so chanced that i had been honoured by holding a brief from your attorneys but the communication which i am going to make now i make not as a lawyer but as a friend mr mason my client lady mason and her son lucius mason are prepared to make over to you the full possession of the estate which they have held under the name of orley farm  the tidings as so given were far from conveying to the sense of the hearer the full information which they bore he heard the words and at the moment conceived that orley farm was intended to come into his hands by some process to which it was thought desirable that he should be brought to agree he was to be induced to buy it or to be bought over from further opposition by some concession of an indefinitely future title but that the estate was to become his at once without purchase and by the mere free will of his hated relatives was an idea that he did not realise  mr furnival he said what future steps i shall take i do not yet know that i have been robbed of my property i am as firmly convinced now as ever but i tell you fairly and i tell mr round so too that i will have no dealings with that woman  your fathers widow sir said mr furnival is an unhappy lady who is now doing her best to atone for the only fault of which i believe her to have been guilty if you were not unreasonable as well as angry you would understand that the proposition which i am now making to you is one which should force you to forgive any injury which she may hitherto have done to you your halfbrother lucius mason has instructed me to make over to you the possession of orley farm these last words mr furnival uttered very slowly fixing his keen grey eyes full upon the face of joseph mason as he did so and then turning round to the attorney he said i presume your client will understand me now  the estate is yours mr mason said round you have nothing to do but to take possession of it  what do you mean said mason turning round upon furnival  exactly what i say your halfbrother lucius surrenders to you the estate  without payment  yes without payment on his doing so you will of course absolve him from all liability on account of the proceeds of the property while in his hands  that will be a matter of course said mr round  then she has robbed me said mason jumping up to his feet by  the will was forged after all  mr mason said mr round if you have a spark of generosity in you you will accept the offer made to you without asking any question by no such questioning can you do yourself any goodnor can you do that poor lady any harm  i knew it was so he said loudly and as he spoke he twice walked the length of the room i knew it was sotwenty years ago i said the same she forged the will i ask you as my lawyer mr rounddid she not forge the will herself  i shall answer no such question mr mason  then by heavens ill expose you if i spend the whole value of the estate in doing it ill expose you and have her punished yet the slippery villain for twenty years she has robbed me  mr mason you are forgetting yourself in your passion said mr furnival what you have to look for now is the recovery of the property but here mr furnival showed that he had not made himself master of joseph masons character  no shouted the angry manno by heaven what i have first to look to is her punishment and that of those who have assisted her i knew she had done itand dockwrath knew it had i trusted him she would now have been in gaol  mr furnival and mr round were both desirous of having the matter quietly arranged and with this view were willing to put up with much the man had been ill used when he declared for the fortieth time that he had been robbed for twenty years they could not deny it when with horrid oaths he swore that that will had been a forgery they could not contradict him when he reviled the laws of his country which had done so much to facilitate the escape of a criminal they had no arguments to prove that he was wrong they bore with him in his rage hoping that a sense of his own selfinterest might induce him to listen to reason but it was all in vain the property was sweet but that sweetness was tasteless when compared to the sweetness of revenge  nothing shall make me tamper with justicenothing said he  but even if it were as you say you cannot do anything to her said round  ill try said mason you have been my attorney and what you know in the matter you are bound to tell and ill make you tell sir  upon my word said round this is beyond bearing mr mason i must trouble you to walk out of my office and then he rang the bell tell mr mat i want to see him but before that younger partner had joined his father joseph mason had gone mat said the old man i dont interfere with you in many things but on this i must insist as long as my name is in the firm mr joseph mason of groby shall not be among our customers  the mans a fool said mr furnival the end of all that will be that two years will go by before he gets his property and in the meantime the house and all about it will go to ruin  in these days there was a delightful family concord between mr furnival and his wife and perhaps we may be allowed to hope that the peace was permanent martha biggs had not been in harley street since we last saw her there and was now walking round red lion square by the hour with some kindred spirit complaining bitterly of the return which had been made for her friendship what i endured and what i was prepared to endure for that woman no breathing creature can ever know said martha biggs to that other martha and now  i suppose the fact is he dont like to see you there said the other  and is that a reason said our martha had i been in her place i would not have put my foot in his house again till i was assured that my friend should be as welcome there as myself but then perhaps my ideas of friendship may be called romantic  but though there were heartburnings and war in red lion square there was sweet peace in harley street mrs furnival had learned that beyond all doubt lady mason was an unfortunate woman on whose behalf her husband was using his best energies as a lawyer and though rumours had begun to reach her that were very injurious to the ladys character she did not on that account feel animosity against her had lady mason been guilty of all the sins in the calendar except one mrs furnival could find it within her heart to forgive her  but sophia was now more interested about lady mason than was her mother and during those days of the trial was much more eager to learn the news as it became known she had said nothing to her mother about lucius nor had she said anything as to augustus staveley miss furnival was a lady who on such subjects did not want the assistance of a mothers counsel then early on the morning that followed the trial they heard the verdict and knew that lady mason was free  i am so glad said mrs furnival and i am sure it was your papas doing  but we will hope that she was really innocent said sophia  oh yes of course and so i suppose she was i am sure i hope so but nevertheless we all know that it was going very much against her  i believe papa never thought she was guilty for a moment  i dont know my dear your papa never talks of the clients for whom he is engaged but what a thing it is for lucius he would have lost every acre of the property  yes its a great thing for him certainly and then she began to consider whether the standing held by lucius mason in the world was not even yet somewhat precarious  it was on the same dayin the eveningthat she received her lovers letter she was alone when she read it and she made herself quite master of its contents before she sat herself to think in what way it would be expedient that she should act i am bound to relinquish to my brotherinlaw my title to orley farm why should he be so bound unless and then she also came to that conclusion which mr round had reached and which joseph mason had reached when they heard that the property was to be given up yes sophia i am a beggar the letter went on to say she was very sorry deeply sorryso at least she said to herself as she sat there alone she took out her handkerchief and pressed it to her eyes then having restored it to her pocket after moderate use she refolded her letter and put that into the same receptacle  papa said she that evening what will mr lucius mason do now will he remain at orley farm  no my dear he will leave orley farm and i think will go abroad with his mother  and who will have orley farm  his brother joseph i believe  and what will lucius have  i cannot say i do not know that he will have anything his mother has an income of her own and he i suppose will go into some profession  oh indeed is not that very sad for him poor fellow in answer to which her father made no remark  that night in her own room she answered her lovers letter and her answer was as follows      harley street march 18     my dear mr mason     i need hardly tell you that i was grieved to the heart by    the tidings conveyed in your letter i will not ask you    for that secret which you withhold from me feeling that    i have no title to inquire into it nor will i attempt to    guess at the cause which induces you to give up to your    brother the property which you were always taught to    regard as your own that you are actuated by noble motives    i am sure and you may be sure of this that i shall    respect you quite as highly in your adversity as i have    ever done in your prosperity that you will make your way    in the world i shall never doubt and it may be that the    labour which you will now encounter will raise you to    higher standing than any you could have achieved had the    property remained in your possession     i think you are right in saying with reference to our    mutual regard for each other that neither should be    held as having any claim upon the other under present    circumstances any such claim would be very silly nothing    would hamper you in your future career so much as a long    marriage engagement and for myself i am aware that the    sorrow and solicitude thence arising would be more than i    could support apart from this also i feel certain that    i should never obtain my fathers sanction for such an    engagement nor could i make it unless he sanctioned it    i feel so satisfied that you will see the truth of this    that i need not trouble you and harass my own heart by    pursuing the subject any further     my feelings of friendship for youof affectionate    friendshipwill be as true as ever i shall look to your    future career with great hope and shall hear of your    success with the utmost satisfaction and i trust that    the time may come at no very distant date when we may    all welcome your return to london and show you that our    regard for you has never been diminished     may god bless and preserve you in the trials which are    before you and carry you through them with honour and    safety wherever you may be i shall watch for tidings of    you with anxiety and always hear them with gratification    i need hardly bid you remember that you have no more    affectionate friend     than yours always most sincerely     sophia furnival     psi believe that a meeting between us at the present    moment would only cause pain to both of us it might drive    you to speak of things which should be wrapped in silence    at any rate i am sure that you will not press it on me   lucius when he received this letter was living with his mother in lodgings near finsbury circus and the letter had been redirected from hamworth to a postoffice in that neighbourhood it was his intention to take his mother with him to a small town on one of the rivers that feed the rhine and there remain hidden till he could find some means by which he might earn his bread he was sitting with her in the evening with two dull tallow candles on the table between them when his messenger brought the letter to him he read it in silence very deliberately then crushed it in his hand and threw it from him with violence into the fire  i hope there is nothing further to distress you lucius said his mother looking up into his face as though she were imploring his confidence  no nothing nothing that matters it is an affair quite private to myself  sir peregrine had spoken with great truth when he declared that lucius mason was able to bear adversity this last blow had now come upon him but he made no wailings as to his misery nor did he say a word further on the subject his mother watched the paper as the flame caught it and reduced it to an ash but she asked no further question she knew that her position with him did not permit of her asking or even hoping for his confidence  i had no right to expect it would be otherwise he said to himself but even to himself he spoke no word of reproach against miss furnival he had realised the circumstances by which he was surrounded and had made up his mind to bear their result  as for miss furnival we may as well declare here that she did not become mrs staveley our old friend augustus conceived that he had received a sufficient answer on the occasion of his last visit to harley street and did not repeat it immediately such little scenes as that which took place there had not been uncommon in his life and when in after months he looked back upon the affair he counted it up as one of those miraculous escapes which had marked his career     chapter lxxix  farewell   that letter you got this morning my dear was it not from lady mason  it was from lady mason father they go on thursday  on thursday so soon as that and then sir peregrine who had asked the question remained silent for a while the letter according to the family custom had been handed to mrs orme over the breakfasttable but he had made no remark respecting it till they were alone together and free from the servants it had been a farewell letter full of love and gratitude and full also of repentance lady mason had now been for three weeks in london and once during that time mrs orme had gone up to visit her she had then remained with her friend for hours greatly to lady masons comfort and now this letter had come bringing a last adieu  illustration farewell  you may read it sir if you like said mrs orme handing him the letter it was evident by his face that he was gratified by the privilege and he read it not once only but over and over again as he did so he placed himself in the shade and sat with his back to mrs orme but nevertheless she could see that from time to time he rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand and gradually raised his handkerchief to his face  thank you dearest he said as he gave the letter back to her  i think that we may forgive her now even all that she has done said mrs orme  yesyesyes he answered for myself i forgave her from the first  i know you did but as regards the propertyit has been given up now and then again they were silent  edith he said after a while i have forgiven her altogether to me she is the same as though she had never done that deed are we not all sinners  surely father  and can i say because she did one startling thing that the total of her sin is greater than mine was i ever tempted as she was tempted was my youth made dangerous for me as was hers and then she did nothing for herself she did it all for another we may think of that now  i have thought of it always  it did not make the sin the less but among her fellowmortals and then he stopped himself wanting words to express his meaning the sin till it was repented was damning but now that it was repented he could almost love the sinner for the sin  edith he said again and he looked at her so wishfully she knew well what was the working of his heart and she knew also that she did not dare to encourage him  i trust said mrs orme that she will bear her present lot for a few years and then perhaps  ah then i shall be in my grave a few months will do that  oh sir  why should i not save her from such a life as that  from that which she had most to fear she has been saved  had she not so chosen it herself she could now have demanded from me a home why should i not give it to her now  a home here sir  yeswhy not but i know what you would say it would be wrongto you and perry  it would be wrong to yourself sir think of it father it is the fact that she did that thing we may forgive her but others will not do so on that account it would not be right that you should bring her here  sir peregrine knew that it would not be right though he was old and weak in body and infirm in purpose his judgment had not altogether left him he was well aware that he would offend all social laws if he were to do that which he contemplated and ask the world around him to respect as lady ormeas his wife the woman who had so deeply disgraced herself but yet he could hardly bring himself to confess that it was impossible he was as a child who knows that a coveted treasure is beyond his reach but still covets it still longs for it hoping against hope that it may yet be his own it seemed to him that he might yet regain his old vitality if he could wind his arm once more about her waist and press her to his side and call her his own it would be so sweet to forgive her to make her sure that she was absolutely forgiven to teach her that there was one at least who would not bring up against her her past sin even in his memory as for his grandson the property should be abandoned to him altogether twas thus he argued with himself but yet as he argued he knew that it could not be so  i was harsh to her when she told me he said after another pausecruelly harsh  she does not think so  no if i had spurned her from me with my foot she would not have thought so she had condemned herself and therefore i should have spared her  but you did spare her i am sure she feels that from the first to the last your conduct to her has been more than kind  and i owed her more than kindness for i loved heryes i loved her and i do love her though i am a feeble old man tottering to my grave yet i love herlove her as that boy loves the fair girl for whom he longs he will overcome it and forget it and some other one as fair will take her place but for me it is all over  what could she say to him in truth it was all oversuch love at least as that of which his old heart was dreaming in its dotage there is no medeas caldron from which our limbs can come out young and fresh and it were well that the heart should grow old as does the body  it is not all over while we are with you she said caressing him but she knew that what she said was a subterfuge  yes yes i have you dearest he answered but he also knew that that pretence at comfort was false and hollow  and she starts on thursday he said on next thursday  yes on thursday it will be much better for her to be away from london while she is there she never ventures even into the street  edith i shall see her before she goes  will that be wise sir  perhaps not it may be foolishvery foolish but still i shall see her i think you forget edith that i have never yet bidden her farewell i have not spoken to her since that day when she behaved so generously  i do not think that she expects it father  no she expects nothing for herself had it been in her nature to expect such a visit i should not have been anxious to make it i will go tomorrow she is always at home you say  yes she is always at home  and lucius  you will not find him there in the daytime  i shall go tomorrow dear you need not tell peregrine  mrs orme still thought that he was wrong but she had nothing further to say she could not hinder his going and therefore with his permission she wrote a line to lady mason telling her of his purpose and then with all the care in her power and with infinite softness of manner she warned him against the danger which she so much feared what might be the result if overcome by tenderness he should again ask lady mason to become his wife mrs orme firmly believed that lady mason would again refuse but nevertheless there would be danger  no said he i will not do that when i have said so you may accept my word then she hastened to apologise to him but he assured her with a kiss that he was in nowise angry with her  he held by his purpose and on the following day he went up to london there was nothing said on the matter at breakfast nor did she make any further endeavour to dissuade him he was infirm but still she knew that the actual fatigue would not be of a nature to injure him indeed her fear respecting him was rather in regard to his staying at home than to his going abroad it would have been well for him could he have been induced to think himself fit for more active movement  lady mason was alone when he reached the dingy little room near finsbury circus and received him standing she was the first to speak and this she did before she had even touched his hand she stood to meet him with her eyes turned to the ground and her hands tightly folded together before her sir peregrine she said i did not expect from you this mark of yourkindness  of my esteem and affection lady mason he said we have known each other too well to allow of our parting without a word i am an old man and it will probably be for ever  then she gave him her hand and gradually lifted her eyes to his face yes she said it will be for ever there will be no coming back for me  nay nay we will not say that thats as may be hereafter but it will not be at once it had better not be quite at once edith tells me that you go on thursday  yes sir we go on thursday  she had still allowed her hand to remain in his but now she withdrew it and asked him to sit down lucius is not here she said he never remains at home after breakfast he has much to settle as to our journey and then he has his lawyers to see  sir peregrine had not at all wished to see lucius mason but he did not say so you will give him my regards he said and tell him that i trust that he may prosper  thank you i will do so it is very kind of you to think of him  i have always thought highly of him as an excellent young man  and he is excellent where is there any one who could suffer without a word as he suffers no complaint ever comes from him and yeti have ruined him  no no he has his youth his intellect and his education if such a one as he cannot earn his bread in the worlday and more than his breadwho can do so nothing ruins a young man but ignorance idleness and depravity  nothingunless those of whom he should be proud disgrace him before the eyes of the world sir peregrine i sometimes wonder at my own calmness i wonder that i can live but believe me that never for a moment do i forget what i have done i would have poured out for him my blood like water if it would have served him but instead of that i have given him cause to curse me till the day of his death though i still live and eat and sleep i think of that always the remembrance is never away from me they bid those who repent put on sackcloth and cover themselves with ashes that is my sackcloth and it is very sore those thoughts are ashes to me and they are very bitter between my teeth  he did not know with what words to comfort her it all was as she said and he could not bid her even try to free herself from that sackcloth and from those ashes it must be so were it not so with her she would not have been in any degree worthy of that love which he felt for her god tempers the wind to the shorn lamb he said  yes she said for the shorn lamb and then she was silent again but could that bitter biting wind be tempered for the shewolf who in the dead of night had broken into the fold and with prowling steps and cunning clutch had stolen the fodder from the sheep that was the question as it presented itself to her but she sat silent and refrained from putting it into words she sat silent but he read her heart for the shorn lamb she had said and he had known her thoughts as they followed quick one upon another through her mind mary he said seating himself now close beside her on the sofa if his heart be as true to you as mine he will never remember these things against you  it is my memory not his that is my punishment she said  why could he not take her home with him and comfort her and heal that festering wound and stop that everrunning gush of her hearts blood but he could not he had pledged his word and pawned his honour all the comfort that could be his to bestow must be given in those few minutes that remained to him in that room and it must be given too without falsehood he could not bring himself to tell her that the sackcloth need not be sore to her poor lacerated body nor the ashes bitter between her teeth he could not tell her that the cup of which it was hers to drink might yet be pleasant to the taste and cool to the lips what could he tell her of the only source of true comfort others he knew had spokenothers who had not spoken in vain he could not now take up that matter and press it on her with available strength for him there was but one thing to say he had forgiven her he still loved her he would have cherished her in his bosom had it been possible he was a weak old foolish man and there was nothing of which he could speak but of his own heart  mary he said again taking her hand i wishi wish that i could comfort you  and yet on you also have i brought trouble and miseryandall but disgrace  no my love no neither misery nor disgraceexcept this misery that i shall be no longer near to you yes i will tell you all now were i alone in the world i would still beg you to go back with me  it cannot be it could not possibly be so  no for i am not alone she who loves you so well has told me so it must not be but that is the source of my misery i have learned to love you too well and do not know how to part with you if this had not been so i would have done all that an old man might to comfort you  but it has been so she said i cannot wash out the past knowing what i did of myself sir peregrine i should never have put my foot over your threshold  i wish i might hear its step again upon my floors i wish i might hear that light step once again  never sir peregrine no one again ever shall rejoice to hear either my step or my voice or to see my form or to grasp my hand the world is over for me and may god soon grant me relief from my sorrow but to youin return for your goodness  for my love  in return for your love what am i to say i could have loved you with all my heart had it been so permitted nay i did do so had that dream been carried out i should not have sworn falsely when i gave you my hand i bade her tell you so from me when i parted with her  she did tell me  i have known but little love hesir josephwas my master rather than my husband he was a good master and i served him trulyexcept in that one thing but i never loved him but i am wrong to talk of this and i will not talk of it longer may god bless you sir peregrine it will be well for both of us now that you should leave me  may god bless you mary and preserve you and give back to you the comforts of a quiet spirit and a heart at rest till you hear that i am under the ground you will know that there is one living who loves you well then he took her in his arms twice kissed her on the forehead and left the room without further speech on either side  illustration farewell  lady mason as soon as she was alone sat herself down and her thoughts ran back over the whole course of her life early in her days when the world was yet beginning to her she had done one evil deed and from that time up to those days of her trial she had been the victim of one incessant struggle to appear before the world as though that deed had not been doneto appear innocent of it before the world but beyond all things innocent of it before her son for twenty years she had striven with a labour that had been all but unendurable and now she had failed and every one knew her for what she was such had been her life and then she thought of the life which might have been hers in her earlier days she had known what it was to be poor and had seen and heard those battles after money which harden our hearts and quench the poetry of our natures but it had not been altogether so with her had things gone differently with her it might afterwards have been said that she had gone through the fire unscathed but the beast had set his foot upon her and when the temptation came it was too much for her not for herself would she have sinned or have robbed that old man who had been to her a kind master but when a child was born to her her eyes were blind and she could not see that wealth ill gotten for her child would be as sure a curse as wealth ill gotten for herself she remembered rebekah and with the cunning of a second rebekah she filched a worlds blessing for her baby now she thought of all this as pictures of that life which might have been hers passed before her minds eye  and they were pleasant pictures had they not burnt into her very soul as she looked at them how sweet had been that drawingroom at the cleeve as she sat there in luxurious quiet with her new friend how sweet had been that friendship with a woman pure in all her thoughts graceful to the eye and delicate in all her ways she knew now as she thought of this that to her had been given the power to appreciate such delights as these how full of charm to her would have been that life in which there had been so much of true innocent affectionhad the load ever been absent from her shoulders and then she thought of sir peregrine with his pleasant ancient manner and truth of heart and told herself that she could have been happy with the love of even so old a man as thathad that burden been away from her but the burden had never been awaynever could be away then she thought once more of her stern but just son and as she bowed her head and kissed the rod she prayed that her release might come to her soon  and now we will say farewell to her and as we do so the chief interest of our tale will end i may perhaps be thought to owe an apology to my readers in that i have asked their sympathy for a woman who had so sinned as to have placed her beyond the general sympathy of the world at large if so i tender my apology and perhaps feel that i should confess a fault but as i have told her story that sympathy has grown upon myself till i have learned to forgive her and to feel that i too could have regarded her as a friend of her future life i will not venture to say anything but no lesson is truer than that which teaches us to believe that god does temper the wind to the shorn lamb to how many has it not seemed at some one period of their lives that all was over for them and that to them in their afflictions there was nothing left but to die and yet they have lived to laugh again to feel that the air was warm and the earth fair and that god in giving them everspringing hope had given everything how many a sun may seem to set on an endless night and yet rising again on some morrow      he tricks his beams and with new spangled ore     flames in the forehead of the morning sky   for lady mason let us hope that the day will come in which she also may once again trick her beams in some modest unassuming way and that for her the morning may even yet be sweet with a glad warmth for us here in these pages it must be sufficient to say this last kindly farewell  as to lucius mason and the arrangement of his affairs with his stepbrother a very few concluding words will suffice when joseph mason left the office of messrs round and crook he would gladly have sacrificed all hope of any eventual pecuniary benefit from the possession of orley farm could he by doing so have secured the condign punishment of her who had so long kept him out of his inheritance but he soon found that he had no means of doing this in the first place he did not know where to turn for advice he had quarrelled absolutely with dockwrath and though he now greatly distrusted the rounds he by no means put implicit trust in him of hamworth of the rounds he suspected that they were engaged to serve his enemy of dockwrath he felt sure that he was anxious only to serve himself under these circumstances he was driven into the arms of a third attorney and learned from him after a delay that cut him to the soul that he could take no further criminal proceeding against lady mason it would be impossible to have her even indicted for the forgeryseeing that two juries at the interval of twenty years had virtually acquitted herunless new evidence which should be absolute and positive in its kind should be forthcoming but there was no new evidence of any kind the offer made to surrender the property was no evidence for a jury whatever it might be in the mind of the world at large  and what am i to do asked mason  take the goods the gods provide you said the attorney accept the offer which your halfbrother has very generously made you  generously shouted mason of groby  well on his part it is generous it is quite within his power to keep it and were he to do so no one would say he was wrong why should he judge his mother  then mr joseph mason went to another attorney but it was of no avail the time was passing away and he learned that lady mason and lucius had actually started for germany in his agony for revenge he had endeavoured to obtain some legal order that should prevent her departurene exeat regno as he repeated over and over again to his advisers learned in the law but it was of no avail lady mason had been tried and acquitted and no judge would interfere  we should soon have her back again you know if we had evidence of forgery said the last attorney  then by  we will have her back again said mason  but the threat was vain nor could he get any one even to promise him that she could be prosecuted and convicted and by degrees the desire for vengeance slackened as the desire for gain resumed its sway many men have threatened to spend a property upon a lawsuit who have afterwards felt grateful that their threats were made abortive and so it was with mr mason after remaining in town over a month he took the advice of the first of those new lawyers and allowed that gentleman to put himself in communication with mr furnival the result was that by the end of six months he again came out of yorkshire to take upon himself the duties and privileges of the owner of orley farm  and then came his great fight with dockwrath which in the end ruined the hamworth attorney and cost mr mason more money than he ever liked to confess dockwrath claimed to be put in possession of orley farm at an exceedingly moderate rent as to the terms of which he was prepared to prove that mr mason had already entered into a contract with him mr mason utterly ignored such contract and contended that the words contained in a certain note produced by dockwrath amounted only to a proposition to let him the land in the event of certain circumstances and resultswhich circumstances and results never took place  this lawsuit mr joseph mason did win and mr samuel dockwrath was as i have said ruined what the attorney did to make it necessary that he should leave hamworth i do not know but miriam his wife is now the mistress of that lodginghouse to which her own mahogany furniture was so ruthlessly removed     chapter lxxx  showing how affairs settled themselves at noningsby   we must now go back to noningsby for one concluding chapter and then our work will be completed you are not to go away from noningsby when the trial is over you know mamma said that i had better tell you so it was thus that madeline had spoken to felix graham as he was going out to the judges carriage on the last morning of the celebrated great orley farm case and as she did so she twisted one of her little fingers into one of his buttonholes this she did with a prettiness of familiarity and the assumption of a right to give him orders and hold him to obedience which was almost intoxicating in its sweetness and why should she not be familiar with him why should she not hold him to obedience by his buttonhole was he not her own had she not chosen him and taken him up to the exclusion of all other such choosings and takings  i shall not go till you send me he said putting up his hand as though to protect his coat and just touching her fingers as he did so  mamma says it will be stupid for you in the mornings but it will not be worse for you than for augustus he stays till after easter  and i shall stay till after whitsuntide unless i am turned out  oh but you will be turned out i am not going to make myself answerable for any improper amount of idleness papa says you have got all the law courts to reform  there must be a double hercules for such a set of stables as that said felix and then with the slight ceremony to which i have before adverted he took his leave for the day  i suppose there will be no use in delaying it said lady staveley on the same morning as she and her daughter sat together in the drawingroom they had already been talking over the new engagement by the hour together but that is a subject on which mothers with marriageable daughters never grow tired as all mothers and marriageable daughters know full well  oh mamma i think it must be delayed  but why my love mr graham has not said so  you must call him felix mamma im sure its a nice name  very well my dear i will  no he has said nothing yet but of course he means to wait tilltill it will be prudent  men never care for prudence of that kind when they are really in loveand im sure he is  is he mamma  he will marry on anything or nothing and if you speak to him he tells you of how the young ravens were fed but he always forgets that hes not a young raven himself  now youre only joking mamma  indeed im quite in earnest but i think your papa means to make up an income for youonly you must not expect to be rich  i do not want to be rich i never did  i suppose you will live in london and then you can come down here when the courts are up i do hope he wont ever want to take a situation in the colonies  who felix why should he go to the colonies  they always dothe clever young barristers who marry before they have made their way that would be very dreadful i really think it would kill me  oh mamma he shant go to any colony  to be sure there are the county courts now and they are better i suppose you wouldnt like to live at leeds or merthyrtydvil  of course i shall live wherever he goes but i dont know why you should send him to merthyrtydvil  those are the sort of places they do go to there is young mrs bright newdegateshe had to go to south shields and her babies are all dreadfully delicate she lost two you know i do think the lord chancellor ought to think about that reigate or maidstone or anywhere about great marlow would not be so bad and in this way they discussed the coming event and the happy future while felix himself was listening to the judges charge and thinking of his clients guilt  then there were two or three days passed at noningsby of almost unalloyed sweetness it seemed that they had all agreed that prudence should go by the board and that love with sweet promises and hopes bright as young trees in spring should have it all her own way judge staveley was a man who on such an occasionknowing with whom he had to dealcould allow ordinary prudence to go by the board there are men and excellent men too from whose minds the cares of life never banish themselves who never seem to remember that provision is made for the young ravens they toil and spin always thinking sternly of the worst and rarely hoping for the best they are ever making provision for rainy days as though there were to be no more sunshine so anxious are they for their children that they take no pleasure in them and their fear is constant that the earth will cease to produce her fruits of such was not the judge dulce est desipere in locis he would say and let the opportunities be frequent and the occasions many such a lovemaking opportunity as this surely should be one  so graham wandered about through the dry march winds with his future bride by his side and never knew that the blasts came from the pernicious east and she would lean on his arm as though he had been the friend of her earliest years listening to and trusting him in all things that little finger as they stood together would get up to his buttonhole and her bright frank eyes would settle themselves on his and then her hand would press closely upon his arm and he knew that she was neither ashamed nor afraid of her love her love to her was the same as her religion when it was once acknowledged by her to be a thing good and trustworthy all the world might know it was it not a glory to her that he had chosen her and why should she conceal her glory had it been that some richer greater man had won her lovesome one whose titles were known and high place in the world approvedit may well be that then she would have been less free with him  papa would like it best if you would give up your writing and think of nothing but the law she said to him in answer to which he told her with many compliments to the special fox in question that story of the fox who had lost his tail and thought it well that other foxes should dress themselves as he was dressed  at any rate papa looks very well without his tail said madeline with somewhat of a daughters pride but you shall wear yours all the same if you like it she added with much of a young maidens love  as they were thus walking near the house on the afternoon of the third or fourth day after the trial one of the maids came to them and told madeline that a gentleman was in the house who wished to see her  a gentleman said madeline  mr orme miss my lady told me to ask you up if you were anywhere near  i suppose i must go said madeline from whom all her pretty freedom of manner and light happiness of face departed on the moment she had told felix everything as to poor peregrine in return for that story of his respecting mary snow to her it seemed as though that had made things equal between themfor she was too generous to observe that though she had given nothing to her other lover felix had been engaged for many months to marry his other love but girls i think have no objection to this they do not desire first fruits or even early fruits as men do indeed i am not sure whether experience on the part of a gentleman in his use of his heart is not supposed by most young ladies to enhance the value of the article madeline was not in the least jealous of mary snow but with great good nature promised to look after her and patronise her when she should have become mrs albert fitzallen but i dont think i should like that mrs thomas she said  you would have mended the stockings for her all the same  o yes i would have done thatand so did miss snow but i would have kept my box locked she should never have seen my letters  it was now absolutely necessary that she should return to the house and say to peregrine orme what words of comfort might be possible for her if she could have spoken simply with her heart she would have said much that was friendly even though it might not be comfortable but it was necessary that she should express herself in words and she felt that the task was very difficult will you come in she said to felix  no i think not but hes a splendid fellow and to me was a stanch friend if i can catch him as he comes out i will speak to him and then madeline with hesitating steps with her hat still on her head and her gloves on her hands walked through the hall into the drawingroom there she found her mother seated on the sofa and peregrine orme standing before her madeline walked up to him with extended hand and a kindly welcome though she felt that the colour was high in her cheeks of course it would be impossible to come out from such an interview as this without having confessed her position or hearing it confessed by her mother in her presence that however had been already done and peregrine knew that the prize was gone  how do you do miss staveley said he as i am going to leave the cleeve for a long time i have come over to say goodbye to lady staveleyand to you  are you going away mr orme  yes i shall go abroadto central africa i think it seems a wild sort of place with plenty of animals to kill  but isnt it very dangerous  no i dont think so the people always come back alive ive a sort of idea that nothing will kill me at any rate i couldnt stay here  madeline dear ive told mr orme that you have accepted mr graham with a friend such as he is i know that you will not be anxious to keep this a secret  no mamma  i was sure of that and now that your papa has consented to it and that it is quite fixed i am sure that it is better that he should know it we shall always look upon him as a very dear friendif he will allow us  then it was necessary that peregrine should speak which he did as follows holding madelines hand for the first three or four seconds of the timemiss staveley i will say this of myself that if ever a fellow loved a girl truly i loved youand i do so now as well or better than ever it is no good my pretending to be contented and all that sort of thing i am not contented but very unhappy i have never wished for but one thing in my life and for that i would have given all that i have in the world i know that i cannot have it and that i am not fit to have it  oh mr orme it is not that  but it is that i knew you before graham did and loved you quite as soon i believethough of course i dont mean to ask any questionsbut i believe i told you so before he ever did  marriages they say are planned in heaven said lady staveley  perhaps they are i only wish this one had not been planned there i cannot help iti cannot express my satisfaction though i will heartily wish for your happiness i knew from the first how it would be and was always sure that i was a fool to love you i should have gone away when i first thought of it for i used to feel that you never cared to speak to me  oh indeed i did said poor madeline  no you did not and why should you when i had nothing to say for myself i ought to have fallen in love with some foolish chit with as little wit about her as i have myself  i hope you will fall in love with some very nice girl said lady staveley and that we shall know her and love her very much  oh i dare say i shall marry some day i feel now as though i should like to break my neck but i dont suppose i shall goodbye lady staveley  goodbye mr orme and may god send that you may be happy  goodbye madeline i shall never call you so againexcept to myself i do wish you may be happyi do indeed as for himhe has been before me and taken away all that i wanted to win  by this time the tears were in his eyes and his voice was not free from their effect of this he was aware and therefore pressing her hand he turned upon his heel and abruptly left the room he had been unable to say that he wished also that felix might be happy but this omission was forgiven him by both the ladies poor madeline as he went muttered a kind farewell but her tears had mastered her also so that she could hardly speak  he went directly to the stables there got upon his horse and then walked slowly down the avenue towards the gate he had got the better of that tearcompelling softness as soon as he found himself beyond the presence of the girl he loved and was now stern in his mood striving to harden his heart he had confessed himself a fool in comparison with felix graham but yethe asked himselfin spite of that was it not possible that he would have made her a better husband than the other it was not to his title or his estate that he trusted as he so thought but to a feeling that he was more akin to her in circumstances in ways of life and in tenderness of heart as all this was passing through his mind felix graham presented himself to him in the road  orme said he i heard that you were in the house and have come to shake hands with you i suppose you have heard what has taken place will you not shake hands with me  no said peregrine i will not  i am sorry for that for we were good friends and i owe you much for your kindness it was a fair standup fight and you should not be angry  i am angry and i dont want your friendship go and tell her that i say so if you like  no i will not do that  i wish with all my heart that we had both killed ourselves at that bank  for shame orme for shame  very well sir let it be for shame and then he passed on meaning to go through the gate and leaving graham on the grass by the roadside but before he had gone a hundred yards down the road his better feelings came back upon him and he returned  i am unhappy he said and sore at heart you must not mind what words i spoke just now  no no i am sure you did not mean them said felix putting his hand on the horses mane  i did mean them then but i do not mean them now i wont say anything about wishes of course you will be happy with her anybody would be happy with her i suppose you wont die and give a fellow another chance  not if i can help it said graham  well if you are to live i dont wish you any evil i do wish you hadnt come to noningsby thats all goodbye to you and he held out his hand which graham took  we shall be good friends yet for all that is come and gone said graham and then there were no more words between them  peregrine did as he said and went abroad extending his travels to many wild countries in which as he used to say any one else would have been in danger no danger ever came to himso at least he frequently wrote word to his mother gorillas he slew by scores lions by hundreds and elephants sufficient for an ivory palace the skins and bones and other trophies he sent home in various ships and when he appeared in london as a lion no man doubted his word but then he did not write a book nor even give lectures nor did he presume to know much about the huge brutes he had slain except that they were pervious to powder and ball  sir peregrine had endeavoured to keep him at home by giving up the property into his hands but neither for grandfather nor for mother nor for lands and money would he remain in the neighbourhood of noningsby no mother he said it will be better for me to be away and away he went  the old baronet lived to see him return though with plaintive wail he often declared to his daughterinlaw that this was impossible he lived but he never returned to that living life which had been his before he had taken up the battle for lady mason he would sometimes allow mrs orme to drive him about the grounds but otherwise he remained in the house sitting solitary over his firewith a book indeed open before him but rarely reading he was waiting patiently as he said till death should come to him  mrs orme kept her promise and wrote constantly to lady masonhearing from her as constantly when lucius had been six months in germany he decided on going to australia leaving his mother for the present in the little german town in which they were staying for her on the whole the change was for the better as to his success in a thriving colony there can be but little doubt  felix graham was soon married to madeline and as yet i have not heard of any banishment either to patagonia or to merthyrtydvil  and now i may say farewell
