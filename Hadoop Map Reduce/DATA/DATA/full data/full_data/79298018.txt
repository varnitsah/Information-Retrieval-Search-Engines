his first coming to brandenburg found but a cool reception as statthalter johannistage 24 june 1412 he first set foot in brandenburg with due escort in due state only statthalter viceregent as yet

late industry was at a low ebb violence was rife plunder disorder everywhere too much the habit for baronial gentlemen to live by the saddle as they termed it that is by highway robbery in modern phrase  the towns harried and plundered to skin and bone were glad to see a statthalter and did homage to him with all their heart but the baronage or squirearchy of the country were of another mind these in the late anarchies had set up for a kind of kings in their own right they had their feuds made war made peace levied tolls transitdues lived much at their own discretion in these solitary countriesrushing out from their stone towers walls fourteen feet thick to seize any herd of six hundred swine any convoy of lubeck or hamburg merchantgoods that had not contented them in passing what were pedlers and mechanic fellows made for if not to be plundered when needful arbitrary rule on the part of these noble robberlords and then much of the crowndomains had gone to the chief of thempawned and the pawnticket lost so to speak or sold for what trifle of ready money was to be had in jobst and companys time to these gentlemen a statthalter coming to inquire into matters was no welcome phenomenon your edle herr noble lord of putlitz noble lords of quitzow rochow maltitz and others supreme in their grassy solitudes this long while and accustomed to nothing greater than themselves in brandenburg how should they obey a statthalter  such was more or less the universal humor in the squirearchy of brandenburg not of good omen to burggraf friedrich but the chief seat of contumacy seemed to be among the quitzows putlitzes above spoken of big squires in the district they call the priegnitz in the country of the sluggish havel river northwest from berlin a fifty or forty miles these refused homage very many of them said they were incorporated with bohmen said this and thatmuch disinclined to homage and would not do it stiff surly fellows much deficient in discernment of what is above them and what is nota thickskinned set bodies clad in buff leather minds also cased in ill habits of long continuance  friedrich was very patient with them hoped to prevail by gentle methods he invited them to dinner had them often at dinner for a year or more but could make no progress in that way who is this we have got for a governor said the noble lords privately to each other a nurnberger tand nurnberg playthingwooden image such as they make at nurnberg said they grinning in a thickskinned way if it rained burggraves all the year round none of them would come to luck in this countryand continued their feuds tolllevyings plunderings and other contumacies seeing matters come to this pass after waiting above a year burggraf friedrich gathered his frankish menatarms quietly made league with the neighboring potentates thuringen and others got some munitions some artillery togetherespecially one huge gun the biggest ever seen a twentyfour pounder no less to which the peasants dragging her with difficulty through the clayey roads gave the name of faule grete lazy or heavy peg a remarkable piece of ordnance lazy peg he had got from the landgraf of thuringen on loan merely but he turned her to excellent account of his own i have often inquired after lazy pegs fate in subsequent times but could never learn anything distinctthe german dryasdust is a dull dog and seldom carries anything human in those big wallets of his  equipped in this way burggraf friedrich he was not yet kurfurst only coming to be marches for the havel country early days of 1414 michaelis i 287 stenzel i 168 where contrary to wont is an insignificant error or two pauli ii 58 is as usual lost in water makes his appearance before quitzows stronghouse of friesack walls

the name of the impregnable castle still discoverable in our time and it ought to be memorable and venerable to every prussian man burggraf friedrich vi not yet quite become kurfurst friedrich i but in a years space to become so he in person was the beneficent operator heavy peg and steady human insight these were clearly the chief implements  quitzow being settledfor the country is in military occupation of friedrich and his allies and except in some stone castle a man has no chancestraightway putlitz or another mutineer with his drawbridge up was battered to pieces and his drawbridge brought slamming down after this manner in an incredibly short period mutiny was quenched and it became apparent to noble lords and to all men that here at length was a man come who would have the laws obeyed again and could and would keep mutiny down  friedrich showed no cruelty far the contrary your mutiny once ended and a little repented of he is ready to be your gracious prince again fairplay and the social winecup or inexorable war and lazy peg it is at your discretion which brandenburg submitted hardly ever rebelled more brandenburg under the wise kurfurst it has got begins in a small degree to be cosmic again or of the domain of the gods ceases to be chaotic and a mere cockpit of the devils there is no doubt but this friedrich also like his ancestor friedrich iii the first hereditary burggraf was an excellent citizen of his country a man conspicuously important in all german business in his time a man setting up for no particular magnanimity ability or heroism but unconsciously exhibiting a good deal which by degrees gained universal recognition he did not shine much as reichsgeneralissimo under kaiser sigismund in his expeditions against zisca on the contrary he presided over huge defeat and rout once and again in that capacity and indeed had represented in vain that with such a species of militia victory was impossible he represented and again represented to no purpose whereupon he declined the office farther in which others fared no better hormayr oesterreichischer plutarch vii 109158  zisca  the offer to be kaiser was made him in his old days but he wisely declined that too it was in brandenburg by what he silently founded there that he did his chief benefit to germany and mankind he understood the noble art of governing men had in him the justice clearness valor and patience needed for that a man of sterling probity for one thing which indeed is the first requisite in said artif you will have your laws obeyed without mutiny see well that they be pieces of god almightys law otherwise all the artillery in the world will not keep down mutiny  friedrich travelled much over brandenburg looking into everything with his own eyesmaking i can well fancy innumerable crooked things straight reducing more and more that famishing dogkennel of a brandenburg into a fruitful arable field his portraits represent a square headed mildlooking solid gentleman with a certain twinkle of mirth in the serious eyes of him except in those hussite wars for kaiser sigismund and the reich in which no man could prosper he may be defined as constantly prosperous to brandenburg he was very literally the blessing of blessings redemption out of death into life in the ruins of that old friesack castle battered down by heavy peg antiquarian science if it had any eyes might look for the taproot of the prussian nation and the beginning of all that brandenburg has since grown to under the sun  friedrich in one capacity or another presided over brandenburg near thirty years he came thither first of all in 1412 was not completely kurfurst in his own right till 1415 nor publicly installed with 100000 looking on from the roofs and windows in constance yonder till 1417age then some fortyfive his brandenburg residence when he happened to have time for residing or sitting still was tangermunde the castle built by kaiser karl iv he died there 21st september 1440 laden tolerably with years and still better with memories of hard work done rentsch guesses by good inference he was born about 1372 as i count he is seventh in descent from that conrad burggraf conrad i cadet of hohenzollern who came down from the rauhe alp seeking service with kaiser redbeard above two centuries ago conrads generation and six others had vanished successively from the worldtheatre in that evermysterious manner and left the stage clear when burggraf friedrich the sixth came to be first elector let three centuries let twelve generations farther come and pass and there will be another still more notable friedrichour little fritz destined to be third king of prussia officially named friedrich ii and popularly frederick the great this first elector is his lineal ancestor twelve times removed rentsch pp 349372 hubner t 176     chapter ii  matinees du roi de prusse  eleven successive kurfursts followed friedrich in brandenburg of whom and their births deaths wars marriages negotiations and continual multitudinous stream of smaller or greater adventures much has been written of a dreary confused nature next to nothing of which ought to be repeated here some list of their names with what rememberable human feature or event if any still speaks to us in them we must try to give their names well dated with any actions incidents or phases of life which may in this way get to adhere to them in the readers memory the reader can insert each at its right place in the grand tide of european events or in such picture as the reader may have of that thereby with diligence he may produce for himself some faint twilight notion of the flight of time in remote brandenburgconvince himself that remote brandenburg was present all along alive after its sort and assisting dumbly or otherwise in the great worlddrama as that went on  we have to say in general the history of brandenburg under the hohenzollerns has very little in it to excite a vulgar curiosity though perhaps a great deal to interest an intelligent one had it found treatment duly intelligentwhich however how could it lucky beyond its neighbors hope to do commonplace dryasdust and voluminous stupidity not worse here than elsewhere play their part  it is the history of a state or social vitality growing from small to great steadily growing henceforth under guidance and the contrast between guidance and noguidance or misguidance in such matters is again impressively illustrated there this we see well to be the fact and the details of this would be of moment were they given us but they are nothow could voluminous dryasdust give them then on the other hand the phenomenon is for a long while on so small a scale wholly without importance in european politics and affairs the commonplace historian writing of it on a large scale becomes unreadable and intolerable witness grandiloquent pauli our fatal friend with his eight watery quartos which gods and men unless driven by necessity have learned to avoid dr carl friedrich pauli allgemeine preussische staatsgeschichte often enough cited here the phenomenon of brandenburg is small remote and the essential particulars too delicate for the eye of dryasdust are mostly wanting drowned deep in details of the unessential so that we are well content my readers and i to keep remote from it on this occasion  on one other point i must give the reader warning a rock of offence on which if he heedlessly strike i reckon he will split at least no help of mine can benefit him till he be got off again alas offences must come and must stand like rocks of offence to the shipwreck of many modern dryasdust interpreting the mysterious ways of divine providence in this universe or what he calls writing history has done uncountable havoc upon the best interests of mankind hapless godless dullard that he is driven and driving on courses that lead only downward for him as for us but one could forgive him all things compared with this doctrine of devils which he has contrived to get established pretty generally among his unfortunate fellowcreatures for the timei must insert the following quotation readers guess from what author  in an impudent pamphlet forged by i know not whom and published in 1766 under the title of matinees du roi de prusse purporting to be morning conversations of frederick the great with his nephew the heirapparent every line of which betrays itself as false and spurious to a reader who has made any direct or effectual study of frederick or his manners or affairsit is set forth in the way of exordium to these pretended royal confessions that notre maison our family of hohenzollern ever since the first origin of it among the swabian mountains or its first descent therefrom into the castle and imperial wardenship of nurnberg some six hundred years ago or more has consistently travelled one road and this a very notable one we as i myself the royal frederick still do have all along proceeded namely in the way of adroit machiavelism as skilful gamblers in this worlds business ardent gatherers of this worlds goods and in brief as devout worshippers of beelzebub the grand regulator and rewarder of mortals here below which creed we the hohenzollerns have found and i still find to be the true one learn it you my prudent nephew and let all men learn it by holding steadily to that and working late and early in such spirit we are come to what you now seeand shall advance still farther if it please beelzebub who is generally kind to those that serve him well such is the doctrine of this impudent pamphlet original manuscripts of which are still purchased by simple personswho have then nobly offered them to me thrice over gratis or nearly so as a priceless curiosity a new printed edition of which probably the fifth has appeared within few years simple persons consider it a curious and interesting document rather ambiguous in origin perhaps but probably authentic in substance and throwing unexpected light on the character of frederick whom men call the great in which new light they are willing a meritorious editor should share  who wrote that pamphlet i know not and am in no condition to guess a certain snappish vivacity very unlike the style of frederick whom it personates a wearisome grimacing gesticulating malice and smartness approaching or reaching the sad dignity of what is called wit in modern times in general the rottenness of matter and the epigrammatic unquiet graciosity of manner in this thing and its elaborately inhuman turn both of expression and of thought are visible characteristics of it thought we saidif thought it can be called thought all hamstrung shrivelled by inveterate rheumatism on the part of the poor illthriven thinker nay tied so to speak for he is of epigrammatic turn withal as by cross ropes right shoulder to left foot and forced to advance hobbling and jerking along in that sad guise not in the way of walk but of saltation and dance and this towards a false not a true aim rather nowhither than somewhitherhere were features leading one to think of an illustrious prince de ligne as perhaps concerned in the affair the bibliographical dictionaries producing no evidence name quite another person or series of persons a certain n de bonneville afterwards a revolutionary spiritualmountebank for some time is now the favorite nameproves on investigation to be an impossible one barbier dictionnaire des anonymes in a helpless doubting manner gives still others highly unmemorable otherwise whereupon you proceed to said other persons acknowledged works as they are called and find there a style bearing no resemblance whatever and are left in a dubious state if it were of any moment in the absence of proof i am unwilling to charge his highness de ligne with such an action and indeed am little careful to be acquainted with the individual who did it who could and would do it a prince of coxcombs i can discern him to have been capable of shining in the eyes of insincere foolish persons and of doing detriment to them not benefit a man without reverence for truth or human excellence not knowing in fact what is true from what is false what is excellent from what is shamexcellent and at the top of the mode an apparently polite and knowing man but intrinsically an impudent dark and merely modishinsolent manwho if he fell in with rhadamanthus on his travels would not escape a horsewhipping him we will willingly leave to that beneficial chance which indeed seems a certain one sooner or later and address ourselves to consider the theory itself and the facts it pretends to be grounded on  as to the theory i must needs say nothing can be falser more heretical or more damnable my own poor opinion and deep conviction on that subject is well known this long while and in fact the summary of all i have believed and have been trying as i could to teach mankind to believe again is even that same opinion and conviction applied to all provinces of things alas in this his sad theory about the world our poor impudent pamphleteer is by no means singular at present nay rather he has in a manner the whole practical part of mankind on his side just now the more is the pity for us all  it is very certain if beelzebub made this world our pamphleteer and the huge portion of mankind that follow him are right but if god made the world and only leads beelzebub as some ugly muzzled bear is led a longer or shorter temporary dance in this divine world and always draws him home again and peels the unjust gains off him and ducks him in a certain hot lake with sure intent to lodge him there to all eternity at lastthen our pamphleteer and the huge portion of mankind that follow him are wrong  more i will not say being indeed quite tired of speaking on that subject not a subject which it concerns me to speak of much as it concerns me and all men to know the truth of it and silently in every hour and moment to do said truth as indeed the sacred voice of their own soul if they listen will conclusively admonish all men and truly if it do not there will be little use in my logic to them for my own share i want no trade with men who need to be convinced of that fact if i am in their premises and discover such a thing of them i will quit their premises if they are in mine i will as old samuel advised count my spoons ingenious gentlemen who believe that beelzebub made this world are not a class of gentlemen i can get profit from let them keep at a distance lest mischief fall out between us they are of the set deserving to be calledand this not in the way of profane swearing but of solemn wrath and pity i say of virtuous anger and inexorable reprobationthe damned set for in very deed they are doomed and damned by natures oldest act of parliament they and whatsoever thing they do or say or think unless they can escape from that devilelement which i still hope they may  but with regard to the facts themselves de notre maison i take leave to say they too are without basis of truth they are not so false as the theory because nothing can in falsity quite equal that notre maison this pamphleteer may learn if he please to make study and inquiry before speaking did not rise by worship of beelzebub at all in this world but by a quite opposite line of conduct it rose in fact by the course which all except fools stockjobber stags cheating gamblers forging pamphleteers and other temporary creatures of the damned sort have found from of old to be the one way of permanently rising by steady service namely of the opposite of beelzebub by conforming to the laws of this universe instead of trying by pettifogging to evade and profitably contradict them the hohenzollerns too have a history still articulate to the human mind if you search sufficiently and this is what even with some emphasis it will teach us concerning their adventures and achievements of success in the field of life resist the devil good reader and he will flee from youso ends our indignant friend  how the hohenzollerns got their big territories and came to what they are in the world will be seen probably they were not any of them paragons of virtue they did not walk in altogether speckless sunday pumps or much clearstarched into consciousness of the moral sublime but in rugged practical boots and by such roads as there were concerning their moralities and conformities to the laws of the road and of the universe there will much remain to be argued by pamphleteers and others men will have their opinion men of more wisdom and of less apes by the deadsea also will have theirs but what man that believed in such a universe as that of this deadsea pamphleteer could consent to live in it at all who that believed in such a universe and did not design to live like a papinsdigester or porcus epicuri in an extremely ugly manner in it could avoid one of two things going rapidly into bedlam or else blowing his brains out it will not do for me at any rate this infinite doghouse not for me ye dryasdusts and omnipotent dogmonsters and mudgods whoever you are one honorable thing i can do take leave of you and your dogestablishment enough     chapter iii  kurfurst friedrich ii  the first friedrichs successor was a younger son friedrich ii who lasted till 1471 above thirty years and proved likewise a notable manager and governor very capable to assert himself and his just rights in this world he was but twentyseven at his accession but the berlin burghers attempting to take some liberties with him found he was old enough he got the name ironteeth friedrich ferratis dentibus from his decisive ways then and afterwards he had his share of brabbling with intricate litigant neighbors quarrels now and then not to be settled without strokes his worst war was with pommernjust claims disputed there and much confused bickering sieging and harassing in consequence of which quarrel we must speak anon it was he who first built the conspicuous schloss or palace at berlin having got the ground for it same ground still covered by the actual fine edifice which is a second edition of friedrichs from the repentant burghers and took up his chief residence there 14421431 nicolari i 81  but his principal achievement in brandenburg history is his recovery of the province called the neumark to that electorate in the thriftless sigismund times the neumark had been pledged had been sold teutsch ritterdom to whose dominions it lay contiguous had purchased it with money down the teutsch ritters were fallen moneyless enough since then they offered to pledge the neumark to friedrich who accepted and advanced the sum after a while the teutsch ritters for a small farther sum agreed to sell neumark michaelis i 301 into which transaction with its dates and circumstances let us cast one glance for our behoof afterwards the teutsch ritters were an opulent domineering body in sigismunds early time but they are now come well down in friedrich iis and are coming ever lower sinking steadily or with desperate attempts to rise which only increase the speed downwards ever since that fatal tannenberg business 15th july 1410 here is the sad progress of their descent to the bottom divided into three stages or periods  period first is of thirty years 14101440 a peace with poland soon followed that defeat of tannenberg humiliating peace with mulct in money and slightly in territory attached to it which again was soon followed by war and ever again each new peace more humiliating than its foregoer teutsch order is steadily sinkinginto debt among other things driven to severe financemeasures ultimately even to debase its coin which produce irritation enough poland is gradually edging itself into the territories and the interior troubles of preussen prefatory to greater operations that lie ahead there  second period of fourteen years so it had gone on from bad to worse till 1440 when the general population through its heads the landed gentry and the towns wearied out with fiscal and other oppressions from its domineering ritterdom brought now to such a pinch began everywhere to stir themselves into vocal complaint complaint emphatic enough where will you find a man that has not suffered injury in his rights perhaps in his person our friends they have invited as guests and under show of hospitality have murdered them men for the sake of their beautiful wives have been thrown into the river like dogsand enough of the like sort voigt vii 747 quoting evidently not an express manifesto but one manufactured by the old chroniclers no want of complaint nor of complainants town of thorn town of dantzig kulm all manner of towns and baronages proceeded now to form a bund or general covenant for complaining to repugn in hotter and hotter form against a domineering ritterdom with back so broken in fine to colleague with polandwhat was most ominous of all baronage burgherage they were german mostly by blood and by culture were wholly german but preferred poland to a teutsch ritterdom of that nature nothing but brabblings scufflings objurgations a great outbreak ripening itself teutsch ritterdom has to hire soldiers no money to pay them it was in these sad years that the teutsch ritterdom fallen moneyless offered to pledge the neumark to our kurfurst 1444 that operation was consummated pauli ii 187does not name the sum all this goes on in hotter and hotter form for ten years longer  period third begins early in 1454 with an important special catastrophe and ends in the thirteenth year after with a still more important universal one of the same nature prussian bund or antioppression covenant of the towns and landed gentry rising in temperature for fourteen years at this rate reached at last the igniting point and burst into fire february 4th 1454 the town of thorn darling firstchild of teutsch ritterdomchild 223 years old at this time founded 1231 as a wooden burg just across the river on the heathen side mainly round the stem of an immense old oak that grew handy thereseven barges always on the river weichsel to fly to our own side if quite overwhelmed oak and seven barges is still the townsarms of thorn see kohler munzbelustigungenxxii 107 quoting dusburg a priest of the order and his old chronica terrae prusciae written in 1326 and grown very big and now very angrysuddenly took its old parent by the throat so to speak and hurled him out to the dogs to the extraneous polacks first of all town of thorn namely sent that day its letter of renunciation to the hochmeister over at marienburg seized in a day or two more the hochmeisters official envoys dignitaries of the order led them through the streets amid universal storm of execrations hootings and unclean projectiles straight to jail and besieged the hochmeisters burg bastille of thorn with a few ritters in it all the artillery and all the throats and hearts of the place raging deliriously upon it so that the poor bitters who had no chance in resisting were in few days obliged to surrender 8th february 1454 says voigt viii 361 16th says kohler  munzbelustigungen xxii 110 had to come out in bare jerkin and thorn ignominiously dismissed them into space forevermorewith actual kicks i have read in some books though others veil that sad feature thorn threw out its old parent in this manner swore fealty to the king of poland and invited other towns and knightages to follow the example to which all were willing wherever able  war hereupon which blazed up over preussen at largeprussian covenant and king of poland versus teutsch ritterdomand lasted into the thirteenth year before it could go out again out by lack of fuel mainly one of the fellest wars on record especially for burning and ruining above 300000 fightingmen are calculated to have perished in it and of towns villages farmsteads a cipher which makes the fancy as it were black and ashy altogether ritterdom showed no lack of fighting energy but that could not save it in the pass things were got to enormous lack of wisdom of reality and human veracity there had long been and the hour was now come finance went out to the last coin large mercenary armies all along and in the end not the color of money to pay them with mercenaries became desperate besieged the hochmeister and his ritters in marienburgfinally sold the country they held formally made it over to the king of poland to get their pay out of it hochmeister had to see such things and say little peace or extinction for want of fuel came in the year 1466 poland got to itself the whole of that fine german country henceforth called west preussen to distinguish it which goes from the left bank of the weichsel to the borders of brandenburg and neumarkwould have got neumark too had not kurfurst friedrich been there to save it the teutsch order had to go across the weichsel ignominiously driven to content itself with east preussen the konigsbergmemel country and even to do homage to poland for that which latter was the bitterest clause of all but it could not be helped more than the others in this manner did its revolted children fling out teutsch ritterdom ignominiously to the dogs to the polacks first of allthorn the eldest child leading off or setting the example  and so the teutsch ritters are sunk beyond retrieval and west preussen called subsequently royal preussen not having homage to pay as the ducal or east preussen had is german no longer but polish sclavic not prospering by the change what thorn had sunk to out of its palmy state see in nankes wanderungen durch preussen hamburg  altona 1800 ii 177200a pleasant little rook treating mainly of natural history but drawing you by its innocent simplicity and geniality to read with thanks whatever is in it and all that fine german country reduced to rebel against its unwise parent was cut away by the polish sword and remained with poland which did not prove very wise either tilltill in the year 1773 it was cut back by the german sword all readers have heard of the partition of poland but of the partition of preussen 307 years before all have not heard  it was in the second year of that final tribulation marked above as period third that the teutsch ritters famishing for money completed the neumark transaction with kurfurst friedrich neumark already pawned to him ten years before they in 1455 for a small farther sum agreed to sell and he long carefully steering towards such an issue and dexterously keeping out of the main broil failed not to buy friedrich could thenceforth on his own score protect the neumark keep up an invisible but impenetrable wall between it and the neighboring anarchic conflagrations of thirteen years and the neumark has ever since remained with brandenburg its original owner  as to friedrichs pomeranian quarrel this is the figure of it here is a scene from rentsch which falls out in friedrichs time and which brought much battling and broiling to him and his symbolical withal of much that befell in brandenburg from first to last under the hohenzollerns as before brandenburg grew by aggregation by assimilation and we see here how difficult the process often was  pommern pomerania long wendish but peaceably so since the time of albert the bear and growing ever more german had in good part according to friedrichs notion if there were force in human treaties and imperial laws fallen fairly to brandenburgthat is to say the half of it stettinpommern had fairly fallenin the year 1464 when duke otto of stettin the last wendish duke died without heirs in that case by many bargains some with bloody crowns it had been settled if the wendish dukes died out the country was to fall to brandenburgand here they were dead at duke ottos burial accordingly in the high church of stettin when the coffin was lowered into its place the stettin burgermeister albrecht glinde took sword and helmet and threw the same into the grave in token that the line was extinct but franz von eichsted apparently another burgher instructed for the nonce jumped into the grave and picked them out again alleging no the dukes of wolgastpommern were of kin these tokens we must send to his grace at wolgast with offer of our homage said franz von eichsted rentsch p 110 whose printer has put his date awry stenzel i 233 calls the man lorenz eikstetten a resolute gentlemanand sent they were and accepted by his grace and perhaps halfascore of bargains with bloody crowns to some of them and yet other chances and centuries with the extinction of new lineshad to supervene before even stettinpommern and that in no complete state could be got 1648 by treaty of westphalia as to pommern at large pommern not denied to be due after such extinction and reextinction of native ducal lines did not fall home for centuries more and what struggles and inextricable armedlitigations there were for it readers of brandenburghistory too wearisomely know the process of assimilation not the least of an easy one  this friedrich was second son his fathers outlook for him had at first been towards a polish princess and the crown of poland which was not then so elective as afterwards and with such view his early breeding had been chiefly in poland johann the eldest son and heirapparent helping his father at home in the mean while but these polish outlooks went to nothing the young princess having died so that friedrich came home possessed merely of the polish language and of what talents the gods had given him which were considerable and now in the mean while johann who at one time promised well in practical life had taken to alchemy and was busy with crucibles and speculations to a degree that seemed questionable father friedrich therefore had to interfere and deal with this johann the alchemist johannes alchemista so the books still name him who loyally renounced the electorship at his fathers bidding in favor of friedrich accepted baireuth better half of the culmbach territory for apanage and there peacefully distilled and sublimated at discretion the government there being an easier task and fitter for a soft speculative herr a third brother albert by name got anspach on the fathers decease very capable to do any fighting there might be occasion for in culmbach  as to the burggrafship it was now done all but the title the first friedrich once he was got to be elector wisely parted with it the first friedrich found his electorship had dreadfully real duties for him and that this of the burggrafship had fallen mostly obsolete so he sold it to the nurnbergers for a round sum only the principalities and territories are retained in that quarter about which too and their feudal duties boundaries and tolls with a jealous litigious nurnberg for neighbor there at length came quarrelling enough but albert the third brother over at anspach took charge of all that and nothing of it fell in johanns way  the good alchemist diedperformed his last sublimation poor mansix or seven years before his brother friedrich age then sixtythree 14th november 1464 friedrich with his iron teeth and faculties only held out till fiftyeight10th february 1471 the manner of his end was peculiar in that war with pommern he sat besieging a pomeranian town uckermunde the name of it when at dinner one day a cannonball plunged down upon the table michaelis i 303 with such a crash as we can fancywhich greatly confused the nerves of friedrich much injured his hearing and even his memory thenceforth in a few months afterwards he resigned in favor of his successor retired to plassenburg and there died in about a year more     chapter iv  kurfurst albert achilles and his successor  neither friedrich nor johann left other than daughters so that the united heritage brandenburg and culmbach both came now to the third brother albert who has been in culmbath these many years already a tall fiery tough old gentleman of formidable talent for fighting who was called the achilles of germany in his day being then a very blazing farseen character dim as he has now grown born 1414 kurfurst 14711486 this albert achilles was the third elector ancestor he of all the brandenburg and culmbach hohenzollern princes that have since figured in the world after him there is no break or shift in the succession down to the little friedrich now bornfriedrich the old grandfather first king was the twelfth kurfurst  we have to say they followed generally in their ancestors steps and had success of the like kind more or

kurfurst and leaves two notable sons  alberts eldest son the fourth kurfurst was johannes cicero 14861499 johannes was his natural name to which the epithet cicero of germany cicero germaniae was added by an admiring public he had commonly administered the electorate during his fathers absences and done it with credit to himself he was an active man nowise deficient as a governor creditably severe on highway robbers for one thingdestroys you fifteen baronial robbertowers at a stroke was also concerned in the hungarianbohemian donnybrook and did that also well but nothing struck a discerning public like the talent he had for speaking spoke four hours at a stretch in kaiser maxs diets in elegantly flowing latin with a fair share of meaning tooand had bursts of parliamentary eloquence in him that were astonishing to hear a tall squareheaded man of erect cheerfully composed aspect head flung rather back if anything his bursts of parliamentary eloquence once glorious as the day procured him the name johannes cicero and that is what remains of them for they are sunk now irretrievable he and they into the belly of eternal night the final restingplace i do perceive of much ciceronian ware in this world apparently he had like some of his descendants what would now be called distinguished literary talentsinsignificant to mankind and us i find he was likewise called der grosse john the great but on investigation it proves to be mere john the big a name coming from his tall stature and ultimate fatness of body  for the rest he left his family well off connected with high potentates all around and had increased his store to a fair degree in his time besides his eldest son who followed as elector by name joachim i a burly gentleman of whom much is written in books he left a second son archbishop of magdeburg who in time became archbishop of mainz and cardinal of holy church ulrich van huttens grand panegyric upon this albert on his first entrance into mainz 9th

and blazes widely abroad in the busy reign of karl v and the inextricable lutheranpapal turkchristian business it had  but the notable point in this albert of mainz was that of leo x and the indulgences pauli v 496499 rentsch p 869 pope leo had permitted albert to retain his archbishopric of magdeburg and other dignities along with that of mainz which was an unusual favor but the pope expected to be paid for itto have 30000 ducats 15000 pounds almost a kings ransom at that time for the pallium to mainz pallium or little bit of woollen cloth on sale by the pope without which mainz could not be held albert with all his dignities was dreadfully short of money at the time chapter of mainz could or would do little or nothing having been drained lately magdeburg halberstadt the like albert tried various shifts tried a little stroke of trade in relicsgathered in the mainz district some hundreds of fractional sacred bones and three whole bodies which he sent to halle for pious

i could borrow the money from the fuggers of augsburg said the archbishop hesitatingly but theni could help you to repay it said his holiness could repay the half of itif only we had but they always make such clamor about these things an indulgence published in germanywell it must be answered albert at last agreeing to take the clamor on himself and to do the feat being at his witsend for money he draws out his fullpower which as first spiritual kurfurst he has the privilege to do nominates 1516 one tetzel for chief salesman a priest whose hardness of face and shiftiness of head and hand were known to him andhere is one hohenzollern that has a place in history poor man it was by accident and from extreme tightness for money he was by no means a violent churchman he had himself inclinations towards luther even of a practical sort as the thing went on but there was no help for it  cardinal albert kurmainz shows himself a copious dexterous public speaker at the diets and elsewhere in those times a man intent on avoiding violent methodsuncomfortably fat in his later years to judge by the portraits kurbrandenburg kurmainz the younger now officially even greater than the elder these names are perpetually turning up in the german histories of that reformationperiod absent on no great occasion and they at length from amid the meaningless beadroll of names wearisomely met with in such books emerge into persons for us as above     chapter v  of the baireuthanspach branch  albert achilles the third elector had before his accession been margraf of anspach and since his brother the alchemists death margraf of baireuth too or of the whole principalitymargraf of culmbach we will call it for brevitys sake though the bewildering old books have not steadily any name for it a certain subaltern of this express title margraf of culmbach a cadet with some temporary appanage there who was once in the service of him they call the winterking and may again be transiently heard of by us here is the altogether mysterious personage who prints himself marquis de lulenbach in bromleys collection of royal letters london 1787 pp 52 cone of the most curious books on the thirtyyears war edited with a composed stupidity and cheerful infinitude of ignorance which still farther distinguish it the bromley originals well worth a real editing turn out on inquiry to have been sold as autographs and dispersed beyond recovery about fifty years ago after his accession albert achilles naturally held both electorate and principality during the rest of his life which was an extremely rare predicament for the two countries the big and the little  no other elector held them both for nearly a hundred years nor then except as it were for a moment the two countries electorate and principality hohenzollern both and constituting what the hohenzollerns had in this world continued intimately connected with affinity and clientship carefully kept up and the lesser standing always under the express protection and as it were cousinship of the greater but they had their separate princes lines of princes and they only twice in the time of these twelve electors came even temporarily under the same head and as to ultimate union brandenburgbaireuth and brandenburganspach were not incorporated with brandenburgproper and its new fortunes till almost our own day namely in 1791 nor then either to continue having fallen to bavaria in the grand congress of vienna within the next fiveandtwenty years all which with the complexities and perplexities resulting from it here we must in some brief way endeavor to elucidate for the reader     two lines in culmbach or baireuthanspach the gera bond of 1598  culmbach the elector left at his death to his second sonproperly to two sons but one of them soon died and the other became sole possessorfriedrich by name who as founder of the elder line of brandenburgculmbach princes must not be forgotten by us founder of the first or elder line for there are two lines this of friedrichs having gone out in about a hundred years and the anspachbaireuth territories having fallen home again to brandenburgwhere however they continued only during the then kurfursts life johann george 15251598 seventh kurfurst was he to whom brandenburgculmbach fell homenay strictly speaking it was but the sure prospect of it that fell home the thing itself did not quite fall in his time though the disposal of it did disposal 1598 thing itself 1603 in his sons timeto be conjoined again with brandenburgproper conjoined for the short potential remainder of his own life and then to be disposed of as an apanage againwhich latter operation as johann george had threeandtwenty children could be no difficult one  johann george accordingly year 1598 split the territory in two brandenburgbaireuth was for his second son brandenburganspach for his third hereby again were two new progenitors of culmbach princes introduced and a new line second or younger line they call it line mostly split in two as heretofore whichafter complex adventures in its split condition baireuth under one head anspach under anothercontinues active down to our little fritzs time and farther as will become but too apparent to us in the course of this history  from of old these territories had been frequently divided each has its own little capital town of anspach town of baireuth populations about the same 16000 to 17000 in our time suitable for such arrangement frequently divided though always under the closest cousinship and ready for reuniting if possible generally under the elder line too under friedrichs posterity which was rather numerous and often in need of apanages they had been in separate hands but the understood practice was not to divide farther baireuth by itself anspach by itself or still luckier if one hand could get hold of bothand especially brandenburg by itself uncut by any apanage this i observe was the received practice but johann george wise kurfurst as he was wished now to make it surer and did so by a famed deed called the gera bond geraische vertrag dated 1598 michaelis i 345 the last year of johann georges life  hereby in a family conclave held at that gera a little town in thuringen it was settled and indissolubly fixed that their electorate unlike all others in germany shall continue indivisible law of primogeniture here if nowhere else is to be in full force and only the culmbach territory if otherwise unoccupied can be split off for younger sons culmbach can be split off and this again withal can be split if need be into two baireuth and anspach but not in any case farther which householdlaw was strictly obeyed henceforth date of it 1598 principal author johann george seventh elector this gera bond the reader can note for himself as an excellent piece of hohenzollern thrift and important in the brandenburg annals on the whole brandenburg keeps continually growing under these twelve hohenzollerns we perceive slower or faster just as the burggrafdom had done and by similar methods a lucky outlay of money as in the case of friedrich ironteeth in the neumark brings them one province lucky inheritance anothergood management is always there which is the mother of good luck  and so there goes on again from johann george downwards a new stream of culmbach princes called the younger or new lineproperly two contemporary lines of baireuthers and anspachersalways in close affinity to brandenburg and with ultimate reversion to brandenburg should both lines fail but with mutual inheritance if only one they had intricate fortunes service in foreign armies much wandering about sometimes considerable scarcity of cash but for a hundred and fifty years to come neither line by any means failedrather the contrary in fact  of this latter or new culmbach line or split line especially of the baireuth part of it our little wilhelmina little fritzs sister who became margravine there has given all the world notice from the anspach part of it at that time in sore scarcity of cash came queen caroline famed in our george the seconds time see a synoptic diagram of these genealogies infra p 388a from it too came an unmomentous margraf who married a little sister of wilhelminas and fritzs of whom we shall hear there is lastly a still more unmomentous margraf only son of said unmomentous and his said spouse who again combined the two territories baireuth having failed of heirs and who himself without heirs and with a frail lady craven as margravinedied at hammersmith close by us in 1806 and so ended the troublesome affair he had already in 1791 sold off to prussia all temporary claims of his and let prussia have the heritage at once without waiting farther prussia as we noticed did not keep it long and it is now part of the bavarian dominionfor the sake of editors and readers long may it so continue  of this younger line intrinsically rather insignificant to mankind we shall have enough to write in time and place we must at present direct our attention to the elder line     the elder line of culmbach friedrich and his three notable sons there  kurfurst albert achilless second son friedrich 14601536 rentsch pp 593602 the founder of the elder culmbach line ruled his country well for certain years and was a man famed for strength of body and mind but claims little notice from us except for the sons he had a quiet commendable honorable manwith a certain pathetic dignity visible even in the eclipsed state he sank into poor old gentleman after grand enough feats in war and peace he fell melancholy fell imbecile blind soon after middle life and continued so for twenty years till he died during which dark state say the old books it was a pleasure to see with what attention his sons treated him and how reverently the eldest always led him out to dinner ib p 612 they live and dine at that high castle of plassenburg where old friedrich can behold the red or white mayn no more alas alas plassenburg is now a correctionhouse where male and female scoundrels do beating of hemp and pious friedrich like eloquent johann has become a forgotten object he was of the german reichsarray who marched to the netherlands to deliver max from durance max the king of the romans whom for all his luck the mutinous flemings had put under lockandkey at one time 1482 pauli ii 389 his beautiful young wife thrown from her horse had perished in a thricetragic way short while before and the seventeen provinces were unruly under the guardianship of max that is his one feat memorable to me at present  he was johann ciceros halfbrother child by a second wife like his uncle kurfurst friedrich ii he had married a polish princess the sharp achilles having perhaps an eye to crowns in that direction during that hungarianbohemianpolish donnybrook but if so there again came nothing of a crown with it though it was not without its good results for friedrichs children by and by  he had eight sons that reached manhood five or six of whom came to something considerable in the world and three are memorable down to this day one of his daughters he married to the duke of liegnitz in silesia which is among the first links i notice of a connection that grew strong with that sovereign duchy and is worth remarking by my readers here of the three notable sons it is necessary that we say something casimir george albert are the names of these three  casimir the eldest 14811527 whose share of heritage is baireuth was originally intended for the church but inclining rather to secular and military things or his prospects of promotion altering he early quitted that and took vigorously to the career of arms and business a truculentlooking herr with thoughtful eyes and hanging underliphat of enviable softness loose disk of felt flung carelessly on almost like a nightcap artificially extended so admirably softand the look of the man casimir between his cataract of black beard and this seminightcap is carelessly truculent he had much fighting with the nurnbergers and others laid it right terribly on in the way of strokes when needful he was especially truculent upon the revolt of peasants in their bauernkrieg 1525 them in their wildest rage he fronted he that others might rally to him unhappy mortals will you shake the world to pieces then because you have much to complain of and hanged the ringleaders of them literally by the dozen when quelled and captured a severe rather truculent herr his brother george who had anspach for heritage and a right to half those prisoners admonished and forgave his half and pleaded hard with casimir for mercy to the others in a fine letter still extant in rentsch p 627 which produced no effect on casimir for the dogs sake and for all sakes let not the dog learn to eat leather of which his indispensable leashes and muzzles are made that was a proverb often heard on the occasion in luthers mouth among the rest  casimir died in 1527 age then towards fifty for the last dozen years or so when the fathers malady became hopeless he had governed culmbach both parts of it the anspach part which belonged to his next brother george going naturally in almost all things along with baireuth and george who was commonly absent not interfering except on important occasions casimir left one little boy age then only six name albert to whom george henceforth practical sovereign of culmbach as his brother had been was appointed guardian this youth very full of fire wildfire too much of it exploded dreadfully on germany by and by albert alcibiades the name they gave him nay towards the end of his nonage he had been rather sputtery upon his uncle the excellent guardian who had charge of him     friedrichs second son margraf george of anspach  uncle george of anspach casimirs next brother had always been of a peaceabler disposition than casimir not indeed without heat of temper and sufficient vivacity of every kind as a youth he had aided kaiser max in two of his petty wars but was always rather given to reading latin to learning and ingenious pursuits his polish mother who we perceive had given casimir his name proved much more important to george at an early age he went to his uncle vladislaus king of hungary and bohemia foralas after all we shall have to cast a glance into that unbeautiful hungarianbohemian scramble comparable to an irish donnybrook where albert achilles long walked as chiefconstable it behooves us after all to point out some of the tallest heads in it and whitherward bludgeon in hand they seem to be swaying and strugglingcourage patient reader  george then at an early age went to his uncle vladislaus king of hungary and bohemia for georges mother as we know was of royal kin daughter of the polish king casimir iv late mauler of the teutsch ritters which circumstance had results for george and us daughter of casimir iv the lady was and therefore of the jagellon blood by her father which amounts to little but by her mother she was granddaughter of that kaiser albert ii who got three crowns in one year and died the next whose posterity have ever sinceup to the lips in trouble with their confused competitive accompaniments hunniades corvinus george podiebrad and others not to speak of dragon turks coiling ever closer round you on the frontierbeen kings of hungary and bohemia two of the crowns the heritable two which were got by kaiser albert in that memorable year he got them as the reader may remember by having the daughter of kaiser sigismund to wifesigismund supergrammaticam whom we left standing red as a flamingo in the marketplace of constance a hundred years ago thus time rolls on in its manycolored manner edacious and feracious  it is in this way that georges uncle vladislaus alberts daughters son is now king of hungary and bohemia the last king vladislaus they had and the last king but one of any kind as we shall see anon vladislaus was heir of poland too could he have managed to get it but he gave up that to his brother to various younger brothers in succession having his hands full with the hungarian and bohemian difficulty he was very fond of nephew george well recognizing the ingenuous wise and loyal nature of the young man he appointed george tutor of his poor son ludwig whom he left at the early age of ten in an evil world and evil position there born without skin they say that is born in the seventh monthcalled ludwig ohne haut ludwig noskin on that account born certainly i can perceive rather thin of skin and he would have needed one of a rhinoceros thickness  george did his function honestly and with success ludwig grew up a gallant airy brisk young king in spite of difficulties constitutional and other got a sister of the great kaiser karl v to wifedetermined ad 1526 to have a stroke at the turk dragon which was coiling round his frontier and spitting fire at an intolerable rate ludwig a fine young man of twenty marched away with much hungarian chivalry right for the turk summer 1526 george meanwhile going busily to bohemia and there with all his strength levying troops for reinforcement ludwig fought and fenced for some time with the turk outskirts came at last to a furious general battle with the turk 29th august 1526 at a place called mohacz far east in the flats of the lower donau and was there tragically beaten and ended seeing the battle gone and his chivalry all in flight ludwig too had to fly galloping for life he came upon bog which proved bottomless as good as bottomless and ludwig horse and man vanished in it straightway from this world hapless young man like a flash of lightning suddenly going down thereand the hungarian sovereignty along with him for hungary is part of austria ever since having with bohemia fallen to karl vs brother ferdinand as now the nearest convenient heir of albert with his three crowns up to the lips in difficulties to this day  george meanwhile with finely appointed reinforcements was in full march to join ludwig but the sad news of mohacz met him he withdrew as soon as might be to his own territory and quitted hungarian politics this i think was georges third and last trial of war he by no means delighted in that art or had cultivated it like casimir and some of his brothers  george by this time had considerable property part of it important to the readers of this history anspach we already know but the duchy of jagerndorfthat and its pleasant valleys fine huntinggrounds and larchclad heights among the giant mountains of silesiathat is to us the memorable territory george got it in this manner  some ten or fifteen years ago the late king vladislaus our uncle of blessed memory loving george and not having royal moneys at command permitted him to redeem with his own cash certain hungarian domains pledged at a ruinously cheap rate but unredeemable by vladislaus george did so years ago guess ten or fifteen george did not like the hungarian domains with their turk and other inconveniences he proposed to exchange them with king vladislaus for the bohemiansilesian duchy of jagerndorf which had just then by failure of heirs lapsed to the king this also vladislaus the beneficent cashless uncle liking george more and more permitted to be done and done it was i see not in what year only that the ultimate investiture done this part of the affair by ludwig ohne haut and duly sanctioned by the kaiser dates 1524 two years before the fatal mohacz business  from the time of this purchase and especially till brother casimirs death which happened in 1527 george resided oftener at jagerndorf than at anspach anspach by the side of baireuth needed no management and in jagerndorf much probably required the hand of a good governor to put it straight again the castle of jagerndorf which towers up there in a rather grand manner to this day george built the old castle of the schellenbergs extinct predecessor line now gone to ruins stands on a hill with larches on it some miles off margraf george was much esteemed as duke of jagerndorf what his actions in that region were i know not but it seems he was so well thought of in silesia two smaller neighboring potentates the duke of oppeln and the duke of ratibor who had no heirs of their body bequeathed with the kaisers assent these towns and territories to george rentsch pp 623 127131 kaiser is ferdinand karl vs brotheras yet only king of bohemia and hungary but supreme in regard to such points his assent is dated 17th june 1531 in rentschin mere love to their subjects rentsch intimates that poor men might be governed by a wise good duke in the time coming the kaiser would have got the duchies otherwise  nay the kaiser in spite of his preliminary assent proved extortionate to george in this matter and exacted heavy sums for the actual possession of oppeln and ratibor george going so zealously ahead in protestant affairs grew less and less a favorite with kaisers but so at any rate on peaceable unquestionable grounds grounds valid as imperial law and ready money george is at last lord of these two little countries in the plain of southsilesia as of jagerndorf among the mountains hard by george has and holds the duchy of jagerndorf with these appendages jagerndorf since 1524 ratibor and oppeln since some years later and lives constantly or at the due intervals in his own strong mountaincastle of jagerndorf therewe have no doubt to the marked benefit of good men in those parts hereby has jagerndorf joined itself to the brandenburg territories and the reader can note the circumstance for it will prove memorable one day  in the business of the reformation margraf george was very noble a simplehearted truthloving modestly valiant man rising unconsciously in that great element into the heroic figure george the pious der fromme george the confessor bekenner were the names he got from his countrymen once this business had become practical george interfered a little more in the culmbach government his brother casimir who likewise had reformation tendencies rather hanging back in comparison to george  in 1525 the townpopulations in the culmbach region big nurnberg in the van had gone quite ahead in the new doctrine and were becoming irrepressibly impatient to clear out the old mendacities and have the gospel preached freely to them this was a questionable step feasible perhaps for a great elector of saxonybut for a margraf of anspach george had come home from jagerndorf some three hundred miles away to look into it for himself found it what with darkness all round what with precipices menacing on both hands and zealous inconsiderate townpopulations threatening to take the bit between their teeth a frightfully intricate thing george mounted his horse one day this year day not dated farther and with only six attendants privately rode off another two hundred miles a good three days ride to wittenberg and alighted at dr martinus lutheruss door rentsch p 625 a notable passage worth thinking of but such visits of high princes to

must onand perils enough there proved to be and precipices on each hand bauernkrieg that is to say peasantswar anabaptistry and redrepublic on the one hand reichsacht ban of empire on the other but george eagerly solemnly attentive with ever new light rising on him dealt with the perils as they came and went steadily on in a simple highly manful and courageous manner  he did not live to see the actual wars that followed on luthers preachinghe was of the same age with luther born few months later and died two years before luther 4th march 148427th dec 1543 george 10th november 148318th

house is at present an inn gasthaus zu den drei mohrenwhere tourists lodge and are still shown the room which the kaiser occupied on such visits is still very celebrated it was the evening of the kaiser karl fifths arrival at the diet which was then already some time since assembled there and great had been the kaisers reception that morning the flower of germany all the princes of the empire protestant and papal alike riding out to meet him in the open country at the bridge of the lech with highflown speeches and benignities on both sidesonly that the kaiser willed all men protestant and other should in the mean while do the popish litanyings waxlight processionings and idolatrous stageperformances with him on the morrow which was corpuschristi day and the protestants could not nor would imperial hints there had already been from innspruck benign hopes of the nature of commands that loyal protestant princes would in the interim avoid open discrepanciesperhaps be so loyal as keep their chaplains peculiar divineservices private in the interim these were hintsand now this of the corpuschristi a still more pregnant hint loyal protestants refused it therefore flatly declined

speeches now oftenest rolled into one by inaccurate editors as by rentsch ubi supra and the corpuschristi idolatries were forborne the margraf and his company this timethe kaiser himself however walking nearly roasted in the sun in heavy purplevelvet cloak with a big waxcandle very superfluous guttering and blubbering in the right hand of him along the streets of augsburg kurbrandenburg kurmainz high cousins of george were at this diet of augsburg kurbrandenburg elector joachim i ciceros son of whom we have spoken and shall speak again being often very loud on the conservative side and eloquent kurmainz going on the conciliatory tack kurbrandenburg in his zeal had ridden on to innspruck to meet the kaiser there and have a preliminary word with him both these high cousins spoke and bestirred themselves a good deal at this diet they had met the kaiser on the plains of the lech this morning and no doubt gloomed unutterable things on george and his speech george could not help it  till his death in 1543 george is to be found always in the front line of this high movement in the line where kursachsen john the steadfast der bestandige and young philip the magnanimous of

leave of margraf george and his fine procedures in that crisis of worldhistory he had got jugerndorf which became important for his family and others but what was that to the promethean conquests such we may call them which he had the honor to assist in making for his family and for his country and for all menvery unconscious he of bringing fire from heaven good modest simple man so far as i can gather there lived in that day few truer specimens of the honest man a rugged roughhewn rather bluntnosed physiognomy cheekbones high cheeks somewhat bagged and wrinkly eyes with a due shade of

upon the fine head of george and by no means to its embellishment  one of his daughters he married to the duke of liegnitz a new link in that connection he left one boy george friedrich who came under alcibiades his cousin of baireuths tutelage and suffered much by that connection or indeed chiefly by his own conspicuously protestant turn to punish which the alcibiades connection was taken as a pretext in riper years george friedrich got his calamities brought well under and lived to do good work protestant and other in the world to which we may perhaps allude again the line of margraf george the pious ends in this george friedrich who had no children the line of margraf george and the elder culmbach line altogether 1603 albert alcibiades casimirs one son having likewise died without posterity  of the younger brothers says my authority some four were in the church two of whom rose to be prelateshere are the four  1 one wilhelm by name was bishop of riga in the remote prussian outskirts and became protestantamong the first great prelates who took that heretical course being favored by circumstances to cast out the v d verbum diaboli as philip read it he is a wiselooking man with magnificent beard with something of contemptuous patience in the meditative eyes of him he had great troubles with his riga peopleas indeed was a perennial case between their bishop and them of whatever creed he might be  2 the other prelate held fast by the papal orthodoxy he had got upon the ladder of promotion towards magdeburg hoping to follow his cousin kurmainz the eloquent conciliatory cardinal in that part of his pluralities as he didlittle to his comfort poor man having suffered a good deal in the sieges and religious troubles of his magdeburgers who ended by ordering him away having openly declared themselves protestant at length he had to go and occupy himself complaining soliciting auliccouncils and the like for therest of his life  3 the probst of wurzburg provost kind of headcanon there orthodox papal he too and often gave his brother george trouble  4 a still more orthodox specimen the youngest member of the family who is likewise in orders gumbrecht gumbertus a canonicus of something or other say the books who went early to rome and became one of his holiness leo tenths chamberlainsstood the sack of rome constable de bourbons and was captured there and ransomedbut died still young 1528 these three were catholics he of wurzburg a rather virulent one  catholic also was johannes a fifth brother who followed the soldiering and diplomatic professions oftenest in spain did governmentmessages to diets and the like for karl v a high man and well seen of his kaiserhe had wedded the young widow of old king ferdinand in spain which proved seemingly a troublous scene for poor johannes what we know is he was appointed commandant of valencia and died there still little turned of thirtyby poison it is supposedand left his young widow to marry a third time  these are the five minor brothers four of them catholic sons of old blind friedrich of plassenburg who are not for their own sake memorable but are mentionable for the sake of the three major brothers so many orthodox catholics while brother george and others went into the heresies at such a rate a family much split by religionand blind old friedrich dim of intellect knew nothing of it and the excellent polish mother said and thought we know not what a divided time  johannes of valencia and these chief priests were all men of mark conspicuous to the able editors of their day but the only brother now generally known to mankind is albert hochmeister of the teutsch ritterdom by whom preussen came into the family of him we must now speak a little     chapter vi  hochmeister albert third notable son of friedrich  albert was born in 1490 georges junior by six years casimirs by nine he too had been meant for the church but soon quitted that other prospects and tendencies opening he had always loved the ingenuous arts but the activities too had charms for him he early shone in his exercises spiritual and bodily grew tall above his fellows expert in arts especially in armsrode with his father to kaiser maxs court was presented by him as the light of his eyes to kaiser max who thought him a very likely young fellow and bore him in mind when the mastership of the teutsch ritterdom fell vacant rentsch pp 840863  the teutsch ritterdom ever since it got its back broken in that battle of tannenberg in 1410 and was driven out of westpreussen with such ignominious kicks has been lying bedrid eating its remaining revenues or sprawling about in helpless efforts to rise again which require no notice from us hopeless of ever recovering westpreussen it had quietly paid its homage to poland for the eastern part of that country quietly for some couple of generations but in the third or fourth generation after tannenberg there began to rise murmursin the holy roman empire first of all preussen is a piece of the reich said hot inconsiderate people preussen could not be alienated without consent of the reich to which discourses the afflicted ritters listened only too gladly their dull eyes kindling into new false hopes at sound of them the point was to choose as hochmeister some man of german influence of power and connection in the country who might help them to their socalled right with this view they chose one and then another of such sortand did not find it very hopeful as we shall see  albert was chosen grandmaster of preussen in february 1511 age then twentyone made his entry into konigsberg november next year in grand cavalcade dreadful storm of rain and wind at the timepoor albert all in black and full of sorrow for the loss of his mother the good polish princess who had died since he left home twenty months of preparation he had held since his election before doing anything for indeed the case was intricate he like his predecessor in office had undertaken to refuse that homage to poland the reich generally and kaiser max himself in a loose way of talk encouraging him a piece of the reich said they all teutsch ritters had no power to give it away in that manner which is a thing more easily said than made good in the way of doing  alberts predecessor chosen on this principle was a saxon prince friedrich of meissen cadet of saxony potently enough connected he too who in like manner had undertaken to refuse the homage and zealously did refuse it though to his cost poor man from the reich for all its big talking he got no manner of assistance had to stave off a polish war as he could by fairspeaking by diplomacies and contrivances and died at middle age worn down by the sorrows of that sad position  an idea prevails in illinformed circles that our new grandmaster albert was no better than a kind of cheat that he took this grandmastership of preussen and then in gayety of heart surreptitiously pocketed preussen for his own behoof which is an idle idea inconsistent with the least inquiry or real knowledge how the matter stood voigt ix 740749 pauli iv 404407 by no means in gayety of heart did albert pocket preussen nor till after as tough a struggle to do other with it as could have been expected of any man  one thing not suspected by the teutsch ritters and least of all by their young hochmeister was that the teutsch ritters had well deserved that terrible downcome at tannenberg that ignominious dismissal out of westpreussen with kicks their insolence luxury degeneracy had gone to great lengths nor did that humiliation mend them at all the reverse rather it was deeply hidden from the young hochmeister as from them that probably they were now at length got to the end of their capability and ready to be withdrawn from the scene as soon as any good way offeredof course they were reluctant enough to fulfil their bargain to poland very loath they to do homage now for preussen and own themselves sunk to the second degree for the ritters had still their old haughtiness of humor their deepseated pride of place gone now into the unhappy conscious state that is usually the last thing that deserts a sinking house pride of place gone to the conscious stateas if in a reverse manner the house felt that it deserved to sink  for the rest alberts position among them was what friedrich of sachsens had been worse not better and the main ultimate difference was he did not die of it like friedrich of sachsen but found an outlet not open in friedrichs time and lived to the ritters and vague public which called itself the reich albert had promised he would refuse the homage to poland on which ritters and reich had clapt their hands and that was pretty much all the assistance he got of them the reich as a formal body had never asserted its right to preussen nor indeed spoken definitely on the subject it was only the vague public that had spoken in the name of the reich from the reich or from any individual of it kaiser or prince when actually applied to albert could get simply nothing from what ritters were in preussen he might perhaps expect promptitude to fight if it came to that which was not much as things stood but from the great body of the ritters scattered over germany with their rich territories balleys bailliwicks safe resources and comfortable teutschmeister over them he got flat refusal the titles hochmeister and teutschmeister are defined in many books and in all manner of dictionaries as meaning the same thing but that is not quite the case they were at first synonymous so far as i can see and after alberts time they again became so but at the date where we now are and for a long while back they represent different entities and indeed oftenest since the prussian decline began antagonistic ones teutschmeister subpresident over the german affairs and possessions of the order resides at mergentheim in that country hochmeister is chief president of the whole but resident at marienburg in preussen and feels there acutely where the shoe pinchesmuch too acutely thinks the teutschmeister in his soft listslippers at mergentheim in the safe wurzburg region we will not be concerned in the adventure at all we wish you well through it never was a spirited young fellow placed in more impossible position his brother casimir george was then in hungary his cousin joachim kurbrandenburg friedrich duke of liegnitz a silesian connection of the family duke friedrich ii comes by mothers from kurfurst friedrich i marries margraf georges daughter even now 1519 hubner tt 179 100 101 consulted advised negotiated to all lengths alberts own effort was incessant agree with king sigismund said they uncle sigismund your good mothers brother a king softly inclined to us allhow agree answered albert he insists on the homage which i have promised not to give casimir went and came to konigsberg to berlin went once himself to cracow to the king on this errand but it was a case of yes and no not to be solved by casimir  as to king sigismund he was patient with it to a degree made the friendliest paternal professionstestifying withal that the claim was undeniable and could by him sigismund never be foregone with the least shadow of honor and of course never would my dear nephew can consider whether his dissolute vainminded halfheretical ritterdom nay whether this prussian fraction of it is in a condition to take poland by the beard in an unjust quarrel or can hope to do tannenberg over again in the reverse way by beelzehubs help  for seven years albert held out in this intermediate state neither peace nor war moving heaven and earth to raise supplies that he might be able to defy poland and begin war the reich answers we have really nothing for you teutschmeister answers again and again i tell you we have nothing in the end sigismund grew impatient made december 1519 some movements of a hostile nature albert did not yield eager only to procrastinate till he were ready by superhuman efforts of borrowing bargaining soliciting and galloping to and fro albert did about the end of next year get up some appearance of an army 14000 german mercenaries horse and foot so many in theory who to the extent of 8000 in actual result came marching towards him october 1520 to serve for eight months with these he will besiege dantzig besiege thorn will plunge suddenly like a fiery javelin into the heart of poland and make poland surrender its claim whereupon king sigismund bestirred himself in earnest came out with vast clouds of polish chivalry overset alberts 8000who took to eating the country instead of fighting for it being indeed in want of all things one of the gladdest days albert had yet seen was when he got the 8000 sent home again  what then is to be done armistice for four years sigismund was still kind enough to consent to that truce for four years try everywhere my poor nephew after that your mind will perhaps become pliant albert tried the reich again four years o princes and then i must do it or be eaten reich busy with lutheranpapal turkchristian quarrels merely shrugged its shoulders upon albert teutschmeister did the like everybody the like in heaven or earth then is there no hope for me thought albert and his stock of ready moneywe will not speak of that  meanwhile dr osiander of anspach had come to him and the pious young man was getting utterly shaken in his religion monkish vows pope holy church itself what is one to think herr doctor albert religious to an eminent degree was getting deep into protestantism in his many journeyings to nurnberg to brandenburg and up and down he had been at wittenberg too he saw luther in person more than once there corresponded with luther in fine believed in the truth of luther the culmbach brothers were both at least george ardently was inclined to protestantism as we have seen but albert was foremost of the three in this course osiander and flights of zealous culmbach preachers made many converts in preussen in these circumstances the four years came to a close  albert we may believe is greatly at a loss and deep deliberations culmbach berlin liegnitz poland all called in are helda case beyond measure intricate you have given your word word must be keptand cannot without plain hurt or ruin even to those that took it of you withdraw therefore fling it upfling it up a valuable article to fling up fling it up is the last resource nay in fact to whom will you fling it up the prussian ritters themselves are getting greatly divided on the point and at last on all manner of points protestantism ever more spreading among them as for the german brethren they and their comfortable teutschmeister who refused to partake in the dangerous adventure at all are they entitled to have much to say in the settlement of it now  among others or as chief oracle of all luther was consulted what would you have me do towards reforming the teutsch order inquired albert of his oracle luthers answer was as may be guessed emphatic luther says one reporter has in his writings declared the order to be a thing serviceable neither to god nor man and the constitution of it a monstrous frightful hermaphroditish neither secular nor spiritual constitution c j weber daa ritterwessen stuttgard 1837 iii 208 we do not know what luthers answer to albert wasbut can infer the purport of it that such a teutsch ritterdom was not at any rate a thing long for this world that white cloaks with black crosses on them would not of themselves profit any ritterdom that solemn vows and high supramundane professions followed by such practice as was notorious are an afflicting not to say a damnable spectacle on gods earththat a young herr had better marry better have done with the wretched babylonian nightmare of papistry altogether better shake oneself awake in gods name and see if there are not still monitions in the eternal sky as to what it is wise to do and wise not to dothis i imagine to have been in modern language the purport of dr luthers advice to hochmeister albrecht on the present interesting occasion  it is certain albert before long took this course uncle sigismund and the resident officials of the ritterdom having made agreement to it as the one practicable course the manner as follows 1 instead of elected hochmeister let us be hereditary duke of preussen and pay homage for it to uncle sigismund in that character 2 such of the resident officials of the ritterdom as are prepared to go along with us we will in like manner constitute permanent feudal proprietors of what they now possess as liferent and they shall be subvassals under us as hereditary duke 3 in all which uncle sigismund and the republic of poland engage to maintain us against the world  that is in sum the transaction entered into by king sigismund i of poland on the one part and hochmeister albert and his ritter officials such as went along with him which of course none could do that were not protestant on the other part done at cracow 8th april 1525 rentsch p 850here certified by rentsch voigt and others is a wornout patch of paper which is perhaps worth printing       1490 may 17 albert is born      1511 february 14 hochmeister      1519 december king

1523 june albert consults luther      1524 november sees luther      1525 april 8 peace of cracow and albert to be duke of      prussia whereby teutsch ritterdom the prussian part of it      vanished from the world dissolving itself and its hermaphrodite      constitution like a kind of male nunnery as so many female ones      had done in those years a transaction giving rise to endless      criticism then and afterwards transaction plainly not      reconcilable with the letter of the law and liable to have logic      chopped upon it to any amount and to all lengths of time      the teutschmeister and his german brethren shrieked murder      the whole world then and for long afterwards had much to say      and argue  to us now that the logicchaff is all laid long since the question is substantial not formal if the teutsch ritterdom was actually at this time dead actually stumbling about as a mere galvanized lie beginning to be putridthen sure enough it behooved that somebody should bury it to avoid pestilential effects in the neighborhood somebody or otherfirst flaying the skin off as was natural and taking that for his trouble all turns in substance on this latter question if again the ritterdom was not dead  and truly it struggled as hard as partridge the almanacmaker to rebut that fatal accusation complained teutschmeister and germanpapist part of it loudly at the diets got albert and his consorts put to the ban geachtet fiercely menaced by the kaiser karl v but nothing came of all that nothing but noise albert maintained his point kaiser karl always found his hands full otherwise and had nothing but stamped parchments and menaces to fire off at albert teutsch ritterdom the popish part of it did enjoy its valuable bailliwicks and very considerable rents in various quarters of germany and europe having lost only preussen and walked about for three centuries more with money in its pocket and a solemn white gown with black cross on its backthe most opulent social club in existence and an excellent place for bestowing younger sons of sixteen quarters but it was and continued through so many centuries in every essential respect a solemn hypocrisy a functionless merely eating phantasm of the nature of goblin hungry ghost or ghoul of which kind there are manytill napoleon finally ordered it to vanish its time even as phantasm being come  albert i can conjecture had his own difficulties as regent in preussen 15251568 protestant theology to make matters worse for him had split itself furiously into doxies and there was an osianderism osiander being the dukes chaplain much flamed upon by the more orthodox ism foreigners too germananspach and other were ill seen by the native gentlemen yet sometimes got encouragement one funccius a shining nurnberg immigrant there soninlaw of osiander who from theology got into politics had at last 1564 to be beheadedold duke albert himself bitterly weeping about him for it was none of alberts doing probably his new allodial ritter gentlemen were not the most submiss when made hereditary we can only hope the duke was a hohenzollern and not quite unequal to his task in this respect a man with high bald brow magnificent spadebeard air muchpondering almost gauntgaunt kind of eyes especially and a slight cast in them which adds to his severity of aspect he kept his possession well every inch of it and left all safe at his decease in 1568 his age was then near eighty it was the tenth year of our elizabeth as queen invincible armada not yet built but alba very busy cutting off high heads in brabant and stirring up the dutch to such fury as was needful for exploding spain and him  this duke albert was a profoundly religious man as all thoughtful men then were much given to theology to doctors of divinity being eager to know gods laws in this universe and wholesomely certain of damnation if he should not follow them fond of the profane sciences too especially of astronomy erasmus reinhold and his tabulae prutenicae were once very celebrated erasmus reinhold proclaims gratefully how these his elaborate tables done according to the latest discoveries 1551 and onwards were executed upon duke alberts high bounty for which reason they are dedicated to duke albert and called prutenicae meaning prussian rentsch p 855 the university of konigsberg was already founded several years before in 1544  albert had not failed to marry as luther counselled by his first wife he had only daughters by his second one son albert friedrich who without opposition or difficulty succeeded his father thus was preussen acquired to the hohenzollern family for before long the electoral branch managed to get mitbelehnung coinfeftment that is to say eventual succession and preussen became a family heritage as anspach and baireuth were     chapter vii  albert alcibiades  one word must be spent on poor albert casimirs son 15221557 already mentioned this poor albert whom they call alcibiades made a great noise in that epoch being what some define as the failure of a fritz who has really features of him we are to call friedrich the great but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors and never came to anything  a high and gallant young fellow left fatherless in childhood perhaps he came too early into powerhe came at any rate in very volcanic times when germany was all in convulsion the old religion and the new having at length broken out into open battle with huge results to be hoped and feared and the largest game going on in sight of an adventurous youth how albert staked in it how he played to immense heights of sudden gain and finally to utter bankruptcy i cannot explain here some german delineator of human destinies artist worth the name if there were any might find in him a fine subject  he was ward of his uncle george and the probable fact is no guardian could have been more faithful nevertheless on approaching the years of majority of majority but not discretion he saw good to quarrel with his uncle claimed this and that which was not granted quarrel lasting for years nay matters ran so high at last it was like to come to war between them had not george been wiser the young fellow actually sent a cartel to his uncle challenged him to mortal combatat which george only wagged his old beard we suppose and said nothing neighbors interposed the diet itself interposed and the matter was got quenched again leaving albert let us hope a repentant young man we said he was full of fire too much of it wildfire  his profession was arms he shone much in war went slashing and fighting through those schmalkaldic broils and others of his time a distinguished captain cutting his way towards something high he saw not well what he had great comradeship with moritz of saxony in the wars two sworn brothers they and comrades in armsit is the same dexterous moritz who himself a protestant managed to get his too protestant cousins electorate of saxony into his hand by luck of the game the moritz too from whom albert by and by got his last defeat giving moritz his death in return that was the finale of their comradeship all things end and nothing ceases changing till it end  he was by position originally on the kaisers side had attained great eminence and done high feats of arms and generalship in his service but being a protestant by creed he changed after that schmalkaldic downfall rout of muhlberg 24th april 1547 which brought moritz an electorate and nearly cost moritzs too protestant cousin his life as well as lands account of it in de wette lebensgeschichte der herzoge zu sachsenweimar 1770 pp 3235 the victorious kaiser growing now very high in his ways there arose complaints against him from all sides very loud from the protestant side and moritz and albert took to arms with loud manifestos and the other phenomena  this was early in 1552 five years after muhlberg rout or battle the there victorious kaiser was now suddenly almost ruined chased like a partridge into the innspruck mountainscould have been caught only moritz would not had no cage to hold so big a bird he said so the treaty of passau was made and the kaiser came much down from his lofty ways famed treaty of passau 22d august 1552 which was the finale of these broils and hushed them up for a fourscore years to come that was a memorable year in german reformation history  albert meanwhile had been busy in the interior of the country blazing aloft in frankenland his native quarter with a success that astonished all men for seven months he was virtually king of germany ransomed bamberg ransomed wurzburg nurnberg places he had a grudge at ransomed all manner of towns and placesespecially rich bishops and their towns with verbum diaboli sticking in themat enormous sums king of the world for a brief seasonmust have had some strange thoughts to himself had they been recorded for us a pious man too not in the least like alcibiades except in the sudden changes of fortune he underwent his motto or old rhymed prayer which he would repeat on getting into the saddle for military worka rough rhyme of his own composingis still preserved let us give it with an english facsimile or roughest mechanical penciltracingby way of glimpse into the heart of a vanished

kaiser being reconciled again and the trenches opened by the valor of guise and his chivalrystill more perhaps by the iron frosts and by the sleety rains of winter and the hungers and the hardships of a hundred thousand men digging vainly at the icebound earth or trampling it when sleety into seas of mud and themselves sinking in it of dysentery famine toil and despair as they cannonaded day and nightmetz could not be taken impossible said the generals with one voice after trying it for a couple of months try it one other ten days said the kaiser with a gloomy fixity let us all die or else do it they tried with double desperation another ten days cannon booming through the winter midnight far and wide four score miles round cannot be done your majesty cannotthe winter and the mud and guise and the walls mans strength cannot do it in this season we must march away karl listened in silence but the tears were seen to run down his proud face now not so young as it once was let us march then

not long after retired into the monastery of st just and there soon died that is the siege of metz where alcibiades was helpful his own bargain with the kaiser should have been better made beforehand  dissatisfied with any bargain he could now get dissatisfied with the treaty of passau with such a finale and hushingup of the religious controversy and in general with himself and with the world albert again drew sword went loose at a high rate upon his bambergwurzburg enemies and having raised supplies there upon moritz and those passautreatiers he was beaten at last by moritz sunday 9th

this albert though not with wisdom enough not with good fortune enough could he have continued to rule the situation as our french friends phrase it to march the fanatical papistries and kaiser karl clear out of it home to spain and san justo a little earlier to wave the coming jesuitries away as with a flaming sword to forbid beforehand the doleful thirtyyears war and the still dolefuler spiritual atrophy the flaccid pedantry ever rummaging and rearranging among learned marinestores which thinks itself wisdom and insight the vague maunderings flutings indolent impotent daydreaming and tobaccosmoking of poor modern germany which has followed therefromach gott he might have been a success of a fritz three times over he might have been a german cromwell beckoning his people to fly eaglelike straight towards the sun instead of screwing about it in that sad uncertain and far too spiral mannerbut it lay not in him not in his capabilities or opportunities after all and we but waste time in such speculations     chapter viii  historical meaning of the reformation  the culmbach brothers we observe play a more important part in that era than their seniors and chiefs of brandenburg these culmbachers margraf george aud albert of preussen at the head of them march valiantly forward in the reformation business while kurbrandenburg joachim i their senior cousin is talking loud at diets galloping to innspruck and the like zealous on the conservative side and cardinal albert kurmainz his eloquent brother is eager to make matters smooth and avoid violent methods  the reformation was the great event of that sixteenth century according as a man did something in that or did nothing and obstructed doing has he much claim to memory or no claim in this age of ours the more it becomes apparent that the reformation was the event then transacting itself was the thing that germany and europe either did or refused to do the more does the historical significance of men attach itself to the phases of that transaction accordingly we notice henceforth that the memorable points of brandenburg history what of it sticks naturally to the memory of a reader or student connect themselves of their own accord almost all with the history of the reformation that has proved to be the law of nature in regard to them softly establishing itself and it is ours to follow that law  brandenburg not at first unanimously by no means too inconsiderately but with overwhelming unanimity when the matter became clear was lucky enough to adopt the reformationand stands by it ever since in its everwidening scope amid such difficulties as there might be brandenburg had felt somehow that it could do no other and ever onwards through the times even of our little fritz and farther if we will understand the word reformation brandenburg so feels being at this day to an honorable degree incapable of believing incredibilities of adopting solemn shams or pretending to live on spiritual moonshine which has been of uncountable advantage to brandenburghow could it fail this was what we must call obeying the audible voice of heaven to which same voice at that time all that did not give earwhat has become of them since have they not signally had the penalties to pay  penalties quarrel not with the old phraseology good reader attend rather to the thing it means the word was heard of old with a right solemn meaning attached to it from theological pulpits and such places and may still be heard there with a halfmeaning or with no meaning though it has rather become obsolete to modern ears but the thing should not have fallen obsolete the thing is a grand and solemn truth expressive of a silent law of heaven which continues forever valid the most untheological of men may still assert the thing and invite all men to notice it as a silent monition and prophecy in this universe to take it with more of awe than they are wont as a correct reading of the will of the eternal in respect of such matters and in their modern sphere to bear the same well in mind for it is perfectly certain and may be seen with eyes in any quarter of europe at this day  protestant or not protestant the question meant everywhere is there anything of nobleness in you o nation or is there nothing are there in this nation enough of heroic men to venture forward and to battle for gods truth versus the devils falsehood at the peril of life and more men who prefer death and all else to living under falsehoodwho once for all will not live under falsehood but having drawn the sword against it the time being come for that rare and important step throw away the scabbard and can say in pious clearness with their whole soul come on then life under falsehood is not good for me and we will try it out now let it be to the death between us then  once risen into this divine whiteheat of temper were it only for a season and not again the nation is thenceforth considerable through all its remaining history what immensities of dross and cryptopoisonous matter will it not burn out of itself in that high temperature in the course of a few years witness cromwell and his puritansmaking england habitable even under the charlessecond terms for a couple of centuries more nations are benefited i believe for ages by being thrown once into divine whiteheat in this manner and no nation that has not had such divine paroxysms at any time is apt to come to much  that was now in this epoch the english of adopting protestantism and we need not wonder at the results which it has had and which the want of it has had for the want of it is literally the want of loyalty to the maker of this universe he who wants that what else has he or can he have if you do not you man or you nation love the truth enough but try to make a chapmanbargain with truth instead of giving yourself wholly soul and body and life to her truth will not live with you truth will depart from you and only logic wit for example london wit sophistry virtu the aesthetic arts and perhaps for a short while bookkeeping by double entry will abide with you you will follow falsity and think it truth you unfortunate man or nation you will right surely you for one stumble to the devil and are every day and hour little as you imagine it making progress thither  austria spain italy france polandthe offer of the reformation was made everywhere and it is curious to see what has become of the nations that would not hear it in all countries were some that accepted but in many there were not enough and the rest slowly or swiftly with fatal difficult industry contrived to burn them out austria was once full of protestants but the hidebound flemishspanish kaiserelement presiding over it obstinately for two centuries kept saying no we with our dull obstinate cimburgis underlip and lazy eyes with our ponderous austrian depth of habituality and indolence of intellect we prefer steady darkness to uncertain new lightand all men may see where austria now is spain still more poor spain going about at this time making its pronunciamientos all the factious attorneys in its little towns assembling to pronounce virtually this the old is a lie thengood heavens after we so long tried hard harder than any nation to think it a truthand if it be not rights of man red republic and progress of the species we know not what now to believe or to do and are as a people stumbling on steep places in the darkness of midnightthey refused truth when she came and now truth knows nothing of them all stars and heavenly lights have become veiled to such men they must now follow terrestrial ignes fatui and think them stars that is the doom passed upon them  italy too had its protestants but italy killed them managed to extinguish protestantism italy put up silently with practical lies of all kinds and shrugging its shoulders preferred going into dilettantism and the fine arts the italians instead of the sacred service of fact and performance did music painting and the liketill even that has become impossible for them and no noble nation sunk from virtue to virtu ever offered such a spectacle before he that will prefer dilettantism in this world for his outfit shall have it but all the gods will depart from him and manful veracity earnestness of purpose devout depth of soul shall no more be his he can if he like make himself a soprano and sing for hireand probably that is the real goal for him  but the sharpestcut example is france to which we constantly return for illustration france with its keen intellect saw the truth and saw the falsity in those protestant times and with its ardor of generous impulse was prone enough to adopt the former france was within a hairsbreadth of becoming actually protestant but france saw good to massacre protestantism and end it in the night of st bartholomew 1572 the celestial apparitor of heavens chancery so we may speak the genius of fact and veracity had left his writ of summons writ was readand replied to in this manner the genius of fact and veracity accordingly withdrewwas staved off got kept away for two hundred years but the writ of summons had been served heavens messenger could not stay away forever no he returned duly with accounts run up on compound interest to the actual hour in 1792and then at last there had to be a protestantism and we know of what kind that was  nations did not so understand it nor did brandenburg more than the others but the question of questions for them at that time decisive of their history for half a thousand years to come was will you obey the heavenly voice or will you not     chapter ix  kurfurst joachim i  brandenburg in the matter of the reformation was at firstwith albert of mainz tetzels friend on the one side and pious george of anspach nit kop ab on the othercertainly a divided house but after the first act it conspicuously ceased to be divided nay kurbrandenburg and kurmainz themselves had known tendencies to the reformation and were well aware that the church could not stand as it was nor did the cause want partisans in berlin in brandenburghardly to be repressed from breaking into flame while kurfurst joachim was so prudent and conservative of this loud kurfurst joachim i here and there mentioned already let us now say a more express word 1484 1499 1535 birth accession death of joachim  joachim i big johns son hesitated hither and thither for some time trying if it would not do to follow the kaiser karl vs lead and at length crossed in his temper perhaps by the speed his friends were going at declared formally against any farther reformation and in his own family and country was strict upon the point he is a man as i judge by no means without a temper of his own very loud occasionally in the diets and elsewherereminds me a little of a certain king friedrich wilhelm whom my readers shall know by and by a big surly rather bottlenosed

complained to kaiser karl his brotherinlawwhose sister he had not used well kaiser karl listened to his complaints with hanging underlip with heavy deep undecipherable eyes evidently no help from karl

and last or with the elector of saxony friedrich the wise or after him with johann the steadfast v d m i ae whom we saw at augsburg who were his mothers brothers and beneficent men he was in saxony on

recognizably of the same kin as christian but her behavior is far different from his she too is zealous for the reformation but she has a right to be so and her notions that way are steady and she has

things looking now more ominous than ever of kurfurst joachim i will remember nothing farther except that once twentythree years before he held a tourney in neuruppin year 1612 tourney on the most magnificent scale and in newruppin pauli ii 466 a place we shall know by and by  as to the lady she lived eighteen years in that fine schloss of lichtenberg saw her children as we said and silently or otherwise rejoiced in the creed they were getting she saw luthers self sometimes had him several times to dinner he would call at her mansion when his journeys lay that way she corresponded with him diligently nay once for a three months she herself went across and lodged with dr luther and his kate as a royal lady might with a heroic sagethough the sages income was only twentyfour pounds sterling annually there is no doubt about that visit of three months one thinks of it as of something human something homely ingenuous and pretty nothing in surly joachims history is half so memorable to me or indeed memorable at all in the stage we are now come to  the lady survived joachim twenty years of these she spent eleven still at lichtenberg in no overhaste to return however her son the new elector declaring for protestantism she at length yielded to his invitations came back 1546 and ended her days at berlin in a peaceable and venerable manner luckless brother christian is lying under lockandkey all this while smuggling out messages and so on like a voice from the land of dreams or of nightmares painful impracticable coming now and then     chapter x  kurfurst joachim ii  joachim ii sixth elector no doubt after painful study and intricate silent consideration ever since his twelfth year when luther was first heard of over the world came gradually and before his fathers death had already come to the conclusion of adopting the confession of augsburg as the true interpretation of this universe so far as we had yet got and did so publicly in the year 1539 rentsch p 452 to the great joy of berlin and the brandenburg populations generally who had been of a protestant humor hardly restrainable by law for some years past by this decision joachim held fast with a stout weighty grasp nothing spasmodic in his way of handling the matter and yet a heartiness which is agreeable to see he could not join in the schmalkaldic war seeing it is probable small chance for such a war of many chiefs and little counsel nor was he willing yet to part from the kaiser karl v who was otherwise very good to him  he had fought personally for this kaiser twice over against the turks first as brandenburg captain learning his art and afterwards as kaisers generalissimo in 1542 he did no good upon the turks on that latter occasion as indeed what good was to be done in such a quagmire of futilities as joachims element there was too sumptuous in his dinners too much wine withal hint some calumniously paulus jovius c see pauli iii 7073 hector of germany say others he tried some small prefatory siege or scalade of pesth could not do it and came his ways home again as the best course pedant chroniclers give him the name hector joachim hectorto match that of cicero and that of achilles a man of solid structure this our hector in body and mind extensive cheeks very large heavyladen face capable of terrible bursts of anger as his kind generally were  the schmalkaldic war went to water as the germans phrase it kursachsenthat is johann friedrich the magnanimous son of johann v d m i ae and nephew of friedrich the wisehad his sorrowfully valid reasons for the war large force too plenty of zealous copartners philip of hessen and others but no generalship or not enough for such a business big army as is apt enough to happen fell short of food kaiser karl hung on the outskirts waiting confidently till it came to famine johann friedrich would attempt nothing decisive while provender lastedand having in the end strangely enough and somewhat deaf to advice divided his big army into three separate partsjohann friedrich was himself with one of those parts surprised at muhlberg on a sunday when at church 24th april 1547 and was there beaten to sudden ruin and even taken captive like to have his head cut off by the triumphant angry kaiser philip of hessen somewhat wiser was home to marburg safe with his part in the interimelector joachim ii of brandenburg had good reason to rejoice in his own cautious reluctances on this occasion however he did now come valiantly up hearing what severities were in the wind  he pleaded earnestly passionately he and cousin or already elector moritz pauli iii 102who was just getting johann friedrichs electorship fished away from him out of these troubles kurfurst 4th june 1547for johann friedrich of saxonys life first of all for johanns life first this is a thing not to be dispensed with your majesty on any terms whatever a sine qua non this life to protestant germany at large to which the kaiser indicated he would see not immediate death at any rate we will see a life that could not and must not be taken in this manner this was the first point then secondly that philip of hessen now home again at marburgnot a bad or disloyal man though headlong and with two wivesmight not be forfeited but that peace and pardon might be granted him on his entire submission to which second point the kaiser answered yes then on his submission these were the two points these pleadings went on at halle where the kaiser now lies in triumphantly victorious humor in the early days of june year 1547 johann friedrich of saxony had been by some imperial courtcouncil or otherspanish merely i supposedoomed to die sentence was signified to him while he sat at chess can wait till we end the game thought johannpergamus said he to his comrade let us go on then sentence not to be executed till one see  with philip of hessen things had a more conclusive aspect philip had accepted the terms procured for him which had been laboriously negotiated brought to paper and now wanted only the signmanual to them ohne einigen gefangnisswithout any imprisonment one of the chief clauses and so philip now came over to halle was met and welcomed by his two friends joachim and moritz at naumburg a stage before halleclear now to make his submission and beg pardon of the kaiser according to bargain on the morrow 19th june 1547 the papers were got signed and next day 20th june philip did according to bargain openly beg pardon of the kaiser in his majestys hall of audience town house of halle i suppose knelt at the kaisers feet publicly on both knees while his kanzler read the submission and entreaty as agreed upon and alas then the kaiser said nothing at all to him kaiser looked haughtily with impenetrable eyes and shelflip over the head of him gave him no hand to kiss and left poor philip kneeling there an awkward position indeedwhich any german painter that there were might make a picture of i have sometimes thought picture of some real meaning more or lessif for symbolic towers of babel medieval mythologies and extensive smearings of that kind he could find leisurephilip having knelt a reasonable time and finding there was no help for it rose in the dread silence some say with too sturdy an expression of countenance and retired from the affair having at least done his part of it  the next practical thing was now supper or as we of this age should call it dinner uncommonly select and high supper host the duke of alba where joachim elector moritz and another high official the bishop of arras were to welcome poor philip after his troubles how the grand supper went i do not hear possibly a little constrained the kaisers strange silence sitting on all mens thoughts not to be spoken of in the present company at length the guests rose to go away philips lodging is with moritz who is his soninlaw as learned readers know you philip your lodging is mine my lodging is yoursi should say cannot we ride togetherphilip is not permitted to go said imperial officiality philip is to continue here and we fear go to prisonprison cried they all ohne einigen gefangniss without any imprisonmentas we read the words it is ohne ewigen gefangniss without eternal imprisonment answer the others and so according to popular tradition which has little or no credibility though printed in many books their false secretary had actually modified it  no intention of imprisoning his durchlaucht of hessen forever not forever answered they and kurfurst joachim in astonished indignation after some remonstrating and arguing louder and louder which profited nothing blazed out into a very whirlwind of rage drew his sword it is whispered with a shudderdrew his sword or was for drawing it upon the duke of alba and would have done god knows what had not friends flung themselves between and got the duke away or him away pauli iii 103 other accounts bear that it was upon the bishop of arras he drew his sword which is a somewhat different matter perhaps he drew it on both or on men and things in generalfor his indignation knew no bounds the heavy solid man yet with a human heart in him after all and a hohenzollern abhorrence of chicanery capable of rising to the transcendent pitch his wars against the turks and his other hectorships i will forget but this of a face so extensive kindled all into divine fire for poor philips sake shall be memorable to me  philip got out by and by though with difficulty the kaiser proving very stiff in the matter and only yielding to obstinate pressures and the force of time and events philip got away and then how johann friedrich of sachsen after being led about for five years in the kaisers train a condemned man liable to be executed any day did likewise at last get away with his head safe and electorate gone these are known historical events which we glanced at already on another score  for by and by the kaiser found tougher solicitation than this of joachims the kaiser by his high carriage in this and other such matters had at length kindled a new war round him and he then soon found himself reduced to extremities again chased to the tyrol mountains and obliged to comply with many things new war of quite other emphasis and management than the schmalkaldic one managed by elector moritz and our poor friend albert alcibiades as principals a kaiser chased into the mountains capable of being seized by a little spurringcapture him said albert i have no cage big enough for such a bird answered moritz and the kaiser was let run how he ran then towards treaty of passau 1552 towards siege of metz and other sad conclusions abdication the finale of them these also are known phases in the reformation history as hinted at above  here at halle in the year 1547 the great kaiser with protestantism manacled at his feet and many things going prosperous was at his culminating point he published his interim 1548 what you troublesome protestants are to do in the mean time while the council of trent is sitting and till it and i decide for you and in short drove and reinedin the reich with a high hand and a sharp whip for the time being troublesome protestants mostly rejected the interim moritz and alcibiades with france in the rear of them took to arms in that way took to ransoming fat bishoprics verbum diaboli manet we know wheretook to chasing kaisers into the mountainsand times came soon round again in all these latter broils kurfurst joachim ii deeply interested as we may fancy strove to keep quiet and to prevail by weight of influence and wise counsel rather than by fighting with his kaiser  one sad little anecdote i recollect of joachim an accident which happened in those passauinterim days a year or two after that drawing of the sword on alba kurfurst joachim unfortunately once fell through a staircase in that time being as i guess a heavy man it was in the castle of grimnitz one of his many castles a spacious enough old huntingseat the repairs of which had not been well attended to the good herr weighty of foot was leading down his electress to dinner one day in this schloss of grimnitz broad stair climbs round a grand hall hung with stagtrophies groups of weapons and the like hallfurniture an unlucky timber yielded yawning chasm in the staircase joachim and his good princess sank by gravitation joachim to the floor with little hurt his poor princess horrible to think of being next the wall came upon the staghorns and boarspears down below pauli iii 112 the poor ladys hurt was indescribable she walked lame all the rest of her clays and joachim i hope hope but not with confidence ib iii 194 loved her all the better for it this unfortunate old schloss of grimnitz some thirty miles northward of berlin wasby the eighth kurfurst joachim friedrich grandson of this one with great renown to himself and to itconverted into an endowed high school the famed joachimsthal gymnasium still famed though now under some change of circumstances and removed to berlin itself nicolai p 725  joachims first wife from whom descend the

the accident at grimnitz was hedwig king sigismund of polands daughter which connection it is thought helped joachim well in getting what they call the mitbelehnung of preussen for it was he that achieved this point from king sigismund  mitbelehnung coinfeftment in preussenwhereby is solemnly acknowledged the right of joachim and his posterity to the reversion of preussen should the culmbach

rather scarce of heirs poor alcibiades died childless as we know and casimirs line is extinct duke albert himself has left only one son who now succeeds in preussen still young and not of the best omens margraf george the pious he left only george friedrich an excellent man who is now prosperous in the world and wedded long since but has no children so that between joachims line and preussen there are only two intermediate heirsand it was a thing eminently worth looking after nor has it wanted that and so kurfurst joachim almost at the end of his course has now made sure of it     joachim makes heritagebrotherhood with the duke of liegnitz  another feat of like nature joachim ii had long ago achieved which likewise in the longrun proved important in his family and in the history of the world an erbverbruderung so they term it with the duke of liegnitzdate 1537 erbverbruderung heritagebrotherhood meaning covenant to succeed reciprocally on failure of heirs to either had in all times been a common paction among german princes well affected to each other friedrich ii the then duke of liegnitz we have transiently seen was related to the family he had been extremely helpful in bringing his young friend albert of preussens affairs to a good issuewhose niece withal he had weddedin fact he was a close friend of this our joachims and there had long been a growing connection between the two houses by intermarriages and good offices  the dukes of liegnitz were sovereignprinces come of the old piasts of poland and had perfect right to enter into this transaction of an erbverbruderung with whom they liked true they had above two hundred years before in the days of king johann ichdien ad 1329 voluntarily constituted themselves vassals of the crown of bohemia pauli iii 22 but the right to dispose of their lands as they pleased had all along been carefully acknowledged and saved entire and so late as 1521 just sixteen years ago the bohemian king vladislaus the last our good margraf georges friend had expressly in a deed still extant confirmed to them with all the emphasis and amplitude that lawphraseology could bring to bear upon it the right to dispose of said lands in any manner of way by written testament or by verbal on their deathbed they can as they see wisest give away sell pawn dispose of and exchange vergeben verkaufen versetzen verschaffen verwechseln these said lands to all lengths and with all manner of freedom which privilege had likewise been confirmed twice over 1522 1524 by ludwig the next king ludwig ohnehaut who perished in the bogs of mohacz and ended the native line of bohemianhungarian kings nay ferdinand king of the romans karl vs brother afterwards kaiser who absorbed that bohemian crown among the others had himself by implication sanctioned or admitted the privilege in 1529 only eight years ago stenzel i 323 the right to make the erbverbruderung could not seem doubtful to anybody  and made accordingly it was signed sealed drawn out on the proper parchments 18th october 1537 to the following clear effect that if duke friedrichs line should die out all his liegnitz countries liegnitz brieg wohlau should fall to the hohenzollern brandenburgers and that if the line of hohenzollern brandenburg should first fail then all and singular the bohemian fiefs of brandenburg as crossen zullichau and seven others there enumerated should fall to the house of liegnitz stenzel i 320 it seemed a clear paction questionable by no mortal doublemarriage between the two houses eldest son on each side to suitable princess on the other was to follow and did follow after some delays 17th february 1545 so that the matter seemed now complete secure on all points and a matter of quiet satisfaction to both the houses and to their friends  but ferdinand king of the romans king of bohemia and hungary and coming to be emperor one day was not of that sentiment ferdinand had once implicitly recognized the privilege but ferdinand now when he saw the privilege turned to use and such a territory as liegnitz exposed to the possibility of falling into inconvenient hands explicitly took other thoughts and gradually determined to prohibit this erbverbruderung the states of bohemia accordingly in 1544 it is not doubtful by ferdinands suggestion were moved to make inquiries as to this heritagefraternity of liegnitz ib i 322 on which hint king ferdinand straightway informed the duke of liegnitz that the act was not justifiable and must be revoked the duke of liegnitz grieved to the heart had no means of resisting ferdinand king of the romans backed by kaiser karl with the states of bohemia barking at his wink were too strong for poor duke friedrich of liegnitz great corresponding between berlin liegnitz prag ensued on this matter but the end was a summons to duke friedrichsummons from king ferdinand in march 1546 to appear in the imperial hall kaiserhof at breslau and to submit that deed of ebverbruderung to the examination of the states there the states already up to the affair soon finished their examination of it 8th may 1546 the deed was annihilated and friedrich was ordered furthermore to produce proofs within six months that his subjects too were absolved of all oaths or the like regarding it and that in fact the transaction was entirely abolished and reduced to zero friedrich complied had to comply very much chagrined he returned home and died next yearit is supposed of heartbreak from this business he had yielded outwardly but to force only in a codicil appended to his last will some months afterwards which will written years ago had treated the erbverbruderung as a fact settled he indicates as with his last breath that he considered the thing still valid though overruled by the hand of power let the reader mark this matter for it will assuredly become memorable one day  the hand of power namely ferdinand king of the romans had applied in like manner to joachim of brandenburg to surrender his portion of the deed and annihilate on his side too this erbverbruderung but joachim refused steadily and all his successors steadily to give up this bit of written parchment kept the same among their precious documents against some day that might come and i suppose it lies in the archives of berlin even now silently or in words asserting that the deed of heritagebrothership was good and that though some hands might have the power no hand could have the right to abolish it on those terms  how king ferdinand permitted himself such a procedure ferdinand says one of his latest apologists in this matter considered the privileges granted by his predecessors in respect to rights of sovereignty as fallen extinct on their death stenzel i 323 whichif reality and fact would but likewise be so kind as consider it sowas no doubt convenient for ferdinand  joachim was not so great with ferdinand as he had been with charles the imperial brother joachim and ferdinand had many debates of this kind some of them rather stiff jagerndorf for instance and the baireuthanspach confiscations in george friedrichs minority ferdinand now kaiser had snatched jagerndorf from poor young george friedrich son of excellent margraf george whom we knew part of the spoils of albert alcibiades thought ferdinand and a good windfallthough young george friedrich had merely been the ward of cousin alcibiades and totally without concern in those political explosions excellent windfall thought ferdinand and held his grip but joachim in his weighty steady way intervened joachim emphatic in the diets and elsewhere made ferdinand quit grip and produce jagerndorf again jagerndorf and the rest had all to be restored and except some filchings in the jagerndorf appendages ratibor and oppeln restored only in semblance and at length juggled away altogether rentsch pp 129 130 everything came to its right owner again nor would joachim rest till alcibiadess territories too were all punctually given back to this same george friedrich to whom by law and justice they belonged in these points joachim prevailed against a stronghanded kaiser apt to consider ones rights fallen extinct now and then in this of liegnitz all he could do was to keep the deed in steady protest silent or vocal  but enough now of joachim hector sixth kurfurst and of his workings and his strugglings he walked through this world treading as softly as might be yet with a strong weighty step rending the jungle steadily asunder well seeing whither he was bound rather an expensive herr built a good deal

is poor thrift to be stingy of your seedcorn  joachim was always a conspicuous public man a busy politician in the reich stanch to his kindred and by no means blind to himself or his own interests stanch also we must grant and ever active though generally in a cautious weighty never in a rash swift way to the great cause of protestantism and to all good causes he was himself a solemnly devout

joachims deathscene has a mild pious beauty which does not depend on creed  he had a brother too not a little occupied with politics and always on the good side a wise pious man whose fame was in all the churches johann of custrin called also johann the wise who busied himself zealously in protestant matters second only in piety and zeal to his cousin margraf george the pious and was not so held back by official considerations as his brother the elector now and then johann of custrin is a very famous man in the old books johann was the first that fortified custrin built himself an illustrious schloss and roofed it with copper in custrin which is a place we shall be well acquainted with by and by and lived there with the neumark for apanage a true mans lifemostly with a good deal of

schmalkaldic wars not the comfortable side for joachims conscience but the safe side for an anxious father kaiser made a knight of this young prince on one occasion of distinction he wrote often to papa about him what a promising young hero he wasseems really to have liked the young man it was johann george elector afterwards seventh electorthis little incident is known to me on evidence rentsch p 465 a small thing that certainly befell at the siege of wittenberg ad 1547 during those philipofhessen negotiations three hundred and odd years ago  the schmalkaldic war having come all to nothing the saxon elector sitting captive with sword overhead in the way we saw saxon wittenberg was besieged and the kaiser was in great hurry to get it kaiser in person and young johann george for sole attendant rode round the place one day to take a view of the works and judge how soon or whether ever it could be compelled to give in gunners noticed them from the battlements gunners saxonprotestant most likely and in just gloom at the perils and indignities now lying on their pious kurfurst johann friedrich the magnanimous lo you kaisers self riding yonder and one of his silk junkers suppose we gave the kaisers self a shot then said the gunner or thought it might help a better man from his lifeperils if such shot did in fact the gun flashed off with due outburst and almost with due effect the ball struck the ground among the very horses feet of the two riders so that they were thrown or nearly so and covered from sight with a cloud of earth and sandand the gunners thought for some instants an unjust obstinate kaisers life was gone and a pious electors saved but it proved not so kaiser karl and johann george both emerged in a minute or two little the worsekaiser karl perhaps blushing somewhat and flurried this time i think in the impenetrable eyes and his cimburgis lip closed for the momentand galloped out of shotrange i never forget this little incident exclaims smelfungus it is one of the few times i can get after all my reading about that surprising karl v i do not say the least understanding or practical conception of him and his character and his affairs but the least ocular view or imagination of him as a fact among facts which is unlucky for smelfungusjohann george still more emphatically never to the end of his life forgot this incident and indeed it must be owned had the shot taken effect as intended the whole course of human things would have been surprisingly alteredand for one thing neither frederich the great nor the present history of friedrich had ever risen above ground or troubled an enlightened public or me  of johann george this seventh elector 1525 15711598 who proved a good governor and carried on the family affairs in the old style of slow steady success i will remember nothing more except that he had the surprising number of threeandtwenty children one of them posthumous though he died at the age of seventythree  he

evident would be the last duke there of his line joachim friedrich having himself fallen a widower did next year though now counting fiftysixbut it will be better if we explain first a little how matters now stood with preussen     chapter xii  of albert friedrich the second duke of preussen  duke albert died in 1568 laden with years and in his latter time greatly broken down by other troubles his prussian raths councillors were disobedient his osianders and lutherancalvinist theologians were all in fire and flame against each other the poor old man with the best dispositions but without power to realize them had much to do and to suffer pious just and honorable intending the best but losing his memory and incapable of business as he now complained in his sixtieth year he had married a second time a young brunswick princess with whose foolish brother eric he had much trouble and who at last herself took so ill with the insolence and violence of these intrusive councillors and theologians that the householdlife she led beside her old husband and them became intolerable to her and she withdrew to another residencea little huntingseat at neuhausen half a dozen miles from konigsbergand there or at labiau still farther off lived mostly in a separate condition for the rest of her life separate for lifenevertheless they happened to die on the same day 20th march 1568 they were simultaneously delivered from their troubles in this world hubner t 181 stenzel i 342  albert left one son the second child of this last wife his one child by the former wife a daughter now of good years was married to the duke of mecklenburg sons name was albert friedrich age at his fathers death fifteen a promising young prince but of sensitive abstruse temperheld under heavy tutelage by his raths and theologians and spurting up against them in explosive rebellion from time to time he now 1568 was to be sovereign duke of preussen and the one representative of the culmbach line in that fine territory margraf george friedrich of anspach the only other culmbacher being childless though wedded  we need not doubt the brandenburg houseold kurfurst joachim ii still alive and thrifty johann george the heirapparentkept a watchful eye on those emergencies but it was difficult to interfere directly the native prussian raths were very jealous and poland itself was a ticklish sovereignty to deal with albert friedrich being still a minor the polish king sigismund proposed to undertake the guardianship of him as became a superior lord to a subject vassal on such an occasion but the prussian raths assured his majesty their young prince was of such a lively intellect he was perfectly fit to conduct the affairs of the government especially with such a body of expert councillors to help him and might be at once declared of age which was accordingly the course followed poland caring little for it brandenburg digesting the arrangement as it could and thus it continued for some years even under new difficulties that arose the official clique of raths being the real government of the country and poor young albert friedrich bursting out occasionally into tears against them occasionally into futile humors of a fiery nature osiandertheology and the battle of the doxies ran very high nor was prussian officiality a beautiful thing  these prussian raths and the prussian ritterschaft generally knightage landaristocracy which had its stande states or meetings of parliament after a sort were all along of a mutinous contumacious humor the idea had got into their minds that they were by birth what the ancient ritters by election had been entitled fit or not fit to share the government promotions among them the duke is hereditary in his office why not we all offices are they not by nature ours to share among us the dukes notion again was to have the work of his offices effectually done small matter by whom the ritters looked less to that side of the questionregarded any foreigner germananspacher or other nonprussian whatever his merit as an intruder usurper or kind of thief when seen in office their contentions contumacies and pretensions were accordingly manifold they had dreams of an aristocratic republic with the sovereign reduced to zero like what their polish neighbors grew to they had various dreams and individuals among them broke out from time to time into high acts of insolence and mutiny it took a hundred and fifty years of brandenburg horsebreaking sometimes with sharp manipulation and a potent curbbit to dispossess them of that notion and make them go steadily in harness which also however was at last got done by the hohenzollerns     of duke albert friedrichs marriage who his wife was and what her possible dowry  in a year or two there came to be question of the marrying of young duke albert friedrich after due consultation the princess fixed upon was maria eleonora eldest daughter of the then duke of cleve to him a proper embassy was sent with that object and came back with yes for answer duke of cleve at that time was wilhelm called the rich in historybooks a sovereign of some extent in those lower rhine countries whom i can connect with the english readers memory in no readier way than by the fact that he was younger brother one year younger of a certain anne of clevesa large fat lady who was rather scurvily used in this country being called by henry viii and us a great flanders mare unsuitable for espousal with a king of delicate feelings this anne of cleves who took matters quietly and lived on her pension when rejected by king henry was aunt of the young lady now in question for preussen she was still alive here in england pleasantly quiet at burley on the hill till maria eleonora was seven years oldwho possibly enough still reads in her memory some fading vestige of new black frocks or trimmings and brief courtmourning on the death of poor aunt anne over seasanother aunt is more honorably distinguished sibylla wife of our noble saxon elector johann friedrich the magnanimous who lost his electorate and almost his life for religions sake as we have seen by whom in his perils and distresses sibylla stood always like a very true and noble wife  duke wilhelm himself was a man of considerable mark in his day his duchy of cleve included not only cleveproper but julich juliers berg which latter pair of duchies were a better thing than cleveproperjulich berg and various other small principalities which gradually agglomerating by marriage heritage and the chance of events in successive centuries had at length come all into wilhelms hands so that he got the name of wilhelm the rich among his contemporaries he seems to have been of a headlong blustery uncertain disposition much tossed about in the controversies of his day at one time he was a protestant declared not without reasons of various kinds the duchy of geldern what we call guelders had fallen to him by express bequest of the last owner whose line was out and wilhelm took possession but the kaiser karl v quite refused to let him keep possession whereupon wilhelm had joined with the french it was in the moritzalcibiades time had declared war and taken other high measures but it came to nothing or to less the end was wilhelm had to come upon his knees before the kaiser and beg forgiveness quite renouncing geldern which accordingly has gone its own different road ever since wilhelm was zealously protestant in those days as his people are and as he still is at the period we treat of but he went into papistry not long after and made other sudden turns and misventures to all appearance rather an abrupt blustery uncertain herr it is to him that albert friedrich the young duke of preussen guided by his council now year 1572 sends an embassy demanding his eldest daughter maria eleonora to wife  duke wilhelm answered yea sent a counterembassy with whatever else was necessary and in due time the young bride with her father set out towards preussen such being the arrangement there to complete the matter they had got as far as berlin warmly welcomed by the kurfurst johann george when from konigsberg a sad message reached them namely that the young duke had suddenly been seized with an invincible depression and overclouding of mind not quite to be characterized by the name of madness but still less by that of perfect sanity his eagerness to see his bride was the same as formerly but his spiritual health was in the questionable state described the young lady paused for a little in such mood as we may fancy she had already lost two offers bridegrooms snatched away by death says pauli pauli iv 512 and thought it might be ominous to refuse the third so she decided to go on dashed aside her fathers doubts sent her unhealthy bridegroom a flowergarland as lovetoken who duly responded and father wilhelm and she proceeded as if nothing were wrong the spiritual state of the prince she found had not been exaggerated to her his humors and ways were strange questionable other than one could have wished such as he was however she wedded him on the appointed termshoping probably for a recovery which never came  the case of alberts malady is to this day dim and strange tales are current as to the origin of it which the curious in physiology may consult they are not fit for reporting here ib iv 476 it seems to have consisted in an overclouding rather than a total ruin of the mind incurable depression there was gloomy torpor alternating with fits of vehement activity or suffering great discontinuity at all timesevident unfitness for business it was long hoped he might recover and doctors in divinity and in medicine undertook him theologians exorcists physicians quacks but no cure came of it nothing but mutual condemnations violences and even execrations from the said doctors and their respective official patrons lay and clerical must have been such a scene for a young wife as has seldom occurred in romance or reality children continued to be born daughter after daughter but no son that lived     margraf george

witnesses an excellent governor and for sixandtwenty years administered the country with great and lasting advantage to it his portraits represent to us a large ponderous figure of a man very fat in his latter years with an air of honest sense dignity composed solidityvery fit for the task now on hand  he resolutely though in mild form smoothed down the flaming fires of his clergy commanding now

still ticklish in spite of rights and liable to perverse accidents that may arise  joachim friedrich as we intimated once was not wanting to himself on this occasion but the affair was full of intricacies a very waspsnest of angry humors and required to be handled with delicacy though with force and decision joachim friedrichs eldest son johann sigismund electoral prince of brandenburg had already in 1594 married one of albert friedrich the hypochondriac duke of preussens daughters and there was a promising family of children no lack of children nevertheless prudent joachim friedrich

assurance doubly sure a man not to be balked if he can help it by virtue of excellent managementduchess prussian stande states and polish crown needing all to be contentedjoachim friedrich with gentle strong pressure did furthermore squeeze his way into the actual guardianship of preussen and the imbecile duke which was his by right this latter feat he achieved in the course of another year 11th march 1605 stenzel i 358 and thereby fairly got hold of preussen which he grasped knuckleswhite as we may say and which his descendants have never quitted since  good management was very necessary the thing was difficultand also was of more importance than we yet altogether see not preussen only but a still better country the duchy of cleve clevejulich duke wilhelms heritage down in the

of brandenburg and its expectancies was instantly despatched from berlin to gather up the threads cut loose by that event and see that the matter took no damage on the road thither news reached him

so young being full thirtyfive and of fair experiencewas in difficulty under these overwhelming tidings and puzzled for a little whether to advance or to return he decided to advance and settle prussian matters where the peril and the risk were brandenburg business he could do by rescripts  his difficulties in preussen and at the polish court were in fact immense but after a space of eight or nine months he did by excellent management not sparing money judiciously laid out on individuals arrive at some adjustment better or worse and got preussen in hand 29th april 1609 stenzel i 370 legal administrator of the imbecile duke as his father had been after which he had to run for brandenburg without loss of time great matters being there in the wind nothing wrong in brandenburg indeed but the great cleve heritage is dropping has dropped over in cleve an immense expectancy is now come to the point of deciding itself     how the cleve heritage dropped and many sprang to pick it up  wilhelm of cleve the explosive duke whom we saw at berlin and konigsberg at the wedding of this poor lady now deceased had in the marriagecontract as he did in all subsequent contracts and deeds of like nature announced a settlement of his estates which was now become of the highest moment for johann sigismund the country at that time called duchy of cleve consisted as we said above not only of cleveproper but of two other still better duchies julich and berg then of the grafschaft county of ravensburg county of mark lordship ofin fact it was a multifarious agglomerate of many little countries gathered by marriage heritage and luck in the course of centuries and now united in the hand of this duke wilhelm it amounted perhaps to two yorkshires in extent see busching erdbeschreibung v 642734 a naturally opulent country of fertile meadows shipping capabilities metalliferous hills and at this time in consequence of the dutchspanish war and the multitude of protestant refugees it was getting filled with ingenious industries and rising to be what it still is the busiest quarter of germany a country lowing with kine the hum of the flaxspindle heard in its cottages in those old daysmuch of the linen called hollands is made in julich and only bleached stamped and sold by the dutch says busching a country in our days which is shrouded at short intervals with the due canopy of coalsmoke and loud with sounds of the anvil and the loom  this duchy of cleve all this fine agglomerate of duchies duke wilhelm settled were to be inherited in a piece by his eldest or indeed as it soon proved his only son and the heirs of that son if there were any failing heirs of that only son then the entire duchy of cleve was to go to maria eleonora as eldest daughter now marrying to friedrich albert duke of prussia and to their heirs lawfully begotten heirs female if there happened to be no male the other sisters of whom there were three were none of them to have the least pretence to inherit cleve or any part of it on the contrary they were in such event of the eldest daughter or her heirs coming to inherit cleve to have each of them a sum of ready money paid 200000 goldgulden about 100000 pounds pauli vi 542 iii 504 by the said inheritrix of cleve or her heirs and on receiving that were to consider their claims entirely fulfilled and to cease thinking of cleve for the future  this settlement by express privilege of kaiser karl v nay of kaiser maximilian before him and the laws of the reich duke wilhelm doubted not he was entitled to make and this settlement he made his lawyers writing down the terms in their wearisome way perhaps six times over and struggling by all methods to guard against the least misunderstanding cleve with all its appurtenances julich berg and the rest goes to the eldest sister and her heirs male or female if she have no heirs male or female then but not till then the next sister steps into her shoes in that matter but if she have then we repeat for the sixth and last time no sister or sisters representative has the least word to say to it but takes her 100000 pounds and ceases thinking of cleve  the other three sisters were all gradually marriedone of them to pfalzneuburg an eminent prince in the bavarian region called the oberpfalz upper palatinate who or at least whose eldest son is much worth mentioning and remembering by us hereand in all these marriagecontracts wilhelm and his lawyers expressed themselves to the like effect and in the like elaborate sixfold manner so that wilhelm and they thought there could nowhere in the world be any doubt about it  shortly after signing the last of these marriagecontracts or perhaps it was in the course of signing them duke wilhelm had a stroke of palsy he had before that gone into papistry again poor man the truth is he had repeated strokes and being an abrupt explosive herr he at last quite yielded to palsy and sank slowly out of the world in a cloud of semiinsanity which lasted almost twenty years died 25th january 1592 age 76 duke wilhelm did leave a son johann wilhelm who succeeded him as duke but this son also proved explosive went half and at length wholly insane jesuit priests and their intrigues to bring back a protestant country to the bosom of the church wrapped the poor man all his days as in a burning nessusshirt and he did little but mischief in the world he married had no children he accused his innocent wife the jesuits and he of infidelity got her judged not properly sentenced and then strangled her he and they in her bedjacobea of baden 1597 a thricetragic history then he married again jesuits being extremely anxious for an orthodox heir but again there came no heir there came only new blazings of the nessusshirt in fine the poor man died spring 1609 and made the world rid of him died 25th march 1609 that is the precise dateabout a month before our new elector johann sigismund got his affairs winded up at the polish court and came galloping home in such haste there was pressing need of him in the cleve regions  for the painful exactitude of duke wilhelm and his lawyers has profited little and there are claimants on claimants rising for that valuable cleve country as indeed johann sigismund had anticipated and been warned from all quarters to expect for months past he has had his faculties bent with lynxeyed attention on that scene of things doubly and trebly impatient to get preussen soldered up ever since this other matter came to the burstingpoint what could be done by the utmost vigilance of his deputies he had done it was the 25th of march when the mad duke died on the 4th of april johann sigismunds deputy attended by a notary to record the act fixed up the brandenburg arms on the governmenthouse of cleve pauli vi 566 on the 5th they did the same at dusseldorf on the following days at julich and the other towns but already on the 5th they had hardly got done at dusseldorf when

is not she nearest of kin second daughter true but the daughter not daughter of a daughter as you are as your serene electress is o durchlaucht of brandenburgconsider besides you are female i am male that was pfalzneuburgs logic none of the best i think in forensic genealogy his tenth point was perhaps rather weak but he had possession copossession and the nine points good the other two sisters by their sons or husbands claimed likewise but not the whole divide it said they that surely is the real meaning of karl vs deed of privilege to make such a testament divide it among the four daughters or their representatives and let us all have shares  nor were these four claimants by any means all the saxon princes next claimed two sets of saxon princes first the minor set gothaweimar and the rest the ernestine line so called representatives of johann friedrich the magnanimous who lost the electorate for religions sake at muhlberg in the past century and from major became minor in saxon genealogy magnanimous johann friedrich said they had to wife an aunt of the now deceased duke of cleve wife sibylla sister of the flanders mare of famous memory our lineal ancestress in favor of whom her father the then reigning duke of cleve made a marriagecontract of precisely similar import to this your prussian one he and barred all his descendants if contracts are to be valid this is the claim of the ernestine line of saxon princes not like to go for much in their present disintegrated condition  but the albertine line the present elector of saxony also claims here is a deed said he executed by kaiser friedrich iii in the year 1483 pauli ubi supra hubner t 286 generations before your kaiser karl deed solemnly granting to albert junior of sachsen and to his heirs the reversion of those same duchies should the male line happen to fail as it was then likely to do how could kaiser max revoke his fathers deed or kaiser karl his greatgrandfathers little albert the albert of the prinzenraub he who grew big and fought lionlike for his kaiser in the netherlands and western countries he and his have clearly the heirship of cleve by right and we now grown electors and seniors of saxony demand it of a grateful house of hapsburgand will study to make ourselves convenient in return  nay if that is your rule that old laws and deeds are to come in bar of new we cry a multitude of personsfrench dukes of nevers and all manner of remote exotic figures among themwe are the real heirs ravensburg mark berg ravenstein this patch and the other of that large duchy of yours were they not from primeval time expressly limited to heirsmale heirsmale and we now are the nearest heirsmale of said patches and portions and will prove itin short there never was such a lawsuitso fat an affair for the attorney species if that had been the way of managing itas this of cleve was likely to prove     the kaisers thoughts about it and the worlds  what greatly complicated the affair too was the interest the kaiser took in it the kaiser could not well brook a powerful protestant in that country still less could his cousin the spaniard spaniards worn to the ground coercing that worldfamous dutch revolt and astonished to find that they could not coerce it at all had resolved at this time to take breath before trying farther spaniards and dutch after fifty years of such fighting as we know have made a twelveyears truce 1609 but the battled spaniard panting pale in his futile rage and sweat has not given up the matter he is only taking breath and will try it again now cleve is his road into holland in such adventure no success possible if cleve be not in good hands brandenburg is protestant powerful brandenburg will not do for a neighbor there  nor will pfalzneuburg a protestant of protestants this palatine neuburg toojunior branch possible heir in time coming of kurpfalz elector palatine himself in the rhine countries of kurpfalz who is acknowledged chief protestant official president of the evangelical union they have lately made among them in these menacing timespfalzneuburg too this young wolfgang wilhelm if he do not break off kind might be very awkward to the kaiser in clevejulich nay saxony itself for they are all protestantsunless perhaps saxony might become pliant and try to make itself useful to a munificent imperial house  evidently what would best suit the kaiser and spaniards were this that no strong power whatever got footing in cleve to grow stronger by the possession of such a countrybetter than best it would suit if he the kaiser could himself get it smuggled into his hands and there hold it fast which privately was the course resolved upon at headquartersin this way the succession controversy of the cleve duchies is coming to be a very high matter mixing itself up with the grand protestantpapal controversy the general armedlawsuit of mankind in that generation kaiser spaniard dutch english french henri iv and all mortals are getting concerned in the decision of it     chapter xiv  symptoms of a great war coming  meanwhile brandenburg and neuburg both hold grip of cleve in that manner with a mutually menacing inquiring expression of countenance each grasps it so to speak convulsively with the one hand and has with the other hand his sword by the hilt ready to fly out but to understand this brandenburgneuburg phenomenon and the then significance of the clevejulich controversy we must take the following bits of chronology along with us for the german empire with protestant complaints and papist usurpations and severities was at this time all a continent of sour thick smoke already breaking out into dullred flashes here and theresymptoms of the universal conflagration of a thirtyyears war which followed sympton first is that of donauworth and dates above a year back     first symptom donauworth 1608  donauworth a protestant imperial freetown in the bavarian regions had been for some fault on the part of the populace against a flaring massprocession which had no business to be there put under ban of the empire had been seized accordingly december 1607 and much cuffed and shaken about by duke maximilian of bavaria as executor of the said ban michaeelis ii 216 buddaei lexicon i 853who what was still worse would by no means give up the town when he had done with it town being handy to him and the man being stout and violently papist hence the evangelical union which we sawwhich has not taken donauworth yet nor ever will donauworth never was retaken but is bavarian at this hour a town namable in history ever since not to say withal that it is where marlborough did the lines of schellenberg long after schellenberg jinglehill so to render it looks down across the danube or donau river upon donauworthits lines and other histories now much abolished and quiet under grass  but now all protestantism sounding everywhere in angry mournful tone donauwarth give up donauworthand an evangelical union with moneys with theoretic contingents of force being on foot for that and the like objectswe can fancy what a scramble this of clevejulich was like to be and especially what effect this duelling attitude of brandenburg and neuburg had on the protestant mind protestant neighbors landgraf moritz of hessencassel at their head intervene in tremulous haste in the clevejulich affair peace o friends some bargain peaceable jointpossession any temporary bargain till we see can two protestants fall to slashing one another in such an aspect of the reich and its jesuitriesand they did agree dortmund 10th may 1609 the first of their innumerable agreements to some temporary jointpossessionthe thricethankful country doing homage to both with oath to the one that shall be found genuine and they did endeavor to govern jointly and to keep the peace on those terms though it was not easy  for the kaiser had already said or his aulic council and spanish cousin poor kaiser rodolf caring too little about these things rodolf ii keplers too insolvent patron 15761612 then matthias rodolfs brother 16121619 rather tolerant to protestantsthen ferdinand ii his uncles son 16191637 much the reverse of tolerant by whom mainly came the thirtyyears warwere the kaisers of this period  ferdinand iii son of ii 16371657 who finished out the thirtyyears war partly by fighting of his own in young days battle of nordlingen his grandest feat was father of  kaiser leopold 1658 1705whose two sons were kaiser joseph 17051711 and kaiser karl vi 17111740 maria theresas father had already said cleve must absolutely not go into wrong hands for which what safe method is there but that the kaiser himself become proprietor a letter is yet extant from the aulic council to their vicechancellor who had been sent to negotiate this matter with the parties letter to the effect that such result was the only good one that it must be achieved that he must devise all manner of quirks alle spitzfindigkeiten auffordern sollte and achieve it pauli iii 5055 this curious letter of a sublime aulic council or imperial hofrath to its vicekanzler still exists  and accordingly quirks did not prove undevisable on behalf of the kaiser since you cannot agree said the kaiser and there are so many of you who claim we having privately stirred up several of you to the feat there will be nothing for it but the kaiser must put the country under sequestration and take possession of it with his own troops till a decision be arrived atwhich probably will not be soon   second symptom seizure of julich by the kaiser and siege and recapture of it by the protestant parties 1610 whereupon whereupon catholic league to balancee evangelical union  and the kaiser forthwith did as he had said sent archduke leopold with troops who forcibly took the castle of julich commanding all other castles and places to surrender and sequestrate themselves in like fashion threatening brandenburg and neuburg in a dreadful manner with reichsacht ban of the empire if they presumed to show contumacy upon which brandenburg and neuburg ranking themselves together showed decided contumacy tore down the kaisers proclamation ib iii 524 emperors proclamation in dusseldorf 23d july 1609taken down solemnly 1st august 1609 having good help at their back  and accordingly on the 4th of september 1610 after a twomonths siege they or the dutch french and evangelical union troops bombarding along with them and many english volunteers to help retook julich and packed leopold away again ib iii 527 the dutch and the french were especially anxious about this cleve businesspoor henri iv was just putting those french troops in motion towards julich when ravaillac the distracted devilsjesuit did his stroke upon him so that another than henri had to lead in that expedition the actual captain at the siege was prince christian of anhalt by repute the first soldier of germany at that period he had a horse shot under him the business being very hot and furioushe had still worse fortune in the course of years there were many english volunteers at this siege english nation hugely interested in it though their king would not act except diplomatically it was the talk of all the then worldthe evening song and the morning prayer of protestants especiallytill it was got ended in this manner it deserves to rank as sympton second in this business far bigger flare of dull red in the universal smokecontinent than that of donauworth had been are there no memorials left of those english volunteers then in carlyles  miscellanies vi two hundred and fifty years ago a fragment about duels is one small scene belonging to them alas they might get edited as bromleys royal letters areand had better lie quiet  evangelical union formed some two years before with what cause we saw has kurpfalz winterkings father died 9th september 1610 few days after this recapture of julich at the head of it but its troops or operations were never of a very forcible character kurbrandenburg now joined it formally as did many more kursachsen anxious to make himself convenient in other quarters never would add to these phenomena the now decisive appearance of a catholic liga league of catholic princes which by way of counterpoise to the union had been got up by duke maximilian of bavaria several months ago and which now under the same guidance in these bad circumstances took a great expansion of figure duke maximilian donauworth max finding the evangelical union go so very high and his own kaiser like to be good for little in such business poor hypochondriac kaiser rodolf ii more taken up with turninglooms and blowpipes than with matters political who accordingly is swept out of julich in such summary waydonauworth max has seen this a necessary institution in the present aspectboth union and league rapidly waxed under the sound of the julich cannon as was natural  kursachsen for standing so well aloof from the union got from the thankful kaiser written titles for these duchies of cleve and julich imperial parchments and infestments of due extent but never any territory in those parts he never offered fight for his pretensions and brandenburg and neuburgneuburg especiallyalways answered him no with sword halfdrawn so kursachsen faded out again and took only parchments by the adventure practically there was no private competitor of moment to brandenburg except this wolfgang wilhelm of pfalzneuburg he alone having clutched holdbut we hasten to symptom third which particularly concerns us and will be intelligible now at last     symptom third a dinnerscene at dusseldorf 1613 spaniards and dutch shoulder arms in cleve  brandenburg and neuburg stood together against third parties but their jointgovernment was apt to fall in two when left to itself and the pressure of danger withdrawn they governed by the raths and stande of the country old methods and old official men each of the two had his own viceregent statthalter present on the ground who jointly presided as they could jarrings were unavoidable but how mend it settle the litigated territory itself and end their big lawsuit they could not often as they tried it with the whole world encouraging and urging them old sir henry wotton provost of eton in his old days remembers how he went ambassador on this errandas on many others equally bootlessand writes himself legatus not only thrice to venice twice to c c but also once to holland in the juliers matter semel in juliacensi negotio see reliquiae wottonianae london 1672 preface it was in 1614 say the biographies vaguely his despatches are they in the paperoffice still his good old book deserves new editing his good old genially pious life a proper elucidation by some faithful man the meetings they had and the treaties and temporary bargains they made and kept and could not keep in these and in the following years and generations pass our power of recording  in 1613 the brandenburg statthalter was ernst the electors younger brother wolfgang wilhelm in person for his father or rather for himself as heir of his mother represented pfalzneuburg ernst of brandenburg had adopted calvinism as his creed a thing hateful and horrible to the lutheran mind of which sort was wolfgang wilhelm to a degree now altogether inconceivable discord arose in consequence between the statthalters as to official appointments sacred and secular you are for promoting calvinistsand you i see are for promoting lutheransjohann sigismund himself had to intervene wolfgang wilhelm and he had their meetings friendly colloquiesthe final celloquy of which is still memorable and issues in symptom third  we said a strong flame of choler burnt in all these hohenzollerns though they held it well down johann sigismund an excellent man of business knew how essential a mild tone is nevertheless he found as this colloquy went on that human patience might at length get too much the scene after some examination is conceivable in this wise place dusseldorf electors apartment in the schloss there time late in the year 1613 day not discoverable by me the two sat at dinner after much colloquy all morning johann sigismund a middleaged bigheaded sternfaced honestlooking man hair cropped i observe and eyelids slightly contracted as if for sharper vision into matters wolfgang wilhelm of features fallen dim to me an airy gentleman well out of his teens but i doubt not of wisdom sufficient evidently very high and stiff in his ways  his proposal by way of final settlement and end to all these brabbles was this and he insisted on it give me your eldest princess to wife let her dowry be your whole claim on clevejulich i will marry her on that condition and we shall be friends here evidently is a gentleman that does not want for conceit in himselfconsider too in johann sigismunds opinion he had no right to a square inch of these territories though for peace sake a joint share had been allowed him for the time on that condition jackanapes thought johann sigismund my girl is not a monster nor at a loss for husbands fully better than you i should hope this he thought and could not help thinking but endeavored to say nothing of it the young jackanapes went on insisting nature at last prevailed johann sigismund lifted his hand princely etiquettes melting all into smoke on the sudden and gave the young jackanapes a slap over the face veritable slap which opened in a dreadful manner the eyes of young pfalzneuburg to his real situation and sent him off highflaming vowing neverimagined vengeance a remarkable slap well testified tothough the old histories struck blank with terror reverence and astonishment can for most part only symbol it in dumbshow pufendorf rer brandenb lib iv 16 p 213 and many others are in this case tobias pfanner historia pacis westphalicae lib i 9 p 26 is explicit neque ut infida

now wolfgang wilhelm flaming off in neverimagined vengeance posted straight to munchen to max of bavaria there declared himself convinced or nearly so of the romancatholic religion wooed and in a few weeks 10th november 1613 wedded maxs younger sister and soon after at dusseldorf pompously professed such his blessed change of beliefwith immense flourish of trumpeting and jubilant pamphleteering from holy church kohler ubi supra his poor old father the devoutest of protestants wailed aloud his ichabod the glory is departedholding weekly fast and humiliation ever afterand died in few months of a broken heart the catholic league has now a new member on those terms  and on the other hand johann sigismund nearly with the like haste 25th december 1613 declared himself convinced of calvinism his younger brothers creed pauli iii 546which continues ever since the brandenburg courtcreed that of the people being mostly lutheran men said it was to please the dutch to please the julichers most of whom are calvinist apologetic pauli is elaborate but inconclusive it was very ill taken at berlin where even popular riot arose on the matter in prussia too it had its drawbacks ib iii 544 michaelis i 349  and now all being full of mutation rearrangement and infinite rumor there marched next year 1614 on slight pretext resting on great suspicions spanish troops into the julichcleve country and countenanced by neuburg began seizing garrisons there whereupon dutch troops likewise marched countenanced by brandenburg and occupied other fortresses and garrisons and so in every strongplace these were either papistspaniards or calvinistdutch who stood there fronting one another and could not by treatying be got out againlike clouds positively electric versus clouds negatively as indeed was getting to be the case of germany in general case fatally visible in every province principality and parish there till a thunderstorm and succession of thunderstorms of thirty years continuance broke out of which these huge rumors and mutations and menacings of war springing out of that final colloquy and slap in the face are to be taken as the third premonitory symptom spaniards and dutch stand electrically fronting one another in cleve for seven years till their truce is out before they clash together germany does not wait so long by a couple of years     symptom fourth and catastrophe upon the heels of it  five years more 1618 and there will have come a fourth symptom biggest of all rapidly consummating the processsymptom still famed of the following external figure three official gentlemen descending from a window in the castle of prag hurled out by impatient bohemian protestantism a depth of seventy feethappily only into dung and without loss of life from which follows a king of bohemia elected there king not unknown to usthunderclouds all in one huge clash and the continent of sour smoke blazing all into a continent of thunderous fire thirtyyears war as they now call it such a conflagration as poor germany never saw before or since  these were the four preliminary symptoms of that dismal business as to the primary causes of it says one of my authorities these lie deep deep almost as those of original sin but the proximate causes seem to me to have been these two first that the jesuitpriests and principalities had vowed and resolved to have by gods help and by the devils this was the peculiarity of it europe made orthodox again and then secondly the fact that a max of bavaria existed at that time whose fiery character cunning but rash head and fanatically papist heart disposed him to attempt that enterprise him with such resources and capacities under their bad guidance  johann sigismund did many swift decisive strokes of business in his time businesses of extensive and important nature but this of the slap to neuburg has stuck best in the idle memory of mankind dusseldorf year 1613 it was precisely in the time when that same friedrioh not yet by any means king of bohemia but already kurpfalz cousin of this neuburg and head man of the protestants was over here in england on a fine errandnamely had married the fair elizabeth 14th february 1613 james the firsts princess goody palsgrave as her mother floutingly called her not liking the connection what kind of a king of bohemia this friedrich made five or six years after and what sea of troubles he and his entered into we know the winterkonig winterking fallen in times of frost or built of mere frost a snowking altogether soluble again is the name he gets in german histories but here is another hook to hang chronology upon  this brief bohemian kingship had not yet exploded on the weissenberg of prag battle there sunday 8th november 1620 when old sir henry wotton being sent as ambassador to lie abroad as he wittily called it to his cost in that business saw in the city of lintz in the picturesque green country by the shores of the donau there an ingenious person who is now recognizable as one of the remarkablest of mankind mr john kepler namely keplar as wotton writes him addressing the great lord bacon unhappily without strict date of any kind on that among other subjects mr johns now evermemorable watching of those  motions of the star mars de motibus stellae martis prag 1609 with calculations repeated seventy times and also with discovery of the planetary laws of this universe some ten years ago appears to be unknown to wotton and bacon but there is something else of mr johns devising it seems baptista porta of naples dead some years before must have given him the essential hintof whom or whose hint mr john does not happen to inform his excellency at present which deserves attention from an instaurator of philosophy  he hath a little black tent of what stuff is not much importing says the ambassador which he can suddenly set up where he will in a field and it is convertible like a windmill to all quarters at pleasure capable of not much more than one man as i conceive and perhaps at no great ease exactly close and darksave at one hole about an inch and a half in the diameter to which he applies a long perspective trunk with the convex glass fitted to the said hole and the concave taken out at the other end which extendeth to about the middle of this erected tent through which the visible radiations of all the objects without are intromitted falling upon a paper which is accommodated to receive them and so he traceth them with his pen in their natural appearance turning his little tent round by degrees till he hath designed the whole aspect of the field reliqui wottonianae london 1672 p 300in fact he hath a camera obscura and is exhibiting the same for the delectation of imperial gentlemen lounging that way mr john invents such toys writes almanacs practises medicine for good reasons his encouragement from the holy roman empire and mankind being only a pension of 18 pounds a year and that hardly ever paid an ingenious person truly if there ever was one among adams posterity just turned of fifty and ill off for cash this glimpse of him in his little black tent with perspective glasses while the thirtyyears war blazes out is welcome as a date     what became of the clevejulich heritage and of the preussen one  in the cleve duchies joint government had now become more difficult than ever but it had to be persisted inunder mutual offences suspicions and outbreaks hardly repressedno final bargain of settlement proving by any method possible treaties enough and conferences and pleadings manifestoingscould not some painful german collector of statistics try to give us the approximate quantity of impracticable treaties futile conferences manifestoes correspondences in brief some authentical cipher say in round millions of idle words spoken by official human creatures and approximately in square miles the extent of law stationery and other paper written first and last about this controversy of the cleve duchies in that form it might have a momentary interest  when the winterkings explosion took place crowned at prag 4th november ns 1619 beaten to ruin there and obliged to gallop almost before dinner done sunday 8th november 1620 and his own unfortunate pfalz palatinate became the theatre of war tilly spinola versus pfalzers english dutch involving all the neighboring regions clevejulich did not escape its fate the spaniards and the dutch who had long sat in gloomy armedtruce occupying with obstinate precaution the main fortresses of these julichcleve countries did now straightway their twelveyears truce being out 1621 pauli vi 578580 fall to fighting and besieging one another there the huge war which proved of thirty years being now all ablaze what the country suffered in the interim may be imagined  in 1624 in pity to all parties some attempt at practical division of the territory was again made neuburg to have berg and julich brandenburg to have cleve mark ravensburg and the minor appurtenances and treaty to that effect was got signed 11th may 1624 but it was not well kept nor could be and the statistic cipher of new treaties manifestoes conferences and approximate written area of lawpaper goes on increasing  it was not till fortytwo years after in 1666 as will be more minutely noticeable by and by that an effective partition could be practically brought about nor in this state was the lawsuit by any means endedas we shall wearisomely see in times long following that in fact there never was in the german chanceries or out of them such a lawsuit armed or wigged as this of the cleve duchies first and last and the sentence was not practically given till the congress of vienna 1815 in our own day gave it and the thing johann sigismund had claimed legally in 1609 was actually handed over to johann sigismunds descendant in the seventh generation after two hundred and six years handed over to him thenand a liberal rate of interest allowed these litigated duchies are now the prussian province julichbergcleve and the nucleus of prussias possessions in the rhine country  a year before johann sigismunds death albert friedrich the poor eclipsed duke of prussia died 8th august 1618 upon which our swift kurfurst not without need of his dexterities there too got peaceable possession of prussianor has his family lost hold of that up to the present time next year 23d december 1619 he himself closed a swift busy life labor enough in it for him perhaps though only an age of fortynine and sank to his long rest his works following himunalterable thenceforth not unfruitful some of them     chapter xv  tenth kurfurst george wilhelm  by far the unluckiest of these electors whether the most unworthy of them or not was george wilhelm tenth elector who now succeeded johann sigismund his father the fathers eyes had closed when this great flame was breaking out and the sons days were all spent amid the hot ashes and fierce blazings of it  the position of brandenburg during this sad thirtyyears war was passive rather than active distinguished only in the former way and as far as possible from being glorious or victorious never since the hohenzollerns came to that country had brandenburg such a time difficult to have mended it impossible to have quite avoided itand kurfurst george wilhelm was not a man so superior to all his neighbors that he could clearly see his way in such an element the perfect or ideal course was clear to have frankly drawn sword for his religion and his rights so soon as the battle fairly opened and to have fought for these same till he got either them or died alas that is easily said and written but it is for a george wilhelm especially difficult to do his capability in all kinds was limited his connections with this side and that were very intricate gustavus and the winterking were his brothersinlaw gustavus wedded to his sister he to winterkings his relations to poland feudal superior of preussen were delicate and gustavus was in deadly quarrel with poland and then gustavuss sudden layinghold of pommern which had just escaped from wallenstein and the kaiser it must be granted poor george wilhelms case demanded circumspectness  one can forgive him for declining the bohemianking speculation though his uncle of jagerndorf and his cousins of liegnitz were so hearty and forward in it pardonable in him to decline the bohemian speculationthough surely it is very sad that he found himself so short of butter and firewood when the poor exking and his young wife then in a specially interesting state came to take shelter with him solltl geschichte des dreissigjahrigen kriegesa trivial modern book gives a notable memorial from the brandenburg raths concerning these their difficulties of housekeeping their real object we perceive was to get rid of a guest so dangerous as the exking under ban of the empire had now become but when gustavus landed and flung out upon the winds such a banner as that of histruly it was required of a protestant governor of men to be able to read said banner in a certain degree a governor not too imperfect would have recognized this gustavus what his purposes and likelihoods were the feeling would have been checked by due circumspectness up my men let us follow this man let us live and die in the cause this man goes for live otherwise with honor or die otherwise with honor we cannot in the pass things have come toand thus at the very worst brandenburg would have had only one class of enemies to ravage it and might have escaped with arithmetically speaking half the harrying it got in that long business  but protestant germanysad shame to it which proved lasting sorrow as wellwas all alike torpid brandenburg not an exceptional case no prince stood up as beseemed or only one and he not a great one landgraf wilhelm of hessen who and his brave widow after him seemed always to know what hour it was wilhelm of hessen all alongand a few wild hands christian of brunswick christian of anhalt johann george of jagerndorf who stormed out tumultuously at first but were soon blown away by the tillywallenstein tradewinds and regulated armamentsthe rest sat still and tried all they could to keep out of harms way the evangelical union did a great deal of manifestoing pathetic indignant and other held solemn meetings at heilbronn old sir henry wotton going as ambassador to them but never got any redress had the evangelical union shut up its inkhorns sooner girt on its fightingtools when the time came and done some little execution with them then instead of none at allwe may fancy the evangelical union would have better discharged its function it might have saved immense wretchedness to germany but its course went not that way  in fact had there been no better protestantism than that of germany all was over with protestantism and max of bavaria with fanatical ferdinand ii as kaiser over him and father lammerlein at his right hand and father hyacinth at his left had got their own sweet way in this world but protestant germany was not protestant europe after all over seas there dwelt and reigned a certain king in sweden there farmed and walked musing by the shores of the ouse in huntingdonshire a certain manthere was a gustav adolf over seas an oliver cromwell over seas and a company of poor men were found capable of taking lucifer by the beardwho accordingly with his lammerleins hyacinths habernfeldts and others was forced to withdraw after a tough struggle     chapter xvi  thirtyyears war  the enormous thirtyyears war most intricate of modern occurrences in the domain of dryasdust divides itself after some unravelling into three principal acts or epochs in all of which one after the other our kurfurst had an interest mounting progressively but continuing to be a passive interest  act first goes from 1620 to 1624 and might be entitled the bohemian king made and demolished personally the bohemian king was soon demolished his kingship may be said to have gone off by explosion by one fight namely done on the weissenberg near prag sunday 8th november

settled with compound interestas in fact such accounts are sure to be one way or other and so we leave johann george among the dumb giantmountains again     chapter xviii  friedrich wilhelm the great kurfurst eleventh of the series  brandenburg had again sunk very low under the tenth elector in the unutterable troubles of the times but it was gloriously raised up again by his son friedrich wilhelm who succeeded in 1640 this is he whom they call the great elector grosse kurfurst of whom there is much writing and celebrating in prussian books as for the epithet it is not uncommon among petty german populations and many times does not mean too much thus max of bavaria with his jesuit lambkins and hyacinths is by bavarians called maximilian the great friedrich wilhelm both by his intrinsic qualities and the success he met with deserves it better than most his success if we look where he started and where he ended was beyond that of any other man in his day he found brandenburg annihilated and he left brandenburg sound and flourishing a great country or already on the way towards greatness undoubtedly a most rapid cleareyed active man there was a stroke in him swift as lightning wellaimed mostly and of a respectable weight withal which shattered asunder a whole world of impediments for him by assiduous repetition of it for fifty years 1620 1640 1688  there hardly ever came to sovereign power a young man of twenty under more distressing hopelesslooking circumstances political significance brandenburg had none a mere protestant appendage dragged about by a papist kaiser his fathers primeminister as we have seen was in the interest of his enemies not brandenburgs servant but austrias the very commandants of his fortresses commandant of spandau more especially refused to obey friedrich wilhelm on his accession were bound to obey the kaiser in the first place he had to proceed softly as well as swiftly with the most delicate hand to get him of spandau by the collar and put him under lockandkey him as a warning to others  for twenty years past brandenburg had been scoured by hostile armies which especially the kaisers part of which committed outrages new in human history in a year or two hence brandenburg became again the theatre of business austrian gallas advancing thither again 1644 with intent to shut up torstenson and his swedes in jutland where they had been chastising old christian iv now meddlesome again for the last time and never a good neighbor to sweden gallas could by no means do what he intended on the contrary he had to run from torstenson what feet could do was hunted he and his merodebruder beautiful inventors of the marauding art till they pretty much all died crepertin says kohler reichshistorie p 556 pauli v 24 no great loss to society the death of these artists but we can fancy what their life and especially what the process of their dying may have cost poor brandenburg again  friedrich wilhelms aim in this as in other emergencies was sunclear to himself but for most part dim to everybody else he had to walk very warily sweden on one hand of him suspicious kaiser on the other he had to wear semblances to be ready with evasive words and advance noiselessly by many circuits more delicate operation could not be imagined but advance he did advance and arrive with extraordinary talent diligence and felicity the young man wound himself out of this first fatal position got those foreign armies pushed out of his country and kept them out his first concern had been to find some vestige of revenue to put that upon a clear footing and by loans or otherwise to scrape a little ready money together on the strength of which a small body of soldiers could be collected about him and drilled into real ability to fight and obey this as a basis on this followed all manner of things freedom from swedishaustrian invasions as the first thing  he was himself as appeared by and by a fighter of the first quality when it came to that but never was willing to fight if he could help it preferred rather to shift manoeuvre and negotiate which he did in a most vigilant adroit and masterly manner but by degrees he had grown to have and could maintain it an army of 24000 men among the best troops then in being with or without his will he was in all the great wars of his timethe time of louis xiv who kindled europe four times over thrice in our kurfursts day the kurfursts dominions a long straggling country reaching from memel to wesel could hardly keep out of the way of any war that might rise he made himself available never against the good cause of protestantism and german freedom yet always in the place and way where his own best advantage was to be had louis xiv had often much need of him still oftener and more pressingly had kaiser leopold the little gentleman in scarlet stockings with a red feather in his hat whom mr savage used to see majestically walking about with austrian

some illumination in it where utter darkness is so prevalent most likely addison picked his story of the siege of weinsberg women carrying out their husbands on their backone of his best spectators out of this poor book his 24000 excellent fightingmen thrown in at the right time were often a thing that could turn the balance in great questions they required to be allowed for at a high ratewhich he well knew how to adjust himself for exacting and securing always     what became of pommern at the peace final glance into clevejulich  when the peace of westphalia 1648 concluded that thirtyyears conflagration and swept the ashes of it into order again friedrich wilhelms right to pommern was admitted by everybody and well insisted on by himself but right had to yield to reason of state and he could not get it the swedes insisted on their expenses the swedes held pommern had all along held itin pawn they said for their expenses nothing for it but to give the swedes the better half of pommern forepommern so they call it swedish pomerania thenceforth which lies next the sea this with some towns and cuttings over and above was swedens share friedrich wilhelm had to put up with hinderpommern docked furthermore of the town of stettin and of other valuable cuttings in favor of sweden much to friedrich wilhelms grief and just anger could he have helped it  they gave him three secularized bishoprics magdeburg halberstadt minden with other small remnants for compensation and he had to be content with these for the present but he never gave up the idea of pommern much of the effort of his life was spent upon recovering forepommern thriceeager upon that whenever lawful opportunity offered to no purpose then he never could recover swedish pommern only his late descendants and that by slowish degrees could recover it all readers remember that burgermeister of stettin with the helmet and sword flung into the grave and picked out againand can judge whether brandenburg got its good luck quite by lying in bed  once and once only he had a voluntary purpose towards war and it remained a purpose only soon after the peace of westphalia old pfalzneuburg the same who got the slap on the face went into tyrannous proceedings against the protestant part of his subjects in julichcleve who called to friedrich wilhelm for help friedrich wilhelm a zealous protestant made remonstrances retaliations ere long the thought struck him suppose backed by the dutch we threw out this fantastic old gentleman his papistries and pretended claims and self clear out of it this was friedrich wilhelms thought and he suddenly marched troops into the territory with that view but europe was in alarm the dutch grew faint friedrich wilhelm saw it would not do he had a conference with old pfalzneuburg young gentleman we remember how your grandfather made free with us and our august countenance nevertheless we in fine the statistic of treaties was increased by one and there the matter rested till calmer times  in 1666 as already said an effective partition of these litigated territories was accomplished prussia to have the duchy of cleveproper the counties of mark and ravensburg with other patches and pertinents neuburg what was the better share to have julich duchy and berg duchy furthermore if either of the lines failed in no sort was a collateral to be admitted but brandenburg was to inherit neuburg or neuburg brandenburg as the case might be pauli v 120129 a clear bargain this at last and in the times that had come it proved executable so far but if the reader fancies the lawsuit was at last out in this way he will be a simple reader in the days of our little fritz the line of pfalzneuburg was evidently ending but that brandenburg and not a collateral should succeed it there lay the quarrelopen still as if it had never been shut and we shall hear enough about it     the great kurfursts wars what he achieved in war and peace  friedrich

times coming for it this was one of the successfulest strokes of business ever done by friedrich wilhelm who had been forced by sheer compulsion to embark in that big gameroyal prussia the western or polish prussia this too as all newspapers know has in our times gone the same road as the other which probably after all it may have had in nature some tendency to do cut away for reasons by the polish sword in that battle of tannenberg long since and then also for reasons cut back again that is the factnot unexampled in human history  old johann casimir not long after that peace of oliva

side in the louisfourteenth war that second one which ended in the treaty of nimwegen doing his best therewhen the swedes egged on by louis xiv made war upon him crossed the pomeranian marches troop after troop and invaded his brandenburg territory with a force which at length amounted to some 16000 men no help for the moment friedrich wilhelm could not be spared from his post the swedes who had at first professed well gradually went into plunder roving harrying at their own will and a melancholy time they made of it for friedrich wilhelm and his people lucky if temporary harm were all the ill they were likely to do lucky if he stood steady however in his solid manner finishing the thing in hand first since that was feasible he then even retired into winterquarters to rest his men and seemed to have left the swedish 16000 autocrats of the situation who accordingly went storming about at a great rate  not so however very far indeed from so having rested his men for certain months

again mine as it long was well won a second time since the first would not do but nolouis xiv proved a gentleman to his swedes louis now that the peace of nimwegen had come and only the elector of brandenburg was still in harness said steadily though anxious enough to keep well with the elector they are my allies these swedes it was on my bidding they invaded you can i leave them in such a pass it must not be so pommern had to be given back a miss which was infinitely grievous to friedrich wilhelm the most victorious elector cannot hit always were his right never so good  another miss which he had to put up with in spite of his rights and his good services was that of the silesian duchies the heritagefraternity with liegnitz had at length in 1675 come to fruit the last duke of liegnitz was dead duchies of liegnitz of brieg wohlau are brandenburgs if there were right done but kaiser leopold in the scarlet stockings will not hear of heritagefraternity nonsense answers kaiser leopold a

for the time poland is our liege lord which it was not always and we cannot be transferred to you except by our consent asked and given which too had been a little neglected on the former occasion of transfer so that the great elector knew not what to do with kalkstein and at length as the case was pressing had him kidnapped by his ambassador at warsaw had him rolled into a carpet there and carried swiftly in the ambassadors coach in the form of luggage over the frontier into his native province there to be judged and in the end since nothing else would serve him to have the sentence executed and his head cut off for the case was pressing horn pp 8082these things especially this of kalkstein with a boisterous polish diet and parliamentary eloquence in the rear of him gave rise to

religious man friedrich crownprince age then thirtyone and already married a second time was of course left chief heirwho as we see has not declined the kingship when a chance for it offered there were four halfbrothers of friedrich too who got apanages appointments they had at one time confidently looked for much more their mother being busy but were obliged to be content and conform to the gera bond and fundamental laws of the country they are entitled margraves two of whom left children margraves of brandenburgschwedt heermeisters head of the maltaknighthood at sonnenburg statthalters in magdeburg or i know not what whose names turn up confusedly in the prussian books and except as temporary genealogical puzzles are not of much moment to the foreign reader happily there is nothing else in the way of princes of the blood in our little friedrichs time and happily what concern he had with these or how he was related to them will not be abstruse to us if occasion rise     chapter xix  king friedrich i again  we said the great elector never could work his silesian duchies out of kaiser leopolds grip to all his urgencies the little kaiser in red stockings answered only in evasions refusals and would quit nothing we noticed also what quarrels the young electoral prince friedrich afterwards king had got into with his stepmother suddenly feeling poisoned after dinner running to his aunt at cassel coming back on treaty and the like these are two facts which the reader knows and out of these two grew a third which it is fit he should know  in his last years the great elector worn out with labor and harassed with such domestic troubles over and above had evidently fallen much under his wifes management cutting out large apanages clear against the gera bond for her childrenlonging probably for quiet in his family at any price as to the poor young prince negotiated back from cassel he lived remote and had fallen into open disfavorwith a very ill effect upon his funds for one thing his father kept him somewhat tight on the moneyside it is alleged and he had rather a turn for spending money handsomely he was also in some alarm about the proposed apanages to his halfbrothers the margraves above mentioned of which there were rumors going     how austria settled the silesian claims  now in these circumstances the austrian court who at this time 1685 greatly needed the electors help against turks and others and found him very urgent about these silesian duchies of his fell upon what i must call a very extraordinary shift for getting rid of the silesian question serene highness said they by their ambassador at berlin to end these troublesome talks and to liquidate all claims admissible and inadmissible about silesia the imperial majesty will give you an actual bit of territory valuable though not so large as you expected the elector listens with both ears what territory then the circle of schwiebus hanging on the northwestern edge of silesia contiguous to the electors own dominions in these frankfurtonoder regions this the generous imperial majesty proposes to give in feesimple to friedrich wilhelm and so to end the matter truly a most small patch of territory in comparison not bigger than an english rutlandshire to say nothing of soil and climate but then again it was an actual patch of territory not a mere parchment shadow of one this last was a tempting point to the old harassed elector such friendly offer they made him i think in 1685 at the time they were getting 8000 of his troops to march against the turks for them a very needful service at the moment by the bye do not march through silesia youor march faster said the cautious austrians on this occasion other roads will answer better than silesia said they pauli v 327 332 baron freytag their ambassador at berlin had negotiated the affair so far circle of schwiebus said freytag and let us have done with these thorny talks  but baron freytag had been busy in the mean while with the young prince secretly offering sympathy counsel help of all which the poor prince stood in need enough we will help you in that dangerous matter of the apanages said freytag help you in all thingsi suppose he would saynecessary pocketmoney is not a thing your highness need want and thus baron freytag what is very curious had managed to bargain beforehand with the young prince that directly on coming to power he would give up schwiebus again should the offer of schwiebus be accepted by papa to which effect baron freytag held a signed bond duly executed by the young man before papa had concluded at all which is very curious indeed  poor old papa worn out with troubles accepted schwiebus in liquidation of all claims 8th april 1686 and a few days after set his men on march against the turksand exactly two months beforehand on the 8th of february last the prince had signed his secret engagement that schwiebus should be a mere phantasm to papa that he the prince would restore it on his accession both these singular parchments signed sealed and done in the due legal form lay simultaneously in freytags hand and probably enough they exist yet in some dusty corner among the solemn sheepskins of the world this is literally the plan hit upon by an imperial court to assist a young prince in his pecuniary and other difficulties and get rid of silesian claims plan actually not unlike that of swindling moneylenders to a young gentleman in difficulties and of manageable turn who has got into their hands  the great elector died two years after schwiebus then in his hand the new elector once instructed as to the nature of the affair refused to give up schwiebus 19th september 1689 pauli vii 74 declared the transaction a swindleand in fact for seven years more retained possession of schwiebus but the austrian court insisted with emphasis at length with threats no insuperable pressure from louis or the turks at this time the poor cheated elector had at last to give up schwiebus in terms of his promise 31st december 1694 he took act that it had been a surreptitious transaction palmed upon him while ignorant and while without the least authority or power to make such a promise that he was not bound by it nor would be except on compulsion thus far and as to binding brandenburg by it how could he at that period of his history bind brandenburg brandenburg was not then his to bind any more than china was  his raths had advised friedrich against giving up schwiebus in that manner but his answer is on record i must i will and shall keep my own word but my rights on silesia which i could not and do not in these unjust circumstances compromise i leave intact for my posterity to prosecute if god and the course of events order it no otherwise than now we must be content but if god shall one day send the opportunity those that come after me will know what they have to do in such case pauli vii 150 and so schwiebus was given up the austrians paying back what brandenburg had laid out in improving it 250000 gulden 25000 poundsand the hand of power had in this way finally as it hoped settled an old troublesome account of brandenburgs settled the silesianduchies claim by the temporary phantasm of a gift of schwiebus that is literally the liegnitzjagerndorf case and the reader is to note it and remember it for it will turn up again in history the hand of power is very strong but a stronger may perhaps get hold of its knuckles one day at an advantageous time and do a feat upon it  the eventual succession to east friesland which had been promised by the reich some ten years ago to the great elector for what he had done against the turks and what he had suffered from those swedish invasions in the common cause this shadow of succession the kaiser now said should not be haggled with any more but be actually realized and the imperial sanction to it now giveneffect to follow if the friesland line died out let this be some consolation for the loss of schwiebus and your silesian duchies here in friesland is the ghost of a coming possession there in schwiebus was the ghost of a going one phantasms you shall not want for but the hand of power parts not with its realities however come by     his real character  poor friedrich led a conspicuous life as elector and king but no public feat he did now concerns us like this private one of schwiebus historically important this and requiring to be remembered while so much else demands mere oblivion from us he was a spirited man did soldierings fine siege of bonn

finds he was a strictly honorable man with a certain height and generosity of mind capable of other nobleness than the upholstery kind he had what we may call a hard life of it did and suffered a good deal in his day and generation not at all in a dishonest or unmanful manner in fact he is quite recognizably a hohenzollernwith his back half broken readers recollect that sad accident how the nurse in one of those headlong journeys which his father and mother were always making let the poor child fall or jerk backward and spoiled him much and indeed was thought to have killed him by that piece of inattention he was not yet hereditary prince he was only second son but the elder died and he became elector king and had to go with his spine distorteddistortion not glaringly conspicuous though undeniableand to act the hohenzollern so nay who knows but it was this very jerk and the halfruin of his nervous systemthis doubled wish to be beautiful and this crooked back capable of being hid or

consist chiefly of subsidies thrice wonderful so the treaty of utrecht is transacting itself which that of rastadt on the part of kaiser and empire unable to get on without subsidies will have to

constitution towards fifty his beautiful ingenious serena with all her theologies pinchofsnuff coronations and other earthly troubles was dead and the task of continuing the hohenzollern progeny given over to friedrich wilhelm the prince royal was thought to be in good hands majesty friedrich with the weak back had retired in 1708 to karlsbad to rest from his cares to take the salutary waters and recruit his weak nerves a little here in the course of confidential promenadings it was hinted it was represented to him by some pickthank of a courtier that the task of continuing the hohenzollern progeny did not seem to prosper in the present good hands that sophie dorothee princess royal had already borne two royal infants which had speedily died that in fact it was to be gathered from the medical men if not from their words then from their looks and cautious innuendoes that sophie dorothee princess royal would never produce a prince or even princess that would live which task therefore did now again seem to devolve upon his majesty if his majesty had not insuperable objections majesty had no insuperable objections old majesty listened to the flattering tale and sure enough he smarted for it in a signal manner  by due industry a princess was fixed upon for bride princess sophie louisa of mecklenburgschwerin age now twentyfour she was got as wife and came home to berlin in all pompbut good came not with her to anybody there not only did she bring the poor old man no children which was a fault to be overlooked considering sophie dorothees success but she brought a

orthodoxy jealousy and other bad nourishment till at length she went quite mad and except the due medical and other attendants nobody saw her or spoke of her at berlin was this a cheering issue of such an adventure to the poor old expensive gentleman he endeavored to digest in silence the bitter morsel he had cooked for himself but reflected often as an old king might what dirt have i eaten  in this way stands that matter in the schloss of berlin when little friedrich who will one day be called the great is born habits of the expensive king hours of rising modes of dressing and so forth are to be found in pollnitz pollnitz memoiren zur lebensund regierungsgeschichte der vier letzten regenten des preussischen staats berlin 1791 a vague inexact but not quite uninstructive or uninteresting book printed also in french which was the original same place and time but we charitably omit them all even from foolish pollnitz a good eye will gather what was above intimated that this feeblebacked heavyladen old king was of humane and just disposition had dignity in his demeanor had reticence patience and though hottempered like all the hohenzollerns that he bore himself like a perfect gentleman for one thing and tottered along his highlying lonesome road not in an unmanful manner at all had not his nerves been damaged by that fall in infancy who knows but we might have had something else to read of him than that he was regardless of expense in this world  his last scene of date february 1713 is the tragical ultimatum of that fine karlsbad adventure of the second marriagethird marriage in fact though the first anterior to serena is apt to be forgotten having lasted short while and produced only a daughter not memorable except by accident this third marriage which had brought so many sorrows to him proved at length the death of the old man for he sat one morning in the chill february days of the year 1713 in his apartment as usual weak of nerves but thinking no special evil when suddenly with huge jingle the glass door of his room went to sherds and there rushed inbleeding and dishevelled the fatal white lady weisse frau who is understood to walk that schloss at berlin and announce death to the royal inhabitants majesty had fainted or was fainting weisse frau oh no your majestynot that but indeed something almost worsemad queen in her apartments had been seized that day when half or quarter dressed with unusual orthodoxy or unusual jealousy watching her opportunity she had whisked into the corridor in extreme deshabille and gone like the wild roe towards majestys suite of rooms through majestys glass door like a catapult and emerged as we sawin petticoat and shift with hair streaming eyes glittering arms cut and the other sad trimmings o heaven who could laugh there are tears due to kings and to all men it was deep misery deep enough sin and misery as calvin well says on the one side and the other the poor old king was carried to bed and never rose again but died in a few days the date of the weisse fraus death one might have hoped was not distant either but she lasted in her sad state for above twenty years coming  old king friedrichs deathday was 25th february 1713 the unconscious little grandson being then in his fourteenth month to whom after this long voyage round the world we now gladly return   by way of

honorable figure in the histories thenceforth the george of kaiser karls nitkopab one son george friedrich born 1539 went to administer preussen when cousin became incompetent died 1603 heir to his father in anspach and jagerndorf also to his cousin alcibiades in baireuth had been left a minor boy of 4 as the reader sees alcibiades his guardian for a little while from which came great difficulties and unjust ruin would have come had not kurfurst joachim i been helpful and vigorous in his behalf george friedrich got at length most of his territories into hand anspach and baireuth unimpaired jagerndorf too except that ratibor and oppeln were much eaten into by the imperial chicaneries in that quarter died 1603 without childrenupon which his territories all reverted to the main brandenburg line namely to johann george seventh kurfurst or his representatives according to the gera bond and the elder culmbach line had ended in this manner  3 albert born 1490 hochmeister of the

settled it on one of his younger sons here are the two new founders in baireuth and anspach and some indication of their lines so far as important to us at present                               baireuth  1 christian second son of kurfurst johann george born 1581 got baireuth 1603 died 1655 a distinguished governor in his sphere had two sons the elder died before him but left a son christian ernst who 2 succeeded and 3 whose son george wilhelm 1644 1655 1712 1678 1712 1726 are birth accession end of these two the latter of whom had no son that lived  upon which the posterity of christians second son succeeded second son of christian notable to us in two little ways first that he george albert margraf of culmbach is the inscrutable marquis de lulenbach of bromleys letters antea p 184 let the commentators take comfort second and better that from him came our little wilhelminas husbandas will be afterwards explained it was his grandson 4 that succeeded in baireuth george friedrich karl 1688 1726 1735 father of wilhelminas husband after whom 5 his son friedrich 1711 1735 1763 wilhelminas husband who leaving 1763 nothing hut a daughter baireuth fell to anspach 1769 after an old uncle 6 childless had also died six baireuth margraves of this line five generations and then to anspach in 1769                                anspach  1 joachim ernst third son of kurfurst johann george born 1583 got anspach 1603 died 1625 had military tendencies experiences did not thrive as captain of the evangelical union 16191620 when winterking came up and thirtyyears war along with him left two sons elder of whom 2 friedrich nominally sovereign age still only eighteen fell in the battle of nordlingen worst battle of the thirtyyears war 1634 and the younger of whom 3 albert succeeded 1620 1634 1667 and his son 4 johann friedrich 1654 1667 1686 and 5 6 7 no fewer than three grandsonschildren mostly though entitled sovereignin a parallel way christian albert 1675 1686 1692 george friedrich 1678 1692 1703 wilhelm friedrich 1685 1703 1723 two little points notable here also and no third  first that one of the granddaughters fullsister of the last of these three parallel figures halfsister of the two former wasqueen caroline george iis wife who has still some fame with us  second that the youngest of said three grandsons queen carolines fullbrother left a son then minor who became major 8 and wedded a sister of our dear little wilhelminas of whom we shall hear karl wilhelm friedrich 1712 1723 1757 unmomentous margraf otherwise his and her one son it was 9 christian friedrich karl alexander 1736 1757 1806 who inherited baireuth inherited actress clairon lady craven and at hammersmith house once bubb doddingtons if that has any charm ended the affair  nine anspach margraves in five generations end 1806   end of book iii
