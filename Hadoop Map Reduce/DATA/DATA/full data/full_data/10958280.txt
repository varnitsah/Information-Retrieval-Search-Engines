10958280	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     book xviithe sevenyears war first campaign17561757     chapter iwhat friedrich had read in the menzel documents  the illinformed world entirely unaware of what friedrich had been studying and ascertaining to his bitter sorrow for four years past was extremely astonished at the part he took in those frenchenglish troubles extremely provoked at his breaking out again into a third silesian war greater than all the others and kindling all europe in such a way the illinformed world rang violently then and long after with a controversy was it of his beginning or not of his beginning controversy which may in our day be considered as settled by unanimous mankind finished forever and can now have no interest for any creature  omitting that our problem is were it possible in brief compass to set forth by what authentic traits there arenot the ambitious audacious voracious and highly condemnable friedrich of the gazetteersbut the thriceintricately situated friedrich of fact what the facts privately known to friedrich were in what manner known and how in a more complex crisis than had yet been friedrich demeaned himself upon which latter point and those cognate to it readers ought not to be ignorant if now fallen indifferent on so many other points of the affair what a loudroaring loose and empty matter is this tornado of vociferation which men call public opinion tragically howling round a man who has to stand silent the while and scan wisely under pain of death the altogether inarticulate dumb and inexorable matter which the gods call fact friedrich did read his terrible sphinxriddle the gazetteer tornado did pipe and blow king friedrich in contrast with his environment at that time will most likely never be portrayed to modern men in his real proportions real aspect and attitude then and therewhich are silently not a little heroic and even pathetic when well seen intoand for certain he is not portrayable at present on our side of the sea but what hints and fractions of feature we authentically have ought to be given with exactitude especially with brevity and left to the ingenuous imagination of readers  the secret sources of the third silesian war since called sevenyears war go back to 1745 nay we may say to the first invasion of silesia in 1740 for it was in maria theresas incurable sorrow at loss of silesia and her inextinguishable hope to reconquer it that this and all friedrichs other wars had their origin twice she had signed peace with friedrich and solemnly ceded silesia to him but that too with the imperial lady was by no means a finis to the business not that she meant to break her treaties far from her such a thoughtin the conscious form though alas in the unconscious again it was always rather near practically she reckoned to herself these treaties would come to be broken as treaties do not endure forever and then at the good moment she did purpose to be ready silesia back to us pragmatic sanction complete in every point was not that our dear fathers will monition of all our fathers and their patriotisms and traditionary heroisms and in fact the behest of gods and men ten years ago this notion had been cut down to apparent death in a disastrous manner for the second time but it did not die in the least it never thinks of dying starts always anew passionate to produce itself again as action valid at last and lives in the imperial heart with a tenacity that is strange to observe still stranger in the envious valetheartin that of bruhl who had far less cause  the peace of dresden christmas 1745 seemed to be an act of considerable magnanimity on friedrichs part it was at the first blush of it incredible to harrach the austrian plenipotentiary whose embarrassed astonished bow we remember on that occasion with english villiers shedding pious tears but what is very remarkable withal is a thing since discovered infra next note p 276 that harrach magnanimous signature hardly yet dry did then straightway by order of his court very privately inquire of bruhl there is peace you see what they call peacebut our treaty of warsaw for partition of this magnanimous man stands all the same does nt it to which according to the documents bruhl hardly escaped from the pangs of death and still in a very paleyellow condition had answered in effect hah say you so ones hatred is eternalbut that mans iron heel wait a little get russia to join in the schemeand hung back the willing mind but the too terrified and in this way like a famishing dog in sight of a too dangerous leg of mutton bruhl has ever since rather held back would not reengage at all for almost two years even on the czarinas engaging and then only in a cautious conditional and hypothetic mannerthough with famine increasing day by day in sight of the desired viands his hatred is fell but he would fain escape with back unbroken     how friedrich discovered the mystery concerning menzel and weingarten  friedrich has been aware of this mystery at least wide awake to it and becoming ever more instructed for almost four years traitor menzel the saxon kanzellistwe who have prophetically read what he had to confess when laid hold of are aware though as yet and on to 1757 it is a dead secret to all mortals but himself and three othershas been busy for prussia ever since the end of 1752 got admittance to the presses sent his first excerpt about the time of easterfair 1753time of voltaires taking wing and has been at work ever since copying despatches from the most secret saxon repositories ready always on excellency mahlzahns indicating the piece wanted and of late i should think is busier than ever as the saxon mystery which is also an austrian and russian one gets more light thrown into it and seems to be fast ripening towards action of a perilous nature the first excerpts furnished by menzel readers can judge how enigmatic they were these menzel papers copies mainly of petersburg or vienna despatches to bruhl with bruhls answersthe principal of which were subsequently printed in their best arrangement and liveliest point of vision in friedrichs manifestoes chiefly in memoire raisonne sur la conduite des cours de vienne et de saxe compiled from the menzel originals so soon as these were got hold of berlin autumn 1756 a solid and able paper rapidly done by one count herzberg who rose high in after times reprinted with many other pieces and passages in gesammelte nachrichten und urkundenwhich is a collection of such 2 vols 113 nos small 8vo no place 1757 my copy of itare by no means a luminous set of documents to readers at this day think what a study they were at potsdam in 1753 while still in the chaotic state fished out more or less at random as menzel could lay hold of them or be directed to them the enigma clearing itself only by intense inspection and capability of seeing in the dark  it appearsif you are curious on the anecdotic part  winterfeld was the first that got eye on this dangerous saxon mystery some exsaxon about to settle in berlin giving hint of it to winterfeld who needed only a hint so soon as winterfeld convinced himself that there was weight in the affair he imparted it to friedrich scheme of partitioning your majesty of picking quarrel then overwhelming and partitioning most serious scheme austrianrussian as well as saxon going on steadily for years past and very lively at this time if true friedrich cannot but admit that this is serious enough important thrice over to discover whether it is trueand gives winterfeld authority to prosecute it to the bottom in dresden or wherever the secret may lie who thereupon charged mahlzahn the prussian minister at dresden to find some proper menzel and bestir himself how mahlzahn has found his menzel and has bestirred himself we saw thiefkeys were made to pattern in berlin first set did not fit second did and stealthy menzel gains admittance to that chamber of the archives can steal thither on shoes of felt when occasion serves and copy what you wishfor a consideration intermittently since about easterfair 1753 three persons are cognizant of it winterfeld mahlzahn friedrich three and no more probably the abstrusest study and the most intense going on in the world at that epoch rotzow charakteristik des siebenjahrigen krieges berlin 1802 i 23  at a very early stage of the menzel excerpts it became manifest that certain synchronous austrian ditto would prove highly elucidative that in fact it would be indispensable to get hold of these as well which also winterfeld has managed to do a deepheaded man who has his eyes about him and is very apt to manage what he undertakes one weingarten junior a secretary in the austrian embassy at berlin excellency peublas second secretary has his acquaintanceships in berlin society and for one thing as winterfeld discovers is madly in love with some chambermaid or quasichambermaid let us call her chambermaid daughter of the castellan at charlottenburg winterfeld through the due channels applied to this chambermaid get me a small secret copy of such and such despatches out of your weingarten it will be well for you and him otherwise perhaps not well chambermaid hope urging or perhaps hope and fear did her best weingarten had to yield the required product and products as required by this weingarten from some date not long after menzels first mysterious dresden excerpts the necessary austrian glosses so far as possible to weingarten on the indications given him have been regularly had for the two or three years past  weingarten first came to be seriously suspected june 1756 weingarten junior let us still say for there was a senior

they sure enoughand the thing they betrayed against their masters was that a celestial thing servants of the devil do fall out and servants not of the devil are fain sometimes to raise a quarrel of that kind  the then world as we said was one loud uproar of logic on the right reading and the wrong of those sibylline documents did your king of prussia interpret them aright or even try it did not he use them as a cloak for highway robbery and swallowing of a peaceable saxony bad man that he surely is for friedrichs demeanor this time again when it came to the acting point was of eminent rapidity almost a swifter lionspring than ever and it brought on him in the aerial or vocal way its usual result huge clamor of rage and logic from uninformed mankind clamorous rage and logic which has now sunk irresuscitably deadnothing of it much worth mentioning to modern readers scarcely even its hic jacet in footnotes for the benefit of the curiousand it is at last a thing not doubtful to anybody that friedrich in that matter did read aright so that now the loud uproar is reduced to one small question with us what did he read in those menzel documents what fact lying in them was it that friedrich had to read here smelted down by repeated roastings is succinct answerfor the ultimate fragment of incombustible here as elsewhere will go into a nutshell once the continents of diplomatistgazetteer logic and disorderly stablelitter threatening to heap themselves over the very stars have been faithfully burnt away  readers heard of a union of warsaw early in 1745 concluded by the seapowers and the saxonpolish and hungarian majesties very harmless union of warsaw public to all the worldbut with a certain thricesecret treaty of warsaw between polish and hungarian majesty themselves two the seapowers being horrorstruck by mention of it which had followed thereupon in an eager and wonderful manner thricesecret treaty for partitioning friedrich and settling the respective shares of his skin treaty which to denote its origin we called of warsaw though it was not finished there shares of skin so difficult to settle and treaty of leipzig 18th may 1745 is its alias in booksof which treaty as the seapowers had recoiled horrorstruck there was no whisper farther to them or to the rest of exoteric mankindthough it has been one of the busiest entities ever since from the menzel documents i know not after what circuitous gropings and searchings friedrich first got notice of that treaty now printed in oeuvres de frederic iv 4042 figure his look on discovering it  we said it was the remarkablest bit of sheepskin in its century readers have heard too that it was proposed to bruhl by a grateful austria directly on signing the peace of dresden our partitiontreaty stands all the same does it notand in what humor bruhl answered hah get russia to join both these facts that there is a treaty of warsaw and that this is the austriansaxon temper and intention towards him and it friedrich learned from the menzel documents and if the reader will possess himself of these two facts and understand that they are of a germinative most vital quality indestructible by the times and the chances and have been growing and developing themselves day and night ever since in a truly wonderful mannerthe reader knows in substance what menzel had to reveal  russia was got to jointhere are methods of operating on russia and kindling a poor fat czarina into strange suspicions and indignations in may 1746 within six months of the peace of dresden a treaty of petersburg new version of the warsaw one was brought to parchment czarina and empressqueen signingbruhl dying to sign but not daring how russia has been got to join and more and more vigorously bear a hand how bruhls rabidities of appetite and terrors of heart have continued ever since how austria and russiabruhl aiding with hysterical alacrity haunted by terror and at last mercifully excused from signinghave year after year especially in this last year 1755 brought the matter nearer and nearer perfection and the two imperial majesties with bruhl to rear wait only till they are fully ready and the world gives opportunity to pick a quarrel with friedrich and overwhelm and partition him according to covenant this wandering through endless mazes of detail is in sum what the menzel documents disclose to friedrich and us how in a space of ten years the small seedgrain of a treaty of warsaw or treaty of petersburg planted and nourished in that manner in the satans invisible world has grown into a mighty tree thereprophetic of facts near at hand which were extremely sanguinary to the human race for the next seven years  this is the sumtotal but for friedrichs sake and to illustrate the situation let us take a few glances more into the then satans invisible world which had become so ominously busy round friedrich and others the czarina we say was got to engage 22d may 1746 there came a treaty of petersburg duly valid which is that of warsaw under a new name and still bruhl durst not for above a year comingnot till august 15th 1747 memoire raisonne in gesammelte nachrichten  i 459 and then only in a hypothetic halfandhalf way with fear and trembling though with hunger unspeakable in sight of the viands a very wretched bruhl as seen in these menzel documents on poor polish majesty bruhl has played the sorcerer this long while and ridden him as he would an enchanted quadruped in a shameful manner but how in turn as we study menzel is bruhl himself hagridden hunted by his own devils and leads such a ghastly phantasmal existence yonder in the valley of the shadow of clothesmere clothes metaphorical and literal montrezmoi des vertus pas des culottes have you no virtues then to show me nothing but pain of breeches exclaimed an impatient french traveller led about in bruhls palace one day archenholtz geschichte des siebenjahrigen krieges i 63 wretched bruhl agitated with hatreds of a rather infernal nature and with terrors of a not celestial comes out on our sympathies as a dog almost pitiablewere that possible with twelve tailors sewing for him and a saxony getting shoved over the precipices by him  a famishing dog in the most singular situation what he dare do he does and with such a will but there is almost only one thing safe to him that of egging on the czarina against friedrich of coining lies to kindle czarish majesty of wafting on every wind rumors to that end and continually besieging with them the empty czarish mind bruhl has many conduits the sieur de funck the sieur gross plenty of legationary sieurs and conduitswhich issue from all quarters on petersburg and which find there a reservoir and due russian servicepipes prepared for themand bruhl is busy commerce of dantzig to be ruined suggests he that is plain look at his asiatic companies his port of embden poland is to be stirred uphas not your czarish majesty heard of his intrigues there courland which is almost become your majestyscunningly snatched by your majestys address like a valuable moribund whale adrift among the shallowsthis bad man will have it out to sea again with the harpoons in it fairly afloat amid the polish anarchies again these are but specimens of bruhl or we can give such in bruhls own words if the reader had rather here are two which have the advantage of brevity  1 the sieur de funck saxon minister at petersburg wrote to count bruhl 9th july 1755 says an inexorable record that the sieur gross now minister of russia at dresden who vanished out of berlin like an angry skyrocket some years ago would do a good service to the common cause if he wrote to his court that the king of prussia had found a channel in courland by which he learned all the secrets of the russian court and sieur funck added that it was expected good use could be made of such a story with her czarish majestyto which count bruhl replies 23d july that he has instructed the sieur gross who will not fail to act in consequence  2 sieur prasse same funcks secretary of legation at petersburg writes to count bruhl 12th april 1756  i am bidden signify to your excellency that it is greatly wished in order to favor certain views you would have the goodness to cause arrive in petersburg by different channels the following intelligence that the king of prussia on pretext of commerce is sending officers and engineers into the ukraine to reconnoitre the country and excite a rebellion there and this advice be pleased to observe is not to come direct from the saxon court nor by the envoy gross but by some third partyto the end there may be no concert noticedas they lon the servicepipes and managing excellencies russian and austrian have given the same commission to other ministers so that the news shall come from more places than one  they the said managing excellencies have also required me to write to the baron de sack our saxon minister in sweden upon it which i will not fail to do and they assured me that our courts advantage was not less concerned in it than that of their own adding these words comfortable to ones soul the king of prussia in 1745 gave saxony a blow which it will feel for fifty years but we will give him one which he will feel for a hundred  to which beautiful suggestion excellency bruhl answers 2d june 1756 as to the secret commission of conveying to petersburg by concealed channels intelligence of prussian machinations in the ukraine we are still busy finding out a right channel and they lon the managing excellencies shall very soon one way or the other see the effect of my personal inclination to second what is so good an intention though a little artful un peu artificieuseun peu nothing to speak of memoire raisonne in  gesammelte nachrichten  i 424425 and ib 472  fancy a poor fat czarina of many appetites of little judgment continually beaten upon in this manner by these saxonaustrian artists and their russian servicepipes bombarded with cunningly devised fabrications every wind freighted for her with phantasmal rumors no ray of direct daylight visiting the poor sovereign woman who is lazy not malignant if she could avoid it mainly a mass of esurient oil with alkali on the back of alkali poured in at this rate for ten years past till by pouring and by stirring they get her to the state of soap and froth is it so wonderful that she does by degrees rise into eminent suspicion anger fear violence and vehemence against her bad neighbor one at last begins to conceive those insane whirls continual mad suspicions mad procedures which have given friedrich such vexation surprise and provocation in the years past  friedrich is always specially eager to avoid illwill from russia but it has come in spite of all he could do and try and these procedures of the czarish majesty have been so capricious unintelligible perverse and his feeling is often enough irritation temporary indignationwhich we know makes verses withal i can nowhere learn from those prussian imbroglios of books what the friedrich sayings or satirical verses properly were retzow speaks of a produkt one at least known in interior circles retzow i 34 produkt which decidedly requires publication beyond anything friedrich ever wrotethough one can do without it too and invoke fancy in defect of print the sharpness of friedrichs tongue we know and the diligence of birds of the air to all her other griefs against the bad man this has given the finish in the tender czarish bosomand like an envenomed drop has set the saponaceous oils already dosed with alkali and well in solution foaming deliriously over the brim in neverimagined deluges of a hatred that is unappeasablevery costly to friedrich and mankind rising ever higher year by year and now risen to what height judge by the following  at petersburg 14th15th may 1753 there was meeting of the russian senate with deliberation held for these two days and for issue this conclusion come to  that it should be and hereby is settled as a fundamental maxim of the russia empire not only to oppose any farther aggrandizement of the king of prussia but to seize the first convenient opportunity for overwhelming ecraser by superior force the house of brandenburg hear hear and reducing it to its former state of mediocrity memoire raisonne in gesammelte nachrichten  i 421 leg of mutton to be actually gone into with what an enthusiasm of hear hear from bruhl and kindred parties especially from bruhlwho however dare not yet bite except hypothetically such his terrors and tremors or look again same senate  at petersburg october 1755 to which fundamental maxim articulately fixed ever since those maydays of 1753 the august russian sanhedrim deliberating farther in october 1755 adds this remarkable extension  that it is our resolution to attack the king of prussia without farther discussion whensoever the said king shall attack any ally of russias or shall himself be attacked by any of them hailed by bruhl as natural with his liveliest approval a glorious deliberation that indeed writes he it clears the way of action for russias allies in this matter and for us too though nobody can blame us if we proceed with the extremest cautionand rather wait till the bear is nearly killed memoire raisonne in gesammelte nachrichten  i 422  many marvels friedrich had deciphered out of this weingartenmenzel apocalypse of satans invisible world and one often fancies friedrichs tone of mind in his intense inspecting of that fateful continent of darkness and his labyrinthic stepping by degrees to the oracular points which have a light in them when flung open but in respect of practical interest this of october 1755 which would get to potsdam probably in few weeks after must have surpassed all the others marvels many one after the other for example or in recapitulation a treaty of warsaw or leipzig to partition him 18th may 1745 treaty of petersburg 22d may 1746 new form of warsaw treaty with czarina superadded tremulous quasiaccession thereto of his polish majesty most tremulous hypothetic quasiaccession yesandno 15th august 1747 and often afterwards first deliberation of the russian senate 15th may 1753 c c for example or in recapitulation a treaty of warsaw or leipzig to partition him 18th may 1745 treaty of petersburg 22d may 1746 new form of warsaw treaty with czarina superadded tremulous quasiaccession thereto of his polish majesty most tremulous hypothetic quasiaccession yesandno 15th august 1747 and often afterwards first deliberation of the russian senate 15th may 1753 c c no doubt left long since of the constant disposition preparation and fixed intention to partition him but here in this last indication by the russian senatewhich kindles into dismal evidence so many other enigmatic tokensthere has an ulterior oracular point disclosed itself to friedrich in vaguer condition but not less indubitable and much more perilous namely that now at last end of 1755 the two imperial majesties very eager both consider that the time is come and areas friedrich looks abroad on the austrianrussian marchings of troops campings and unusual military symptoms and combinationsvisibly preparing to that end  they have agreed to attack me next year 1756 if they can and next again 1757 without if so friedrich putting written word and public occurrence together gradually reads and so all readers will see the fact wasthough imperial majesty at schonbrunn as we shall find strove to deny it when applied to and scouted as mere fiction and imagination the notion of such an agreement which i infer therefore not to have existed in parchment not in parchment but only in reality and as a mutual bond registered inshall we say in heaven as some are wontregistered perhaps in two places very separate indeed no truer agreement ever did existthough a devout imperial majesty denies it who would shudder at the lie direct  poor imperial majesty who can tell her troubles and straits in this abstruse time heaven itself ordering her to get back the silesia of her fathers if she couldyet heaven always looking dubious surely upon this method of doing it by solemn public treaties signed in sight of all mankind and contrariwise in the very same moments by secret treaties of a fell nature concocted underground to destroy the life of these imperial majesty flatters herself it may be fair treaty of dresden treaty of aixlachapelle treaties wrung from me by force the tyrannic seapowers screwing us kaunitz can tell a consummate kaunitz who has provided remedies treaties do get broken besides i will not go to war unless he the bad one of prussia doalas your noble majesty plain it at least is your love of silesia is very strong and consummate kaunitz and it have led you into strange predicaments the pompadour for instance who was it that answered je ne la connais pas i dont know her how gladly would the imperial maria theresa soul of propriety have made that answer but she did not she had to answer differently for kaunitz was imperative a kind little note to the pompadour one and then another and another it is indispensable your imperial majesty and imperial majesty always had to do it and there exist in writing at this hour various flattering little notes from imperial majesty to that address which begin ma cousine princesse et cousine say many witnesses nay madame ma tres chere soeur says one good witness hormayr cited in preuss i 433 nas are duclos montgaillard memoires de richelieu cnotes which ought to have been printed before this or given at least to the museums my cousin princess and cousin madame my dearest sister oh high imperial soul with what strange bedfellows does misery of various kinds bring us acquainted  friedrich was blamably imprudent in regard to pompadour thinks valori a little complaisance might havewhat might it not have done but his prussian majesty would not and while the ministers of all the other powers allied with france went assiduously to pay their court to madame the baron von knyphausen alone by his masters order never once went dont je ne la connais paswhile the empressqueen was writing her the most flattering letters the prince of prussia kings eldest brother wished ardently to obtain her portrait and had applied to me for it as had prince henri to my predecessor the king who has such gallant and seductive ways when he likes could certainly have reconciled this celebrated ladya highly important improper female to him and others valori i 320  yes but he quite declined not counting the costs costs may be immediate profits are remoteremote but sure costs did indeed prove considerable perhaps far beyond his expectation though i flatter myself they never awoke much remorse in him on that score  friedrichs enigma towards the end of 1755 and onwards is becoming frightfully stringent and the solution what practically will be the wise course for me does not lessen in abstruse intricacy but the reverse as it grows more pressing a very stormy and dubious future truly two circumstances in it will be highly determinative one of them evident to friedrich the other unknown to him and to all mortals except two or three first  that there will be an englishfrench war straightway and that as usual the french weaker at sea will probably attack hanover that is to say bring the war home to ones own door and ripen into fulfilment those austrianrussian plots this is the evident circumstance fast coming on visible to friedrich and to everybody but that in such event austria will join not with england but with france this is a second circumstance guessable by nobody known only to kaunitz and a select one or two but which also will greatly complicate friedrichs position and render his enigma indeed astonishingly intricate as well as stringent for solution     chapter iienglish diplomacies abroad in prospect of a french war  britannic majesty i know not at what date but before the launching of that poor braddock thunderbolt much more after the tragic explosion it made had felt that french war was nearly inevitable and also that the french method would be as heretofore to attack hanover and wound him in that tender part there goes on accordingly a lively foreign diplomatizing on his majestys part at presentin defect almost total of domestic preparation military and othermajesty and ministers expecting salvation from abroad as usual military preparation does lag at a shameful rate but on the other hand there is a great deal of pondering really industrious considering and contriving about foreign allies and their subsidies and engagements that step for example the questionable seizure of the french ships without declaration of war was a contrivance by diplomatic heads of bad quality seize their ships said some bad head after meditating put their ships in sequestration till they do us justice if they wont and go to warthen they are the aggressors not we and our allies have to send their auxiliary quotas as per contract so the ships were seized held in sequestration till many of the cargoes being perishable goods some even fish rotted smolletts history of england c c and in return as will be seen not one auxiliary came to hand so that the diplomatic head had his rotted cargoes and much public obloquy for his pains not a fortunate stroke of business that  britannic majesty on applying at vienna through keith sir or mr robert keith the first excellency of that name for there are two a father and a son both vienna excellencies was astonished to learn that in such event of an aggression even on hanover there was no cooperation to be looked for here altogether cold on that subject her imperial majesty seems regardless of excellency keiths remonstrances and urgencies and in the end is flatly negatory cannot do it your excellency times so perilous bad king of prussia so minatorynot to mention sotto voce that we have turned on our axis and the wind thanks to kaunitz no longer hits us on the same cheek as formerly  cannot will not britannic majesty may well stare wideeyed remembering such gigantic subsidizings and alcides labors dettingens fontenoys on the percontra side but so stands the fact no help from an ungrateful viennaquick then seek elsewhere and hanbury and the continental british excellencies have to bestir themselves as they never did especially hanbury who is directed upon russiawhom alone of these excellencies it is worth while to follow for a moment russia on fair subsidy yielded us a 35000 last war willingly granted most useful though we had no fighting out of them mere terror of them being enough beyond all things let hanbury do his best in russia  hanbury cheerfully confident provides himself with the requisites store of bribemoney as the chiefat warsaw withal he picks up one poniatowski airy sentimental coxcomb rather of dissolute habits handsomest and windiest of young polacks good for a lover to the grandduchess this one thinks hanbury which proved true and had its uses for hanburygrandduchess and grandduke catherine and peter whom we saw wedded twelve years ago heirsapparent of this russian chaos being an abstrusely situated pair of spouses well capable of something political in private ways in such a scene of affairs and catherine who is an extremely clever creature being out of a lover just now a fine scene for the diplomatist this russia at present nowhere in the world can you do so much with bribery quite a standing item and financial necessaryoflife to officials of the highest rank there as hanbury well knows his letters in raumer passim that of poniatowski proved otherwise too a notable stroke of hanburys and shot the poor polish coxcomb aloft into tragic altitudes on the sudden as we all know  hanburys immense dexterities and incessant labors at petersburg shall lie hidden in the sloppails it is enough to say his guineas his dexterities and auxiliary poniatowskis did prevail and he triumphantly signed his treaty petersburg 30th september subsidytreaty for 55000 men 15000 of them cavalry not to speak of 40 to 50 galleys and the like to attack whomsoever britannic majesty bids annual cost a mere 500000 pounds while on service 100000 pounds while waiting in adelung vii 609 and what is more and what our readers are to mark the 55000 begin on the instant to assemblealong the livonian frontier or lithuanian looking direct into preussen diligently rendezvousing there 55000 of them nay gradually 70000 no stinginess in the czarina to her ally of england a most triumphant thing thinks hanbury could another of you have done it signed ready for ratifying 30th september 1755 bad braddock news not hinderingand before it is ratified this also let readers mark the actual troops getting on march  hanburys masterpiece surely a glorious triumph in the circumstances and a difficult thinks hanbury had hanbury seen the inside of the cards as readers have he would not have thought it so triumphant for years pastespecially since that fundamental maxim may 14th15th 1753 which we heard ofthe czarinas longings had been fixed and here nowscattering money from both hands of it and wooing us with diplomatic finessingsis the fulfilment come opportunity upon preussen behold it here  the russian senate again holds deliberation declares on the heel of this hanbury treaty in october 1755 what we read above that its antiprussian intentions aretruculent indeed and it is the common talk in petersburg society through winter what a dose the ambitious king of prussia has got brewed for him memoire raisonne in gesammelte nachrichten  i 429 c out of russian indignation and resources miraculously set afloat by english guineas a triumphant hanbury for the time beingthough a tragical enough by and by     the triumphant hanbury treaty becomes itself nothing or lessbut produces a friedrich treaty followed by results which surprise everybody  king friedrichs outlooks on this consummation may well seem to him critical the sore longing of an infuriated czarina is now let loose and in a condition to fulfil itself to friedrich these petersburg news are no secret nor to him are the petersburg private intentions a thing that can be doubted apart from the menzelweingarten revelations as we noticed once it appears the grandduke peter a great admirer of friedrich poor confused soul had himself thricesecretly warned friedrich that the mysterious combination russia in the van would attack him next springnot weingarten that betrayed our grand mystere from first hand that was done said excellency peubla on quitting berlin not long after cogniazzo gestandnisse eines oesterreichischen veterans as cited above i 225 september 16th 1756 peubla left berlin rodenbeck i 298three months after weingartens disappearance the grand mystery is not uncertain to friedrich and it may well be very formidablecoupled with those braddock explosions seizures of french ships and englishfrench war imminent and likely to become a general european one which are the closing prospects of 1755 the french king he reckons not to be well disposed to him their old treaty of twelve years since 1744 is just about running out not friendly the french king owing to little rubs that have been still less the pompadourthough who could guess how implacable she was at not being known ne la connais pas at vienna he is well aware the humor towards him is mere cannibalism in refined forms but most perilous of all most immediately perilous is the implacable czarina set afloat upon english guineas  with a hope as is credibly surmised that the english might soothe or muzzle this implacable czarina friedrich directly after hanburys feat in petersburg applied at london with an offer which was very tempting there suppose your britannic majesty would make with me an express neutrality convention mutual covenant to keep the german reich entirely free of this war now threatening to break out to attack jointly and sweep home again with vigor any and every armed nongerman setting foot on the german soil an offer most welcome to the heads of opposition the pitts and others of that country who wish dear hanover safe enough safe in davyjoness locker if that would do but are tired of subsidizing and fighting and tumulting all the world over for that high end so that friedrichs proposal is grasped at and after a little manipulation the thing is actually concluded  by no means much manipulation both parties being willing there was uncommonly rapid surgery of any little difficulties and discrepancies rapid closure instant salutary stitching together of that long unhealable privateer controversy as the main item 20000 pounds allowed to prussia for prussian damages and to england from the other side the remainder of silesiau debt painfully outstanding for two or three years back is to be paid off at onceand in this way such neutrality convention of prussia with england comes forth as a practical fact upon mankind done at westminster 16th january 1756 the steppingstone as it proved to a closer treaty of the same date next year of which we shall hear a great deal the steppingstone in fact to many large thingsand to the ruin of our late russiansubsidy treaty hanburys masterpiece for one small thing that is a treaty signed sure enough answer they of st jamess and we will be handsome about it to her czarish majesty but as to ratifying it in its present formof course never  what a clap of thunder to excellency hanbury his masterpiece found suddenly a superfluity an incommodity the orthodox english course now is no foreign soldiers at all to be allowed in germany and there are the 55000 tramping on with such alacrity we cannot ratify that treaty excellency hanbury writes the majestys ministry in a tone not of gratitude you must turn it some other way a terrible blow to hanbury who had been expecting gratitude without end and now try how he might there was no turning it another way this privately and this only being the czarinas own way a czarina obstinate to a degree would not consent even when they made her the liberal offer keep your 55000 at home dont attack the king of prussia with them you shall have your subsidy all the same no i wont answered sheto hanburys amazement hanbury had not read the weingartenmenzel documentswhat double double of toil and trouble might hanbury have saved himself and others could he have read them  hanbury could not still less could the majestys ministry surmise the czarinas secret at all now or for a good while coming and in fact poor hanbury busy as a diplomatic bee never did more good in russia or out of it by direction of the majestys ministry hanbury still tried industriously cash in both hands tried various things assuage the czarinas mind reconcile her to king friedrichall in vain unite austria russia and england cant you thenin a treaty against the designs of france how very vain then at a later stage get us the czarina to mediate between prussia and austria so very possible to sleek them down into peace thought majestys ministryand unwearied hanbury cunning eloquence on his lips and money in both hands tries again and ever again for many months and in the way of making ropes from sand it must be owned there never was such twisting and untwisting as that appointed hanbury who in fact broke his heart by itand died mad by his own hand before long hanburys life in works vol iii gives sad account poor soul after allhere are some russian notices from him and he has many curious not pertinent here which are still worth gleaning  petersburg 2d october 1755 the health of the empress czarina elizabeth catin du nord age now fortyfive is bad she is affected with spitting of blood shortness of breath constant coughing swelled legs and water on the chest yet she danced a minuet with me lucky hanbury there is great fermentation at court peter grandduke peter does not conceal his enmity to the schuwalofs paramours of catin old and new catherine grandduchess who at length has an heir unbeautiful czar paul that will be and miscarriages not a few is on good terms with

have conversations with her for hours together as at supper my rank places me always next to her twicelucky hanbury  since her coming to this country she has by every method in her power endeavored to gain the affections of the nation she applied herself with diligence to study their language and speaks it at present as the russians tell me in the greatest perfection she has also succeeded in her other aim for she is esteemed and beloved here in a high degree her person is very advantageous and her manners very captivating she has great knowledge of this empire and makes it her only study she has parts and greatchancellor brute bestuchef tells me that nobody has more steadiness and resolution she has of late openly declared herself to me in respect of the king of prussiahates him a good deal natural and formidable enemy of russia heart certainly the worst in the world and so on but will see better by and by having eyes of her ownshe never mentions the king of england but with the utmost respect and highest regard is thoroughly sensible of the utility of the union between england and russia always calls his majesty the empresss best and greatest ally so much of nourishment in him withal as in a certain webfooted chief of birds reckoned chief by some and hopes he will also give his friendship and protection to the grandduke and herselfas for the grandduke he is weak and violent but his confidence in the grandduchess is so great that sometimes he tells people that though he does not understand things himself his wife understands everything should the empress as i fear

who may concern us a little in the sequeland in justice to poor hanover the sad subjectmatter of excellency hanburys problems and futilities in russia and elsewhere let us save this other fraction by a very different hand and close that hanbury scene  friedrich himself was so dangerous says the constitutional historian once friedrich in alliance with france how easy for him to catch hanover by the throat at a weeks notice throw a deathnoose round the throat of poor hanover and hand the same to france for tightening at discretion poor hanover indeed she reaps little profit from her english honors what has she had to do with these transatlantic colonies of england an unfortunate country if the english would but think liable to be strangled at any time for englands quarrels the achillesheel to invulnerable england a sad function for hanover if it be a proud one and amazingly lucrative to some hanoverians the country is very dear to his britannic majesty in one sense very dear to britain in another nay germany itself through hanover is to be torn up by war for transatlantic interestsout of which she does not even get good virginia tobacco but grows bad of her own no more concern than the ring of saturn with these oversea quarrels and can through hanover be torn to pieces by war about them such honor to give a king to the british nation in a strait for one and such profit coming of itwe hope all sides are grateful for the blessings received     there has been a countertreaty going on at versailles in the interim which hereupon starts out and tumbles the wholly astonished european diplomacies heelsoverhead  to expectant mankind especially to vienna and versailles this britannicprussian treaty was a great surprise and indeed it proved the signal of a general system of new treaties all round the first signal in factthough by no means the first causeof a total circumgyration summerset or tumble heelsoverhead in the political relations of europe altogether which ensued thereupon miraculous almost as the earthquake at lisbon to the gazetteer and diplomatic mind and incomprehensible for long years after first signal we say by no means that it was the first cause or indeed that it was a cause at allthe thing being determined elsewhere long before ever since 1753 when kaunitz left it ready waiting only its time  kaiser franz they say when probably during those keith urgencies the joining with france and turning against poor britannic majesty was proposed in council at vienna opened his usually silent lips and opined with emphasis against such a course no kaunitz or creature able to persuade kaiser franz that good would come of itthough finding sovereign lady and everybody against him he held his peace again and returned to his private banking operations which were more extensive than ever from the new troubles rising lent the empressqueen always on solid securities says friedrich large sums from time to time in those wars dealt in commissariat stores to right and left we ourselves had most of our meal from him this year oeuvres de frederic iv 8 kaiser franz was and continued of the old way of thinking but consummate kaunitz and the high ladys fixed passion for her schlesien had changed everybody else the ulterior facts are as follows abbreviated to the utmost  september 22d 1755 a few days before hanburys subsidyfeat at petersburg which took such a whirl for hanbury there had met for the first time at versailles more especially at babiole pleasurehouse of the pompadour a most select committee of three persons graf von stahremberg austrian ambassador pompadour herself and a certain infinitely elegant count and reverence de bernis beautiful clericomundane gentleman without right benefice hitherto but much in esteem with the pompadourfor deepest practical consideration in regard to closure of a frenchaustrian alliance reverend count subsequently cardinal de bernis has sense in diplomacy has his experiences in secular diplomatic matters a softgoing cautious man not yet official but tending that way whom the pompadour has brought with her as henchman or unghostly counsellor in this intricate adventure  stahremberg instructed from home has no hesitation nor has pompadour herself remembering that insolent je ne la connais pas and the percontra ma cousine princesse et soeurbut bernis i suppose looks into the practical difficulties which are probably very considerable to the official french eye in the present state of europe and of the public mind from september 22d or autumnal equinox 1755 onward to this britannicprussian phenomenon of january 1756 the pompadour conclave has been sittingdifficulties no doubt considerable i will give only the dates having myself no interest in such a committee at babiole but the dates sufficiently betoken that there were intricacies conflicts between the new and the old hitherto the axiom always was prussia the adjunct and satellite of france now to be entirely reversed you say  july 1755 that is two months before this babiole committee met a duc de nivernois respectable intelligent dilettante french nobleman had been named as ambassador to friedrich go you respectable wise nivernois nobleman of letters so called try and retain friedrich for us as usual and now on meeting of the babiole committee nivernois does not go lingers saddled and bridled till the very end of the year arrives in berlin january 12th 1756 has his first audience january 14th a man highly amiable to friedrich but with proposalswonderful indeed  the french this good while back are in no doubt about war with england a right hearty war and have always expected to retain prussia as formerlythough rather on singular terms some time ago for instance m de rouille warminister requested knyphausen prussian envoy at paris suggest to your kings majesty what plunder there is at hanover perfectly at liberty to keep it all if he will plunder hanover for us oeuvres de frederic iv 29 pleasant message to the proud king who answered with the due brevity to the purport silence sirwith didactic effects on the surprised rouille who now mends his proposal though again in a remarkable way instructs nivernois namely to offer king friedrich the island of tobago if he will renew treaty and take arms for us island of tobago a deserted litigated but pretty island were it ever ours will not that entice this king intent on commerce friedrich who likes nivernois and his polite ways answers quizzingly island of tobago island of barataria your lordship must be meaning island of which i cannot be the sancho panza ib 31 and nivernois found he must not mention tobago again  for the rest friedrich made no secret of his english treaty showed it with all frankness to nivernois in all points is there can the most captious allege that there is anything against france in it my one wish and aim that of peace for myself judge nivernois stayed till march but seems to have had of definite only tobago and good words so that nothing farther came of him and there was no renewal of treaty then or after thus in his third month march 1756 practical nivernois was recalled without resultinstead of whom fat valori was sent privately intending to do nothing but observe in berlin from all which we infer that the babiole committee now saw land and that bernis himself had decided in the affirmative austria not prussia yes madame to the joy of madame and everybody for it is incredible say all witnesses what indignation broke out in paris when friedrich made this new defection so they termed it revolt from his liege lord who had been so exemplary to him on former occasions and would not bite at tobago when offered so that the babiole committee went on henceforth with flowing sea and by mayday 1st may 1756 brought out its frenchaustrian treaty in a completed state to stand by one another like castor and pollux in a manner 24000 reciprocally to be ready on demand nay i think something of subsidies withalto austria of course but the particulars are not worth giving the performance thanks to a zealous pompadour having quite outrun the stipulation and left it practically out of sight when the push came our constitutional historian may shadow the rest  france and england going to war in these sad circumstances and france and austria being privately prepared by kaunitz and others to swear everlasting friendship on the occasion instead of everlasting enmity as heretofore unexpected changes miraculous to the gazetteers became inevitablenothing less in short than explosion or topsyturvying of the old diplomaticpolitical scheme of europe old dance of the constellations flung heelsoverhead on the sudden and much pirouetting jigging setting before they could change partners and continue their august dance again whether in war or peace no end to the industrious wonder of the gazetteer mind to the dark difficulties of the diplomatic what bafflings agonistic shufflings impotent gazings into the dark what seductive fiddling and being fiddled to a most sad function of humanity if sometimes an inevitable one which ought surely at all times to be got over as briefly as possible to be written of especially with a maximum of brevity human nature being justly impatient of talk about it beyond the strictly needful  most true it is and was most miraculous though now quite forgotten again political europe had to make a complete whirlround on that occasion and not in a day and merely saying to itself let me do summerset as idle readers supposebut with long months of agonistic shuffle and struggle in all places and such diplomatic fiddling and being fiddled to as seldom was before of which these two instances the bernis and the hanbury are to serve as specimen two and no more a universe of extinct fiddling compressed into two nutshells if readers have an ear     chapter iiifrenchenglish

only three are in this country or have colonels even nominated incredible but certain and the interesting point is his grace of newcastle dare not have colonels still less higher officers nominated

friedrichs enigma gets more and more stringent  friedrichs situation in those fatefully questionable months and for many past especially from january 16th to julyreaders must imagine it for there is no description possible in many intricacies friedrich has been but never i reckon in any equal to this himself certain what the two imperial women have vowed against him self and winterfeld certain of that sad truth and all other mortals ready to deny it and fly delirious on hint of it should he venture to act in consequence friedrichs situation is not unimaginable when as can now be done by candid inquirers who will take trouble enough the one or two internal facts of it are disengaged from the roaring ocean of clamorous delusions which then enveloped them to everybody and are held steadily in view said ocean being well run off to the home of it very deep underground lies do fall silent truth waits to be recognized not always in vain no reader ever will conceive the strangling perplexity of that situation now so remote and extinct to us all i can do is to set down what features of it have become indisputable and leave them as detached traceries as fractions of an outline to coalesce into something of image where they can  winterfelds opinion was for some time past distinct attack them since it is certain they only wait to attack us but friedrich would by no means listen to that we must not be the aggressor my friend that would spoil all perhaps the english will pacify the russian catin for me tie her with packthreads bribes and intrigues from stirring wait watch fiery winterfeld who hates the french who despises the austrians and thinks the prussian army a considerable fact in politics has great schemes far too great for a practical friedrich plunge into the austrians with a will prussian soldierycan austrians resist it ruin them since they are bent on ruining us stir up the hungarian protestants try all things home upon our implacable enemies sword drawn scabbard flung away and the frenchwhat are the french our king should be kaiser of teutschland and he can and he maythe french would then be quieter these things winterfeld carried in his head and comrades have heard them from him over wine retzow i 43 c to all which friedrich if any whisper of them ever got to friedrich would answer one can guess how  it is evident friedrich had not given up his hope indeed for above a year more he never did that england might by profuse briberysuch the power of bribery in that mad courtassuage overnet with backstairs packthreads or in some way compesce the russian delirium for him and england his sole ally in the world still tender of austria and unable to believe what the full intentions of austria are england demands much wariness in his procedures towards austria reiterating always wait your majesty oh beware  his own army we need not say is in perfect preparation the armylet us guess 150000 regular or near 200000 of all arms and

dessau keith duke of brunswickbevern no one of these people has been idle in the ten years past least of all has the chief captain of themwhose diligence and vigilance in that sphere latterly were not likely to decline  friedrichs army is in the perfection of order ready at the hour for many months back but the least motion he makes with it is a subject of jealousy last year on those russian advancings and alacrities he had marched some regiments into pommern within reach of preussen should the russians actually try a stroke there see cried all the world see cried the enlightened russian public this year 1756 from june onwards and earlier there are still more fatal symptoms on the austrian side great and evident warpreparations magazines forming camps in bohemia moravia camp at konigsgratz camp at praghandy for the silesian border friedrich knows they have deliberated on their pretext for a war and have fixed on what will dosome new small prussianmecklenburg brabble which there has lately been paltry enough recruitingquarrel such as often are and has been settled mutually some time ago this one but is capable of being ripped up againand that on this cobweb of a pretext they mean to draw sword when they like russia too has its pretext ready and if friedrich hint of stirring england whispers hoarse england and other friends wait your majesty oh beware to keep ones sword at its sharpest and with an easy patient air ones eyes vigilantly open this is nearly all that friedrich can do in neighborhood of such portentous imminencies he has many critics near and farfor instance  berlin 31st july 1756 excellency valori writes to versailles  to give you account of a conversation i have had a day or two ago with the prince of prussia august wilhelm heirapparent who honors me with a particular confidenceand who appears to be privately like some others very strong in the opposition view he talked to me of the present condition of the king his brother of his brothers apprehensions of his military arrangements of the little trust placed in him by neighbors of their hostile humor towards him and of many other things which this good prince little understanding them as would appear or the dangerous secret that lay under them did not approve of the prince then saidlisten to what the prince of prussia said to valori one of the last days of july 1756  there is an anecdote which continually recurs to me in the passes we are got to at present putting the case we might be attacked by russia and perhaps by austria the late rothenburg was sent as readers know on the kings part to milord tyrconnel to know of him what in such case were the helps he might reckon on from france milord enumerated the various helps and then added being a blusterous irishman sent hither for his ill tongue helps enough you observe monsieur but morbleu if you deceive us you will be squelched vous serez ecrases the king my brother was angry enough at hearing such a speech but my dear marquis and the prince turned full upon me with a face of inquiry can the thing actually come true and do you think it can be the interest of your master and his scarlet woman to abandon us to the fury of our enemies ah that cursed convention neutralityconvention with england i would give a finger from my hand that it had never been concluded i never approved of it ask the duc de nivernois he knows what we said of it together but how return on our steps who would now trust us this prince appeared to be much affected by the king his brothers situation of which he understood as good as nothing and agreed that he the king his brother had well deserved it valori ii 129131  this is not the first example nor the last of august wilhelms owning a heedless goodnatured tongue considerably prone to take the opposition side on light grounds for which if he found a kind of solacement and fame in some circles it was surely at a dear rate to his brother that bad habit would most likely be known and his brother i suppose did not speak of it at all such his brothers custom in cases of the kindjudicious valori by way of answer dilated on the peculiar esteem of his majesty louis xv for the prussian majestyso as my instructions direct me to do and we hear no more of the prince of prussias talk at this time but shall in future and may conjecture a great deal about the atmosphere friedrich had now to live in a friedrich undergoing privately a great deal of criticism mad tendency to war lust of conquest contempt for his neighbors for the opinion of the worldno end of irrational tendencies ib ii 124151 july 27thaugust 21st from persons to whom the secret of his problem is deeply unknown  one wise thing the english have done sent an excellency mitchell a man of loyalty of sense and honesty to be their resident at berlin this is the noteworthy not yet much noted sir andrew mitchell by far the best excellency england ever had in that court an aberdeen

regard with friedrich and well deserved to do so constantly about him during the next seven years and whose letters are among the perennially valuable documents on friedrichs history happily secured in the british museum and now in the most perfect order for consulting thanks to sir f madden and three years labor well investedshould certainly and will one day be read to the bottom and cleared of their darknesses extrinsic and intrinsic which are considerable by somebody competent  mitchell is in berlin since june 10th mitchell who is on the scene itself and looking into friedrich with his own eyes finds the reiterating of that beware your majesty which had been his chief task hitherto a more and more questionable thing and suggests to him at last plainly ask her hungarian majesty what is your meaning by those bohemian campings pshaw answers friedrich nothing but some ambiguous answer perhaps with insult in itnevertheless thinks better and determines to do so mitchell papers     chapter ivfriedrich puts a question at vienna twice over  july 18th 1756 friedrich despatches an express to graf von klinggraf his resident at vienna an experienced man whom we have seen before in old carteret conferenceofhanau times to demand audience of the empress and in the fittest terms friendly and courteous brief and clear to put that question of mitchells suggesting those unwonted armaments camps in bohmen camps in mahren and military movements and preparations klinggraf is to say have caused anxiety in her majestys peaceable neighbor of prussia who desires always to continue in peace and who requests hereby a word of assurance from her majesty that these his anxieties are groundless friedrich himself hopes little or nothing from this but he has done it to satisfy people about him and put an end to all scruples in himself and others the answer may be expected in ten or twelve days  and about the same timelikely enough directly after though there is no date given to a fact which is curious and authentic  friedrich sent for two of his chief generals to potsdam for a secret conference with winterfeld and him the generals are old schwerin and general retzow seniormajorgeneral retzow whom we used to hear of in the silesian warsand whose son reports on this occasion conference is on this imminency of war and as to what shall be done in it friedrich explains in general terms his dangers from austria and russia his certainty that austria will attack him and asks were it or were it not better to attack austria as is our prussian principle in such case schwerin and retzowschwerin first as the eldest and after him retzow who privately has charge from the prussian princes to do itopine strongly that indications are uncertain that much seems inevitable which does not come that in a time of such tumultuous whirlings and unexpected changes the true rule is watch well and wait  after enough of this with winterfeld looking dissent but saying almost nothing friedrich gives sign to winterfeldwho spreads out in their lucidest prearranged order the principal menzelweingarten documents and bids the two military gentlemen read they read with astonishment are forced to believe stand gazing at one anotherand do now take a changed tone schwerin after a silence of everybody for some minutesbursts out like one inspired if war is to be and must be let us start tomorrow seize saxony at once and in that rich corny country form magazines for our operations on bohemia retzow i 39  that is privately friedrichs own full intention saxony with its elbe river as highway is his indispensable preliminary for bohemia and he will not a second time as he did in 1744 with such results leave it in an unsecured condition adieu then messieurs silent au revoir which may be soon retzow junior a rational sincere but rather pipeclayed man who is wholly to be trusted on this conference with his father for authority has some touches of commentary on it which indicate date being 1802 that till the end of his life or of prince henri his patrons there remained always in some heads a doubt as to friedrichs wisdom in regard to starting the sevenyears war and to schwerins entire sincerity in that inspired speech and still more curious that there was always at potsdam as elsewhere a majestys opposition party privately intent to look at the wrong side and doing it diligentlythough with lips strictly closed for most part without words except wellweighed and to the wise which is an excellent arrangement for a majesty and majestys opposition where feasible in the world  from retzow i learn farther that winterfeld directly on the back of this conference took a tour to the bohemian baths to karlsbad or toplitz for ones health and wandered about a good deal in those frontier mountains of bohemia taking notes taking sketches not with a picturesque view and returned by the saxon pirna country a strange stony labyrinth which he guessed might possibly be interesting soon the saxon commandant of the konigstein lofty fortress of those parts strongest in saxony was of winterfelds acquaintance winterfeld called on this commandant found his konigstein too high for cannonading those neighborhoods but that there was at the base of it a new work going on and that the saxons were though languidly endeavoring to bestir themselves in matters military their entire army at present is under 20000 but in the course of next winter they expect to have it 40000 shall be of that force against season 1757 no doubt winterfelds gatherings and communications had their uses at potsdam on his getting home from this tour to toplitz  meanwhile klinggraf has had his audience at vienna and has sped as ill as could have been expected the answer given was of supercilious brevity evasive in effect null and as good as answering that there is no answer two accounts we have as friedrich successively had them of this famed passage first klinggrafs own which is clear rapid and stands by the essential second an account from the other side of the scenes furnished by menzel of dresden for friedrichs behoof and ours which curiously illustrates the foregoing and confirms the interpretation friedrich at once made of it this is menzels account in other words the saxon envoy at viennas stolen by menzel  july 26th it appears klinggrafhaving applied to kaunitz the day before who noticed a certain flurry in him and had answered carelessly audience yes of course nay i am this moment going to the empress only you must tell me about whatwas admitted to the imperial presence he first of many that were waiting imperial presence held in its hand a snip of paper carefully composed by kaunitz from the data and read these words die bedenklichen umstande the questionable circumstances of the time have moved me to consider as indispensably necessary those measures which for my own security and for defence of my allies i am taking and which otherwise do not tend the least towards injury of anybody whatsoeverand adding no syllable more gave a sign with her hand intimating to klinggraf that the interview was done klinggraf strode through the antechamber

the scenes sees that the thing is settled writes again however august 2d probably the day after or the same day klinggrafs despatch reached him instructing klinggraf to request a less oracular response and specially if her imperial majesty austria and russia being as is understood in active league against him will say that austria will not attack him this year or the next draw up memorial

and not quite peculiar to ferdinand which are worth reading   the king to duke ferdinand of brunswick  potsdam 15th august 1756  for time of fieldservice i have made the arrangement that for the subaltern officers of your regiment over and above their ordinary equipagemoneys there shall to each subaltern officer and once for all be eight thalers twentyfour shillings sterling advanced that sum eight thalers per subaltern shall be paid to the captain of every company and besides this there shall monthly two thalers be deducted from the subalterns pay and be likewise paid over to the captainin return for which he is to furnish free table for the subalterns throughout the campaign and so long as the regiment is in the field  of the two baggagecarts per company the regiment shall take only one and leave the other at home no officer let him be who or of what title he will generals not excepted shall take with him the least of silver plate not even a silver spoon whoever wants therefore to keep table great or small tafel oder tisch must manage the same with tin utensilswithout exception be he who he will  each captain shall take with him a little cask of vinegar of which as soon as the regiments get to camp he must give me reckoning and i will then have him repaid this vinegar shall solely and exclusively be employed for this purpose that in places where the water is bad there be poured into it for the soldiers a few drops of the vinegar to correct the water and thereby preserve them from illnesses  so soon as the regiment gets on march the women who have permission to follow are put under command of the profoss that thereby all plunderings and disorders may the more be guarded against if the captains and officers take grooms jager or the like domestics there can

prussian sentries pacing about in those corridorscorridors which lead to the secret archives important to some of usinstead of which the said king had not only doubled his sentries there but also by an officer demanded the keys of the archiveapartment just alluded to and as the queens majesty for security of all writings there offered to seal the door of it herself and did so there and thenthe said officer had so little respect that he clapped his own seal thereon too  nor was he content therewithnot by any meansbut the same officer having been with wylich commandant here came back a short

the saxon camp did continueunmanageable by any method for five weeks to come the season of waroperations gone by that timeand friedrichs first campaign rendered mostly fruitless in this manner will by no means check the austrian truculencies as by his velocity he hoped to do no but on the contrary will rouse the austrians french and all enemies to a tenfold pitch of temper and bring upon himself from an astonished and misunderstanding public such tempests and world tornadoes of loudroaring obloquy as even he friedrich had never endured before  to readers of a touring habit this saxon country is perhaps well known for the last halfcentury it has been growing more and more famous under the name of saxon switzerland sachsische schweitz instead of misnian highlands meissnische hochland which it used to be called a beautiful enough and extremely rugged country interesting to the picturesque mind begins rising in soft hills on both sides of the elbe a few miles east of dresden as you ascend the river till it rises into hills of wild character getting ever wilder and riven into wondrous chasms and precipices extends say almost twenty miles up the river to tetschen and beyond in this eastern direction and with perhaps ten miles of breadth on each side of the river area of the rockregion therefore is perhaps some four hundred square miles the falkenberg what we should call hawkscrag northeastward in the lausitz the schneeberg snow mountain southeastward on the bohemian border are about thirtyfive miles apart these two are both reckoned to be in itits last outposts on that eastern side but the limits of it are fixed by custom only and depend on no natural condition  we might define it as the sandstone neck of the metal mountains a rather lower block of sandstone intercalated into the metalmountain range which otherwise on both hands is higher and of harder rocks southward as shoulder to this sandstone neck lies continuous broad and high the metalmountain range specially so called northward and northeastward there rise beyond that falkenberg many mountains solitary or in groupsthe metal mountains fading out here into the lausitz hills still in fine picturesque fashion which are northern border to the great bohemian basin of the elba after you emerge from this sandstone country  saxon switzerland is not very high anywhere 2000 feet is a notable degree of height but it is torn and tumbled into stone labyrinths chasms and winding rockwalls as few regions are grows pinewood to the topmost height pinetrees far aloft look quietly down upon you over sheer precipices on your intricate path on the slopes of the hills is grass enough in the intervals are villages and husbandries are corn and milk for the laborious nativeswho depend mainly on quarrying and pineforest work pines and freestone rafts of long slim pines and big stone barges are what one sees upon the river there a note not very geological says of it  elbe sweeps freely through this country for ages and aeons past curling himself a little into snakefigure and with increased velocity but silent mostly and trim to the edge a fine flintcolored riverthough in aeons long anterior it must have been a very different matter for torrents and waterpower the country is one huge block of sandstone so many square miles of that material ribbed channelled torn and quarried in this manner by the everbusy elements for a million of ages past chiefly by the elbe himself since he got to be a river and became cosmic and personal ceasing to be a mere watery chaos of lakes and deluges hereabouts for the sandstone was of various degrees of hardness tenacious as marble some parts of it soft almost as sand other parts and the primordial diluviums and worldold torrents great and small rushing down from the bohemian highlands from the saxon metal mountains with such storming gurgling and swashing have swept away the soft parts and left the hard standing in this chaotic manner and bequeathed it all to the elbe and the common frosts and rains of these human ages  elbe has now a trim course but elbe too is busy quarrying and mining where not artificially held inand you notice at every outlet of a brook from the interior north side and south side how busy the brook has been boring grinding undermining much helped by the frosts by the rains aeons ago the brook was a lake in the interior but was every moment laboring to get out till it has cut for itself that mountain gullet or sheerdown chasm and brought out with it an alluvium or deltaon which since adams time human creatures have built a hamlet that is the origin or unwritten history of most hamlets and cultivated spots you fall in with here they are the waste shavings of the brook working millions of years for its own object of getting into the elbe in level circumstances ploughed fields not without fertility are in the interior if you ascend that brook the hamlet at the delta or mouth of it is as if built

encouragement to reflect except upon his own sorrows and delirious circumstances physical and moral how much happier were i lying in my bed thinks the bewildered touristdoes strive withal to admire the picturesque but with little success notices the bastei bastion and other rigorously prescribed points of the sublime and beautiful which are to be done that you will have to do my friend step out you will have to go on that pinnacle with indifferent hotel attached on that iron balcony aloft among the clouds yonder and shudder to project over elbeflood from such altitudes admiring the picturesque in prescribed manner  this country has for its permanent uses timber freestone modicum of milk and haver serviceable to the generalityand to his polish majesty at present it is as the very ark of noah priceless at this juncture being the strongest military country in the world excellent strength in it express fortresses especially one fortress called the konigstein not far from schandau

preciosities impregnable to gunpowder artillery not to be had except by hunger and then farther down the river close by pirna presiding over pirna as that konigstein in some sort does over schandau is the sonnenstein sonnenstein too was a fortress in those days of friedrich but not impregnable if judged worth taking the austrians took it a year or two hence friedrich retook it dismantled it the sonnenstein is now a madhouse say the guidebooks  sonnenstein stands close east or upstream of pirna which is a town of 5000 souls by much the largest in those parts konigstein a little downstream of schandau which latter is on the opposite or north side of the river these are the two chief towns which do all the trade of this region picturesque places boththe tourist remembers pirna standing on its sleek table or stairstep by the rivers edge well above floodmark green shaggy or fringy mountains looking down on it to rearward in front beyond the river nothing visible but milelong creamcolored rockwall with bushes at bottom and top wall quarried by elbe as you can see pirna is near the beginning properly end but we start from dresden or western extremity of saxon schweitz schandau almost at the opposite or eastern extremity is still more picturesque standing on the delta of a little brook with high rockcliffs with gardenshrubberies sanded walks tufts of forestumbrage a bright painted almost operaticlooking placewith spawaters if i recollect yes truly and the bath season making its packages in great haste breaking up prematurely this year 1756  directly on arriving at grosssedlitz friedrich takes ocular survey of this country which is already not unknown to him he finds that the saxons have secured themselves within the mountains a rocky streamlet brook of gottleube which issues into elbe just between grosssedlitz and them through a dell of eighty or a hundred feet deep serving as their first defence well in front of the mere rocky heights and precipices behind it which stretch continuously along to southward six miles or more from pirna and the south brink of elbe at langenhennersdorf which is the southernmost part these heights make an elbow inwards by leopoldshayn towards the konigstein which is but four miles off here too the saxons are defended by a brook running straight towards konigstein this one in front of their heights and stand defensive in this way along a rockbulwark of ten miles long the passes all secured by batteries by abatis palisades mile after mile as friedrich rides observant leftward behind them elbe rushing swifter through his rockwalls yonder with chasms and intricate gorges defending them inexpugnably to rear six miles long of natural bulwark six to hennersdorf where the gross of the saxons lie then to konigstein four other miles sufficiently if more sparsely beset by them no stronger position in the world friedrich thinks oeuvres de frederic iv 83 84 not a very distinct account and far from accurate in the detailswhich are left without effectual correction even in the best editionsand that it is impossible to force this place without a loss of life disproportionate even to its importance at present not to say that the saxons will make terms all the easier before bloodshed rise between usand furthermore that hunger for we hear they have provision only for two weeks may itself soon do it wedge them in therefore block every outgate every entrance nothing to get in except gradually hunger hunger and on our part rational offers will suffice that is friedrichs plan good in itselfthough the ovine obstinacy and other circumstances retarded the execution of it to an unexpected extent lamentable to friedrich and to some others  the prussiansaxon military operations for the next five weeks need not detain us their respective positions on the heights behind that brook gottleube and on the plainer country in front of it  how the prussians lie first division of them from grosssedlitz to zehist under the king then second division from zehist to cotta and onward by the rothschenke redhouse tavern by markersbach and sparsely as far as hellendorf on the prag highway in brief where all the divisions of them lie and under whom and where the prussians watching elbe itself have batteries and posts on the north side of it all this is marked on the mapto satisfy ingenuous curiosity should it make tour in those parts to which add only these straggles of note as farther elucidative  the saxons between elbe and their lines possess about thirty square miles of country from pirna or sonnenstein to konigstein as the crow flies may be five miles east to west but by langenhennersdorf and the elbow there it will be ten at konigstein moreover elbe makes an abrupt turn northward for a couple of miles instead of westward as heretofore turning abruptly westward again after that so that the saxon camp or occupancy here is an irregular trapezium with pirna and konigstein for vertices and with area estimable as aboveploughable a fair portion of it and not without corn of its own so that the two weeks provision spun themselves out short allowance aiding to two months before actual famine came   the highroad from the lausitz parts crosses elbe at pirna falls into the dresdenprag highroad there and from pirna towards toplitz for the first few miles this latter runs through the prussian posts but we may guess it is not much travelled at present north of elbe too the prussians have batteries on the fit points detachments of due force from grosssedlitz bridgeofpontoons all round to schandau or beyond could fire upon the konigstein across the river they have plugged up the saxon position everywhere they have a battery especially and strong post to cannonade the bridge at pirna should the saxons think of trying there it is now the one saxon or even halfsaxon bridge sonnenstein and pirna command the saxon end of it a strong battery the prussian end a bridge lying mainly idle like the general highway to toplitz at this time beyond the konigstein again at a place called wendischfahre wendsferry the prussians have by means of boats swinging wide at anchor on the swift current what is called a flyingbridge with which the north side can communicate with the south they have a post at niederraden ober raden railway station in our time is on the south side nether raden is an interesting little hamlet mostly invisible to mankind built in the throat of the stone chasms there from which you begin mounting to the bastei far aloft a raden to be noted by the tourist and us  little or even nothing of fighting there is why should there be the military operations are a deadlock and require no word thirty thousand half of the prussian force lie vigilant as lynxes blockading here other half 32000 under marshal keith have marched forward to aussig to nollendorf on the bohemian frontier to clear the ways and look into any austrian motion thereaboutswith whom with some pandour detachment of whom duke ferdinand leading the vanguard has had a little brush among the hills smiting them home again in his usual creditable way september 13th and taking camp at peterswalde he and others of the force that night oeuvres de frederic iv 85 anonymous of hamburg i 19 it is with this keith army with this if with any that adventures are to be looked for at present  polish majestys headquarters are at struppen well in the centre of the saxon lines goes always to the konigstein to sleep polish majestys own table is by friedrichs permission for that special object supplied ad libitum but the common men were at once put on short allowance which grows always the shorter polish majesty corresponds with friedrich as we saw and above all sends burning messages to austria to france to every european court charged with mere shrieks help me a robber has me in which sense excellencies of all kinds especially one lord stormont the english excellency daily running out from dresden to grosssedlitz are passionately industrious with friedrich who is eager enough to comply were there any safe means possible but there are none unfortunately too it appears the austrians are astir feldmarschall browne actually furbishing himself at prag yonder with an eye hitherward and extraordinary haste and spirit shown which obliges friedrich to rise in his demands ovine obstinacy on the other side naturally increasing from the same cause  polish majesty we say has liberty to bring in proviant for self and suite rigorously for no mortal more and he lives well in the culinary sensesurely for most part in his dressinggown too poor loose collapsed soul bruhl and he have plenty of formal business but their one real business is that of crying by estafettes and every conceivable method to austria get us out of this to which austria has answered yes only patience and be steadyfriedrichs headquarters are at sedlitz and the negotiating and responding which he has transcends imagination his first hope was polish majesty might be persuaded to join with himon the back of that certainty gradually coming that polish majesty never would and that the austrians would endeavor a rescue were they once ready starvation or the austrians which will be first here is the question and friedrich studies to think it will be the former at all events having settled on the starvation method and seen that all his posts are right we perceive he does not stick close by sedlitz but runs now hither now thither is at torgau where an important establishment kind of new government for saxony on the finance side is organizing itself what his work with ambassadors was and how delicate the handling needed thinkhere is another clipping   polish majesty passes the day at struppen amid many vain noises of soldiering of diplomatizing the night always at konigstein and finally both day and nightquite luxuriously accommodated bruhl and he to the very end of this affair towards struppen this is weeks farther on but we give it herecomte de broglio old broglios elder son younger is in the military line who is ambassador to his saxonpolish majesty sets out from dresden for an interview with said majesty at the prussian lines he is informed yes you can go but without our kings order you cannot return what the most christian majestys ambassador and treated in this way

thinks valori think the prussian officers who are sorry but inflexible margraf karl commandant of the place in absence of king friedrich who is gone lately on a business we shall hear of earnestly

and must indignant broglio reappeared next day on foot lieutenantgeneral prince friedrich eugen of wurtemberg the chief man in charge do you dare indubitably yesand broglio still pushing on

daughter of those injured polish majesties fell on her knees pompadour permitting and encouraging at the feet of most christian majesty on her knees all in passion of tears craved help and protection to her loved old mother in the name of nature and of all kings could any king resist and his pompadour was busy think of that noble empress who calls me cousin and dear princess think of that insolent prussian robber ah your majestyand king louis though not a hating man did privately dislike friedrich and evil speeches of friedrichs had been reported to him and in short the upshot was king louis bound only to 24000 for help of austria determined to send and did send above 100000 across the rhine next year for that object as will be seen and all frenchmenall except belleisle who is oldare charmed with these new energetic measures and beautiful new austrian connections  certain it is the austrians are coming her imperial majesty bent with all her might on relief of those saxon martyrs which indeed is relief of herself as she well perceives courage my friends endure yet a little messengers smuggle themselves through the mountain paths and go and return though with difficulty  since september 19th the correspondence with polish majesty has ceased no persuading of the polish majesty winterfeld went twice to him conferred at large bruhl forbidden to be there on the actual stringencies and urgencies of fact between the two countries but it was with no result at all polish majesty has not the least intention that saxony shall be even a highway for friedrich if at any time polish majesty can hinder it neutrality therefore will not do for friedrich he demands alliance practical partnership and to that his polish majesty is completely abhorrent diplomatizing may cease nothing but wrestle of fight will settle this matter  friedrich able to get nothing from the sovereign of saxony is reduced to grasp saxony itself and we can observe him doing it always the closer always the more carefully as the complicacy deepens and the obstinacy becomes more dangerous and provoking what alternative is there on first entering saxony friedrich had made no secret that he was not a mere bird of passage there at torgau there was at once a fieldcommissariat established with prussian officials of eminence to administer the military chest to be deposited there and torgau to be put in a state of defence torgau our saxon metropolis of warfinance is becoming more and more the metropolis of saxon finance in general saxon officials were liable from the first to be suspended on friedrichs order saxon financeofficials of all kinds were from the first instructed that till farther notice there must be no disbursements without king friedrichs sanction and in fact king friedrich fully intends that saxony is to help him all it can and that it either will or else shall in this dire pressure of perplexity which is due in such a degree to the conduct of the saxon government for twelve years past would saxony go with him in any form of consent how much more convenient to friedrich but saxony will not polish majesty not himself suffering hunger is obstinate as the decrees of fate or as sheep when too much put upon regardless of considerationsand in fine here is browne actually afoot coming to relieve polish majestythe austrians had uncommonly bestirred themselves  the activity the zeal of all ranks ever since this expedition into saxony and clutching of saxony by the throat contemporary witnesses declare to have been extraordinary horses for piccolominis cavalrythey had scarcely got their horses not to speak of training them not to speak of cannon and the heavier requisites when schwerin began marching out of glatz on piccolomini as to the cannon for browne and him draughtcattle seem absolutely unprocurable whereupon maria theresa flings open her own imperial studs there yoke these to our cannon let them go their swiftestwhich awoke such an enthusiasm that noblemen and peasants crowded forward with their coachhorses and their carthorses to relay browne all through bohemia at different stages and the cannon and equipments move to their places at the gallop in a manner archenholtz i 24and even browne at the base of the metal mountains has got most of his equipments and is astir towards pirna army of 60000 rumor says for relief of the saxon martyrs friedrichs complexities are getting day by day more stringent  from the middle of september marshal keith as was observed with half of the prussians duke ferdinand of brunswick under him has been on the bohemian slope of the metal mountains securing the roads towns and passes thereabouts and looking out for the advance of marshal browne from the interior parts town of aussig and the riverroad castle of tetschen on its high rock known to tourists which always needs to be taken on such occasions these keith has secured lies encamped from peterswalde to aussig the middle or main strength of him being in the hamlet of johnsdorf discoverable if readers like there lies keith fifteen miles in length like a strap or bar thrown across the back of that metalmountain rangeor part of its back for the range is very broad and there is much inequality and many troughs big and little partial and general in the crossing of it a tract which my readers and i have crossed before now by the pascopol or postroad and otherwise and shall often have to cross  browne vigorously astir in the interior cannon and equipments coming by relays at such a pace is daily advancing with his best speed in the last days of september browne is encamped at budin may cross the eger river any day and will then be within two marches of keith his intentions towards pirna country are fixed and sure but the plan or route he will take is unknown to everybody and indeed to browne himself till he see near at hand and consider brownes problem he himself knows is abundantly abstrusebordering on the impossible but he will try his best to get within reach of the saxons is almost impossible to browne even were there no keith there as good as impossible altogether by any line of march while keith is afoot in those parts by aussig down the river straight for the interior of their camp it is flatly impossible by the south or southeast corner of their camp gottleube way or by the northeast by schandau way right bank of elbe it is virtually soat least without beating keith could one beat keith indeedbut that will not be easy and that unluckily is the preliminary to everything  by the hellendorfhennersdorf side in the wastes where gottleube brook gathers itself browne might have a chance there on that southeast corner of their camp were he once there to attack the prussians from without while the saxons burst up from withinthere thinks a good judge is much the favorablest place but unless brownes army had wings how is it ever to get there across those metalmountain ranges barred by keithby aussig with the rocks overhanging elbe river and him he cannot go in any case were there no keith indeed but there always is standing ready on the spring one might hold to leftward and by stolen marches swift far round about  by schandau region north side of the elbe is brownes easiest and indeed one feasible point of approachno prussians at present between him and that the road open though a far circuit northward for brownewere he to cross the elbe in leitmeritz circle and march with velocity that too will be difficultnearly impossible in sight of keith and were that even done the egress for the saxons by schandau side is through strait mountain gorges intricate steep passes crossings of the elbe what force of saxons or of austrians will drive the prussians from their redoubts and batteries there oeuvres de frederic iv 86 93 96  brownes problem is none of the feasiblest but his orders are strict relieve the saxons at all risks and browne one of the ablest soldiers living your imperial majestys best general said the dying khevenhuller long since will do his utmost upon it friedrich does not think the enterprise very dangerousbeating of keith the indispensable preliminary to it but will naturally himself go and look into it  tuesday september 28th friedrich quits pirna country by the prag highway making due inspection of his posts as he goes along and the outmost of these once past drives rapidly up the mountains gets with small escort through peterswalde on to johnsdorf that night does not think this keith position good breaks up this camp of johnsdorf bodily next morning and marches down the mountains direct towards browne who we hear is about crossing the eger his pontoons now come at last and will himself be on the advance from turmitz a poor mountain hamlet in the hollow of the hills which is headquarters that night the march proceeds again friedrich with the vanguard army i think on various countryroads on both hands till all get upon the great road againpragtoplitzdresden postroad which is called specially in this part of it and loosely in whole the pascopol and leads down direct to budin and browne  a pascopol famed in military annals says our tourist it is a road with many windings many precipitous sweeps of up and down road precipitous in structureoffers views to the lover of wild nature huge lonesome hills scattered in the distance waste expanses nearer hand and futile attempts at moorish agriculture but little else that is comfortable in times of peace you will meet at long intervals some postvehicle struggling forward under melancholy circumstances some cart or dilapidated mongrel between cart and basket with a lean ox harnessed to it and scarecrow driver laden with pitcoalwhich you wish safe home and that the scarecrow were getting warmed by it but in wartime the steep road is livelier the common invasion road between saxony and bohemia whole armies sweeping over it and their thousandfold wagons and noises making clangor enough  one of those hollows on the pascopol is joachimsthal with its old silver mines yielding coins which were in request with traders the silver being fine let my

village of lobositz its poor cornmills and huckstershops all peaceably unknown as yet which is soon to become very famous  the countryroads where friedrichs army is on march i should think are mostly on the mounting hand for here from turmitz is a trough again though the last considerable one and on the crest of that we shall look down upon the bohemian plains and the grand basin of the elbethrough various scrubby villages which are not nameworthy through one called kletschen which for a certain reason is crossing the shoulder of kletschenberg hill of this kletschen which abuts upon the pascopolyonder in bright sunshine is your beautiful expansive basin of the elbe and the green bohemian plains revealed for a moment friedrich snatches his glass not with picturesque object see yonder is feldmarschall browne then in camp yonder down by lobositz not ten miles from usit is most true browne marched this morning long before the sun crossed eger and pitched camp at noongood thinks friedrich and pushes down into the pascopol into the hollows and minor troughs which hide browne henceforth till we are quite near  quite near through welmina and a certain final gap of the hills friedrich with the vanguard does emerge an hour before sunset overhanging browne not above a mile from the camp of browne a very large camp that of brownes flanked to right by the elbe goes from sulowitz through lobositz to welhoten close on elbeand has properties extremely well worth studying just now friedrich the books say bivouacs by a fire of sticks short way down on the southern slope of the hill and till sunset and after has eyeglass brain and faculties and activities sufficiently occupied for the rest of the nighthis divisions gradually taking post behind him under arms not till

our day but some bewildered memory of alte fritz clinging obstinately even to the peasant mind thereabouts a sleepy littery place some biggish haggard untrimmed trees some brokenbacked sleepylooking thatched houses not in contact and each as far as might be with its back turned on the other and cloaked in its own litter and privacy probably no human creature will be visible as you pass through much straw lying about chiefly where the few gaunt trees look down on it cattle glad of any shelter in fact it is mainly an extinct tumult of straw nothing alive as you pass but a few poor oxen languidly sauntering up and down finding much to trample little to eat the czech populations were it not for that question of the nationalities are not very beautiful  close south of this poor hamlet is a big hill conspicuous with three peaks quite at the other base of which a good way down lies lobositz the main village in those parts a place now of assiduous cornmill and fruit trade and one of

shoulder of this lobosch hill runs the road from welmina to lobositz with branches towards many other villages to your right or southern hand short way southward rises the other hill which lloyd calls homolka hill the gap or interval between homolka and lobosch perhaps a furlong in extent is essentially the pass through those uplands this pass friedrich at the first moment made sure of filling the same with battalions there to bivouac he likewise promptly laid hold of the two hills high lobosch to his left and lower homolka to right which precautionary measure it is reckoned a fault in browne to have neglected that night fault for which he smarted on the morrow  from this upland pass or neck between the two mountains friedrichs battalions would have had a fine view had the morning shone for them lobositz leitmeritz melnick a great fertile valley or expanse of fruitful country many miles in breadth and length elbe like a silver stripe winding grandly through the finest of all his countries before ducking himself into the rocktumults of that pirna district the mountain gorges of prag and moldau river south of melnick lie hidden under the horizon or visible only as peaks thirty miles and more to southeastward a bright country intervening sprinkled with steepled towns to northwestward far away are the lausitz mountains ranked in loose order but massive making a kind of range and as outposts to them in their scattered state hills of good height and aspect are scattered all about and break the uniformity of the plain nowhere in north germany could the prussian battalions have a finer viewif the morning were fine and if views were their object  the morning first in october was not fine and it was far other than scenery that the prussian battalions had in handfriday 1st october 1756 day should have broken but where is day at seven in the morning and on till eleven thick mist lay over the plain thin fog to the very hilltops so that you cannot see a hundred yards ahead lobositz is visible only as through a crape farther on nothing but gray sea under which what the austrians are doing or whether there are any austrians who can say leftward on the loboschhill side as we reconnoitre some pandours are noticeable nestled in the vineyards therethat sunward side of the lobosch is all vineyards belonging to the different lobositzers scrubby vineyards all in a brown plucked state at this season vineyards parted by low stone walls say three or four feet high parted by hurdles or by tiny trenches in our day and the stone walls mere stone facings there are the pandours crouched and give fire in a kneeling posture when you approach lower down near lobositz itself flickerings as of horse squadrons probably hussar parties twinkle dubious in the wavering mist problem wrapt in mist nothing to be seen and all depends on judging it with accuracy seven by the clock deploy at any rate let us cover our post and be in readiness for events  friedrichs vanguard of itself nearly fills that neck or space between the lobosch and homolka hills he spreads his infantry and hundred fieldpieces in part rightwards along the homolka hill but chiefly leftwards along the lobosch where their nearest duty is to drive off those pandours always as a new battalion pushing farther leftward comes upon its ground the pandours give fire on itand it on the pandours till the left wing is complete and all the lobosch is in this manner a crackling of pandour musketry and antimusketry right wing steady to its guns on the homolka has as yet nothing to do those wings of infantry are two lines deep the cavalry in three lines is between them in the centre no room for cavalry elsewhere except on the outskirts some fringing of light horse to be ready for emergencies  the pandour firing except for the noise of it does not amount to much they can take no aim says lloyd crouching behind their stone fences and the prussian battalions steadily pushing downwards trample out their sputtering and clear the lobosch of them to a safe distance but the ground is intricate so wrapt in mist for the present that crackling lasts for hours decisive of nothing and the mist also and ones anxious guessings and scrutinizings lasts in a wavering fitful manner  once for some time in the wavering of the mist there was seen down in the plain opposite our centre a body of cavalry horse for certain say ten squadrons of them or 1500 horse continually manoeuvring changing shape now in more ranks now in fewer sometimes checkerwise formed like a draughtboard shooting out wings they career about one sees not whither or vanish again into the mist behind brownes rearguard this that we are come upon thinks friedrich these squatted pandours backed by horse must be his rearguard that are amusing us browne and the army are off crossing the elbe hastening towards the schandau the pirna quarter while we stand bickering and idly sputtering hereweary of such idle business friedrich orders forward twenty of his squadrons from the centre station charge me those austrian horse and let us finish this the twenty squadrons preceded by a pair of fieldpieces move down hill storm in upon the austrian party storm it furiously into the mist are furiously chasing itwhen unexpected cannonbatteries destructive caseshot awaken on their left flank batteries from lobositz one may guess and force them to draw back to draw back with some loss and rank again in an indignantly blown condition at the foot of their hill indignant after brief breathing they try it once more  dont try it friedrich had sent out to tell them for the mist was clearing and friedrich on the higher ground saw new important phenomena but it was too late for the twenty squadrons are again dashing forward sweeping down whatever is before them in spite of cannonvolleys they plunge deeper and deeper into the mist come upon a ditch twelve feet broad big swampy drain such as are still found there grassgreen in summertime clear said ditch forward still deeper into the mist and after three hundred yards come upon a second far worse ditch plainly impassable this oneditch they call it though it is in fact a vile sedgy brook oozing along there the morell bach considerable brook lazily wandering towards lobositz where it disembogues in rather swifter fashionand are saluted with cannon from the farther side and see serried ranks under the gauze of mist brownes army in fact the twenty squadrons have to recoil out of shotrange the faster the better with a loss of a good many men in those two charges friedrich orders them up hill again much regretful of this second charge which he wished to hinder and posts them to rearwardwhere they stand silent the unconscious stoicphilosophers in buff and have little farther service through the rest of the day  it is now 11 oclock the mist all clearing off and friedrich before that second charge had a growing view of the plain and its condition beyond question there is browne not in retreat by any means but in full array numerous and his position very strong ranked unattackable mostly behind that oozy brook or bach of morell which has only two narrow bridges cannon plenty on both one bridge from the south parts to sulowitz our road to sulowitz and it would be by radostitz and the homolka and then one other bridge connecting sulowitz with lobositzwhich latter is brownes own bridge uniting right wing and left of browne so to speak and is still more unattackable in the circumstances what will friedrich decide on attempting  that oozy morell brook issues on brownes side of lobositz cutting browne in two but is otherwise all in brownes favor browne extends through lobositz and beyond it curves up to welhoten on the riverbrink at lobositz are visible considerable redoubts cannonbatteries and much regular infantry browne will be difficult to force yonder in the lobositz part but yonder alone can he be tried he is pushing up more infantry that way conscious probably of that factand that the lobosch hill is not his but anothers what would not browne now give for the lobosch hill yesternight he might have had it gratis in a manner and indeed did try slightly with his pandour people durst not at greater expensewho have now ceased sputtering and cower extinct in the lower vineyards there browne at any rate is rapidly strengthening his right wing which has hold of lobositz pushing forward in that quarterwhere the brook withal is of firmer bottom and more wadable thither too is friedrich bent so that lobositz is now the key of the battle there will the tug of war now be  friedrichs cavalry is gone all to rearward his right wing holds the homolka hillthat too would now be valuable to browne and cannot be had gratis as yesternight friedrichs left wing is on the lobosch pandours pretty well extinct before it but now from welhoten quarter new regulars coming on thitheras if browne would still take the lobosch which would be victory to him but is not now possible to browne nor will long seem sofriedrich having other work in view for himmeaning now to take lobositz instead of losing the lobosch to him friedrich pushes out his left wing still farther leftward leftward and downward withal to clear those vineyardfences completely of their occupants pandour or regular old or new this is done the vineyardfences sweptand the sweepings driven in a more and more stormy fashion towards welhoten and lobositz the lobosch falling quite desperate for browne  henceforth friedrich directs all his industry to taking lobositz browne to the defending of it which he does with great vigor and fire his batteries redoubts doing their uttermost and his battalions rushing on mass of them after mass at quick march obstinate fierce to a degree in the height of temper and showing such fight as we never had of them before friedrichs left wing and brownes right now have it to decide between themany attempt browne makes with his left through sulowitz as he once did and once only is instantly repressed by cannon from the homolka hill and the rest of the battle or rather the battle itselffor all hitherto has been pickeering and groping in the mistmay be made conceivable in few words  friedrich orders the second line of his left wing to march up and join with the first right wing shoving its two lines into one is now to cover the lobosch as well left wing in condensed condition shall fall down on lobositz and do its best they are now clear of the vineyardworks the ground is leveller though still slopinga three furlongs from the village and somewhat towards the elbe when brownes battalions first came extensively to close grips fierce enough as was said the toughest wrestle yet had with those austrianscoming on with steady fury under such force of cannon with iron ramrods too and improved ways like our own but nothing could avail them the counterfury being so great they had to go at the welhoten part and even to runplunging into elbe a good few of them and drowning there in the vain hope to swim never have my troops says friedrich done such miracles of valor cavalry as well

great rate and infinite musketry ninety cartridges a man on our prussian side and ammunition falling done not without bayonetpushings and smitings with the butt of your musket the austrians are driven into lobositz are furiously pushed there and in spite of new battalions coming to the rescue are fairly pushed through these villagestreets are too narrow for new battalions from browne much of the village should have been burnt beforehand say cool judges and now sure enough it does get burnt lobositz is now all on fire by prussian industry so that the austrians have to quit it instantly and rush off in great disorder key of the battle or battle itself quite lost to them  the prussian infantry led by the duke of brunswickbevern governor of stettin one of the dukeferdinand cousinry frugal and valiant gave the highest satisfaction seldom was such firing such furious pushing they had spent ninety cartridges a man were at last quite out of cartridges so that bevern had to say strike in with bayonets meine kinder buttends or what we have heran our grenadiers were mainly they that burnt lobositz how salutary now would it have been says epimetheus lloyd had browne had a small battery on the other side of the elbe whereby he might have taken them in flank and shorn them into the wind epimetheus marks this battery on his plan and is wise behindhand at a cheap rate  brownes right wing and probably his army with it would have gone much to perdition now that lobositz was become prussianhad not browne in the nick of the moment made a masterly movement pushed forward his centre and left wing numerous battalions still fresh to interpose between the chasing prussians and those fugitives the prussians infantry only cannot chase on such terms the prussian cavalry we know is far rearward on the high ground browne retires a mile or twosouthward budinwardnot chased and there halts and rearranges himself thinking what farther he will do his aim in fighting had only been to defend himself and in that humble aim he has failed chase of the prussians over that homolkalobosch country with the high grounds rearward and the metal mountains in their hands he could in no event have attempted  the question now is will he go back to budin or will he try farther towards schandau nature points to the former course in such circumstances friedrich by way of assisting does a thing much admired by lloyddetaches bevern with a strong party southward out of lobositz which is now his to lay hold of tschirskowitz lying budinward but beyond the budin road which feat when browne hears of it means to him going to cut me off from budin then from my ammunitionstores from my very breadcupboard and he marches that same midnight silently in good order back to budin he is not much ruined nay the prussian loss is numerically greater 3308 killed and wounded on the prussian side on the austrian 2984 with three cannon taken and two standards not ruined at all but foiled frustrated and has to devise earnestly what next once rearranged he may still try  the battle lasted seven hours the last four of it very hot till lobositz was won and lost it was about 5 pm when browne fired his retreatcannoncannon happened to be loaded say the anecdotebooks mythically given now and then friedrich wearied enough had flung himself into his carriage for a moments rest or thankful reflection and of all places the ball of the retreatcannon lighted there between friedrichs feet as he lay recliningsay the anecdotebooks whom nobody is bound to believe  on the strength of those two prussian charges which had retired from caseshot on their flank and had not wings for getting over sedge and ooze austria pretended to claim the victory two charges repelled by our gallant horse lobositz indeed was got on fire and we had nothing for it but to withdraw but we took a new position and only left that for want of waterwith the like excuses essentially a clear victory said the austrians and sang tedeum about itbut profited nothing by that piece of melody the fact considerable or not was from the first too undeniable browne beaten from the field and beaten from his attempt too the saxons not relievable by this method and lies quiet in budin againwith his water sure to him but what other advantages gained  here are two letters brief both which we may as well read  1 friedrich to

now friedrichs people in their lines here gave them such a joyfiring for lobositz as retzow has seldom heard huge volleyings salvoings runningfires starting out artistically timed and stationed thunderous high and borne by the echoes gloomily reverberative into every dell and labyrinth of the pirna countryintended to strike a deeper damp into them thinks he retzow i 67 but imperial majesty was mindful too and straightway sent browne positive order deliver me these poor saxons at any price and in the course of not quite a week from lobositz there arrives a confidential messenger from browne courage still ye caged saxons i will try it another way only you must hold out till the 11th on the 11th stand to your tools and it shall be done  browne is to take a succinct detachment 8000 picked men horse and foot to make a wider sweep with these well eastward by the foot of lausitz hills and far enough from all prussian parties and scouts to march with all speed and silence through bohmleipa kamnitz rumburg schluckenau and come in upon the schandau region quite from the northeast side say at lichtenhayn an eligible village which is but seven miles or so from the konigstein with the chasmy country and the river intervening monday october 11th browne will arrive at lichtenhayn sixty miles of circling march from budin privately post himself near lichtenhayn prussian posts of no great strength lying ahead of him there you indignant extenuated saxons are to get yourselves acrossnear the konigstein it will have to be under cover of the konigsteins cannonon the front or riverward side of those same prussian posts crossingplace brownes messenger settles can be thurmsdorf hamlet opposite the lilienstein opposite the hamlets of ebenheit and halbstadt there konigstein fire will cover your bridge and your building of it  monday night next i say post yourselves there with hearts resolute with powder dry there about the eastern roots of the lilienstein beautiful show mountain with stairsteps cut on it for tourist people by august the strong and avoid the prussian battery and abatis which is on it just now you at ebenheit i at lichtenhayn trimmed and braced for action through that monday night tuesday morning the konigstein at your beckoning shall fire two cannonshots which shall mean all ready here then forward you on those prussian posts by the front i will attack them by the rear with right fury both of us i am told they are but weak in those posts surely by double impetus and deadlift effort from us both they can be forced only force themyou are in the open field again and you march away with me colors flying your hungercage and all your tribulations left behind you   this is brownes plan the poor saxons acceptwhat choice have theythough the question of crossing and bridgebuilding has its intricacies and that inevitable item of postponement till the 11th is a sore clause to them for not only are there short and ever shorter rations but grim famine itself is advancing with large strides the daily twenty ounces of meal has sunk to half that quantity the ounce or so of butchersmeat once a week has vanished or become horse of extreme leanness the cavalry horses have not tasted oats nothing but hay or straw not even water always the artillery horses had to live by grazing brown leaves their main diet latterly not horses any longer but walking trestles poor animals and the menwell they are fallen pale but they are resolute as ever the nine cornmills which they have in this circuit of theirs grind now night and day and all the cavalry are set to thresh whatever grain can be found about no hind or husbandman shall retain one sheaf in this way they hope utter hunger may be staved off and the great attempt made precis de la retraite de larmee saxonne de son camp de pirna in gesammelte nachrichten i 482494  browne skilfully and perfectly did his part of the adventure browne arrives punctually at lichtenhayn evening of the 11th bivouacs hidden in the woods thereabouts in cold damp weather stealthily reconnoitres the prussian villages ahead and trims himself for assault at sound of the two cannons tomorrow but there came no cannonsignal on the morrow far other signallings and messagings tomorrow and next day and next from the konigstein and neighborhood wait excellency feldmarschall writes bruhl to him note after note instead of signalling from the konigstein do wait a very little you run no risk in waiting we even if we must yield will make that our first stipulation you will grumbles browne and waits naturally with extreme impatience but the truth is the adventure on the saxon side of it has already altogether misgone and becomes from this point onwards a mere series of failures futilities and disastrous miseries tragical to think of worth some record here since there are documents abundantespecially as feldmarschall rutowski who is generalinchief an old not esteemed friend of ours has produced or caused to be produced a narrative which illuminates the business from within as well precis c just cited compare tagebuch der einschliessung des sachsischen lagers bey pirna diary c which is the prussian account in seyfarth beylagen ii 2248 the latter is our main document here  i know not how much of the blame was general rutowskis one could surmise some laxity of effort and a rather slovenlysurvey of facts in that quarter the enterprise from the first was flatly impossible say judges and it is certain poor rutowskis execution was not firstrate how get across the elbe rutowski had said to himself perhaps not quite with the due rigor of candor proportionate to the rigorous fact how get across the elbe we have copper pontoons at pirna but they will be difficult to cart or we might have a boatbridge boats planked together two and two at pirna are plenty of boats and by oar and trackrope the river itself might be a road for them boats or pontoons to konigstein by water or land they must be got eight miles of abysmal roads our horses all extenuated impossible to cart these pontoons said rutowski to himselfpity he had not tried it he had a week to do those eight bad miles in and 2000 lean horses picking grass or brown leaves while their riders threshed we will drag our pontoons by water by the elbe towpath thought rutowski that will be easierand forthwith sets about preparing for it secretly collecting boats at pirna steersmen towingmen bridgetackle and what else will be necessary  rutowski made at least no delay brownes messenger we find had come to him thursday 7th and on friday night rutowski has a squad of boatmen steersmen and twoscore of towing peasants ready and actually gets under way they are escorted by the due battalions with fieldpieceswho are to fire upon the prussian batteries and keep up such a blaze of musketry and heavier shot as will screen the boats in passing surely a ticklish operation thisarguing a sanguine temper in general rutowski the south bank of the river is ours but there are various prussian batteries three of them very strong along the north bank which will not fail to pelt us terribly as we pass no help for itwe must trust in luck here is the sequel with dates adjusted  elbe river night of october 8th9th friday night accordingly so soon as darkness unusually dark this night has dropt her veil on the business rutowski sets forth the prussian battery or bridgehead tetedepont at pirna has not noticed him so silent was he but alas the other batteries do not fail to notice to give fire and in fact on being answered and finding it a serious thing to burst out into horrible explosion unanswerable by the saxon fieldpieces and surely perilous to human nature steering and towing those big riverboats loyal to our king and full of pity for him that are webut towing at a rate say of two shillings per head before long the forty towing peasants fling down their ropes first one then more then all in spite of efforts promises menaces and vanish among the thicketsforfeiting the two shillings on view of imminent death soldiers take the towingropes try to continue it a little but now the steersmen also manage to call halt we wont let us out let us out we will steer you aground on the prussian shore if you dont making night hideous and the towing enterprise breaks down for that bout double barges mooring on the saxon shore i know not precisely at what point nor is it material  saturday night october 9th10th new boatmen forty new towmen have been hired at immense increase of wages say four shillings for the night but have you much good probability my general that even for that high guerdon imminence of death can be made indifferent to towmen no you have nt the matter goes this night precisely as it did last towmen vanishing in the horrible cannon tumult steersmen shrieking we will ground you on the prussian shore very soldiers obliged to give it up and general rutowski himself obliged to wash his hands of it as a thing that cannot be done in fact a thing which need not have been tried had rutowski been rigorously candid with himself and his hopes as the facts now prove to be twentyfour hours lost by this bad business says he thirtysix as i count or to take it rigorously fortyeight even and now sunday morning instead of friday at what in sad truth is metaphorically the eleventh hour rutowski has to bethink him of his copper pontoons and make the impossible carting method possible in a days time or do worse  sunday monday october 10th11th by unheardof exertions all hands and all spenthorses now at a deadlift effort night and day rutowski does get his pontoons carted out of the pirna storehouse lands them at thurmsdorfopposite the liliensteina mile or so short of konigstein where his bridge shall be it is now the 11th at night and our pontoons are got to the ground nothing more every man of us at this hour should have been across and trimming himself to climb with bayonet fixed browne is ready expecting our signalshot to storm in on his side and our bridge is not built only the pontoons here all things went perverse adds rutowski for farther comfort we saxon homearmy had with us except officers only four pontoniers or trained bridgebuilders all the rest are at warsaw sad thought but too late to think it  tuesday till wednesday early 12th13th bridge the four pontoniers with officers and numb soldiers doing their best is got builtbrowne waiting for us on thorns all day prussians extensively beginning to strengthen their posts about the lilienstein about lichtenhayn or where risk is and in fact pouring across to that northern side quite aware of rutowski and browne  that same night 12th13th while the bridge was struggling to complete itselfrain now falling and tempests broken outthe saxon army from pirna down to hennersdorf had lifted itself from its lines and got under way towards thurmsdorf and the crossingplace dark night plunging rain all the elements in uproar the worst roads in nature now champed doubly such roads as never any army marched on before most of their cannon are left standing a few they had tried to yoke broke down and choked up the narrow road altogether so that the cavalry had to dismount and lead their horses by sidepathsfigure what sidepaths distance to thurmsdorf from any point of the saxon lines cannot be above six miles but it takes them all that night and all next day such a march as might fill the heart with pity oh ye rutowskis bruhls though never so decorated by twelve tailors what a sight ye are at the head of men dark night wild raging weather labyrinthic roads worn kneedeep it is broad daylight wednesday 13th and only the vanguard is yet got across trailing a couple of cannons and splashes about endeavoring to take rank there in spite of wet and hunger rain still pouring wind very high  nothing of browne comes this wednesday but from the opposite grosssedlitz and gottleube side the prussians are coming this morning at daylight struck by symptoms the prussians mounted our empty redoubts they are now in full chase of us ziethen with hussars as vanguard a difficult bit of marching even ziethen and his light people find it sprawling forward at their cheeriest with daylight to help and in chase not chased through such intricacies of rock and mud ziethens company did not assist the saxons they wheel round show fight and there is volleying and bickering all day the saxon march getting ever more perturbed nearly all the baggage has to be left ziethen takes into the woods near thurmsdorf giving fire as the poor wet saxons now much in a pellmell condition pass to their bridge prussian account in gesammelte nachrichten i 852 heavier prussians are striding on to rear these from some final hilltop do at last belch out two cannonshots figure the confusion at that bridge the speed now becoming delirious there towards evening rain still violent the saxons baggageless and rushing quite pellmell the latter part of them are mostly across still countable to 14000 or soupon which they cut their bridge adrift and let the river take it at raden a few miles lower the prussians fished it out rebuilt it more deliberatelyand we shall find it there anon this day friedrich hearing what is afoot has returned in person from the lobositz country takes struppen as his headquarter which was lately the polish majestys  from browne there has nothing come this wednesday but tomorrow morning at seven there comes a letter from him written this night at ten to the effect  headquarter lichtenhayn wednesday october 13th 10 pm  excellenzhave omitting the i waited here at lichtenhayn since tuesday expecting your signalcannon hearing nothing of it conclude you have by misfortune not been able to get across and that the enterprise is up my own position being dangerous prussians of double my strength intrenched within few miles of me i turn homewards tomorrow at nine am ready for whatever occurs till then and sorrowfully say adieu precis ut supra p 493 heldengeschichte iii 940 c  dreadful weather for browne in his bivouac and wearisome waiting with prussians and perils accumulating on him browne was ill of lungs coughing much lodging in these violent tempests on the cold ground a right valiant soldier and man as does appear the flower of all the irish brownes though they have quite forgotten him in our time and of all those irish exiles then tragically spending themselves in austrian quarrels you saw the great man says one who seems to have been present how he sacrificed himself to this enterprise what austrian fieldmarshal but himself would ever have lowered his loftiness to lead in person so insignificant a detachment merely for the public good i have seen staffofficers distinguished only by their sasheries and insignia who would not have stirred to inspect a vedette without 250 men our fieldmarshal was of another turn sharing with his troops all the hardships none excepted of these critical days and in spite of a violent cough which often brought the visible blood from his lungs and had quite worn him down exposing himself like the meanest of the army to the tempests of rainy weather think what a sight it was going to your very heart and summoning you to endurance of every hardshipthat evening not said which when the fieldmarshal worn out with his fatigues and his disorder sank out of faintingfits into a sleep the ground was his bed and the storm of clouds his coverlid in crowds his brave warcomrades gathered round stripped their cloaks their coats and strove in noble rivalry which of them should have the happiness to screen the father of the army at their own cost of exposure and by any device keep the pelting of the weather from that loved head cogniazzo gestandnisse eines oesterreichischen veterans ii 251 there is a picture for you in the heights of lichtenhayn as you steam past schandau in contemplative mood and perhaps think of justice to ireland among other sad thoughts that rise  from thurmsdorf to the pontoonbridge there was a kind of road down which the saxons scrambled yesterday and by painful degrees got wriggled across but on the other shore forward to the hamlets of halbstadt and ebenheit there is nothing but a steep slippery footpath figure what a problem for the 14000 in such weather then at ebenheit close behind brownewards were browne now there rises the lilienstein abrupt rocky mountain its slopes on both hands washed by the river river making its first elbow here closely girdling this lilienstein on both these slopes are prussian batteries each with its abatis needing to be stormedthat will be your first operation abatis and slopes of the lilienstein once stormed you fall into a valley or hollow raked again by prussian batteries and will have to mount still storming out of the valley skyhigh across the ziegenruck goatsback ridge that is your second preliminary operation after which you come upon the work itself namely the prussian redoubts at lichtenhayn and 12000 men on them by this time a modern tourist says reminding or informing  from the konigstein to pirna elbe if serpentine is like a serpent rushing at full speed just past the konigstein the elbe from westward as its general course is turns suddenly to northward runs so for a mile

business too as gathered from his father and other good sources and testimonies  bruhl and the polish majesty safe enough they and snug in the konigstein are clear for advancing die like soldiers for your king and country writes polish majesty thursday two in the morning that also rutowski reads and i think still other royal autographs sent as postscripts to that from the konigstein they duly fire off the two cannonshot as signal that we are coming signal which browne just in the act of departing never heard owing to the piping of the winds and rattling of the rain advance my heroes counsel they you cannot drag your ammunitions say you your poor couple of big guns here are his majestys own royal horses for that serviceand in effect the royal stud is heroically flung open in this pressure and a splashing column of sleek quadrupeds 150 royal draughthorses early in the forenoon gotzinger p 156 swim across to ebenheit accordingly if that could encourage and about noon there is strong cannonading from the konigstein as signal to browne who is off polish majesty looking with his spyglass in an astonished manner in vain rutowski and his council of warsitting wet in a hut of ebenheit with 14000 starved men outside who have stood seventytwo hours of rain for one itemsee nothing for it but surrender on such terms as we can get  in fact independently of weather and circumstances the enterprise says friedrich was radically impossible nobody that had known the ground could have judged it other rutowski had not known it then browne never pretended to know it rutowski was not candid with the conditions the conditions never known nor candidly looked at and they are now replying to him with candor enough from the first his enterprise was a final flicker of false hope going out as here by spasm in the rigors of impossibility and flat despair  that column of royal horses sent splashing across the riverthat was the utmost of selfsacrifice which i find recorded of his polish majesty in this matter he was very obstinate his bruhl and he were but his conduct was not very heroic that royal autograph general rutowski and ye true saxons attack these prussian lines then sell your lives like men not like bruhl and me must have fallen cold on the heart after seventytwo hours of rain rutowskis wet council of war in the hut at ebenheit rain still pouring answers unanimously that it were a leading of men to the butchery that there is nothing for it but surrender bruhl and majesty can only answer welladay it must be so then  winterfeld prussian commander hereabouts grants armistice grants liberal wagonloads of bread first of all terms of capitulation to be settled at struppen tomorrow  friday october 15th rutowski goes across to struppen the late saxon headquarter now friedrichsfriday gone a fortnight was the day of lobositz winterfeld and he are the negotiators there friedrich ratifying or refusing by marginal remarks the terms granted are hard enough but they must be accepted first preliminary of all terms has already been accepted a gift of bread to these poor saxons their haversacks are empty their cartridgeboxes drowned it has rained on them three days and nights last upshot of all terms is still well known to everybody that the 14000 saxons are compelled to become prussian and forced to volunteer  that had been friedrichs determination and reading of his rights in the matter now that hard had come to hard you refused all terms you have resisted to death or deathsdoor and are now at discretion of the question what is to be done with those saxons friedrich had thought a great deal first and last and had found it very intricateas readers too will if they think of it prisoners of warto keep them locked up with trouble and expense in that fashion they can never be exchanged saxony has now nothing to exchange them with and austria will not their obstinacy has had costs to me who of us can count what costs in short they shall volunteer  never did i for my poor part authorize such a thing loudly asseverated rutowski afterwards and indeed the capitulation is not precise on that interesting point a lengthy document and not worth the least perusal otherwise we condense it into three articles all grounding on this general basis not deniable by rutowski the saxon army being at such a pass ready to die of hunger if we did not lift our finger has so to speak become our property and we grant it the following terms  1 kettledrums standards and the like insignia and matters of honorcarry these to the konigstein with my regretful respects to his polish majesty konigstein to be a neutral fortress during this war polish majesty at perfect liberty to go to warsaw as he on the instant now did and never returned  2 officers to depart on giving their parole not to serve against us during this war parole given nothing like too well kept  3 rest of the army with all its equipments munitions soul and body so to speak is to surrender utterly and be ours as all saxony shall for the present be in heldengeschichte iii 920928 at full lengthwith briedrichs marginalia noticeably brief  that is in sum the capitulation of struppen nothing articulate in it about the one now interesting pointand in regard to that i can only fancy rutowski might interject interrogatively perhaps at some length our soldiers to be prisoners of war then prisoners yes clearlyunless they choose to volunteer and have a better fate prisoners can volunteer they are at discretion they would die if we did not lift our finger thus i suppose winterfeld would rejoin if necessaryand that in the winterfeldrutowski conferences the thing had probably been kept in a kind of chiaroscuro by both parties  very certain it is sunday 17th october 1756 capitulation being signed the night before friedrich goes across at niederraden where the pilgrim of the picturesque now climbs to see the bastei where the prussians have by this time a bridge thrown together out of those pontoonsgoes across at niederraden up that chasmy pass rides to the heights of waltersdorf in the opener country behind and pauses there while the captive saxon army defiles past him laying down its arms at his feet unarmed and now under prussian word of command these exsaxon soldiers go on defiling march through by that chasm of niederraden cross to oberraden and in the plainer country thereabouts arein i know not what length of hours but in an incredibly short length so swift is the managementchanged wholly into prussian soldiers obliged to volunteer every one of them  that is the fact fact loudly censured fact surely questionableto what intrinsic degree i at this moment do not know fact much blamable before the loose public of mankind upon which i leave men to their verdict it is not a fact which invites imitation as we shall see fact how accomplished by what methods that would be the question with me but even that is left dark the horse regiments three of heavy horse he broke and distributed about a good few in his own gardeducorps three other horse regiments were in poland the sole saxon army now leftof whom at least of one man among whom we may happen to hear ten foot regiments what was reckoned a fault he left together in prussian uniform with prussian officers they were scattered up and down put in garrisons not easy handling them they deserted by whole companies at a time in the course of this war preuss ii 22 135 in stenzel v 1620 more precise details not a measure for imitation as we saidhow friedrich defended such hard conduct to the saxons reader i know only that destiny and necessity urged on by saxons and others was hard as adamant upon friedrich at this time and that friedrich did not the least dream of making any defenceand will have to take your verdict such as it may be  moritz of dessau had a terrible winter of it organizing and breaking in these saxon peoplegot by pressgang in this way polish majesty with 500 of suite had driven instantly for warsaw posthorses most politely furnished him and all the prussian posts and soldiers well kept out of his roadroad chosen for him to that end poor soul he never came back for six years coming he saw from warsaw in the distance amid anarchy and niepozwalam which he never lacked there the wide war raging in saxony especially and died soon after it was done nor did bruhl return except broken by that event and to die in few months after let us pity the poor fatgoose of a majesty not illnatured at all only stupid and idle some pity even to the doomedphantasm bruhl if you canand thank heaven to have got done with such a pair  friedrichs treatment of the saxon troops saxon majesty and country who shall say that it was wise in all points it would be singular treatment if it were in all things after is so different from before and during the truth is friedrich hoped long to have made some agreement with the saxons and readers now in the universal silence have no notion of friedrichs complexities from fact and of the loud howl of hostile rumor which was piping through all journals diplomacies and foreign human throats against him at

tight indeed for the six years coming there is no detailing of all that details were they even known to an editor at such distance would weary every reader enough to understand that friedrich has not

its aims of aggrandizement in austrian spyletters now and afterwards they are described to us as gut preussisch strong for prussia the most of them even in dresden itself  whether friedrich could have had much real hope to end the war this year or scare it off from beginning may be a question if he had it is totally disappointed the saxon government has brought ruin on itself and country but it has been of great damage to friedrich would polish majesty have consented to disband his soldiers and receive friedrich with a bonafide neutrality friedrich could have passed the mountains still in time

which they failed not to do and establish themselves there and threaten us with an invasion into the altmark or that the russians should get through by the neumarkyou are to save the royal family the principal dicasteria landschedules lists of taxdues the ministries and the directorium which is the central ministry of all if it is in saxony on the leipzig side that we are beaten the fittest place for the removal of the royal family and of the treasure is to custrin in such case the royal family and all above named must go escorted by the whole garrison of berlin to custrin if the russians entered by the neumark or if a misfortune befell us in the lausitz it would be to magdeburg that all would have to go in fine the last refuge is stettinbut you must not go till the last extremity the garrison the royal family and the treasure are inseparable and go always together to this must be added the crown diamonds the silver plate in the grand apartmentswhich in such case as well as the gold plate must be at once coined into money  if it happened that i were killed the public affairs must go on without the smallest alteration or its being noticeable that they are in other hands and in this case you must hasten forward the oaths and homagings as well here as in preussen and above all in silesia if i should have the fatality to be taken prisoner by the enemy i prohibit all of you from paying the least regard to my person or taking the least heed of what i might write from my place of detention should such misfortune happen me i wish to sacrifice myself for the state and you must obey my brotherwho as well as all my ministers and generals shall answer to me with their heads not to offer any province or any ransom for me but to continue the war pushing their advantages as if i never had existed in the world  i hope and have ground to believe that you count finck will not need to make use of this instruction but in case of misfortune i authorize you to employ it and as mark that it is after a mature and sound deliberation my firm and constant will i sign it with my hand and confirm it with my seal  or in friedrichs own spelling c so far as our possibilities permit
