98219432	north american review  no dxcviii  september 7 1906   chapters from my autobiographyi1  by mark twain        prefatory notemr clemens began to write his autobiography many      years ago and he continues to add to it day by day it was his      original intention to permit no publication of his memoirs until      after his death but after leaving pier no 70 he concluded      that a considerable portion might now suitably be given to the      public it is that portion garnered from the quartermillion of      words already written which will appear in this review during the      coming year no part of the autobiography will be published in book      form during the lifetime of the authoreditor n a r   introduction  i intend that this autobiography shall become a model for all future autobiographies when it is published after my death and i also intend that it shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and methoda form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along like contact of flint with steel moreover this autobiography of mine does not select from my life its showy episodes but deals mainly in the common experiences which go to make up the life of the average human being because these episodes are of a sort which he is familiar with in his own life and in which he sees his own life reflected and set down in print the usual conventional autobiographer seems to particularly hunt out those occasions in his career when he came into contact with celebrated persons whereas his contacts with the uncelebrated were just as interesting to him and would be to his reader and were vastly more numerous than his collisions with the famous  howells was here yesterday afternoon and i told him the whole scheme of this autobiography and its apparently systemless systemonly apparently systemless for it is not really that it is a deliberate system and the law of the system is that i shall talk about the matter which for the moment interests me and cast it aside and talk about something else the moment its interest for me is exhausted it is a system which follows no charted course and is not going to follow any such course it is a system which is a complete and purposed jumblea course which begins nowhere follows no specified route and can never reach an end while i am alive for the reason that if i should talk to the stenographer two hours a day for a hundred years i should still never be able to set down a tenth part of the things which have interested me in my lifetime i told howells that this autobiography of mine would live a couple of thousand years without any effort and would then take a fresh start and live the rest of the time  he said he believed it would and asked me if i meant to make a library of it  i said that that was my design but that if i should live long enough the set of volumes could not be contained merely in a city it would require a state and that there would not be any multibillionaire alive perhaps at any time during its existence who would be able to buy a full set except on the instalment plan  howells applauded and was full of praises and endorsement which was wise in him and judicious if he had manifested a different spirit i would have thrown him out of the window i like criticism but it must be my way   i  back of the virginia clemenses is a dim procession of ancestors stretching back to noahs time according to tradition some of them were pirates and slavers in elizabeths time but this is no discredit to them for so were drake and hawkins and the others it was a respectable trade then and monarchs were partners in it in my time i have had desires to be a pirate myself the readerif he will look deep down in his secret heart will findbut never mind what he will find there i am not writing his autobiography but mine later according to tradition one of the procession was ambassador to spain in the time of james i or of charles i and married there and sent down a strain of spanish blood to warm us up also according to tradition this one or anothergeoffrey clement by namehelped to sentence charles to death  i have not examined into these traditions myself partly because i was indolent and partly because i was so busy polishing up this end of the line and trying to make it showy but the other clemenses claim that they have made the examination and that it stood the test therefore i have always taken for granted that i did help charles out of his troubles by ancestral proxy my instincts have persuaded me too whenever we have a strong and persistent and ineradicable instinct we may be sure that it is not original with us but inheritedinherited from away back and hardened and perfected by the petrifying influence of time now i have been always and unchangingly bitter against charles and i am quite certain that this feeling trickled down to me through the veins of my forebears from the heart of that judge for it is not my disposition to be bitter against people on my own personal account i am not bitter against jeffreys i ought to be but i am not it indicates that my ancestors of james iis time were indifferent to him i do not know why i never could make it out but that is what it indicates and i have always felt friendly toward satan of course that is ancestral it must be in the blood for i could not have originated it   and so by the testimony of instinct backed by the assertions of clemenses who said they had examined the records i have always been obliged to believe that geoffrey clement the martyrmaker was an ancestor of mine and to regard him with favor and in fact pride this has not had a good effect upon me for it has made me vain and that is a fault it has made me set myself above people who were less fortunate in their ancestry than i and has moved me to take them down a peg upon occasion and say things to them which hurt them before company  a case of the kind happened in berlin several years ago william walter phelps was our minister at the emperors court then and one evening he had me to dinner to meet count s a cabinet minister this nobleman was of long and illustrious descent of course i wanted to let out the fact that i had some ancestors too but i did not want to pull them out of their graves by the ears and i never could seem to get the chance to work them in in a way that would look sufficiently casual i suppose phelps was in the same difficulty in fact he looked distraught now and thenjust as a person looks who wants to uncover an ancestor purely by accident and cannot think of a way that will seem accidental enough but at last after dinner he made a try he took us about his drawingroom showing us the pictures and finally stopped before a rude and ancient engraving it was a picture of the court that tried charles i there was a pyramid of judges in puritan slouch hats and below them three bareheaded secretaries seated at a table mr phelps put his finger upon one of the three and said with exulting indifference  an ancestor of mine  i put my finger on a judge and retorted with scathing languidness  ancestor of mine but it is a small matter i have others  it was not noble in me to do it i have always regretted it since but it landed him i wonder how he felt however it made no difference in our friendship which shows that he was fine and high notwithstanding the humbleness of his origin and it was also creditable in me too that i could overlook it i made no change in my bearing toward him but always treated him as an equal  but it was a hard night for me in one way mr phelps thought i was the guest of honor and so did count s but i didnt for there was nothing in my invitation to indicate it it was just a friendly offhand note on a card by the time dinner was announced phelps was himself in a state of doubt something had to be done and it was not a handy time for explanations he tried to get me to go out with him but i held back then he tried s and he also declined there was another guest but there was no trouble about him we finally went out in a pile there was a decorous plunge for seats and i got the one at mr phelpss left the count captured the one facing phelps and the other guest had to take the place of honor since he could not help himself we returned to the drawingroom in the original disorder i had new shoes on and they were tight at eleven i was privately crying i couldnt help it the pain was so cruel conversation had been dead for an hour s had been due at the bedside of a dying official ever since half past nine at last we all rose by one blessed impulse and went down to the street door without explanationsin a pile and no precedence and so parted  the evening had its defects still i got my ancestor in and was satisfied  among the virginian clemenses were jere already mentioned and sherrard jere clemens had a wide reputation as a good pistolshot and once it enabled him to get on the friendly side of some drummers when they wouldnt have paid any attention to mere smooth words and arguments he was out stumping the state at the time the drummers were grouped in front of the stand and had been hired by the opposition to drum while he made his speech when he was ready to begin he got out his revolver and laid it before him and said in his soft silky way  i do not wish to hurt anybody and shall try not to but i have got just a bullet apiece for those six drums and if you should want to play on them dont stand behind them  sherrard clemens was a republican congressman from west virginia in the war days and then went out to st louis where the james clemens branch lived and still lives and there he became a warm rebel this was after the war at the time that he was a republican i was a rebel but by the time he had become a rebel i was become temporarily a republican the clemenses have always done the best they could to keep the political balances level no matter how much it might inconvenience them i did not know what had become of sherrard clemens but once i introduced senator hawley to a republican mass meeting in new england and then i got a bitter letter from sherrard from st louis he said that the republicans of the northno the mudsills of the northhad swept away the old aristocracy of the south with fire and sword and it ill became me an aristocrat by blood to train with that kind of swine did i forget that i was a lambton  that was a reference to my mothers side of the house as i have already said she was a lambtonlambton with a p for some of the american lamptons could not spell very well in early times and so the name suffered at their hands she was a native of kentucky and married my father in lexington in 1823 when she was twenty years old and he twentyfour neither of them had an overplus of property she brought him two or three negroes but nothing else i think they removed to the remote and secluded village of jamestown in the mountain solitudes of east tennessee there their first crop of children was born but as i was of a later vintage i do not remember anything about it i was postponedpostponed to missouri missouri was an unknown new state and needed attractions  i think that my eldest brother orion my sisters pamela and margaret and my brother benjamin were born in jamestown there may have been others but as to that i am not sure it was a great lift for that little village to have my parents come there it was hoped that they would stay so that it would become a city it was supposed that they would stay and so there was a boom but by and by they went away and prices went down and it was many years before jamestown got another start i have written about jamestown in the gilded age a book of mine but it was from hearsay not from personal knowledge my father left a fine estate behind him in the region round about jamestown75000 acres2 when he died in 1847 he had owned it about twenty years the taxes were almost nothing five dollars a year for the whole and he had always paid them regularly and kept his title perfect he had always said that the land would not become valuable in his time but that it would be a commodious provision for his children some day it contained coal copper iron and timber and he said that in the course of time railways would pierce to that region and then the property would be property in fact as well as in name it also produced a wild grape of a promising sort he had sent some samples to nicholas longworth of cincinnati to get his judgment upon them and mr longworth had said that they would make as good wine as his catawbas the land contained all these riches and also oil but my father did not know that and of course in those early days he would have cared nothing about it if he had known it the oil was not discovered until about 1895 i wish i owned a couple of acres of the land now in which case i would not be writing autobiographies for a living my fathers dying charge was cling to the land and wait let nothing beguile it away from you my mothers favorite cousin james lampton who figures in the gilded age as colonel sellers always said of that landand said it with blazing enthusiasm tootheres millions in itmillions it is true that he always said that about everythingand was always mistaken too but this time he was right which shows that a man who goes around with a prophecygun ought never to get discouraged if he will keep up his heart and fire at everything he sees he is bound to hit something by and by  many persons regarded colonel sellers as a fiction an invention an extravagant impossibility and did me the honor to call him a creation but they were mistaken i merely put him on paper as he was he was not a person who could be exaggerated the incidents which looked most extravagant both in the book and on the stage were not inventions of mine but were facts of his life and i was present when they were developed john t raymonds audiences used to come near to dying with laughter over the turnipeating scene but extravagant as the scene was it was faithful to the facts in all its absurd details the thing happened in lamptons own house and i was present in fact i was myself the guest who ate the turnips in the hands of a great actor that piteous scene would have dimmed any manly spectators eyes with tears and racked his ribs apart with laughter at the same time but raymond was great in humorous portrayal only in that he was superb he was wonderfulin a word great in all things else he was a pigmy of the pigmies  the real colonel sellers as i knew him in james lampton was a pathetic and beautiful spirit a manly man a straight and honorable man a man with a big foolish unselfish heart in his bosom a man born to be loved and he was loved by all his friends and by his family worshipped it is the right word to them he was but little less than a god the real colonel sellers was never on the stage only half of him was there raymond could not play the other half of him it was above his level that half was made up of qualities of which raymond was wholly destitute for raymond was not a manly man he was not an honorable man nor an honest one he was empty and selfish and vulgar and ignorant and silly and there was a vacancy in him where his heart should have been there was only one man who could have played the whole of colonel sellers and that was frank mayo3  it is a world of surprises they fall too where one is least expecting them when i introduced sellers into the book charles dudley warner who was writing the story with me proposed a change of sellers christian name ten years before in a remote corner of the west he had come across a man named eschol sellers and he thought that eschol was just the right and fitting name for our sellers since it was odd and quaint and all that i liked the idea but i said that that man might turn up and object but warner said it couldnt happen that he was doubtless dead by this time a man with a name like that couldnt live long and be he dead or alive we must have the name it was exactly the right one and we couldnt do without it so the change was made warners man was a farmer in a cheap and humble way when the book had been out a week a collegebred gentleman of courtly manners and ducal upholstery arrived in hartford in a sultry state of mind and with a libel suit in his eye and his name was eschol sellers he had never heard of the other one and had never been within a thousand miles of him this damaged aristocrats programme was quite definite and businesslike the american publishing company must suppress the edition as far as printed and change the name in the plates or stand a suit for 10000 he carried away the companys promise and many apologies and we changed the name back to colonel mulberry sellers in the plates apparently there is nothing that cannot happen even the existence of two unrelated men wearing the impossible name of eschol sellers is a possible thing  james lampton floated all his days in a tinted mist of magnificent dreams and died at last without seeing one of them realized i saw him last in 1884 when it had been twentysix years since i ate the basin of raw turnips and washed them down with a bucket of water in his house he was become old and whiteheaded but he entered to me in the same old breezy way of his earlier life and he was all there yetnot a detail wanting the happy light in his eye the abounding hope in his heart the persuasive tongue the miraclebreeding imaginationthey were all there and before i could turn around he was polishing up his aladdins lamp and flashing the secret riches of the world before me i said to myself i did not overdraw him by a shade i set him down as he was and he is the same man today cable will recognize him i asked him to excuse me a moment and ran into the next room which was cables cable and i were stumping the union on a reading tour i said  i am going to leave your door open so that you can listen there is a man in there who is interesting  i went back and asked lampton what he was doing now he began to tell me of a small venture he had begun in new mexico through his son only a little thinga mere triflepartly to amuse my leisure partly to keep my capital from lying idle but mainly to develop the boydevelop the boy fortunes wheel is ever revolving he may have to work for his living some dayas strange things have happened in this world but its only a little thinga mere trifle as i said  and so it wasas he began it but under his deft hands it grew and blossomed and spreadoh beyond imagination at the end of half an hour he finished finished with the remark uttered in an adorably languid manner  yes it is but a trifle as things go nowadaysa bagatellebut amusing it passes the time the boy thinks great things of it but he is young you know and imaginative lacks the experience which comes of handling large affairs and which tempers the fancy and perfects the judgment i suppose theres a couple of millions in it possibly three but not more i think still for a boy you know just starting in life it is not bad i should not want him to make a fortunelet that come later it could turn his head at his time of life and in many ways be a damage to him  then he said something about his having left his pocketbook lying on the table in the main drawingroom at home and about its being after banking hours now and  i stopped him there and begged him to honor cable and me by being our guest at the lecturewith as many friends as might be willing to do us the like honor he accepted and he thanked me as a prince might who had granted us a grace the reason i stopped his speech about the tickets was because i saw that he was going to ask me to furnish them to him and let him pay next day and i knew that if he made the debt he would pay it if he had to pawn his clothes after a little further chat he shook hands heartily and affectionately and took his leave cable put his head in at the door and said  that was colonel sellers                                                       mark twain                         to be continued  footnotes  1 copyright 1906 by harper  brothers all rights reserved

delightfully     north american review  no dxcix  september 21 1906   chapters from my autobiographyii  by mark twain   ii  my experiences as an author began early in 1867 i came to new york from san francisco in the first month of that year and presently charles h webb whom i had known in san francisco as a reporter on the bulletin and afterward editor of the californian suggested that i publish a volume of sketches i had but a slender reputation to publish it on but i was charmed and excited by the suggestion and quite willing to venture it if some industrious person would save me the trouble of gathering the sketches together i was loath to do it myself for from the beginning of my sojourn in this world there was a persistent vacancy in me where the industry ought to be ought to was is better perhaps though the most of the authorities differ as to this  webb said i had some reputation in the atlantic states but i knew quite well that it must be of a very attenuated sort what there was of it rested upon the story of the jumping frog when artemus ward passed through california on a lecturing tour in 1865 or 66 i told him the jumping frog story in san francisco and he asked me to write it out and send it to his publisher carleton in new york to be used in padding out a small book which artemus had prepared for the press and which needed some more stuffing to make it big enough for the price which was to be charged for it  it reached carleton in time but he didnt think much of it and was not willing to go to the typesetting expense of adding it to the book he did not put it in the wastebasket but made henry clapp a present of it and clapp used it to help out the funeral of his dying literary journal the saturday press the jumping frog appeared in the last number of that paper was the most joyous feature of the obsequies and was at once copied in the newspapers of america and england it certainly had a wide celebrity and it still had it at the time that i am speaking ofbut i was aware that it was only the frog that was celebrated it wasnt i i was still an obscurity  webb undertook to collate the sketches he performed this office then handed the result to me and i went to carletons establishment with it i approached a clerk and he bent eagerly over the counter to inquire into my needs but when he found that i had come to sell a book and not to buy one his temperature fell sixty degrees and the oldgold intrenchments in the roof of my mouth contracted threequarters of an inch and my teeth fell out i meekly asked the privilege of a word with mr carleton and was coldly informed that he was in his private office discouragements and difficulties followed but after a while i got by the frontier and entered the holy of holies ah now i remember how i managed it webb had made an appointment for me with carleton otherwise i never should have gotten over that frontier carleton rose and said brusquely and aggressively  well what can i do for you  i reminded him that i was there by appointment to offer him my book for publication he began to swell and went on swelling and swelling and swelling until he had reached the dimensions of a god of about the second or third degree then the fountains of his great deep were broken up and for two or three minutes i couldnt see him for the rain it was words only words but they fell so densely that they darkened the atmosphere finally he made an imposing sweep with his right hand which comprehended the whole room and said  bookslook at those shelves every one of them is loaded with books that are waiting for publication do i want any more excuse me i dont good morning  twentyone years elapsed before i saw carleton again i was then sojourning with my family at the schweitzerhof in luzerne he called on me shook hands cordially and said at once without any preliminaries  i am substantially an obscure person but i have at least one distinction to my credit of such colossal dimensions that it entitles me to immortalityto wit i refused a book of yours and for this i stand without competitor as the prize ass of the nineteenth century  it was a most handsome apology and i told him so and said it was a longdelayed revenge but was sweeter to me than any other that could be devised that during the lapsed twentyone years i had in fancy taken his life several times every year and always in new and increasingly cruel and inhuman ways but that now i was pacified appeased happy even jubilant and that thenceforth i should hold him my true and valued friend and never kill him again  i reported my adventure to webb and he bravely said that not all the carletons in the universe should defeat that book he would publish it himself on a ten per cent royalty and so he did he brought it out in blue and gold and made a very pretty little book of it i think he named it the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county and other sketches price 125 he made the plates and printed and bound the book through a jobprinting house and published it through the american news company  in june i sailed in the quaker city excursion i returned in november and in washington found a letter from elisha bliss of the american publishing company of hartford offering me five per cent royalty on a book which should recount the adventures of the excursion in lieu of the royalty i was offered the alternative of ten thousand dollars cash upon delivery of the manuscript i consulted a d richardson and he said take the royalty i followed his advice and closed with bliss by my contract i was to deliver the manuscript in july of 1868 i wrote the book in san francisco and delivered the manuscript within contract time bliss provided a multitude of illustrations for the book and then stopped work on it the contract date for the issue went by and there was no explanation of this time drifted along and still there was no explanation i was lecturing all over the country and about thirty times a day on an average i was trying to answer this conundrum  when is your book coming out  i got tired of inventing new answers to that question and by and by i got horribly tired of the question itself whoever asked it became my enemy at once and i was usually almost eager to make that appear  as soon as i was free of the lecturefield i hastened to hartford to make inquiries bliss said that the fault was not his that he wanted to publish the book but the directors of his company were staid old fossils and were afraid of it they had examined the book and the majority of them were of the opinion that there were places in it of a humorous character bliss said the house had never published a book that had a suspicion like that attaching to it and that the directors were afraid that a departure of this kind would seriously injure the houses reputation that he was tied hand and foot and was not permitted to carry out his contract one of the directors a mr drakeat least he was the remains of what had once been a mr drakeinvited me to take a ride with him in his buggy and i went along he was a pathetic old relic and his ways and his talk were also pathetic he had a delicate purpose in view and it took him some time to hearten himself sufficiently to carry it out but at last he accomplished it he explained the houses difficulty and distress as bliss had already explained it then he frankly threw himself and the house upon my mercy and begged me to take away the innocents abroad and release the concern from the contract i said i wouldntand so ended the interview and the buggy excursion then i warned bliss that he must get to work or i should make trouble he acted upon the warning and set up the book and i read the proofs then there was another long wait and no explanation at last toward the end of july 1869 i think i lost patience and telegraphed bliss that if the book was not on sale in twentyfour hours i should bring suit for damages  that ended the trouble half a dozen copies were bound and placed on sale within the required time then the canvassing began and went briskly forward in nine months the book took the publishing house out of debt advanced its stock from twentyfive to two hundred and left seventy thousand dollars profit to the good it was bliss that told me thisbut if it was true it was the first time that he had told the truth in sixtyfive years he was born in 1804   iii   this was in 1849 i was fourteen years old then we were still living in hannibal missouri on the banks of the mississippi in the new frame house built by my father five years before that is some of us lived in the new part the rest in the old part back of itthe l in the autumn my sister gave a party and invited all the marriageable young people of the village i was too young for this society and was too bashful to mingle with young ladies anyway therefore i was not invitedat least not for the whole evening ten minutes of it was to be my whole share i was to do the part of a bear in a small fairy play i was to be disguised all over in a closefitting brown hairy stuff proper for a bear about half past ten i was told to go to my room and put on this disguise and be ready in half an hour i started but changed my mind for i wanted to practise a little and that room was very small i crossed over to the large unoccupied house on the corner of main and hill streets4 unaware that a dozen of the young people were also going there to dress for their parts i took the little black slave boy sandy with me and we selected a roomy and empty chamber on the second floor we entered it talking and this gave a couple of halfdressed young ladies an opportunity to take refuge behind a screen undiscovered their gowns and things were hanging on hooks behind the door but i did not see them it was sandy that shut the door but all his heart was in the theatricals and he was as unlikely to notice them as i was myself  that was a rickety screen with many holes in it but as i did not know there were girls behind it i was not disturbed by that detail if i had known i could not have undressed in the flood of cruel moonlight that was pouring in at the curtainless windows i should have died of shame untroubled by apprehensions i stripped to the skin and began my practice i was full of ambition i was determined to make a hit i was burning to establish a reputation as a bear and get further engagements so i threw myself into my work with an abandon that promised great things i capered back and forth from one end of the room to the other on all fours sandy applauding with enthusiasm i walked upright and growled and snapped and snarled i stood on my head i flung handsprings i danced a lubberly dance with my paws bent and my imaginary snout sniffing from side to side i did everything a bear could do and many things which no bear could ever do and no bear with any dignity would want to do anyway and of course i never suspected that i was making a spectacle of myself to any one but sandy at last standing on my head i paused in that attitude to take a minutes rest there was a moments silence then sandy spoke up with excited interest and said  marse sam has you ever seen a smoked herring  no what is that  its a fish  well what of it anything peculiar about it  yes suh you bet you dey is dey eats em guts and all  there was a smothered burst of feminine snickers from behind the screen all the strength went out of me and i toppled forward like an undermined tower and brought the screen down with my weight burying the young ladies under it in their fright they discharged a couple of piercing screamsand possibly others but i did not wait to count i snatched my clothes and fled to the dark hall below sandy following i was dressed in half a minute and out the back way i swore sandy to eternal silence then we went away and hid until the party was over the ambition was all out of me i could not have faced that giddy company after my adventure for there would be two performers there who knew my secret and would be privately laughing at me all the time i was searched for but not found and the bear had to be played by a young gentleman in his civilized clothes the house was still and everybody asleep when i finally ventured home i was very heavyhearted and full of a sense of disgrace pinned to my pillow i found a slip of paper which bore a line that did not lighten my heart but only made my face burn it was written in a laboriously disguised hand and these were its mocking terms  you probably couldnt have played bear but you played bare very welloh very very well  we think boys are rude unsensitive animals but it is not so in all cases each boy has one or two sensitive spots and if you can find out where they are located you have only to touch them and you can scorch him as with fire i suffered miserably over that episode i expected that the facts would be all over the village in the morning but it was not so the secret remained confined to the two girls and sandy and me that was some appeasement of my pain but it was far from sufficientthe main trouble remained i was under four mocking eyes and it might as well have been a thousand for i suspected all girls eyes of being the ones i so dreaded during several weeks i could not look any young lady in the face i dropped my eyes in confusion when any one of them smiled upon me and gave me greeting and i said to myself that is one of them and got quickly away of course i was meeting the right girls everywhere but if they ever let slip any betraying sign i was not bright enough to catch it when i left hannibal four years later the secret was still a secret i had never guessed those girls out and was no longer expecting to do it nor wanting to either  one of the dearest and prettiest girls in the village at the time of my mishap was one whom i will call mary wilson because that was not her name she was twenty years old she was dainty and sweet peachbloomy and exquisite gracious and lovely in character and i stood in awe of her for she seemed to me to be made out of angelclay and rightfully unapproachable by an unholy ordinary kind of a boy like me i probably never suspected her but  the scene changes to calcuttafortyseven years later it was in 1896 i arrived there on my lecturing trip as i entered the hotel a divine vision passed out of it clothed in the glory of the indian sunshinethe mary wilson of my longvanished boyhood it was a startling thing before i could recover from the bewildering shock and speak to her she was gone i thought maybe i had seen an apparition but it was not so she was flesh she was the granddaughter of the other mary the original mary that mary now a widow was upstairs and presently sent for me she was old and grayhaired but she looked young and was very handsome we sat down and talked we steeped our thirsty souls in the reviving wine of the past the beautiful past the dear and lamented past we uttered the names that had been silent upon our lips for fifty years and it was as if they were made of music with reverent hands we unburied our dead the mates of our youth and caressed them with our speech we searched the dusty chambers of our memories and dragged forth incident after incident episode after episode folly after folly and laughed such good laughs over them with the tears running down and finally mary said suddenly and without any leading up  tell me what is the special peculiarity of smoked herrings  it seemed a strange question at such a hallowed time as this and so inconsequential too i was a little shocked and yet i was aware of a stir of some kind away back in the deeps of my memory somewhere it set me to musingthinkingsearching smoked herrings smoked herrings the peculiarity of smo i glanced up her face was grave but there was a dim and shadowy twinkle in her eye whichall of a sudden i knew and far away down in the hoary past i heard a remembered voice murmur dey eats em guts and all  atlast ive found one of you anyway who was the other girl  but she drew the line there she wouldnt tell me  footnote  4 that house still stands   iv   but it was on a bench in washington square that i saw the most of louis stevenson it was an outing that lasted an hour or more and was very pleasant and sociable i had come with him from his house where i had been paying my respects to his family his business in the square was to absorb the sunshine he was most scantily furnished with flesh his clothes seemed to fall into hollows as if there might be nothing inside but the frame for a sculptors statue his long face and lank hair and dark complexion and musing and melancholy expression seemed to fit these details justly and harmoniously and the altogether of it seemed especially planned to gather the rays of your observation and focalize them upon stevensons special distinction and commanding feature his splendid eyes they burned with a smouldering rich fire under the penthouse of his brows and they made him beautiful                                       i said i thought he was right about the others but mistaken as to bret harte in substance i said that harte was good company and a thin but pleasant talker that he was always bright but never brilliant that in this matter he must not be classed with thomas bailey aldrich nor must any other man ancient or modern that aldrich was always witty always brilliant if there was anybody present capable of striking his flint at the right angle that aldrich was as sure and prompt and unfailing as the redhot iron on the blacksmiths anvilyou had only to hit it competently to make it deliver an explosion of sparks i added  aldrich has never had his peer for prompt and pithy and witty and humorous sayings none has equalled him certainly none has surpassed him in the felicity of phrasing with which he clothed these children of his fancy aldrich was always brilliant he couldnt help it he is a fireopal set round with rose diamonds when he is not speaking you know that his dainty fancies are twinkling and glimmering around in him when he speaks the diamonds flash yes he was always brilliant he will always be brilliant he will be brilliant in hellyou will see  stevenson smiling a chuckly smile i hope not  well you will and he will dim even those ruddy fires and look like a transfigured adonis backed against a pink sunset                                       there on that bench we struck out a new phraseone or the other of us i dont remember whichsubmerged renown variations were discussed submerged fame submerged reputation and so on and a choice was made submerged renown was elected i believe this important matter rose out of an incident which had been happening to stevenson in albany while in a bookshop or bookstall there he had noticed a long rank of small books cheaply but neatly gotten up and bearing such titles as daviss selected speeches daviss selected poetry daviss this and daviss that and daviss the other thing compilations every one of them each with a brief compact intelligent and useful introductory chapter by this same davis whose first name i have forgotten stevenson had begun the matter with this question  can you name the american author whose fame and acceptance stretch widest in the states  i thought i could but it did not seem to me that it would be modest to speak out in the circumstances so i diffidently said nothing stevenson noticed and said  save your delicacy for another timeyou are not the one for a shilling you cant name the american author of widest note and popularity in the states but i can  then he went on and told about that albany incident he had inquired of the shopman  who is this davis  the answer was  an author whose books have to have freighttrains to carry them not baskets apparently you have not heard of him  stevenson said no this was the first time the man said  nobody has heard of davis you may ask all around and you will see you never see his name mentioned in print not even in advertisement these things are of no use to davis not any more than they are to the wind and the sea you never see one of daviss books floating on top of the united states but put on your diving armor and get yourself lowered away down and down and down till you strike the dense region the sunless region of eternal drudgery and starvation wagesthere youll find them by the million the man that gets that market his fortune is made his bread and butter are safe for those people will never go back on him an author may have a reputation which is confined to the surface and lose it and become pitied then despised then forgotten entirely forgottenthe frequent steps in a surface reputation at surface reputation however great is always mortal and always killable if you go at it rightwith pins and needles and quiet slow poison not with the club and tomahawk but it is a different matter with the submerged reputationdown in the deep water once a favorite there always a favorite once beloved always beloved once respected always respected honored and believed in for what the reviewer says never finds its way down into those placid deeps nor the newspaper sneers nor any breath of the winds of slander blowing above down there they never hear of these things their idol may be painted clay up then at the surface and fade and waste and crumble and blow away there being much weather there but down below he is gold and adamant and indestructible   v  this is from this mornings paper                           mark twain letter sold              written to thomas nast it proposed a joint tour       a mark twain autograph letter brought 43 yesterday at the auction      by the merwinclayton company of the library and correspondence of      the late thomas nast cartoonist the letter is nine pages      notepaper is dated hartford nov 12 1877 and it addressed to      nast it reads in part as follows                                                    hartford nov 12       my dear nast i did not think i should ever stand on a platform      again until the time was come for me to say i die innocent but the      same old offers keep arriving that have arriven every year and      been every year declined500 for louisville 500 for st louis      1000 gold for two nights in toronto half gross proceeds for new      york boston brooklyn c i have declined them all just as usual      though sorely tempted as usual       now i do not decline because i mind talking to an audience but      because 1 travelling alone is so heartbreakingly dreary and 2      shouldering the whole show is such cheerkilling responsibility       therefore i now propose to you what you proposed to me in november      1867ten years ago when i was unknown viz that you should      stand on the platform and make pictures and i stand by you and      blackguard the audience i should enormously enjoy meandering      around to big townsdont want to go to little ones with you for      company       the letter includes a schedule of cities and the number of      appearances planned for each   this is as it should be this is worthy of all praise i say it myself lest other competent persons should forget to do it it appears that four of my ancient letters were sold at auction three of them at twentyseven dollars twentyeight dollars and twentynine dollars respectively and the one above mentioned at fortythree dollars there is one very gratifying circumstance about this to wit that my literature has more than held its own as regards money value through this stretch of thirtysix years i judge that the fortythreedollar letter must have gone at about ten cents a word whereas if i had written it today its market rate would be thirty centsso i have increased in value two or three hundred per cent i note another gratifying circumstancethat a letter of general grants sold at something short of eighteen dollars i cant rise to general grants lofty place in the estimation of this nation but it is a deep happiness to me to know that when it comes to epistolary literature he cant sit in the front seat along with me  this reminds menine years ago when we were living in tedworth square london a report was cabled to the american journals that i was dying i was not the one it was another clemens a cousin of minedr j ross clemens now of st louiswho was due to die but presently escaped by some chicanery or other characteristic of the tribe of clemens the london representatives of the american papers began to flock in with american cables in their hands to inquire into my condition there was nothing the matter with me and each in his turn was astonished and disappointed to find me reading and smoking in my study and worth next to nothing as a text for transatlantic news one of these men was a gentle and kindly and grave and sympathetic irishman who hid his sorrow the best he could and tried to look glad and told me that his paper the evening sun had cabled him that it was reported in new york that i was dead what should he cable in reply i said  say the report is greatly exaggerated  he never smiled but went solemnly away and sent the cable in those words the remark hit the world pleasantly and to this day it keeps turning up now and then in the newspapers when people have occasion to discount exaggerations  the next man was also an irishman he had his new york cablegram in his handfrom the new york worldand he was so evidently trying to get around that cable with invented softnesses and palliations that my curiosity was aroused and i wanted to see what it did really say so when occasion offered i slipped it out of his hand it said  if mark twain dying send five hundred words if dead send a thousand  now that old letter of mine sold yesterday for fortythree dollars when i am dead it will be worth eightysix

vi  tomorrow will be the thirtysixth anniversary of our marriage my wife passed from this life one year and eight months ago in florence italy after an unbroken illness of twentytwo months duration  i saw her first in the form of an ivory miniature in her brother charleys stateroom in the steamer quaker city in the bay of smyrna in the summer of 1867 when she was in her twentysecond year i saw her in the flesh for the first time in new york in the following december she was slender and beautiful and girlishand she was both girl and woman she remained both girl and woman to the last day of her life under a grave and gentle exterior burned inextinguishable fires of sympathy energy devotion enthusiasm and absolutely limitless affection she was always frail in body and she lived upon her spirit whose hopefulness and courage were indestructible perfect truth perfect honesty perfect candor were qualities of her character which were born with her her judgments of people and things were sure and accurate her intuitions almost never deceived her in her judgments of the characters and acts of both friends and strangers there was always room for charity and this charity never failed i have compared and contrasted her with hundreds of persons and my conviction remains that hers was the most perfect character i have ever met and i may add that she was the most winningly dignified person i have ever known her character and disposition were of the sort that not only invites worship but commands it no servant ever left her service who deserved to remain in it and as she could choose with a glance of her eye the servants she selected did in almost all cases deserve to remain and they did remain she was always cheerful and she was always able to communicate her cheerfulness to others during the nine years that we spent in poverty and debt she was always able to reason me out of my despairs and find a bright side to the clouds and make me see it in all that time i never knew her to utter a word of regret concerning our altered circumstances nor did i ever know her children to do the like for she had taught them and they drew their fortitude from her the love which she bestowed upon those whom she loved took the form of worship and in that form it was returnedreturned by relatives friends and the servants of her household it was a strange combination which wrought into one individual so to speak by marriageher disposition and character and mine she poured out her prodigal affections in kisses and caresses and in a vocabulary of endearments whose profusion was always an astonishment to me i was born reserved as to endearments of speech and caresses and hers broke upon me as the summer waves break upon gibraltar i was reared in that atmosphere of reserve as i have already said in another chapter i never knew a member of my fathers family to kiss another member of it except once and that at a deathbed and our village was not a kissing community the kissing and caressing ended with courtshipalong with the deadly pianoplaying of that day  she had the heartfree laugh of a girl it came seldom but when it broke upon the ear it was as inspiring as music i heard it for the last time when she had been occupying her sickbed for more than a year and i made a written note of it at the timea note not to be repeated  tomorrow will be the thirtysixth anniversary we were married in her fathers house in elmira new york and went next day by special train to buffalo along with the whole langdon family and with the beechers and the twichells who had solemnized the marriage we were to live in buffalo where i was to be one of the editors of the buffalo express and a part owner of the paper i knew nothing about buffalo but i had made my household arrangements there through a friend by letter i had instructed him to find a boardinghouse of as respectable a character as my light salary as editor would command we were received at about nine oclock at the station in buffalo and were put into several sleighs and driven all over america as it seemed to mefor apparently we turned all the corners in the town and followed all the streets there werei scolding freely and characterizing that friend of mine in very uncomplimentary words for securing a boardinghouse that apparently had no definite locality but there was a conspiracyand my bride knew of it but i was in ignorance her father jervis langdon had bought and furnished a new house for us in the fashionable street delaware avenue and had laid in a cook and housemaids and a brisk and electric young coachman an irishman patrick mcaleerand we were being driven all over that city in order that one sleighful of those people could have time to go to the house and see that the gas was lighted all over it and a hot supper prepared for the crowd we arrived at last and when i entered that fairy place my indignation reached highwater mark and without any reserve i delivered my opinion to that friend of mine for being so stupid as to put us into a boardinghouse whose terms would be far out of my reach then mr langdon brought forward a very pretty box and opened it and took from it a deed of the house so the comedy ended very pleasantly and we sat down to supper  the company departed about midnight and left us alone in our new quarters then ellen the cook came in to get orders for the mornings marketingand neither of us knew whether beefsteak was sold by the barrel or by the yard we exposed our ignorance and ellen was fall of irish delight over it patrick mcaleer that brisk young irishman came in to get his orders for next dayand that was our first glimpse of him  our first child langdon clemens was born the 7th of november 1870 and lived twentytwo months susy was born the 19th of march 1872 and passed from life in the hartford home the 18th of august 1896 with her when the end came were jean and katy leary and john and ellen the gardener and his wife clara and her mother and i arrived in england from around the world on the 31st of july and took a house in guildford a week later when susy katy and jean should have been arriving from america we got a letter instead  it explained that susy was slightly illnothing of consequence but we were disquieted and began to cable for later news this was friday all day no answerand the ship to leave southampton next day at noon clara and her mother began packing to be ready in case the news should be bad finally came a cablegram saying wait for cablegram in the morning this was not satisfactorynot reassuring i cabled again asking that the answer be sent to southampton for the day was now closing i waited in the postoffice that night till the doors were closed toward midnight in the hope that good news might still come but there was no message we sat silent at home till one in the morning waitingwaiting for we knew not what then we took the earliest morning train and when we reached southampton the message was there it said the recovery would be long but certain this was a great relief to me but not to my wife she was frightened she and clara went aboard the steamer at once and sailed for america to nurse susy i remained behind to search for a larger house in guildford  that was the 15th of august 1896 three days later when my wife and clara were about halfway across the ocean i was standing in our diningroom thinking of nothing in particular when a cablegram was put into my hand it said susy was peacefully released today  it is one of the mysteries of our nature that a man all unprepared can receive a thunderstroke like that and live there is but one reasonable explanation of it the intellect is stunned by the shock and but gropingly gathers the meaning of the words the power to realize their fall import is mercifully wanting the mind has a dumb sense of vast lossthat is all it will take mind and memory months and possibly years to gather together the details and thus learn and know the whole extent of the loss a mans house burns down the smoking wreckage represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and pleasant associations by and by as the days and weeks go on first he misses this then that then the other thing and when he casts about for it he finds that it was in that house always it is an essentialthere was but one of its kind it cannot be replaced it was in that house it is irrevocably lost he did not realize that it was an essential when he had it he only discovers it now when he finds himself balked hampered by its absence it will be years before the tale of lost essentials is complete and not till then can he truly know the magnitude of his disaster  the 18th of august brought me the awful tidings the mother and the sister were out there in midatlantic ignorant of what was happening flying to meet this incredible calamity all that could be done to protect them from the full force of the shock was done by relatives and good friends they went down the bay and met the ship at night but did not show themselves until morning and then only to clara when she returned to the stateroom she did not speak and did not need to her mother looked at her and said  susy is dead  at half past ten oclock that night clara and her mother completed their circuit of the globe and drew up at elmira by the same train and in the same car which had borne them and me westward from it one year one month and one week before and again susy was therenot waving her welcome in the glare of the lights as she had waved her farewell to us thirteen months before but lying white and fair in her coffin in the house where she was born  the last thirteen days of susys life were spent in our own house in hartford the home of her childhood and always the dearest place in the earth to her about her she had faithful old friendsher pastor mr twichell who had known her from the cradle and who had come a long journey to be with her her uncle and aunt mr and mrs theodore crane patrick the coachman katy who had begun to serve us when susy was a child of eight years john and ellen who had been with us many years also jean was there  at the hour when my wife and clara set sail for america susy was in no danger three hours later there came a sudden change for the worse meningitis set in and it was immediately apparent that she was deathstruck that was saturday the 15th of august  that evening she took food for the last time jeans letter to me the next morning the brainfever was raging she walked the floor a little in her pain and delirium then succumbed to weakness and returned to her bed previously she had found hanging in a closet a gown which she had seen her mother wear she thought it was her mother dead and she kissed it and cried about noon she became blind an effect of the disease and bewailed it to her uncle  from jeans letter i take this sentence which needs no comment  about one in the afternoon susy spoke for the last time  it was only one word that she said when she spoke that last time and it told of her longing she groped with her hands and found katy and caressed her face and said mamma  how gracious it was that in that forlorn hour of wreck and ruin with the night of death closing around her she should have been granted that beautiful illusionthat the latest vision which rested upon the clouded mirror of her mind should have been the vision of her mother and the latest emotion she should know in life the joy and peace of that dear imagined presence  about two oclock she composed herself as if for sleep and never moved again she fell into unconsciousness and so remained two days and five hours until tuesday evening at seven minutes past seven when the release came she was twentyfour years and five months old  on the 23d her mother and her sisters saw her laid to restshe that had been our wonder and our worship  in one of her own books i find some verses which i will copy here apparently she always put borrowed matter in quotation marks these verses lack those marks and therefore i take them to be her own        love came at dawn when all the world was fair        when crimson glories bloom and sun were rife      love came at dawn when hopes wings fanned the air        and murmured i am life       love came at eve and when the day was done        when heart and brain were tired and slumber pressed      love came at eve shut out the sinking sun        and whispered i am rest   the summer seasons of susys childhood were spent at quarry farm on the hills east of elmira new york the other seasons of the year at the home in hartford like other children she was blithe and happy fond of play unlike the average of children she was at times much given to retiring within herself and trying to search out the hidden meanings of the deep things that make the puzzle and pathos of human existence and in all the ages have baffled the inquirer and mocked him as a little child aged seven she was oppressed and perplexed by the maddening repetition of the stock incidents of our races fleeting sojourn here just as the same thing has oppressed and perplexed maturer minds from the beginning of time a myriad of men are born they labor and sweat and struggle for bread they squabble and scold and fight they scramble for little mean advantages over each other age creeps upon them infirmities follow shames and humiliations bring down their prides and their vanities those they love are taken from them and the joy of life is turned to aching grief the burden of pain care misery grows heavier year by year at length ambition is dead pride is dead vanity is dead longing for release is in their place it comes at lastthe only unpoisoned gift earth ever had for themand they vanish from a world where they were of no consequence where they achieved nothing where they were a mistake and a failure and a foolishness there they have left no sign that they have existeda world which will lament them a day and forget them forever then another myriad takes their place and copies all they did and goes along the same profitless road and vanishes as they vanishedto make room for another and another and a million other myriads to follow the same arid path through the same desert and accomplish what the first myriad and all the myriads that came after it accomplishednothing  mamma what is it all for asked susy preliminarily stating the above details in her own halting language after long brooding over them alone in the privacy of the nursery  a year later she was groping her way alone through another sunless bog but this time she reached a rest for her feet for a week her mother had not been able to go to the nursery evenings at the childs prayer hour she spoke of itwas sorry for it and said she would come tonight and hoped she could continue to come every night and hear susy pray as before noticing that the child wished to respond but was evidently troubled as to how to word her answer she asked what the difficulty was susy explained that miss foote the governess had been teaching her about the indians and their religious beliefs whereby it appeared that they had not only a god but several this had set susy to thinking as a result of this thinking she had stopped praying she qualified this statementthat is she modified itsaying she did not now pray in the same way as she had formerly done her mother said  tell me about it dear  well mamma the indians believed they knew but now we know they were wrong by and by it can turn out that we are wrong so now i only pray that there may be a god and a heavenor something better  i wrote down this pathetic prayer in its precise wording at the time in a record which we kept of the childrens sayings and my reverence for it has grown with the years that have passed over my head since then its untaught grace and simplicity are a childs but the wisdom and the pathos of it are of all the ages that have come and gone since the race of man has lived and longed and hoped and feared and doubted  to go back a yearsusy aged seven several times her mother said to her  there there susy you mustnt cry over little things  this furnished susy a text for thought she had been breaking her heart over what had seemed vast disastersa broken toy a picnic cancelled by thunder and lightning and rain the mouse that was growing tame and friendly in the nursery caught and killed by the catand now came this strange revelation for some unaccountable reason these were not vast calamities why how is the size of calamities measured what is the rule there must be some way to tell the great ones from the small ones what is the law of these proportions she examined the problem earnestly and long she gave it her best thought from time to time for two or three daysbut it baffled herdefeated her and at last she gave up and went to her mother for help  mamma what is little things  it seemed a simple questionat first and yet before the answer could be put into words unsuspected and unforeseen difficulties began to appear they increased they multiplied they brought about another defeat the effort to explain came to a standstill then susy tried to help her mother outwith an instance an example an illustration the mother was getting ready to go downtown and one of her errands was to buy a longpromised toywatch for susy  if you forgot the watch mamma would that be a little thing  she was not concerned about the watch for she knew it would not be forgotten what she was hoping for was that the answer would unriddle the riddle and bring rest and peace to her perplexed little mind  the hope was disappointed of coursefor the reason that the size of a misfortune is not determinate by an outsiders measurement of it but only by the measurements applied to it by the person specially affected by it the kings lost crown is a vast matter to the king but of no consequence to the child the lost toy is a great matter to the child but in the kings eyes it is not a thing to break the heart about a verdict was reached but it was based upon the above model and susy was granted leave to measure her disasters thereafter with her own tapeline  as a child susy had a passionate temper and it cost her much remorse and many tears before she learned to govern it but after that it was a wholesome salt and her character was the stronger and healthier for its presence it enabled her to be good with dignity it preserved her not only from being good for vanitys sake but from even the appearance of it in looking back over the long vanished years it seems but natural and excusable that i should dwell with longing affection and preference upon incidents of her young life which made it beautiful to us and that i should let its few small offences go unsummoned and unreproached  in the summer of 1880 when susy was just eight years of age the family were at quarry farm as usual at that season of the year haycutting time was approaching and susy and clara were counting the hours for the time was big with a great event for them they had been promised that they might mount the wagon and ride home from the fields on the summit of the hay mountain this perilous privilege so dear to their age and species had never been granted them before their excitement had no bounds they could talk of nothing but this epochmaking adventure now but misfortune overtook susy on the very morning of the important day in a sudden outbreak of passion she corrected clarawith a shovel or stick or something of the sort at any rate the offence committed was of a gravity clearly beyond the limit allowed in the nursery in accordance with the rule and custom of the house susy went to her mother to confess and to help decide upon the size and character of the punishment due it was quite understood that as a punishment could have but one rational object and functionto act as a reminder and warn the transgressor against transgressing in the same way againthe children would know about as well as any how to choose a penalty which would be rememberable and effective susy and her mother discussed various punishments but none of them seemed adequate this fault was an unusually serious one and required the setting up of a dangersignal in the memory that would not blow out nor burn out but remain a fixture there and furnish its saving warning indefinitely among the punishments mentioned was deprivation of the haywagon ride it was noticeable that this one hit susy hard finally in the summing up the mother named over the list and asked  which one do you think it ought to be susy  susy studied shrank from her duty and asked  which do you think mamma  well susy i would rather leave it to you you make the choice yourself  it cost susy a struggle and much and deep thinking and weighingbut she came out where any one who knew her could have foretold she would  well mamma ill make it the haywagon because you know the other things might not make me remember not to do it again but if i dont get to ride on the haywagon i can remember it easily  in this world the real penalty the sharp one the lasting one never falls otherwise than on the wrong person it was not i that corrected clara but the remembrance of poor susys lost hayride still brings me a pangafter twentysix years  apparently susy was born with humane feelings for the animals and compassion for their troubles this enabled her to see a new point in an old story once when she was only six years olda point which had been overlooked by older and perhaps duller people for many ages her mother told her the moving story of the sale of joseph by his brethren the staining of his coat with the blood of the slaughtered kid and the rest of it she dwelt upon the inhumanity of the brothers their cruelty toward their helpless young brother and the unbrotherly treachery which they practised upon him for she hoped to teach the child a lesson in gentle pity and mercifulness which she would remember apparently her desire was accomplished for the tears came into susys eyes and she was deeply moved then she said  poor little kid  a childs frank envy of the privileges and distinctions of its elders is often a delicately flattering attention and the reverse of unwelcome but sometimes the envy is not placed where the beneficiary is expecting it to be placed once when susy was seven she sat breathlessly absorbed in watching a guest of ours adorn herself for a ball the lady was charmed by this homage this mute and gentle admiration and was happy in it and when her pretty labors were finished and she stood at last perfect unimprovable clothed like solomon in all his glory she paused confident and expectant to receive from susys tongue the tribute that was burning in her eyes susy drew an envious little sigh and said  i wish i could have crooked teeth and spectacles  once when susy was six months along in her eighth year she did something one day in the presence of company which subjected her to criticism and reproof afterward when she was alone with her mother as was her custom she reflected a little while over the matter then she set up what i thinkand what the shade of burns would thinkwas a quite good philosophical defence  well mamma you know i didnt see myself and so i couldnt know how it looked  in homes where the near friends and visitors are mainly literary peoplelawyers judges professors and clergymenthe childrens ears become early familiarized with wide vocabularies it is natural for them to pick up any words that fall in their way it is natural for them to pick up big and little ones indiscriminately it is natural for them to use without fear any word that comes to their net no matter how formidable it may be as to size as a result their talk is a curious and funny musketry clatter of little words interrupted at intervals by the heavy artillery crash of a word of such imposing sound and size that it seems to shake the ground and rattle the windows sometimes the child gets a wrong idea of a word which it has picked up by chance and attaches to it a meaning which impairs its usefulnessbut this does not happen as often as one might expect it would indeed it happens with an infrequency which may be regarded as remarkable as a child susy had good fortune with her large words and she employed many of them she made no more than her fair share of mistakes once when she thought something very funny was going to happen but it didnt she was racked and torn with laughter by anticipation but apparently she still felt sure of her position for she said if it had happened i should have been transformed transported with glee  and earlier when she was a little maid of five years she informed a visitor that she had been in a church only once and that was the time when clara was crucified christened  in heidelberg when susy was six she noticed that the schloss gardens were populous with snails creeping all about everywhere one day she found a new dish on her table and inquired concerning it and learned that it was made of snails she was awed and impressed and said  wild ones mamma  she was thoughtful and considerate of othersan acquired quality no doubt no one seems to be born with it one hot day at home in hartford when she was a little child her mother borrowed her fan several times a japanese one value five cents refreshed herself with it a moment or two then handed it back with a word of thanks susy knew her mother would use the fan all the time if she could do it without putting a deprivation upon its owner she also knew that her mother could not be persuaded to do that a relief most be devised somehow susy devised it she got five cents out of her moneybox and carried it to patrick and asked him to take it downtown a mile and a half and buy a japanese fan and bring it home he did itand thus thoughtfully and delicately was the exigency met and the mothers comfort secured it is to the childs credit that she did not save herself expense by bringing down another and more costly kind of fan from upstairs but was content to act upon the impression that her mother desired the japanese kindcontent to accomplish the desire and stop with that without troubling about the wisdom or unwisdom of it  sometimes while she was still a child her speech fell into quaint and strikingly expressive forms onceaged nine or tenshe came to her mothers room when her sister jean was a baby and said jean was crying in the nursery and asked if she might ring for the nurse her mother asked  is she crying hardmeaning cross ugly  well no mamma it is a weary lonesome cry  it is a pleasure to me to recall various incidents which reveal the delicacies of feeling that were so considerable a part of her budding character such a revelation came once in a way which while creditable to her heart was defective in another direction she was in her eleventh year then her mother had been making the christmas purchases and she allowed susy to see the presents which were for patricks children among these was a handsome sled for jimmy on which a stag was painted also in gilt capitals the word deer susy was excited and joyous over everything until she came to this sled then she became sober and silentyet the sled was the choicest of all the gifts her mother was surprised and also disappointed and said  why susy doesnt it please you isnt it fine  susy hesitated and it was plain that she did not want to say the thing that was in her mind however being urged she brought it haltingly out  well mamma it is fine and of course it did cost a good dealbutbutwhy should that be mentioned  seeing that she was not understood she reluctantly pointed to that word deer it was her orthography that was at fault not her heart she had inherited both from her mother                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dci  october 19 1906   chapters from my autobiographyiv  by mark twain   when susy was thirteen and was a slender little maid with plaited tails of coppertinged brown hair down her back and was perhaps the busiest bee in the household hive by reason of the manifold studies health exercises and recreations she had to attend to she secretly and of her own motion and out of love added another task to her laborsthe writing of a biography of me she did this work in her bedroom at night and kept her record hidden after a little the mother discovered it and filched it and let me see it then told susy what she had done and how pleased i was and how proud i remember that time with a deep pleasure i had had compliments before but none that touched me like this none that could approach it for value in my eyes it has kept that place always since i have had no compliment no praise no tribute from any source that was so precious to me as this one was and still is as i read it now after all these many years it is still a kings message to me and brings me the same dear surprise it brought me thenwith the pathos added of the thought that the eager and hasty hand that sketched it and scrawled it will not touch mine againand i feel as the humble and unexpectant must feel when their eyes fall upon the edict that raises them to the ranks of the noble  yesterday while i was rummaging in a pile of ancient notebooks of mine which i had not seen for years i came across a reference to that biography it is quite evident that several times at breakfast and dinner in those longpast days i was posing for the biography in fact i clearly remember that i was doing thatand i also remember that susy detected it i remember saying a very smart thing with a good deal of an air at the breakfasttable one morning and that susy observed to her mother privately a little later that papa was doing that for the biography  i cannot bring myself to change any line or word in susys sketch of me but will introduce passages from it now and then just as they came in their quaint simplicity out of her honest heart which was the beautiful heart of a child what comes from that source has a charm and grace of its own which may transgress all the recognized laws of literature if it choose and yet be literature still and worthy of hospitality i shall print the whole of this little biography before i have done with itevery word every sentence  the spelling is frequently desperate but it was susys and it shall stand i love it and cannot profane it to me it is gold to correct it would alloy it not refine it it would spoil it it would take from it its freedom and flexibility and make it stiff and formal even when it is most extravagant i am not shocked it is susys spelling and she was doing the best she couldand nothing could better it for me  susy began the biography in 1885 when i was in the fiftieth year of my age and she just entering the fourteenth of hers she begins in this way        we are a very happy family we consist of papa mamma jean clara      and me it is papa i am writing about and i shall have no trouble      in not knowing what to say about him as he is a very striking      character   but wait a minutei will return to susy presently  in the matter of slavish imitation man is the monkeys superior all the time the average man is destitute of independence of opinion he is not interested in contriving an opinion of his own by study and reflection but is only anxious to find out what his neighbors opinion is and slavishly adopt it a generation ago i found out that the latest review of a book was pretty sure to be just a reflection of the earliest review of it that whatever the first reviewer found to praise or censure in the book would be repeated in the latest reviewers report with nothing fresh added therefore more than once i took the precaution of sending my book in manuscript to mr howells when he was editor of the atlantic monthly so that he could prepare a review of it at leisure i knew he would say the truth about the booki also knew that he would find more merit than demerit in it because i already knew that that was the condition of the book i allowed no copy of it to go out to the press until after mr howellss notice of it had appeared that book was always safe there wasnt a man behind a pen in all america that had the courage to find anything in the book which mr howells had not foundthere wasnt a man behind a pen in america that had spirit enough to say a brave and original thing about the book on his own responsibility  i believe that the trade of critic in literature music and the drama is the most degraded of all trades and that it has no real valuecertainly no large value when charles dudley warner and i were about to bring out the gilded age the editor of the daily graphic persuaded me to let him have an advance copy he giving me his word of honor that no notice of it would appear in his paper until after the atlantic monthly notice should have appeared this reptile published a review of the book within three days afterward i could not really complain because he had only given me his word of honor as security i ought to have required of him something substantial i believe his notice did not deal mainly with the merit of the book or the lack of it but with my moral attitude toward the public it was charged that i had used my reputation to play a swindle upon the public that mr warner had written as much as half of the book and that i had used my name to float it and give it currency a currencyso the critic averredwhich it could not have acquired without my name and that this conduct of mine was a grave fraud upon the people the graphic was not an authority upon any subject whatever it had a sort of distinction in that it was the first and only illustrated daily newspaper that the world had seen but it was without character it was poorly and cheaply edited its opinion of a book or of any other work of art was of no consequence everybody knew this yet all the critics in america one after the other copied the graphics criticism merely changing the phraseology and left me under that charge of dishonest conduct even the great chicago tribune the most important journal in the middle west was not able to invent anything fresh but adopted the view of the humble daily graphic dishonestycharge and all  however let it go it is the will of god that we must have critics and missionaries and congressmen and humorists and we must bear the burden meantime i seem to have been drifting into criticism myself but that is nothing at the worst criticism is nothing more than a crime and i am not unused to that  what i have been travelling toward all this time is this the first critic that ever had occasion to describe my personal appearance littered his description with foolish and inexcusable errors whose aggregate furnished the result that i was distinctly and distressingly unhandsome that description floated around the country in the papers and was in constant use and wear for a quarter of a century it seems strange to me that apparently no critic in the country could be found who could look at me and have the courage to take up his pen and destroy that lie that lie began its course on the pacific coast in 1864 and it likened me in personal appearance to petroleum v nasby who had been out there lecturing for twentyfive years afterward no critic could furnish a description of me without fetching in nasby to help out my portrait i knew nasby well and he was a good fellow but in my life i have not felt malignant enough about any more than three persons to charge those persons with resembling nasby it hurts me to the heart i was always handsome anybody but a critic could have seen it and it had long been a distress to my familyincluding susythat the critics should go on making this wearisome mistake year after year when there was no foundation for it even when a critic wanted to be particularly friendly and complimentary to me he didnt dare to go beyond my clothes he never ventured beyond that old safe frontier when he had finished with my clothes he had said all the kind things the pleasant things the complimentary things he could risk then he dropped back on nasby  yesterday i found this clipping in the pocket of one of those ancient memorandumbooks of mine it is of the date of thirtynine years ago and both the paper and the ink are yellow with the bitterness that i felt in that old day when i clipped it out to preserve it and brood over it and grieve about it i will copy it here to wit        a correspondent of the philadelphia press writing of one of      schuyler colfaxs receptions says of our washington correspondent      mark twain the delicate humorist was present quite a lion as      he deserves to be mark is a bachelor faultless in taste whose      snowy vest is suggestive of endless quarrels with washington      washerwomen but the heroism of mark is settled for all time for      such purity and smoothness were never seen before his lavender      gloves might have been stolen from some turkish harem so delicate      were they in size but more likelyanything else were more likely      than that in form and feature he bears some resemblance to the      immortal nasby but whilst petroleum is brunette to the core twain      is golden amberhued melting blonde   let us return to susys biography now and get the opinion of one who is unbiassed  from susys biography        papas appearance has been described many times but very      incorrectly he has beautiful gray hair not any too thick or any      too long but just right a roman nose which greatly improves the      beauty of his features kind blue eyes and a small mustache he has      a wonderfully shaped head and profile he has a very good      figurein short he is an extrodinarily fine looking man all his      features are perfect except that he hasnt extrodinary teeth his      complexion is very fair and he doesnt ware a beard he is a very      good man and a very funny one he has got a temper but we all of      us have in this family he is the loveliest man i ever saw or ever      hope to seeand oh so absentminded he does tell perfectly      delightful stories clara and i used to sit on each arm of his      chair and listen while he told us stories about the pictures on the      wall   i remember the storytelling days vividly they were a difficult and exacting audiencethose little creatures  along one side of the library in the hartford home the bookshelves joined the mantelpiecein fact there were shelves on both sides of the mantelpiece on these shelves and on the mantelpiece stood various ornaments at one end of the procession was a framed oilpainting of a cats head at the other end was a head of a beautiful young girl lifesizecalled emmeline because she looked just about like thatan impressionist watercolor between the one picture and the other there were twelve or fifteen of the bricàbrac things already mentioned also an oilpainting by elihu vedder the young medusa every now and then the children required me to construct a romancealways impromptunot a moments preparation permittedand into that romance i had to get all that bricàbrac and the three pictures i had to start always with the cat and finish with emmeline i was never allowed the refreshment of a change endforend it was not permissible to introduce a bricàbrac ornament into the story out of its place in the procession  these bricàbracs were never allowed a peaceful day a reposeful day a restful sabbath in their lives there was no sabbath in their lives there was no peace they knew no existence but a monotonous career of violence and bloodshed in the course of time the bricàbrac and the pictures showed wear it was because they had had so many and such tumultuous adventures in their romantic careers  as romancer to the children i had a hard time even from the beginning if they brought me a picture in a magazine and required me to build a story to it they would cover the rest of the page with their pudgy hands to keep me from stealing an idea from it the stories had to come hot from the bat always they had to be absolutely original and fresh sometimes the children furnished me simply a character or two or a dozen and required me to start out at once on that slim basis and deliver those characters up to a vigorous and entertaining life of crime if they heard of a new trade or an unfamiliar animal or anything like that i was pretty sure to have to deal with those things in the next romance once clara required me to build a sudden tale out of a plumber and a bawgunstrictor and i had to do it she didnt know what a boaconstrictor was until he developed in the talethen she was better satisfied with it than ever  from susys biography        papas favorite game is billiards and when he is tired and wishes      to rest himself he stays up all night and plays billiards it seems      to rest his head he smokes a great deal almost incessantly he has      the mind of an author exactly some of the simplest things he cant      understand our burglaralarm is often out of order and papa had      been obliged to take the mahoganyroom off from the alarm      altogether for a time because the burglaralarm had been in the      habit of ringing even when the mahoganyroom was closed at length      he thought that perhaps the burglaralarm might be in order and he      decided to try and see accordingly he put it on and then went down      and opened the window consequently the alarm bell rang it would      even if the alarm had been in order papa went despairingly      upstairs and said to mamma livy the mahoganyroom wont go on i      have just opened the window to see       why youth mamma replied if youve opened the window why of      coarse the alarm will ring       thats what ive opened it for why i just went down to see if it      would ring       mamma tried to explain to papa that when he wanted to go and see      whether the alarm would ring while the window was closed he      mustnt go and open the windowbut in vain papa couldnt      understand and got very impatient with mamma for trying to make      him believe an impossible thing true   this is a frank biographer and an honest one she uses no sandpaper on me i have to this day the same dull head in the matter of conundrums and perplexities which susy had discovered in those longgone days complexities annoy me they irritate me then this progressive feeling presently warms into anger i cannot get far in the reading of the commonest and simplest contractwith its parties of the first part and parties of the second part and parties of the third partbefore my temper is all gone ashcroft comes up here every day and pathetically tries to make me understand the points of the lawsuit which we are conducting against henry butters harold wheeler and the rest of those plasmon buccaneers but daily he has to give it up it is pitiful to see when he bends his earnest and appealing eyes upon me and says after one of his efforts now you do understand that dont you  i am always obliged to say i dont ashcroft i wish i could understand it but i dont send for the cat  in the days which susy is talking about a perplexity fell to my lot one day f g whitmore was my business agent and he brought me out from town in his buggy we drove by the portecochère and toward the stable now this was a single road and was like a spoon whose handle stretched from the gate to a great round flowerbed in the neighborhood of the stable at the approach to the flowerbed the road divided and circumnavigated it making a loop which i have likened to the bowl of the spoon as we neared the loop i saw that whitmore was laying his course to port i was sitting on the starboard sidethe side the house was on and was going to start around that spoonbowl on that lefthand side i said  dont do that whitmore take the righthand side then i shall be next to the house when we get to the door  he said that will not happen in any case it doesnt make any difference which way i go around this flowerbed  i explained to him that he was an ass but he stuck to his proposition and i said  go on and try it and see  he went on and tried it and sure enough he fetched me up at the door on the very side that he had said i would be i was not able to believe it then and i dont believe it yet  i said whitmore that is merely an accident you cant do it again  he said he couldand he drove down into the street fetched around came back and actually did it again i was stupefied paralyzed petrified with these strange results but they did not convince me i didnt believe he could do it another time but he did he said he could do it all day and fetch up the same way every time by that time my temper was gone and i asked him to go home and apply to the asylum and i would pay the expenses i didnt want to see him any more for a week  i went upstairs in a rage and started to tell livy about it expecting to get her sympathy for me and to breed aversion in her for whitmore but she merely burst into peal after peal of laughter as the tale of my adventure went on for her head was like susys riddles and complexities had no terrors for it her mind and susys were analytical i have tried to make it appear that mine was different many and many a time i have told that buggy experiment hoping against hope that i would some time or other find somebody who would be on my side but it has never happened and i am never able to go glibly forward and state the circumstances of that buggys progress without having to halt and consider and call up in my mind the spoonhandle the bowl of the spoon the buggy and the horse and my position in the buggy and the minute i have got that far and try to turn it to the left it goes to ruin i cant see how it is ever going to fetch me out right when we get to the door susy is right in her estimate i cant understand things  that burglaralarm which susy mentions led a gay and careless life and had no principles it was generally out of order at one point or another and there was plenty of opportunity because all the windows and doors in the house from the cellar up to the top floor were connected with it however in its seasons of being out of order it could trouble us for only a very little while we quickly found out that it was fooling us and that it was buzzing its bloodcurdling alarm merely for its own amusement then we would shut it off and send to new york for the electricianthere not being one in all hartford in those days when the repairs were finished we would set the alarm again and reestablish our confidence in it it never did any real business except upon one single occasion all the rest of its expensive career was frivolous and without purpose just that one time it performed its duty and its whole dutygravely seriously admirably it let fly about two oclock one black and dreary march morning and i turned out promptly because i knew that it was not fooling this time the bathroom door was on my side of the bed i stepped in there turned up the gas looked at the annunciator and turned off the alarmso far as the door indicated was concernedthus stopping the racket then i came back to bed mrs clemens opened the debate  what was it  it was the cellar door  was it a burglar do you think  yes i said of course it was did you suppose it was a sundayschool superintendent  no what do you suppose he wants  i suppose he wants jewelry but he is not acquainted with the house and he thinks it is in the cellar i dont like to disappoint a burglar whom i am not acquainted with and who has done me no harm but if he had had common sagacity enough to inquire i could have told him we kept nothing down there but coal and vegetables still it may be that he is acquainted with the place and that what he really wants is coal and vegetables on the whole i think it is vegetables he is after  are you going down to see  no i could not be of any assistance let him select for himself i dont know where the things are  then she said but suppose he comes up to the ground floor  thats all right we shall know it the minute he opens a door on that floor it will set off the alarm  just then the terrific buzzing broke out again i said  he has arrived i told you he would i know all about burglars and their ways they are systematic people  i went into the bathroom to see if i was right and i was i shut off the diningroom and stopped the buzzing and came back to bed my wife said  what do you suppose he is after now  i said i think he has got all the vegetables he wants and is coming up for napkinrings and odds and ends for the wife and children they all have familiesburglars haveand they are always thoughtful of them always take a few necessaries of life for themselves and fill out with tokens of remembrance for the family in taking them they do not forget us those very things represent tokens of his remembrance of us and also of our remembrance of him we never get them again the memory of the attention remains embalmed in our hearts  are you going down to see what it is he wants now  no i said i am no more interested than i was before they are experienced peopleburglars they know what they want i should be no help to him i think he is after ceramics and bricàbrac and such things if he knows the house he knows that that is all that he can find on the diningroom floor  she said with a strong interest perceptible in her tone suppose he comes up here  i said it is all right he will give us notice  what shall we do then then  climb out of the window  she said a little restively well what is the use of a burglaralarm for us  you have seen dear heart that it has been useful up to the present moment and i have explained to you how it will be continuously useful after he gets up here  that was the end of it he didnt ring any more alarms presently i said  he is disappointed i think he has gone off with the vegetables and the bricàbrac and i think he is dissatisfied  we went to sleep and at a quarter before eight in the morning i was out and hurrying for i was to take the 829 train for new york i found the gas burning brightlyfull headall over the first floor my new overcoat was gone my old umbrella was gone my new patentleather shoes which i had never worn were gone the large window which opened into the ombra at the rear of the house was standing wide i passed out through it and tracked the burglar down the hill through the trees tracked him without difficulty because he had blazed his progress with imitation silver napkinrings and my umbrella and various other things which he had disapproved of and i went back in triumph and proved to my wife that he was a disappointed burglar i had suspected he would be from the start and from his not coming up to our floor to get human beings  things happened to me that day in new york i will tell about them another time  from susys biography        papa has a peculiar gait we like it seems just to sute him but      most people do not he always walks up and down the room while      thinking and between each coarse at meals   a lady distantly related to us came to visit us once in those days she came to stay a week but all our efforts to make her happy failed we could not imagine why and she got up her anchor and sailed the next morning we did much guessing but could not solve the mystery later we found out what the trouble was it was my tramping up and down between the courses she conceived the idea that i could not stand her society  that word youth as the reader has perhaps already guessed was my wifes pet name for me it was gently satirical but also affectionate i had certain mental and material peculiarities and customs proper to a much younger person than i was  from susys biography        papa is very fond of animals particularly of cats we had a dear      little gray kitten once that he named lazy papa always wears      gray to match his hair and eyes and he would carry him around on      his shoulder it was a mighty pretty sight the gray cat sound      asleep against papas gray coat and hair the names that he has      given our different cats are realy remarkably funny they are      namely stray kit abner motley fraeulein lazy bufalo bill      cleveland sour mash and pestilence and famine   at one time when the children were small we had a very black mothercat named satan and satan had a small black offspring named sin pronouns were a difficulty for the children little clara came in one day her black eyes snapping with indignation and said  papa satan ought to be punished she is out there at the greenhouse and there she stays and stays and his kitten is downstairs crying  from susys biography        papa uses very strong language but i have an idea not nearly so      strong as when he first maried mamma a lady acquaintance of his is      rather apt to interupt what one is saying and papa told mamma that      he thought he should say to the ladys husband i am glad your wife      wasnt present when the deity said let there be light   it is as i have said before this is a frank historian she doesnt cover up ones deficiencies but gives them an equal showing with ones handsomer qualities of course i made the remark which she has quotedand even at this distant day i am still as much as half persuaded that if that lady had been present when the creator said let there be light she would have interrupted him and we shouldnt ever have got it  from susys biography        papa said the other day i am a mugwump and a mugwump is pure from      the marrow out papa knows that i am writing this biography of      him and he said this for it he doesnt like to go to church at      all why i never understood until just now he told us the other      day that he couldnt bear to hear any one talk but himself but      that he could listen to himself talk for hours without getting      tired of course he said this in joke but ive no dought it was      founded on truth                                                        mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dcii  november 2 1906   chapters from my autobiographyv  by mark twain   susys remark about my strong language troubles me and i must go back to it all through the first ten years of my married life i kept a constant and discreet watch upon my tongue while in the house and went outside and to a distance when circumstances were too much for me and i was obliged to seek relief i prized my wifes respect and approval above all the rest of the human races respect and approval i dreaded the day when she should discover that i was but a whited sepulchre partly freighted with suppressed language i was so careful during ten years that i had not a doubt that my suppressions had been successful therefore i was quite as happy in my guilt as i could have been if i had been innocent  but at last an accident exposed me i went into the bathroom one morning to make my toilet and carelessly left the door two or three inches ajar it was the first time that i had ever failed to take the precaution of closing it tightly i knew the necessity of being particular about this because shaving was always a trying ordeal for me and i could seldom carry it through to a finish without verbal helps now this time i was unprotected but did not suspect it i had no extraordinary trouble with my razor on this occasion and was able to worry through with mere mutterings and growlings of an improper sort but with nothing noisy or emphatic about themno snapping and barking then i put on a shirt my shirts are an invention of my own they open in the back and are buttoned therewhen there are buttons this time the button was missing my temper jumped up several degrees in a moment and my remarks rose accordingly both in loudness and vigor of expression but i was not troubled for the bathroom door was a solid one and i supposed it was firmly closed i flung up the window and threw the shirt out it fell upon the shrubbery where the people on their way to church could admire it if they wanted to there was merely fifty feet of grass between the shirt and the passerby still rumbling and thundering distantly i put on another shirt again the button was absent i augmented my language to meet the emergency and threw that shirt out of the window i was too angrytoo insaneto examine the third shirt but put it furiously on again the button was absent and that shirt followed its comrades out of the window then i straightened up gathered my reserves and let myself go like a cavalry charge in the midst of that great assault my eye fell upon that gaping door and i was paralyzed  it took me a good while to finish my toilet i extended the time unnecessarily in trying to make up my mind as to what i would best do in the circumstances i tried to hope that mrs clemens was asleep but i knew better i could not escape by the window it was narrow and suited only to shirts at last i made up my mind to boldly loaf through the bedroom with the air of a person who had not been doing anything i made half the journey successfully i did not turn my eyes in her direction because that would not be safe it is very difficult to look as if you have not been doing anything when the facts are the other way and my confidence in my performance oozed steadily out of me as i went along i was aiming for the lefthand door because it was furthest from my wife it had never been opened from the day that the house was built but it seemed a blessed refuge for me now the bed was this one wherein i am lying now and dictating these histories morning after morning with so much serenity it was this same old elaborately carved black venetian bedsteadthe most comfortable bedstead that ever was with space enough in it for a family and carved angels enough surmounting its twisted columns and its headboard and footboard to bring peace to the sleepers and pleasant dreams i had to stop in the middle of the room i hadnt the strength to go on i believed that i was under accusing eyesthat even the carved angels were inspecting me with an unfriendly gaze you know how it is when you are convinced that somebody behind you is looking steadily at you you have to turn your faceyou cant help it i turned mine the bed was placed as it is now with the foot where the head ought to be if it had been placed as it should have been the high headboard would have sheltered me but the footboard was no sufficient protection for i could be seen over it i was exposed i was wholly without protection i turned because i couldnt help itand my memory of what i saw is still vivid after all these years  against the white pillows i saw the black headi saw that young and beautiful face and i saw the gracious eyes with a something in them which i had never seen there before they were snapping and flashing with indignation i felt myself crumbling i felt myself shrinking away to nothing under that accusing gaze i stood silent under that desolating fire for as much as a minute i should sayit seemed a very very long time then my wifes lips parted and from them issuedmy latest bathroom remark the language perfect but the expression velvety unpractical apprenticelike ignorant inexperienced comically inadequate absurdly weak and unsuited to the great language in my lifetime i had never heard anything so out of tune so inharmonious so incongruous so illsuited to each other as were those mighty words set to that feeble music i tried to keep from laughing for i was a guilty person in deep need of charity and mercy i tried to keep from bursting and i succeededuntil she gravely said there now you know how it sounds  then i exploded the air was filled with my fragments and you could hear them whiz i said oh livy if it sounds like that i will never do it again  then she had to laugh herself both of us broke into convulsions and went on laughing until we were physically exhausted and spiritually reconciled  the children were present at breakfastclara aged six and susy eightand the mother made a guarded remark about strong language guarded because she did not wish the children to suspect anythinga guarded remark which censured strong language both children broke out in one voice with this comment why mamma papa uses it  i was astonished i had supposed that that secret was safe in my own breast and that its presence had never been suspected i asked  how did you know you little rascals  oh they said we often listen over the balusters when you are in the hall explaining things to george  from susys biography        one of papas latest books is the prince and the pauper and it is      unquestionably the best book he has ever written some people want      him to keep to his old style some gentleman wrote him i enjoyed      huckleberry finn immensely and am glad to see that you have      returned to your old style that enoyed me that enoyed me greatly      because it trobles me susy was troubled by that word and      uncertain she wrote a u above it in the proper place but      reconsidered the matter and struck it out to have so few people      know papa i mean realy know him they think of mark twain as a      humorist joking at everything and with a mop of reddish brown      hair which sorely needs the barbars brush a roman nose short      stubby mustache a sad careworn face with maney crows feet etc      that is the way people picture papa i have wanted papa to write a      book that would reveal something of his kind sympathetic nature      and the prince and the pauper partly does it the book is full of      lovely charming ideas and oh the language it is perfect i      think that one of the most touching scenes in it is where the      pauper is riding on horseback with his nobles in the recognition      procession and he sees his mother oh and then what followed how      she runs to his side when she sees him throw up his hand palm      outward and is rudely pushed off by one of the kings officers      and then how the little paupers consceince troubles him when he      remembers the shameful words that were falling from his lips when      she was turned from his side i know you not woman and how his      grandeurs were stricken valueless and his pride consumed to ashes      it is a wonderfully beautiful and touching little scene and papa      has described it so wonderfully i never saw a man with so much      variety of feeling as papa has now the prince and the pauper is      full of touching places but there is most always a streak of humor      in them somewhere now in the coronationin the stirring      coronation just after the little king has got his crown back again      papa brings that in about the seal where the pauper says he used      the seal to crack nuts with oh it is so funny and nice papa      very seldom writes a passage without some humor in it somewhere      and i dont think he ever will   the children always helped their mother to edit my books in manuscript she would sit on the porch at the farm and read aloud with her pencil in her hand and the children would keep an alert and suspicious eye upon her right along for the belief was well grounded in them that whenever she came across a particularly satisfactory passage she would strike it out their suspicions were well founded the passages which were so satisfactory to them always had an element of strength in them which sorely needed modification or expurgation and were always sure to get it at their mothers hand for my own entertainment and to enjoy the protests of the children i often abused my editors innocent confidence i often interlarded remarks of a studied and felicitously atrocious character purposely to achieve the childrens brief delight and then see the remorseless pencil do its fatal work i often joined my supplications to the childrens for mercy and strung the argument out and pretended to be in earnest they were deceived and so was their mother it was three against one and most unfair but it was very delightful and i could not resist the temptation now and then we gained the victory and there was much rejoicing then i privately struck the passage out myself it had served its purpose it had furnished three of us with good entertainment and in being removed from the book by me it was only suffering the fate originally intended for it  from susys biography        papa was born in missouri his mother is grandma clemens jane      lampton clemens of kentucky grandpa clemens was of the ffvs of      virginia   without doubt it was i that gave susy that impression i cannot imagine why because i was never in my life much impressed by grandeurs which proceed from the accident of birth i did not get this indifference from my mother she was always strongly interested in the ancestry of the house she traced her own line back to the lambtons of durham englanda family which had been occupying broad lands there since saxon times i am not sure but i think that those lambtons got along without titles of nobility for eight or nine hundred years then produced a great man threequarters of a century ago and broke into the peerage my mother knew all about the clemenses of virginia and loved to aggrandize them to me but she has long been dead there has been no one to keep those details fresh in my memory and they have grown dim  there was a jere clemens who was a united states senator and in his day enjoyed the usual senatorial famea fame which perishes whether it spring from four years service or forty after jere clemenss fame as a senator passed away he was still remembered for many years on account of another service which he performed he shot old john browns governor wise in the hind leg in a duel however i am not very clear about this it may be that governor wise shot him in the hind leg however i dont think it is important i think that the only thing that is really important is that one of them got shot in the hind leg it would have been better and nobler and more historical and satisfactory if both of them had got shot in the hind legbut it is of no use for me to try to recollect history i never had a historical mind let it go whichever way it happened i am glad of it and that is as much enthusiasm as i can get up for a person bearing my name but i am forgetting the first clemensthe one that stands furthest back toward the really original first clemens which was adam  from susys biography        clara and i are sure that papa played the trick on grandma about      the whipping that is related in the adventures of tom sayer      hand me that switch the switch hovered in the air the peril was      desperatemy look behind you aunt the old lady whirled around      and snatched her skirts out of danger the lad fled on the instant      scrambling up the high board fence and dissapeared over it   susy and clara were quite right about that  then susy says        and we know papa played hookey all the time and how readily      would papa pretend to be dying so as not to have to go to school   these revelations and exposures are searching but they are just if i am as transparent to other people as i was to susy i have wasted much effort in this life        grandma couldnt make papa go to school no she let him go into a      printingoffice to learn the trade he did so and gradually picked      up enough education to enable him to do about as well as those who      were more studious in early life   it is noticeable that susy does not get overheated when she is complimenting me but maintains a proper judicial and biographical calm it is noticeable also and it is to her credit as a biographer that she distributes compliment and criticism with a fair and even hand  my mother had a good deal of trouble with me but i think she enjoyed it she had none at all with my brother henry who was two years younger than i and i think that the unbroken monotony of his goodness and truthfulness and obedience would have been a burden to her but for the relief and variety which i furnished in the other direction i was a tonic i was valuable to her i never thought of it before but now i see it i never knew henry to do a vicious thing toward me or toward any one elsebut he frequently did righteous ones that cost me as heavily it was his duty to report me when i needed reporting and neglected to do it myself and he was very faithful in discharging that duty he is sid in tom sawyer but sid was not henry henry was a very much finer and better boy than ever sid was  it was henry who called my mothers attention to the fact that the thread with which she had sewed my collar together to keep me from going in swimming had changed color my mother would not have discovered it but for that and she was manifestly piqued when she recognized that that prominent bit of circumstantial evidence had escaped her sharp eye that detail probably added a detail to my punishment it is human we generally visit our shortcomings on somebody else when there is a possible excuse for itbut no matter i took it out of henry there is always compensation for such as are unjustly used i often took it out of himsometimes as an advance payment for something which i hadnt yet done these were occasions when the opportunity was too strong a temptation and i had to draw on the future i did not need to copy this idea from my mother and probably didnt still she wrought upon that principle upon occasion  if the incident of the broken sugarbowl is in tom sawyeri dont remember whether it is or notthat is an example of it henry never stole sugar he took it openly from the bowl his mother knew he wouldnt take sugar when she wasnt looking but she had her doubts about me not exactly doubts either she knew very well i would one day when she was not present henry took sugar from her prized and precious old english sugarbowl which was an heirloom in the familyand he managed to break the bowl it was the first time i had ever had a chance to tell anything on him and i was inexpressibly glad i told him i was going to tell on him but he was not disturbed when my mother came in and saw the bowl lying on the floor in fragments she was speechless for a minute i allowed that silence to work i judged it would increase the effect i was waiting for her to ask who did thatso that i could fetch out my news but it was an error of calculation when she got through with her silence she didnt ask anything about itshe merely gave me a crack on the skull with her thimble that i felt all the way down to my heels then i broke out with my injured innocence expecting to make her very sorry that she had punished the wrong one i expected her to do something remorseful and pathetic i told her that i was not the oneit was henry but there was no upheaval she said without emotion its all right it isnt any matter you deserve it for something youve done that i didnt know about and if you havent done it why then you deserve it for something that you are going to do that i shant hear about  there was a stairway outside the house which led up to the rear part of the second story one day henry was sent on an errand and he took a tin bucket along i knew he would have to ascend those stairs so i went up and locked the door on the inside and came down into the garden which had been newly ploughed and was rich in choice firm clods of black mold i gathered a generous equipment of these and ambushed him i waited till he had climbed the stairs and was near the landing and couldnt escape then i bombarded him with clods which he warded off with his tin bucket the best he could but without much success for i was a good marksman the clods smashing against the weatherboarding fetched my mother out to see what was the matter and i tried to explain that i was amusing henry both of them were after me in a minute but i knew the way over that high board fence and escaped for that time after an hour or two when i ventured back there was no one around and i thought the incident was closed but it was not henry was ambushing me with an unusually competent aim for him he landed a stone on the side of my head which raised a bump there that felt like the matterhorn i carried it to my mother straightway for sympathy but she was not strongly moved it seemed to be her idea that incidents like this would eventually reform me if i harvested enough of them so the matter was only educational i had had a sterner view of it than that before  it was not right to give the cat the painkiller i realize it now i would not repeat it in these days but in those tom sawyer days it was a great and sincere satisfaction to me to see peter perform under its influenceand if actions do speak as loud as words he took as much interest in it as i did it was a most detestable medicine perry daviss painkiller mr paveys negro man who was a person of good judgment and considerable curiosity wanted to sample it and i let him it was his opinion that it was made of hellfire  those were the cholera days of 49 the people along the mississippi were paralyzed with fright those who could run away did it and many died of fright in the flight fright killed three persons where the cholera killed one those who couldnt flee kept themselves drenched with cholera preventives and my mother chose perry daviss painkiller for me she was not distressed about herself she avoided that kind of preventive but she made me promise to take a teaspoonful of painkiller every day originally it was my intention to keep the promise but at that time i didnt know as much about painkiller as i knew after my first experiment with it she didnt watch henrys bottleshe could trust henry but she marked my bottle with a pencil on the label every day and examined it to see if the teaspoonful had been removed the floor was not carpeted it had cracks in it and i fed the painkiller to the cracks with very good resultsno cholera occurred down below  it was upon one of these occasions that that friendly cat came waving his tail and supplicating for painkillerwhich he gotand then went into those hysterics which ended with his colliding with all the furniture in the room and finally going out of the open window and carrying the flowerpots with him just in time for my mother to arrive and look over her glasses in petrified astonishment and say what in the world is the matter with peter  i dont remember what my explanation was but if it is recorded in that book it may not be the right one  whenever my conduct was of such exaggerated impropriety that my mothers extemporary punishments were inadequate she saved the matter up for sunday and made me go to church sunday nightwhich was a penalty sometimes bearable perhaps but as a rule it was not and i avoided it for the sake of my constitution she would never believe that i had been to church until she had applied her test she made me tell her what the text was that was a simple matter and caused me no trouble i didnt have to go to church to get a text i selected one for myself this worked very well until one time when my text and the one furnished by a neighbor who had been to church didnt tally after that my mother took other methods i dont know what they were now  in those days men and boys wore rather long cloaks in the wintertime they were black and were lined with very bright and showy scotch plaids one winters night when i was starting to church to square a crime of some kind committed during the week i hid my cloak near the gate and went off and played with the other boys until church was over then i returned home but in the dark i put the cloak on wrong side out entered the room threw the cloak aside and then stood the usual examination i got along very well until the temperature of the church was mentioned my mother said  it must have been impossible to keep warm there on such a night  i didnt see the art of that remark and was foolish enough to explain that i wore my cloak all the time that i was in church she asked if i kept it on from church home too i didnt see the bearing of that remark i said that that was what i had done she said  you wore it in church with that red scotch plaid outside and glaring didnt that attract any attention  of course to continue such a dialogue would have been tedious and unprofitable and i let it go and took the consequences  that was about 1849 tom nash was a boy of my own agethe postmasters son the mississippi was frozen across and he and i went skating one night probably without permission i cannot see why we should go skating in the night unless without permission for there could be no considerable amusement to be gotten out of skating at night if nobody was going to object to it about midnight when we were more than half a mile out toward the illinois shore we heard some ominous rumbling and grinding and crashing going on between us and the home side of the river and we knew what it meantthe ice was breaking up we started for home pretty badly scared we flew along at full speed whenever the moonlight sifting down between the clouds enabled us to tell which was ice and which was water in the pauses we waited started again whenever there was a good bridge of ice paused again when we came to naked water and waited in distress until a floating vast cake should bridge that place it took us an hour to make the tripa trip which we made in a misery of apprehension all the time but at last we arrived within a very brief distance of the shore we waited again there was another place that needed bridging all about us the ice was plunging and grinding along and piling itself up in mountains on the shore and the dangers were increasing not diminishing we grew very impatient to get to solid ground so we started too early and went springing from cake to cake tom made a miscalculation and fell short he got a bitter bath but he was so close to shore that he only had to swim a stroke or twothen his feet struck hard bottom and he crawled out i arrived a little later without accident we had been in a drenching perspiration and toms bath was a disaster for him he took to his bed sick and had a procession of diseases the closing one was scarletfever and he came out of it stone deaf within a year or two speech departed of course but some years later he was taught to talk after a fashionone couldnt always make out what it was he was trying to say of course he could not modulate his voice since he couldnt hear himself talk when he supposed he was talking low and confidentially you could hear him in illinois  four years ago 1902 i was invited by the university of missouri to come out there and receive the honorary degree of lld i took that opportunity to spend a week in hannibala city now a village in my day it had been fiftythree years since tom nash and i had had that adventure when i was at the railway station ready to leave hannibal there was a crowd of citizens there i saw tom nash approaching me across a vacant space and i walked toward him for i recognized him at once he was old and whiteheaded but the boy of fifteen was still visible in him he came up to me made a trumpet of his hands at my ear nodded his head toward the citizens and said confidentiallyin a yell like a foghorn  same damned fools sam  from susys biography        papa was about twenty years old when he went on the mississippi as      a pilot just before he started on his tripp grandma clemens asked      him to promise her on the bible not to touch intoxicating liquors      or swear and he said yes mother i will and he kept that      promise seven years when grandma released him from it   under the inspiring influence of that remark what a garden of forgotten reforms rises upon my sight                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dciii  november 16 1906   chapters from my autobiographyvi  by mark twain   from susys biography        papa made arrangements to read at vassar college the 1st of may      and i went with him we went by way of new york city mamma went      with us to new york and stayed two days to do some shopping we      started tuesday at 12 past two oclock in the afternoon and      reached new york about 14 past six papa went right up to general      grants from the station and mamma and i went to the everett house      aunt clara came to supper with us up in our room       we and aunt clara were going were going to the theatre right after      supper and we expected papa to take us there and to come home as      early as he could but we got through dinner and he didnt come      and didnt come and mamma got more perplexed and worried but at      last we thought we would have to go without him so we put on our      things and started down stairs but before wed goten half down we      met papa coming up with a great bunch of roses in his hand he      explained that the reason he was so late was that his watch stopped      and he didnt notice and kept thinking it an hour earlier than it      really was the roses he carried were some col fred grant sent to      mamma we went to the theatre and enjoyed adonis word illegible      acted very much we reached home about 12 past eleven oclock and      went right to bed wednesday morning we got up rather late and had      breakfast about 12 past nine oclock after breakfast mamma went      out shopping and papa and i went to see papas agent about some      business matters after papa had gotten through talking to cousin      charlie webster papas agent we went to get a friend of papas      major pond to go and see a dog show with us then we went to see      the dogs with major pond and we had a delightful time seeing so      many dogs together when we got through seeing the dogs papa      thought he would go and see general grant and i went with himthis      was april 29 1885 papa went up into general grants room and he      took me with him i felt greatly honored and delighted when papa      took me into general grants room and let me see the general and      col grant for general grant is a man i shall be glad all my life      that i have seen papa and general grant had a long talk together      and papa has written an account of his talk and visit with general      grant for me to put into this biography   susy has inserted in this place that account of mineas follows                                                       april 29 1885       i called on general grant and took susy with me the general was      looking and feeling far better than he had looked or felt for some      months he had ventured to work again on his book that morningthe      first time he had done any work for perhaps a month this mornings      work was his first attempt at dictating and it was a thorough      success to his great delight he had always said that it would be      impossible for him to dictate anything but i had said that he was      noted for clearness of statement and as a narrative was simply a      statement of consecutive facts he was consequently peculiarly      qualified and equipped for dictation this turned out to be true      for he had dictated two hours that morning to a shorthand writer      had never hesitated for words had not repeated himself and the      manuscript when finished needed no revision the two hours work      was an account of appomattoxand this was such an extremely      important feature that his book would necessarily have been      severely lame without it therefore i had taken a shorthand writer      there before to see if i could not get him to write at least a few      lines about appomattox5 but he was at that time not well enough      to undertake it i was aware that of all the hundred versions of      appomattox not one was really correct therefore i was extremely      anxious that he should leave behind him the truth his throat was      not distressing him and his voice was much better and stronger      than usual he was so delighted to have gotten appomattox      accomplished once more in his lifeto have gotten the matter off      his mindthat he was as talkative as his old self he received      susy very pleasantly and then fell to talking about certain      matters which he hoped to be able to dictate next day and he said      in substance that among other things he wanted to settle once for      all a question that had been bandied about from mouth to mouth and      from newspaper to newspaper that question was with whom      originated the idea of the march to the sea was it grants or was      it shermans idea whether i or some one else being anxious to      get the important fact settled asked him with whom the idea      originated i dont remember but i remember his answer i shall      always remember his answer general grant said       neither of us originated the idea of shermans march to the sea      the enemy did it       he went on to say that the enemy however necessarily originated a      great many of the plans that the general on the opposite side gets      the credit for at the same time that the enemy is doing that he      is laying open other moves which the opposing general sees and      takes advantage of in this case sherman had a plan all thought      out of course he meant to destroy the two remaining railroads in      that part of the country and that would finish up that region but      general hood did not play the military part that he was expected to      play on the contrary general hood made a dive at chattanooga      this left the march to the sea open to sherman and so after      sending part of his army to defend and hold what he had acquired in      the chattanooga region he was perfectly free to proceed with the      rest of it through georgia he saw the opportunity and he would      not have been fit for his place if he had not seized it       he wrote me the general is speaking what his plan was and i      sent him word to go ahead my staff were opposed to the movement      i think the general said they tried to persuade him to stop      sherman the chief of his staff the general said even went so far      as to go to washington without the generals knowledge and get the      ear of the authorities and he succeeded in arousing their fears to      such an extent that they telegraphed general grant to stop      sherman       then general grant said out of deference to the government i      telegraphed sherman and stopped him twentyfour hours and then      considering that that was deference enough to the government i      telegraphed him to go ahead again       i have not tried to give the generals language but only the      general idea of what he said the thing that mainly struck me was      his terse remark that the enemy originated the idea of the march to      the sea it struck me because it was so suggestive of the generals      epigrammatic fashionsaying a great deal in a single crisp      sentence this is my account and signed mark twain   susy resumes        after papa and general grant had had their talk we went back to      the hotel where mamma was and papa told mamma all about his      interview with general grant mamma and i had a nice quiet      afternoon together   that pair of devoted comrades were always shutting themselves up together when there was opportunity to have what susy called a cozy time from susys nursery days to the end of her life she and her mother were close friends intimate friends passionate adorers of each other susys was a beautiful mind and it made her an interesting comrade and with the fine mind she had a heart like her mothers susy never had an interest or an occupation which she was not glad to put aside for that something which was in all cases more precious to hera visit with her mother susy died at the right time the fortunate time of life the happy agetwentyfour years at twentyfour such a girl has seen the best of lifelife as a happy dream after that age the risks begin responsibility comes and with it the cares the sorrows and the inevitable tragedy for her mothers sake i would have brought her back from the grave if i could but i would not have done it for my own  from susys biography        then papa went to read in public there were a great many authors      that read that thursday afternoon beside papa i would have liked      to have gone and heard papa read but papa said he was going to      read in vassar just what he was planning to read in new york so i      stayed at home with mamma       the next day mamma planned to take the four oclock car back to      hartford we rose quite early that morning and went to the vienna      bakery and took breakfast there from there we went to a german      bookstore and bought some german books for claras birthday   dear me the power of association to snatch mouldy dead memories out of their graves and make them walk that remark about buying foreign books throws a sudden white glare upon the distant past and i see the long stretch of a new york street with an unearthly vividness and john hay walking down it grave and remorseful i was walking down it too that morning and i overtook hay and asked him what the trouble was he turned a lustreless eye upon me and said  my case is beyond cure in the most innocent way in the world i have committed a crime which will never be forgiven by the sufferers for they will never believeoh well no i was going to say they would never believe that i did the thing innocently the truth is they will know that i acted innocently because they are rational people but what of that i never can look them in the face againnor they me perhaps  hay was a young bachelor and at that time was on the tribune staff he explained his trouble in these words substantially  when i was passing along here yesterday morning on my way downtown to the office i stepped into a bookstore where i am acquainted and asked if they had anything new from the other side they handed me a french novel in the usual yellow paper cover and i carried it away i didnt even look at the title of it it was for recreation reading and i was on my way to my work i went mooning and dreaming along and i think i hadnt gone more than fifty yards when i heard my name called i stopped and a private carriage drew up at the sidewalk and i shook hands with the inmatesmother and young daughter excellent people they were on their way to the steamer to sail for paris the mother said  i saw that book in your hand and i judged by the look of it that it was a french novel is it  i said it was  she said do let me have it so that my daughter can practise her french on it on the way over  of course i handed her the book and we parted ten minutes ago i was passing that bookstore again and i stepped in and fetched away another copy of that book here it is read the first page of it that is enough you will know what the rest is like i think it must be the foulest book in the french languageone of the foulest anyway i would be ashamed to offer it to a harlotbut oh dear i gave it to that sweet young girl without shame take my advice dont give away a book until you have examined it  from susys biography        then mamma and i went to do some shopping and papa went to see      general grant after we had finnished doing our shopping we went      home to the hotel together when we entered our rooms in the hotel      we saw on the table a vase full of exquisett red roses mamma who      is very fond of flowers exclaimed oh i wonder who could have sent      them we both looked at the card in the midst of the roses and saw      that it was written on in papas handwriting it was written in      german liebes geshchenk on die mamma i am sure i didnt say      onthat is susys spelling not mine also i am sure i didnt      spell geschenk so liberally as all thats l c mamma was      delighted papa came home and gave mamma her ticket and after      visiting a while with her went to see major pond and mamma and i      sat down to our lunch after lunch most of our time was taken up      with packing and at about three oclock we went to escort mamma to      the train we got on board the train with her and stayed with her      about five minutes and then we said goodbye to her and the train      started for hartford it was the first time i had ever beene away      from home without mamma in my life although i was 13 yrs old      papa and i drove back to the hotel and got major pond and then went      to see the brooklyn bridge we went across it to brooklyn on the      cars and then walked back across it from brooklyn to new york we      enjoyed looking at the beautiful scenery and we could see the      bridge moove under the intense heat of the sun we had a perfectly      delightful time but weer pretty tired when we got back to the      hotel       the next morning we rose early took our breakfast and took an      early train to poughkeepsie we had a very pleasant journey to      poughkeepsie the hudson was magnificentshrouded with beautiful      mist when we arived at poughkeepsie it was raining quite hard      which fact greatly dissapointed me because i very much wanted to      see the outside of the buildings of vassar college and as it rained      that would be impossible it was quite a long drive from the      station to vasser college and papa and i had a nice long time to      discuss and laugh over german profanity one of the german phrases      papa particularly enjoys is o heilige maria mutter jesus jean      has a german nurse and this was one of her phrases there was a      time when jean exclaimed ach gott to every trifle but when      mamma found it out she was shocked and instantly put a stop to it   it brings that pretty little german girl vividly before mea sweet and innocent and plump little creature with peachy cheeks a clearsouled little maiden and without offence notwithstanding her profanities and she was loaded to the eyebrows with them she was a mere child she was not fifteen yet she was just from germany and knew no english she was always scattering her profanities around and they were such a satisfaction to me that i never dreamed of such a thing as modifying her for my own sake i had no disposition to tell on her indeed i took pains to keep her from being found out i told her to confine her religious exercises to the childrens quarters and urged her to remember that mrs clemens was prejudiced against pieties on weekdays to the children the little maids profanities sounded natural and proper and right because they had been used to that kind of talk in germany and they attached no evil importance to it it grieves me that i have forgotten those vigorous remarks i long hoarded them in my memory as a treasure but i remember one of them still because i heard it so many times the trial of that little creatures life was the childrens hair she would tug and strain with her comb accompanying her work with her misplaced pieties and when finally she was through with her triple job she always fired up and exploded her thanks toward the sky where they belonged in this form gott sei dank ich bin fertig mitm gott verdammtes haar i believe i am not quite brave enough to translate it  from susys biography        we at length reached vassar college and she looked very finely her      buildings and her grounds being very beautiful we went to the      front doore and range the bell the young girl who came to the      doore wished to know who we wanted to see evidently we were not      expected papa told her who we wanted to see and she showed us to      the parlor we waited no one came and waited no one came still      no one came it was beginning to seem pretty awkward oh well this      is a pretty piece of business papa exclaimed at length we heard      footsteps coming down the long corridor and miss c the lady who      had invited papa came into the room she greeted papa very      pleasantly and they had a nice little chatt together soon the lady      principal also entered and she was very pleasant and agreable she      showed us to our rooms and said she would send for us when dinner      was ready we went into our rooms but we had nothing to do for      half an hour exept to watch the rain drops as they fell upon the      window panes at last we were called to dinner and i went down      without papa as he never eats anything in the middle of the day i      sat at the table with the lady principal and enjoyed very much      seeing all the young girls trooping into the diningroom after      dinner i went around the college with the young ladies and papa      stayed in his room and smoked when it was supper time papa went      down and ate supper with us and we had a very delightful supper      after supper the young ladies went to their rooms to dress for the      evening papa went to his room and i went with the lady principal      at length the guests began to arive but papa still remained in his      room until called for papa read in the chapell it was the first      time i had ever heard him read in my lifethat is in public when      he came out on to the stage i remember the people behind me      exclaimed oh how queer he is isnt he funny i thought papa was      very funny although i did not think him queer he read a trying      situation and the golden arm a ghost story that he heard down      south when he was a little boy the golden arm papa had told me      before but he had startled me so that i did not much wish to hear      it again but i had resolved this time to be prepared and not to      let myself be startled but still papa did and very very much he      startled the whole roomful of people and they jumped as one man      the other story was also very funny and interesting and i enjoyed      the evening inexpressibly much after papa had finished reading we      all went down to the collation in the diningroom and after that      there was dancing and singing then the guests went away and papa      and i went to bed the next morning we rose early took an early      train for hartford and reached hartford at 12 past 2 oclock we      were very glad to get back   how charitably she treats that ghastly experience it is a dear and lovely disposition and a most valuable one that can brush away indignities and discourtesies and seek and find the pleasanter features of an experience susy had that disposition and it was one of the jewels of her character that had come to her straight from her mother it is a feature that was left out of me at birth and at seventy i have not yet acquired it i did not go to vassar college professionally but as a guestas a guest and gratis aunt clara now mrs john b stanchfield was a graduate of vassar and it was to please her that i inflicted that journey upon susy and myself the invitation had come to me from both the lady mentioned by susy and the president of the collegea sour old saint who has probably been gathered to his fathers long ago and i hope they enjoy him i hope they value his society i think i can get along without it in either end of the next world  we arrived at the college in that soaking rain and susy has described with just a suggestion of dissatisfaction the sort of reception we got susy had to sit in her damp clothes half an hour while we waited in the parlor then she was taken to a fireless room and left to wait there again as she has stated i do not remember that presidents name and i am sorry he did not put in an appearance until it was time for me to step upon the platform in front of that great garden of young and lovely blossoms he caught up with me and advanced upon the platform with me and was going to introduce me i said in substance  you have allowed me to get along without your help thus far and if you will retire from the platform i will try to do the rest without it  i did not see him any more but i detest his memory of course my resentment did not extend to the students and so i had an unforgettable good time talking to them and i think they had a good time too for they responded as one man to use susys unimprovable phrase  girls are charming creatures i shall have to be twice seventy years old before i change my mind as to that i am to talk to a crowd of them this afternoon students of barnard college the sexs annex to columbia university and i think i shall have as pleasant a time with those lasses as i had with the vassar girls twentyone years ago  from susys biography        i stopped in the middle of mammas early history to tell about our      tripp to vassar because i was afraid i would forget about it now i      will go on where i left off some time after miss emma nigh died      papa took mamma and little langdon to elmira for the summer when      in elmira langdon began to fail but i think mamma did not know just      what was the matter with him   i was the cause of the childs illness his mother trusted him to my care and i took him a long drive in an open barouche for an airing it was a raw cold morning but he was well wrapped about with furs and in the hands of a careful person no harm would have come to him but i soon dropped into a reverie and forgot all about my charge the furs fell away and exposed his bare legs by and by the coachman noticed this and i arranged the wraps again but it was too late the child was almost frozen i hurried home with him i was aghast at what i had done and i feared the consequences i have always felt shame for that treacherous mornings work and have not allowed myself to think of it when i could help it i doubt if i had the courage to make confession at that time i think it most likely that i have never confessed until now  from susys biography        at last it was time for papa to return to hartford and langdon was      real sick at that time but still mamma decided to go with him      thinking the journey might do him good but after they reached      hartford he became very sick and his trouble prooved to be      diptheeria he died about a week after mamma and papa reached      hartford he was burried by the side of grandpa at elmira new      york susy rests there with thems l c after that mamma      became very very ill so ill that there seemed great danger of      death but with a great deal of good care she recovered some      months afterward mamma and papa and susy who was perhaps fourteen      or fifteen months old at the times l c went to europe and      stayed for a time in scotland and england in scotland mamma and      papa became very well equanted with dr john brown the author of      rab and his friends and he mett but was not so well equanted      with mr charles kingsley mr henry m stanley sir thomas hardy      grandson of the captain hardy to whom nellson said kiss me hardy      when dying on shipboard mr henry irving robert browning sir      charles dilke mr charles reade mr william black lord houghton      frank buckland mr tom hughes anthony trollope tom hood son of      the poetand mamma and papa were quite well equanted with dr      macdonald and family and papa met harrison ainsworth   i remember all these men very well indeed except the last one i do not recall ainsworth by my count susy mentions fourteen men they are all dead except sir charles dilke  we met a great many other interesting people among them lewis carroll author of the immortal alicebut he was only interesting to look at for he was the stillest and shyest fullgrown man i have ever met except uncle remus dr macdonald and several other lively talkers were present and the talk went briskly on for a couple of hours but carroll sat still all the while except that now and then he answered a question his answers were brief i do not remember that he elaborated any of them  at a dinner at smalleys we met herbert spencer at a large luncheon party at lord houghtons we met sir arthur helps who was a celebrity of worldwide fame at the time but is quite forgotten now lord elcho a large vigorous man sat at some distance down the table he was talking earnestly about godalming it was a deep and flowing and unarticulated rumble but i got the godalming pretty clearly every time it broke free of the rumble and as all the strength was on the first end of the word it startled me every time because it sounded so like swearing in the middle of the luncheon lady houghton rose remarked to the guests on her right and on her left in a matteroffact way excuse me i have an engagement and without further ceremony she went off to meet it this would have been doubtful etiquette in america lord houghton told a number of delightful stories he told them in french and i lost nothing of them but the nubs                                                       mark twain                         to be continued  footnote  5 i was his publisher i was putting his personal memoirs to press at the times l c     north american review  no dciv  december 7 1906   chapters from my autobiographyvii  by mark twain   i was always heedless i was born heedless and therefore i was constantly and quite unconsciously committing breaches of the minor proprieties which brought upon me humiliations which ought to have humiliated me but didnt because i didnt know anything had happened but livy knew and so the humiliations fell to her share poor child who had not earned them and did not deserve them she always said i was the most difficult child she had she was very sensitive about me it distressed her to see me do heedless things which could bring me under criticism and so she was always watchful and alert to protect me from the kind of transgressions which i have been speaking of  when i was leaving hartford for washington upon the occasion referred to she said i have written a small warning and put it in a pocket of your dressvest when you are dressing to go to the authors reception at the white house you will naturally put your fingers in your vest pockets according to your custom and you will find that little note there read it carefully and do as it tells you i cannot be with you and so i delegate my sentry duties to this little note if i should give you the warning by word of mouth now it would pass from your head and be forgotten in a few minutes  it was president clevelands first term i had never seen his wifethe young the beautiful the goodhearted the sympathetic the fascinating sure enough just as i had finished dressing to go to the white house i found that little note which i had long ago forgotten it was a grave little note a serious little note like its writer but it made me laugh livys gentle gravities often produced that effect upon me where the expert humorists best joke would have failed for i do not laugh easily  when we reached the white house and i was shaking hands with the president he started to say something but i interrupted him and said  if your excellency will excuse me i will come back in a moment but now i have a very important matter to attend to and it must be attended to at once  i turned to mrs cleveland the young the beautiful the fascinating and gave her my card on the back of which i had written he didntand i asked her to sign her name below those words  she said he didnt he didnt what  oh i said never mind we cannot stop to discuss that now this is urgent wont you please sign your name i handed her a fountainpen  why she said i cannot commit myself in that way who is it that didntand what is it that he didnt  oh i said time is flying flying flying wont you take me out of my distress and sign your name to it its all right i give you my word its all right  she looked nonplussed but hesitatingly and mechanically she took the pen and said  i will sign it i will take the risk but you must tell me all about it right afterward so that you can be arrested before you get out of the house in case there should be anything criminal about this  then she signed and i handed her mrs clementss note which was very brief very simple and to the point it said dont wear your arctics in the white house it made her shout and at my request she summoned a messenger and we sent that card at once to the mail on its way to mrs clemens in hartford  when the little ruth was about a year or a year and a half old mason an old and valued friend of mine was consulgeneral at frankfortonthemain i had known him well in 1867 68 and 69 in america and i and mine had spent a good deal of time with him and his family in frankfort in 78 he was a thoroughly competent diligent and conscientious official indeed he possessed these qualities in so large a degree that among american consuls he might fairly be said to be monumental for at that time our consular service was largelyand i think i may say mainlyin the hands of ignorant vulgar and incapable men who had been political heelers in america and had been taken care of by transference to consulates where they could be supported at the governments expense instead of being transferred to the poor house which would have been cheaper and more patriotic mason in 78 had been consulgeneral in frankfort several yearsfour i think he had come from marseilles with a great record he had been consul there during thirteen years and one part of his record was heroic there had been a desolating cholera epidemic and mason was the only representative of any foreign country who stayed at his post and saw it through and during that time he not only represented his own country but he represented all the other countries in christendom and did their work and did it well and was praised for it by them in words of no uncertain sound this great record of masons had saved him from official decapitation straight along while republican presidents occupied the chair but now it was occupied by a democrat mr cleveland was not seated in ithe was not yet inauguratedbefore he was deluged with applications from democratic politicians desiring the appointment of a thousand or so politically useful democrats to masons place a year or two later mason wrote me and asked me if i couldnt do something to save him from destruction  i was very anxious to keep him in his place but at first i could not think of any way to help him for i was a mugwump we the mugwumps a little company made up of the unenslaved of both parties the very best men to be found in the two great partiesthat was our idea of itvoted sixty thousand strong for mr cleveland in new york and elected him our principles were high and very definite we were not a party we had no candidates we had no axes to grind our vote laid upon the man we cast it for no obligation of any kind by our rule we could not ask for office we could not accept office when voting it was our duty to vote for the best man regardless of his party name we had no other creed vote for the best manthat was creed enough  such being my situation i was puzzled to know how to try to help mason and at the same time save my mugwump purity undefiled it was a delicate place but presently out of the ruck of confusions in my mind rose a sane thought clear and brightto wit since it was a mugwumps duty to do his best to put the beet man in office necessarily it must be a mugwumps duty to try to keep the best man in when he was already there my course was easy now it might not be quite delicate for a mugwump to approach the president directly but i could approach him indirectly with all delicacy since in that case not even courtesy would require him to take notice of an application which no one could prove had ever reached him  yes it was easy and simple sailing now i could lay the matter before ruth in her cradle and wait for results i wrote the little child and said to her all that i have just been saying about mugwump principles and the limitations which they put upon me i explained that it would not be proper for me to apply to her father in mr masons behalf but i detailed to her mr masons high and honorable record and suggested that she take the matter in her own hands and do a patriotic work which i felt some delicacy about venturing upon myself i asked her to forget that her father was only president of the united states and her subject and servant i asked her not to put her application in the form of a command but to modify it and give it the fictitious and pleasanter form of a mere requestthat it would be no harm to let him gratify himself with the superstition that he was independent and could do as he pleased in the matter i begged her to put stress and plenty of it upon the proposition that to keep mason in his place would be a benefaction to the nation to enlarge upon that and keep still about all other considerations  in due time i received a letter from the president written with his own hand signed by his own hand acknowledging ruths intervention and thanking me for enabling him to save to the country the services of so good and welltried a servant as mason and thanking me also for the detailed fulness of masons record which could leave no doubt in any ones mind that mason was in his right place and ought to be kept there mason has remained in the service ever since and is now consulgeneral at paris  during the time that we were living in buffalo in 7071 mr cleveland was sheriff but i never happened to make his acquaintance or even see him in fact i suppose i was not even aware of his existence fourteen years later he was become the greatest man in the state i was not living in the state at the time he was governor and was about to step into the post of president of the united states at that time i was on the public highway in company with another bandit george w cable we were robbing the public with readings from our works during four monthsand in the course of time we went to albany to levy tribute and i said we ought to go and pay our respects to the governor  so cable and i went to that majestic capitol building and stated our errand we were shown into the governors private office and i saw mr cleveland for the first time we three stood chatting together i was born lazy and i comforted myself by turning the corner of a table into a sort of seat presently the governor said  mr clemens i was a fellow citizen of yours in buffalo a good many months a good while ago and during those months you burst suddenly into a mighty fame out of a previous longcontinued and no doubt proper obscuritybut i was a nobody and you wouldnt notice me nor have anything to do with me but now that i have become somebody you have changed your style and you come here to shake hands with me and be sociable how do you explain this kind of conduct  oh i said it is very simple your excellency in buffalo you were nothing but a sheriff i was in society i couldnt afford to associate with sheriffs but you are a governor now and you are on your way to the presidency it is a great difference and it makes you worth while  there appeared to be about sixteen doors to that spacious room from each door a young man now emerged and the sixteen lined up and moved forward and stood in front of the governor with an aspect of respectful expectancy in their attitude no one spoke for a moment then the governor said  you are dismissed gentlemen your services are not required mr clemens is sitting on the bells  there was a cluster of sixteen bell buttons on the corner of the table my proportions at that end of me were just right to enable me to cover the whole of that nest and that is how i came to hatch out those sixteen clerks  in accordance with the suggestion made in gilders letter recently received i have written the following note to expresident cleveland upon his sixtyninth birthday        honored sir       your patriotic virtues have won for you the homage of half the      nation and the enmity of the other half this places your character      as a citizen upon a summit as high as washingtons the verdict is      unanimous and unassailable the votes of both sides are necessary      in cases like these and the votes of the one side are quite as      valuable as are the votes of the other where the votes are all in      a mans favor the verdict is against him it is sand and history      will wash it away but the verdict for you is rock and will stand                                                         s l clemens          as of date march 18 1906   in a diary which mrs clemens kept for a little while a great many years ago i find various mentions of mrs harriet beecher stowe who was a near neighbor of ours in hartford with no fences between and in those days she made as much use of our grounds as of her own in pleasant weather her mind had decayed and she was a pathetic figure she wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular irishwoman among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather mrs stowe entered them at her own free will and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits she was able to deal in surprises and she liked to do it she would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a warwhoop that would jump that person out of his clothes and she had other moods sometimes we would hear gentle music in the drawingroom and would find her there at the piano singing ancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect  her husband old professor stowe was a picturesque figure he wore a broad slouch hat he was a large man and solemn his beard was white and thick and hung far down on his breast the first time our little susy ever saw him she encountered him on the street near our house and came flying wideeyed to her mother and said santa claus has got loose  which reminds me of rev charley stowes little boya little boy of seven years i met rev charley crossing his mothers grounds one morning and he told me this little tale he had been out to chicago to attend a convention of congregational clergymen and had taken his little boy with him during the trip he reminded the little chap every now and then that he must be on his very best behavior there in chicago he said we shall be the guests of a clergyman there will be other guestsclergymen and their wivesand you must be careful to let those people see by your walk and conversation that you are of a godly household be very careful about this the admonition bore fruit at the first breakfast which they ate in the chicago clergymans house he heard his little son say in the meekest and most reverent way to the lady opposite him  please wont you for christs sake pass the butter

in those early days duelling suddenly became a fashion in the new territory of nevada and by 1864 everybody was anxious to have a chance in the new sport mainly for the reason that he was not able to thoroughly respect himself so long as he had not killed or crippled somebody in a duel or been killed or crippled in one himself  at that time i had been serving as city editor on mr goodmans virginia city enterprise for a matter of two years i was twentynine years old i was ambitious in several ways but i had entirely escaped the seductions of that particular craze i had had no desire to fight a duel i had no intention of provoking one i did not feel respectable but i got a certain amount of satisfaction out of feeling safe i was ashamed of myself the rest of the staff were ashamed of mebut i got along well enough i had always been accustomed to feeling ashamed of myself for one thing or another so there was no novelty for me in the situation i bore it very well plunkett was on the staff r m daggett was on the staff these had tried to get into duels but for the present had failed and were waiting goodman was the only one of us who had done anything to shed credit upon the paper the rival paper was the virginia union its editor for a little while was tom fitch called the silvertongued orator of wisconsinthat was where he came from he tuned up his oratory in the editorial columns of the union and mr goodman invited him out and modified him with a bullet i remember the joy of the staff when goodmans challenge was accepted by fitch we ran late that night and made much of joe goodman he was only twentyfour years old he lacked the wisdom which a person has at twentynine and he was as glad of being it as i was that i wasnt he chose major graves for his second that name is not right but its close enough i dont remember the majors name graves came over to instruct joe in the duelling art he had been a major under walker the grayeyed man of destiny and had fought all through that remarkable mans filibustering campaign in central america that fact gauges the major to say that a man was a major under walker and came out of that struggle ennobled by walkers praise is to say that the major was not merely a brave man but that he was brave to the very utmost limit of that word all of walkers men were like that i knew the gillis family intimately the father made the campaign under walker and with him one son they were in the memorable plaza fight and stood it out to the last against overwhelming odds as did also all of the walker men the son was killed at the fathers side the father received a bullet through the eye the old manfor he was an old man at the timewore spectacles and the bullet and one of the glasses went into his skull and remained there there were some other sons steve george and jim very young chapsthe merest ladswho wanted to be in the walker expedition for they had their fathers dauntless spirit but walker wouldnt have them he said it was a serious expedition and no place for children  the major was a majestic creature with a most stately and dignified and impressive military bearing and he was by nature and training courteous polite graceful winning and he had that quality which i think i have encountered in only one other manbob howlanda mysterious quality which resides in the eye and when that eye is turned upon an individual or a squad in warning that is enough the man that has that eye doesnt need to go armed he can move upon an armed desperado and quell him and take him prisoner without saying a single word i saw bob howland do that oncea slender goodnatured amiable gentle kindly little skeleton of a man with a sweet blue eye that would win your heart when it smiled upon you or turn cold and freeze it according to the nature of the occasion  the major stood joe up straight stood steve gillis up fifteen paces away made joe turn right side towards steve cock his navy sixshooterthat prodigious weaponand hold it straight down against his leg told him that that was the correct position for the gunthat the position ordinarily in use at virginia city that is to say the gun straight up in the air then brought slowly down to your man was all wrong at the word one you must raise the gun slowly and steadily to the place on the other mans body that you desire to convince then after a pause two threefirestop at the word stop you may firebut not earlier you may give yourself as much time as you please after that word then when you fire you may advance and go on firing at your leisure and pleasure if you can get any pleasure out of it and in the meantime the other man if he has been properly instructed and is alive to his privileges is advancing on you and firingand it is always likely that more or less trouble will result  naturally when joes revolver had risen to a level it was pointing at steves breast but the major said no that is not wise take all the risks of getting murdered yourself but dont run any risk of murdering the other man if you survive a duel you want to survive it in such a way that the memory of it will not linger along with you through the rest of your life and interfere with your sleep aim at your mans leg not at the knee not above the knee for those are dangerous spots aim below the knee cripple him but leave the rest of him to his mother  by grace of these truly wise and excellent instructions joe tumbled fitch down next morning with a bullet through his lower leg which furnished him a permanent limp and joe lost nothing but a lock of hair which he could spare better then than he could now for when i saw him here in new york a year ago his crop was gone he had nothing much left but a fringe with a dome rising above  sidenote 1864  about a year later i got my chance but i was not hunting for it goodman went off to san francisco for a weeks holiday and left me to be chief editor i had supposed that that was an easy berth there being nothing to do but write one editorial per day but i was disappointed in that superstition i couldnt find anything to write an article about the first day then it occurred to me that inasmuch as it was the 22nd of april 1864 the next morning would be the threehundredth anniversary of shakespeares birthdayand what better theme could i want than that i got the cyclopædia and examined it and found out who shakespeare was and what he had done and i borrowed all that and laid it before a community that couldnt have been better prepared for instruction about shakespeare than if they had been prepared by art there wasnt enough of what shakespeare had done to make an editorial of the necessary length but i filled it out with what he hadnt donewhich in many respects was more important and striking and readable than the handsomest things he had really accomplished but next day i was in trouble again there were no more shakespeares to work up there was nothing in past history or in the worlds future possibilities to make an editorial out of suitable to that community so there was but one theme left that theme was mr laird proprietor of the virginia union his editor had gone off to san francisco too and laird was trying his hand at editing i woke up mr laird with some courtesies of the kind that were fashionable among newspaper editors in that region and he came back at me the next day in a most vitriolic way he was hurt by something i had said about himsome little thingi dont remember what it was nowprobably called him a horsethief or one of those little phrases customarily used to describe another editor they were no doubt just and accurate but laird was a very sensitive creature and he didnt like it so we expected a challenge from mr laird because according to the rulesaccording to the etiquette of duelling as reconstructed and reorganized and improved by the duellists of that regionwhenever you said a thing about another person that he didnt like it wasnt sufficient for him to talk back in the same offensive spirit etiquette required him to send a challenge so we waited for a challengewaited all day it didnt come and as the day wore along hour after hour and no challenge came the boys grew depressed they lost heart but i was cheerful i felt better and better all the time they couldnt understand it but i could understand it it was my make that enabled me to be cheerful when other people were despondent so then it became necessary for us to waive etiquette and challenge mr laird when we reached that decision they began to cheer up but i began to lose some of my animation however in enterprises of this kind you are in the hands of your friends there is nothing for you to do but to abide by what they consider to be the best course daggett wrote a challenge for me for daggett had the languagethe right languagethe convincing languageand i lacked it daggett poured out a stream of unsavory epithets upon mr laird charged with a vigor and venom of a strength calculated to persuade him and steve gillis my second carried the challenge and came back to wait for the return it didnt come the boys were exasperated but i kept my temper steve carried another challenge hotter than the other and we waited again nothing came of it i began to feel quite comfortable i began to take an interest in the challenges myself i had not felt any before but it seemed to me that i was accumulating a great and valuable reputation at no expense and my delight in this grew and grew as challenge after challenge was declined until by midnight i was beginning to think that there was nothing in the world so much to be desired as a chance to fight a duel so i hurried daggett up made him keep on sending challenge after challenge oh well i overdid it laird accepted i might have known that that would happenlaird was a man you couldnt depend on  the boys were jubilant beyond expression they helped me make my will which was another discomfortand i already had enough then they took me home i didnt sleep anydidnt want to sleep i had plenty of things to think about and less than four hours to do it inbecause five oclock was the hour appointed for the tragedy and i should have to use up one hourbeginning at fourin practising with the revolver and finding out which end of it to level at the adversary at four we went down into a little gorge about a mile from town and borrowed a barn door for a markborrowed it of a man who was over in california on a visitand we set the barn door up and stood a fencerail up against the middle of it to represent mr laird but the rail was no proper representative of him for he was longer than a rail and thinner nothing would ever fetch him but a line shot and then as like as not he would split the bulletthe worst material for duelling purposes that could be imagined i began on the rail i couldnt hit the rail then i tried the barn door but i couldnt hit the barn door there was nobody in danger except stragglers around on the flanks of that mark i was thoroughly discouraged and i didnt cheer up any when we presently heard pistolshots over in the next little ravine i knew what that wasthat was lairds gang out practising him they would hear my shots and of course they would come up over the ridge to see what kind of a record i was makingsee what their chances were against me well i hadnt any record and i knew that if laird came over that ridge and saw my barn door without a scratch on it he would be as anxious to fight as i wasor as i had been at midnight before that disastrous acceptance came  now just at this moment a little bird no bigger than a sparrow flew along by and lit on a sagebush about thirty yards away steve whipped out his revolver and shot its head off oh he was a marksmanmuch better than i was we ran down there to pick up the bird and just then sure enough mr laird and his people came over the ridge and they joined us and when lairds second saw that bird with its head shot off he lost color he faded and you could see that he was interested he said  who did that  before i could answer steve spoke up and said quite calmly and in a matteroffact way  clemens did it  the second said why that is wonderful how far off was that bird  steve said oh not farabout thirty yards  the second said well that is astonishing shooting how often can he do that  steve said languidly oh about four times out of five  i knew the little rascal was lying but i didnt say anything the second said why that is amazing shooting i supposed he couldnt hit a church  he was supposing very sagaciously but i didnt say anything well they said good morning the second took mr laird home a little tottery on his legs and laird sent back a note in his own hand declining to fight a duel with me on any terms whatever  well my life was savedsaved by that accident i dont know what the bird thought about that interposition of providence but i felt very very comfortable over itsatisfied and content now we found out later that laird had hit his mark four times out of six right along if the duel had come off he would have so filled my skin with bulletholes that it wouldnt have held my principles  by breakfasttime the news was all over town that i had sent a challenge and steve gillis had carried it now that would entitle us to two years apiece in the penitentiary according to the brandnew law judge north sent us no message as coming from himself but a message came from a close friend of his he said it would be a good idea for us to leave the territory by the first stagecoach this would sail next morning at four oclockand in the meantime we would be searched for but not with avidity and if we were in the territory after that stagecoach left we would be the first victims of the new law judge north was anxious to have some objectlessons for that law and he would absolutely keep us in the prison the full two years  well it seemed to me that our society was no longer desirable in nevada so we stayed in our quarters and observed proper caution all dayexcept that once steve went over to the hotel to attend to another customer of mine that was a mr cutler you see laird was not the only person whom i had tried to reform during my occupancy of the editorial chair i had looked around and selected several other people and delivered a new zest of life into them through warm criticism and disapprovalso that when i laid down my editorial pen i had four horsewhippings and two duels owing to me we didnt care for the horsewhippings there was no glory in them they were not worth the trouble of collecting but honor required that some notice should be taken of that other duel mr cutler had come up from carson city and had sent a man over with a challenge from the hotel steve went over to pacify him steve weighed only ninetyfive pounds but it was well known throughout the territory that with his fists he could whip anybody that walked on two legs let his weight and science be what they might steve was a gillis and when a gillis confronted a man and had a proposition to make the proposition always contained business when cutler found that steve was my second he cooled down he became calm and rational and was ready to listen steve gave him fifteen minutes to get out of the hotel and half an hour to get out of town or there would be results so that duel went off successfully because mr cutler immediately left for carson a convinced and reformed man  i have never had anything to do with duels since i thoroughly disapprove of duels i consider them unwise and i know they are dangerous also sinful if a man should challenge me now i would go to that man and take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet retired spot and kill him                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dcvi  january 4 1907   chapters from my autobiographyix  by mark twain   dictated december 13 1906 as regards the coming american monarchy it was before the secretary of state had been heard from that the chairman of the banquet said  in this time of unrest it is of great satisfaction that such a man as you mr root is chief adviser of the president  mr root then got up and in the most quiet and orderly manner touched off the successor to the san francisco earthquake as a result the several state governments were well shaken up and considerably weakened mr root was prophesying he was prophesying and it seems to me that no shrewder and surer forecasting has been done in this country for a good many years  he did not say in so many words that we are proceeding in a steady march toward eventual and unavoidable replacement of the republic by monarchy but i suppose he was aware that that is the case he notes the several steps the customary steps which in all the ages have led to the consolidation of loose and scattered governmental forces into formidable centralizations of authority but he stops there and doesnt add up the sum he is not unaware that heretofore the sum has been ultimate monarchy and that the same figures can fairly be depended upon to furnish the same sum whenever and wherever they can be produced so long as human nature shall remain as it is but it was not needful that he do the adding since any one can do it neither would it have been gracious in him to do it  in observing the changed conditions which in the course of time have made certain and sure the eventual seizure by the washington government of a number of state duties and prerogatives which have been betrayed and neglected by the several states he does not attribute those changes and the vast results which are to flow from them to any thoughtout policy of any party or of any body of dreamers or schemers but properly and rightly attributes them to that stupendous powercircumstance which moves by laws of its own regardless of parties and policies and whose decrees are final and must be obeyed by alland will be the railway is a circumstance the steamship is a circumstance the telegraph is a circumstance they were mere happenings and to the whole world the wise and the foolish alike they were entirely trivial wholly inconsequential indeed silly comical grotesque no man and no party and no thoughtout policy said behold we will build railways and steamships and telegraphs and presently you will see the condition and way of life of every man and woman and child in the nation totally changed unimaginable changes of law and custom will follow in spite of anything that anybody can do to prevent it  the changed conditions have come and circumstance knows what is following and will follow so does mr root his language is not unclear it is crystal        our whole life has swung away from the old state centres and is      crystallizing about national centres         the old barriers which kept the states as separate      communities are completely lost from sight         that state power of regulation and control is gradually      passing into the hands of the national government       sometimes by an assertion of the interstate commerce power      sometimes by an assertion of the taxing power the national      government is taking up the performance of duties which under the      changed conditions the separate states are no longer capable of      adequately performing       we are urging forward in a development of business and social life      which tends more and more to the obliteration of state lines and      the decrease of state power as compared with national power       it is useless for the advocates of state rights to inveigh against       the extension of national authority in the fields of necessary      control where the states themselves fail in the performance of      their duty   he is not announcing a policy he is not forecasting what a party of planners will bring about he is merely telling what the people will require and compel and he could have addedwhich would be perfectly truethat the people will not be moved to it by speculation and cogitation and planning but by circumstancethat power which arbitrarily compels all their actions and over which they have not the slightest control  the end is not yet  it is a true word we are on the march but at present we are only just getting started  if the states continue to fail to do their duty as required by the people    constructions of the constitution will be found to vest the power where it will be exercisedin the national government  i do not know whether that has a sinister meaning or not and so i will not enlarge upon it lest i should chance to be in the wrong it sounds like shipmoney come again but it may not be so intended   human nature being what it is i suppose we must expect to drift into monarchy by and by it is a saddening thought but we cannot change our nature we are all alike we human beings and in our blood and bone and ineradicable we carry the seeds out of which monarchies and aristocracies are grown worship of gauds titles distinctions power we have to worship these things and their possessors we are all born so and we cannot help it we have to be despised by somebody whom we regard as above us or we are not happy we have to have somebody to worship and envy or we cannot be content in america we manifest this in all the ancient and customary ways in public we scoff at titles and hereditary privilege but privately we hanker after them and when we get a chance we buy them for cash and a daughter sometimes we get a good man and worth the price but we are ready to take him anyway whether he be ripe or rotten whether he be clean and decent or merely a basket of noble and sacred and longdescended offal and when we get him the whole nation publicly chaffs and scoffsand privately envies and also is proud of the honor which has been conferred upon us we run over our list of titled purchases every now and then in the newspapers and discuss them and caress them and are thankful and happy  like all the other nations we worship money and the possessors of itthey being our aristocracy and we have to have one we like to read about rich people in the papers the papers know it and they do their best to keep this appetite liberally fed they even leave out a football bullfight now and then to get room for all the particulars of howaccording to the display headingrich woman fell down cellarnot hurt the falling down the cellar is of no interest to us when the woman is not rich but no rich woman can fall down cellar and we not yearn to know all about it and wish it was us  in a monarchy the people willingly and rejoicingly revere and take pride in their nobilities and are not humiliated by the reflection that this humble and hearty homage gets no return but contempt contempt does not shame them they are used to it and they recognize that it is their proper due we are all made like that in europe we easily and quickly learn to take that attitude toward the sovereigns and the aristocracies moreover it has been observed that when we get the attitude we go on and exaggerate it presently becoming more servile than the natives and vainer of it the next step is to rail and scoff at republics and democracies all of which is natural for we have not ceased to be human beings by becoming americans and the human race was always intended to be governed by kingship not by popular vote  i suppose we must expect that unavoidable and irresistible circumstances will gradually take away the powers of the states and concentrate them in the central government and that the republic will then repeat the history of all time and become a monarchy but i believe that if we obstruct these encroachments and steadily resist them the monarchy can be postponed for a good while yet  sidenote 184951  dictated december 1 1906 an exciting event in our village hannibal was the arrival of the mesmerizer i think the year was 1850 as to that i am not sure but i know the monthit was may that detail has survived the wear of fiftyfive years a pair of connected little incidents of that month have served to keep the memory of it green for me all this time incidents of no consequence and not worth embalming yet my memory has preserved them carefully and flung away things of real value to give them space and make them comfortable the truth is a persons memory has no more sense than his conscience and no appreciation whatever of values and proportions however never mind those trifling incidents my subject is the mesmerizer now  he advertised his show and promised marvels admission as usual 25 cents children and negroes half price the village had heard of mesmerism in a general way but had not encountered it yet not many people attended the first night but next day they had so many wonders to tell that everybodys curiosity was fired and after that for a fortnight the magician had prosperous times i was fourteen or fifteen years oldthe age at which a boy is willing to endure all things suffer all things short of death by fire if thereby he may be conspicuous and show off before the public and so when i saw the subjects perform their foolish antics on the platform and make the people laugh and shout and admire i had a burning desire to be a subject myself every night for three nights i sat in the row of candidates on the platform and held the magic disk in the palm of my hand and gazed at it and tried to get sleepy but it was a failure i remained wide awake and had to retire defeated like the majority also i had to sit there and be gnawed with envy of hicks our journeyman i had to sit there and see him scamper and jump when simmons the enchanter exclaimed see the snake see the snake and hear him say my how beautiful in response to the suggestion that he was observing a splendid sunset and so onthe whole insane business i couldnt laugh i couldnt applaud it filled me with bitterness to have others do it and to have people make a hero of hicks and crowd around him when the show was over and ask him for more and more particulars of the wonders he had seen in his visions and manifest in many ways that they were proud to be acquainted with him hicksthe idea i couldnt stand it i was getting boiled to death in my own bile  on the fourth night temptation came and i was not strong enough to resist when i had gazed at the disk awhile i pretended to be sleepy and began to nod straightway came the professor and made passes over my head and down my body and legs and arms finishing each pass with a snap of his fingers in the air to discharge the surplus electricity then he began to draw me with the disk holding it in his fingers and telling me i could not take my eyes off it try as i might so i rose slowly bent and gazing and followed that disk all over the place just as i had seen the others do then i was put through the other paces upon suggestion i fled from snakes passed buckets at a fire became excited over hot steamboatraces made love to imaginary girls and kissed them fished from the platform and landed mudcats that outweighed meand so on all the customary marvels but not in the customary way i was cautious at first and watchful being afraid the professor would discover that i was an impostor and drive me from the platform in disgrace but as soon as i realized that i was not in danger i set myself the task of terminating hickss usefulness as a subject and of usurping his place  it was a sufficiently easy task hicks was born honest i without that incumbranceso some people said hicks saw what he saw and reported accordingly i saw more than was visible and added to it such details as could help hicks had no imagination i had a double supply he was born calm i was born excited no vision could start a rapture in him and he was constipated as to language anyway but if i saw a vision i emptied the dictionary onto it and lost the remnant of my mind into the bargain  at the end of my first halfhour hicks was a thing of the past a fallen hero a broken idol and i knew it and was glad and said in my heart success to crime hicks could never have been mesmerized to the point where he could kiss an imaginary girl in public or a real one either but i was competent whatever hicks had failed in i made it a point to succeed in let the cost be what it might physically or morally he had shown several bad defects and i had made a note of them for instance if the magician asked what do you see and left him to invent a vision for himself hicks was dumb and blind he couldnt see a thing nor say a word whereas the magician soon found that when it came to seeing visions of a stunning and marketable sort i could get along better without his help than with it then there was another thing hicks wasnt worth a tallow dip on mute mental suggestion whenever simmons stood behind him and gazed at the back of his skull and tried to drive a mental suggestion into it hicks sat with vacant face and never suspected if he had been noticing he could have seen by the rapt faces of the audience that something was going on behind his back that required a response inasmuch as i was an impostor i dreaded to have this test put upon me for i knew the professor would be willing me to do something and as i couldnt know what it was i should be exposed and denounced however when my time came i took my chance i perceived by the tense and expectant faces of the people that simmons was behind me willing me with all his might i tried my best to imagine what he wanted but nothing suggested itself i felt ashamed and miserable then i believed that the hour of my disgrace was come and that in another moment i should go out of that place disgraced i ought to be ashamed to confess it but my next thought was not how i could win the compassion of kindly hearts by going out humbly and in sorrow for my misdoings but how i could go out most sensationally and spectacularly  there was a rusty and empty old revolver lying on the table among the properties employed in the performances on mayday two or three weeks before there had been a celebration by the schools and i had had a quarrel with a big boy who was the schoolbully and i had not come out of it with credit that boy was now seated in the middle of the house halfway down the main aisle i crept stealthily and impressively toward the table with a dark and murderous scowl on my face copied from a popular romance seized the revolver suddenly flourished it shouted the bullys name jumped off the platform and made a rush for him and chased him out of the house before the paralyzed people could interfere to save him there was a storm of applause and the magician addressing the house said most impressively  that you may know how really remarkable this is and how wonderfully developed a subject we have in this boy i assure you that without a single spoken word to guide him he has carried out what i mentally commanded him to do to the minutest detail i could have stopped him at a moment in his vengeful career by a mere exertion of my will therefore the poor fellow who has escaped was at no time in danger  so i was not in disgrace i returned to the platform a hero and happier than i have ever been in this world since as regards mental suggestion my fears of it were gone i judged that in case i failed to guess what the professor might be willing me to do i could count on putting up something that would answer just as well i was right and exhibitions of unspoken suggestion became a favorite with the public whenever i perceived that i was being willed to do something i got up and did somethinganything that occurred to meand the magician not being a fool always ratified it when people asked me how can you tell what he is willing you to do i said its just as easy and they always said admiringly well it beats me how you can do it  hicks was weak in another detail when the professor made passes over him and said his whole body is without sensation nowcome forward and test him ladies and gentlemen the ladies and gentlemen always complied eagerly and stuck pins into hicks and if they went deep hicks was sure to wince then that poor professor would have to explain that hicks wasnt sufficiently under the influence but i didnt wince i only suffered and shed tears on the inside the miseries that a conceited boy will endure to keep up his reputation and so will a conceited man i know it in my own person and have seen it in a hundred thousand others that professor ought to have protected me and i often hoped he would when the tests were unusually severe but he didnt it may be that he was deceived as well as the others though i did not believe it nor think it possible those were dear good people but they must have carried simplicity and credulity to the limit they would stick a pin in my arm and bear on it until they drove it a third of its length in and then be lost in wonder that by a mere exercise of willpower the professor could turn my arm to iron and make it insensible to pain whereas it was not insensible at all i was suffering agonies of pain  after that fourth night that proud night that triumphant night i was the only subject simmons invited no more candidates to the platform i performed alone every night the rest of the fortnight in the beginning of the second week i conquered the last doubters up to that time a dozen wise old heads the intellectual aristocracy of the town had held out as implacable unbelievers i was as hurt by this as if i were engaged in some honest occupation there is nothing surprising about this human beings feel dishonor the most sometimes when they most deserve it that handful of overwise old gentlemen kept on shaking their heads all the first week and saying they had seen no marvels there that could not have been produced by collusion and they were pretty vain of their unbelief too and liked to show it and air it and be superior to the ignorant and the gullible particularly old dr peake who was the ringleader of the irreconcilables and very formidable for he was an ffv he was learned whitehaired and venerable nobly and richly clad in the fashions of an earlier and a courtlier day he was large and stately and he not only seemed wise but was what he seemed in that regard he had great influence and his opinion upon any matter was worth much more than that of any other person in the community when i conquered him at last i knew i was undisputed master of the field and now after more than fifty years i acknowledge with a few dry old tears that i rejoiced without shame   sidenote 1847  dictated december 2 1906 in 1847 we were living in a large white house on the corner of hill and main streetsa house that still stands but isnt large now although it hasnt lost a plank i saw it a year ago and noticed that shrinkage my father died in it in march of the year mentioned but our family did not move out of it until some months afterward ours was not the only family in the house there was anotherdr grants one day dr grant and dr reyburn argued a matter on the street with swordcanes and grant was brought home multifariously punctured old dr peake calked the leaks and came every day for a while to look after him the grants were virginians like peake and one day when grant was getting well enough to be on his feet and sit around in the parlor and talk the conversation fell upon virginia and old times i was present but the group were probably quite unconscious of me i being only a lad and a negligible quantity two of the groupdr peake and mrs crawford mrs grants motherhad been of the audience when the richmond theatre burned down thirtysix years before and they talked over the frightful details of that memorable tragedy these were eyewitnesses and with their eyes i saw it all with an intolerable vividness i saw the black smoke rolling and tumbling toward the sky i saw the flames burst through it and turn red i heard the shrieks of the despairing i glimpsed their faces at the windows caught fitfully through the veiling smoke i saw them jump to their death or to mutilation worse than death the picture is before me yet and can never fade  in due course they talked of the colonial mansion of the peakes with its stately columns and its spacious grounds and by odds and ends i picked up a clearly defined idea of the place i was strongly interested for i had not before heard of such palatial things from the lips of people who had seen them with their own eyes one detail casually dropped hit my imagination hard in the wall by the great front door there was a round hole as big as a saucera british cannonball had made it in the war of the revolution it was breathtaking it made history real history had never been real to me before  very well three or four years later as already mentioned i was kingbee and sole subject in the mesmeric show it was the beginning of the second week the performance was half over just then the majestic dr peake with his ruffled bosom and wristbands and his goldheaded cane entered and a deferential citizen vacated his seat beside the grants and made the great chief take it this happened while i was trying to invent something fresh in the way of a vision in response to the professors remark  concentrate your powers looklook attentively theredont you see something concentrateconcentrate now thendescribe it  without suspecting it dr peake by entering the place had reminded me of the talk of three years before he had also furnished me capital and was become my confederate an accomplice in my frauds i began on a vision a vague and dim one that was part of the game at the beginning of a vision it isnt best to see it too clearly at first it might look as if you had come loaded with it the vision developed by degrees and gathered swing momentum energy it was the richmond fire dr peake was cold at first and his fine face had a trace of polite scorn in it but when he began to recognize that fire that expression changed and his eyes began to light up as soon as i saw that i threw the valves wide open and turned on all the steam and gave those people a supper of fire and horrors that was calculated to last them one while they couldnt gasp when i got throughthey were petrified dr peake had risen and was standingand breathing hard he said in a great voice  my doubts are ended no collusion could produce that miracle it was totally impossible for him to know those details yet he has described them with the clarity of an eyewitnessand with what unassailable truthfulness god knows i know  i saved the colonial mansion for the last night and solidified and perpetuated dr peakes conversion with the cannonball hole he explained to the house that i could never have heard of that small detail which differentiated this mansion from all other virginian mansions and perfectly identified it therefore the fact stood proven that i had seen it in my vision lawks  it is curious when the magicians engagement closed there was but one person in the village who did not believe in mesmerism and i was the one all the others were converted but i was to remain an implacable and unpersuadable disbeliever in mesmerism and hypnotism for close upon fifty years this was because i never would examine them in after life i couldnt the subject revolted me perhaps because it brought back to me a passage in my life which for prides sake i wished to forget though i thoughtor persuaded myself i thoughti should never come across a proof which wasnt thin and cheap and probably had a fraud like me behind it  the truth is i did not have to wait long to get tired of my triumphs not thirty days i think the glory which is built upon a lie soon becomes a most unpleasant incumbrance no doubt for a while i enjoyed having my exploits told and retold and told again in my presence and wondered over and exclaimed about but i quite distinctly remember that there presently came a time when the subject was wearisome and odious to me and i could not endure the disgusting discomfort of it i am well aware that the worldglorified doer of a deed of great and real splendor has just my experience i know that he deliciously enjoys hearing about it for three or four weeks and that pretty soon after that he begins to dread the mention of it and by and by wishes he had been with the damned before he ever thought of doing that deed i remember how general sherman used to rage and swear over when we were marching through georgia which was played at him and sung at him everywhere he went still i think i suffered a shade more than the legitimate hero does he being privileged to soften his misery with the reflection that his glory was at any rate golden and reproachless in its origin whereas i had no such privilege there being no possible way to make mine respectable  how easy it is to make people believe a lie and how hard it is to undo that work again thirtyfive years after those evil exploits of mine i visited my old mother whom i had not seen for ten years and being moved by what seemed to me a rather noble and perhaps heroic impulse i thought i would humble myself and confess my ancient fault it cost me a great effort to make up my mind i dreaded the sorrow that would rise in her face and the shame that would look out of her eyes but after long and troubled reflection the sacrifice seemed due and right and i gathered my resolution together and made the confession  to my astonishment there were no sentimentalities no dramatics no george washington effects she was not moved in the least degree she simply did not believe me and said so i was not merely disappointed i was nettled to have my costly truthfulness flung out of the market in this placid and confident way when i was expecting to get a profit out of it i asserted and reasserted with rising heat my statement that every single thing i had done on those longvanished nights was a lie and a swindle and when she shook her head tranquilly and said she knew better i put up my hand and swore to itadding a triumphant now what do you say  it did not affect her at all it did not budge her the fraction of an inch from her position if this was hard for me to endure it did not begin with the blister she put upon the raw when she began to put my sworn oath out of court with arguments to prove that i was under a delusion and did not know what i was talking about arguments arguments to show that a person on a mans outside can know better what is on his inside than he does himself i had cherished some contempt for arguments before i have not enlarged my respect for them since she refused to believe that i had invented my visions myself she said it was folly that i was only a child at the time and could not have done it she cited the richmond fire and the colonial mansion and said they were quite beyond my capacities then i saw my chance i said she was righti didnt invent those i got them from dr peake even this great shot did no damage she said dr peakes evidence was better than mine and he had said in plain words that it was impossible for me to have heard about those things dear dear what a grotesque and unthinkable situation a confessed swindler convicted of honesty and condemned to acquittal by circumstantial evidence furnished by the swindled  i realised with shame and with impotent vexation that i was defeated all along the line i had but one card left but it was a formidable one i played itand stood from under it seemed ignoble to demolish her fortress after she had defended it so valiantly but the defeated know not mercy i played that matter card it was the pinsticking i said solemnly  i give you my honor a pin was never stuck into me without causing me cruel pain  she only said  it is thirtyfive years i believe you do think that now but i was there and i know better you never winced  she was so calm and i was so far from it so nearly frantic  oh my goodness i said let me show you that i am speaking the truth here is my arm drive a pin into itdrive it to the headi shall not wince  she only shook her gray head and said with simplicity and conviction  you are a man now and could dissemble the hurt but you were only a child then and could not have done it  and so the lie which i played upon her in my youth remained with her as an unchallengeable truth to the day of her death carlyle said a lie cannot live it shows that he did not know how to tell them if i had taken out a life policy on this one the premiums would have bankrupted me ages ago                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dcvii  january 18 1907   chapters from my autobiographyx  by mark twain   sidenote 1825  sidenote 1837  dictated march 28 1906 orion clemens was born in jamestown fentress county tennessee in 1825 he was the familys firstborn and antedated me ten years between him and me came a sister margaret who died aged ten in 1837 in that village of florida missouri where i was born and pamela mother of samuel e moffett who was an invalid all her life and died in the neighborhood of new york a year ago aged about seventyfive her character was without blemish and she was of a most kindly and gentle disposition also there was a brother benjamin who died in 1848 aged ten or twelve  sidenote 1843  orions boyhood was spent in that wee little log hamlet of jamestown up there among the knobsso calledof east tennessee the family migrated to florida missouri then moved to hannibal missouri when orion was twelve and a half years old when he was fifteen or sixteen he was sent to st louis and there he learned the printers trade one of his characteristics was eagerness he woke with an eagerness about some matter or other every morning it consumed him all day it perished in the night and he was on fire with a fresh new interest next morning before he could get his clothes on he exploited in this way three hundred and sixtyfive redhot new eagernesses every year of his life but i am forgetting another characteristic a very pronounced one that was his deep glooms his despondencies his despairs these had their place in each and every day along with the eagernesses thus his day was dividedno not divided mottledfrom sunrise to midnight with alternating brilliant sunshine and black cloud every day he was the most joyous and hopeful man that ever was i think and also every day he was the most miserable man that ever was  while he was in his apprenticeship in st louis he got well acquainted with edward bates who was afterwards in mr lincolns first cabinet bates was a very fine man an honorable and upright man and a distinguished lawyer he patiently allowed orion to bring to him each new project he discussed it with him and extinguished it by argument and irresistible logicat first but after a few weeks he found that this labor was not necessary that he could leave the new project alone and it would extinguish itself the same night orion thought he would like to become a lawyer mr bates encouraged him and he studied law nearly a week then of course laid it aside to try something new he wanted to become an orator mr bates gave him lessons mr bates walked the floor reading from an english book aloud and rapidly turning the english into french and he recommended this exercise to orion but as orion knew no french he took up that study and wrought at it like a volcano for two or three days then gave it up during his apprenticeship in st louis he joined a number of churches one after another and taught in their sundayschoolschanging his sundayschool every time he changed his religion he was correspondingly erratic in his politicswhig today democrat next week and anything fresh that he could find in the political market the week after i may remark here that throughout his long life he was always trading religions and enjoying the change of scenery i will also remark that his sincerity was never doubted his truthfulness was never doubted and in matters of business and money his honesty was never questioned notwithstanding his foreverrecurring caprices and changes his principles were high always high and absolutely unshakable he was the strangest compound that ever got mixed in a human mould such a person as that is given to acting upon impulse and without reflection that was orions way everything he did he did with conviction and enthusiasm and with a vainglorious pride in the thing he was doingand no matter what that thing was whether good bad or indifferent he repented of it every time in sackcloth and ashes before twentyfour hours had sped pessimists are born not made optimists are born not made but i think he was the only person i have ever known in whom pessimism and optimism were lodged in exactly equal proportions except in the matter of grounded principle he was as unstable as water you could dash his spirits with a single word you could raise them into the sky again with another one you could break his heart with a word of disapproval you could make him as happy as an angel with a word of approval and there was no occasion to put any sense or any vestige of mentality of any kind into these miracles anything you might say would answer  he had another conspicuous characteristic and it was the father of those which i have just spoken of this was an intense lust for approval he was so eager to be approved so girlishly anxious to be approved by anybody and everybody without discrimination that he was commonly ready to forsake his notions opinions and convictions at a moments notice in order to get the approval of any person who disagreed with them i wish to be understood as reserving his fundamental principles all the time he never forsook those to please anybody born and reared among slaves and slaveholders he was yet an abolitionist from his boyhood to his death he was always truthful he was always sincere he was always honest and honorable but in light mattersmatters of small consequence like religion and politics and such thingshe never acquired a conviction that could survive a disapproving remark from a cat  he was always dreaming he was a dreamer from birth and this characteristic got him into trouble now and then  once when he was twentythree or twentyfour years old and was become a journeyman he conceived the romantic idea of coming to hannibal without giving us notice in order that he might furnish to the family a pleasant surprise if he had given notice he would have been informed that we had changed our residence and that that gruff old bassvoiced sailorman dr g our family physician was living in the house which we had formerly occupied and that orions former room in that house was now occupied by dr gs two middleaged maiden sisters orion arrived at hannibal per steamboat in the middle of the night and started with his customary eagerness on his excursion his mind all on fire with his romantic project and building and enjoying his surprise in advance he was always enjoying things in advance it was the make of him he never could wait for the event but must build it out of dreamstuff and enjoy it beforehandconsequently sometimes when the event happened he saw that it was not as good as the one he had invented in his imagination and so he had lost profit by not keeping the imaginary one and letting the reality go  when he arrived at the house he went around to the back door and slipped off his boots and crept upstairs and arrived at the room of those elderly ladies without having wakened any sleepers he undressed in the dark and got into bed and snuggled up against somebody he was a little surprised but not muchfor he thought it was our brother ben it was winter and the bed was comfortable and the supposed ben added to the comfortand so he was dropping off to sleep very well satisfied with his progress so far and full of happy dreams of what was going to happen in the morning but something else was going to happen sooner than that and it happened now the maid that was being crowded fumed and fretted and struggled and presently came to a halfwaking condition and protested against the crowding that voice paralyzed orion he couldnt move a limb he couldnt get his breath and the crowded one discovered his new whiskers and began to scream this removed the paralysis and orion was out of bed and clawing round in the dark for his clothes in a fraction of a second both maids began to scream then so orion did not wait to get his whole wardrobe he started with such parts of it as he could grab he flew to the head of the stairs and started down and was paralyzed again at that point because he saw the faint yellow flame of a candle soaring up the stairs from below and he judged that dr g was behind it and he was he had no clothes on to speak of but no matter he was well enough fixed for an occasion like this because he had a butcherknife in his hand orion shouted to him and this saved his life for the doctor recognized his voice then in those deepseagoing bass tones of his that i used to admire so much when i was a little boy he explained to orion the change that had been made told him where to find the clemens family and closed with some quite unnecessary advice about posting himself before he undertook another adventure like thatadvice which orion probably never needed again as long as he lived  one bitter december night orion sat up reading until three oclock in the morning and then without looking at a clock sallied forth to call on a young lady he hammered and hammered at the door couldnt get any response didnt understand it anybody else would have regarded that as an indication of some kind or other and would have drawn inferences and gone home but orion didnt draw inferences he merely hammered and hammered and finally the father of the girl appeared at the door in a dressinggown he had a candle in his hand and the dressinggown was all the clothing he had onexcept an expression of unwelcome which was so thick and so large that it extended all down his front to his instep and nearly obliterated the dressinggown but orion didnt notice that this was an unpleasant expression he merely walked in the old gentleman took him into the parlor set the candle on a table and stood orion made the usual remarks about the weather and sat downsat down and talked and talked and went on talkingthat old man looking at him vindictively and waiting for his chancewaiting treacherously and malignantly for his chance orion had not asked for the young lady it was not customary it was understood that a young fellow came to see the girl of the house not the founder of it at last orion got up and made some remark to the effect that probably the young lady was busy and he would go now and call again that was the old mans chance and he said with fervency why good land arent you going to stop to breakfast   orion did not come to hannibal until two or three years after my fathers death meantime he remained in st louis he was a journeyman printer and earning wages out of his wage he supported my mother and my brother henry who was two years younger than i my sister pamela helped in this support by taking piano pupils thus we got along but it was pretty hard sledding i was not one of the burdens because i was taken from school at once upon my fathers death and placed in the office of the hannibal courier as printers apprentice and mr s the editor and proprietor of the paper allowed me the usual emolument of the office of apprenticethat is to say board and clothes but no money the clothes consisted of two suits a year but one of the suits always failed to materialize and the other suit was not purchased so long as mr ss old clothes held out i was only about half as big as mr s consequently his shirts gave me the uncomfortable sense of living in a circus tent and i had to turn up his pants to my ears to make them short enough  there were two other apprentices one was steve wilkins seventeen or eighteen years old and a giant when he was in mr ss clothes they fitted him as the candlemould fits the candlethus he was generally in a suffocated condition particularly in the summertime he was a reckless hilarious admirable creature he had no principles and was delightful company at first we three apprentices had to feed in the kitchen with the old slave cook and her very handsome and bright and wellbehaved young mulatto daughter for his own amusementfor he was not generally laboring for other peoples amusementsteve was constantly and persistently and loudly and elaborately making love to that mulatto girl and distressing the life out of her and worrying the old mother to death she would say now marse steve marse steve cant you behave yourself with encouragement like that steve would naturally renew his attentions and emphasize them it was killingly funny to ralph and me and to speak truly the old mothers distress about it was merely a pretence she quite well understood that by the customs of slaveholding communities it was steves right to make love to that girl if he wanted to but the girls distress was very real she had a refined nature and she took all steves extravagant lovemaking in resentful earnest  we got but little variety in the way of food at that kitchen table and there wasnt enough of it anyway so we apprentices used to keep alive by arts of our ownthat is to say we crept into the cellar nearly every night by a private entrance which we had discovered and we robbed the cellar of potatoes and onions and such things and carried them downtown to the printingoffice where we slept on pallets on the floor and cooked them at the stove and had very good times  as i have indicated mr ss economies were of a pretty close and rigid kind by and by when we apprentices were promoted from the basement to the ground floor and allowed to sit at the family table along with the one journeyman harry h the economies continued mrs s was a bride she had attained to that distinction very recently after waiting a good part of a lifetime for it and she was the right woman in the right place according to the economics of the place for she did not trust the sugarbowl to us but sweetened our coffee herself that is she went through the motions she didnt really sweeten it she seemed to put one heaping teaspoonful of brown sugar into each cup but according to steve that was a deceit he said she dipped the spoon in the coffee first to make the sugar stick and then scooped the sugar out of the bowl with the spoon upside down so that the effect to the eye was a heapedup spoon whereas the sugar on it was nothing but a layer this all seems perfectly true to me and yet that thing would be so difficult to perform that i suppose it really didnt happen but was one of steves lies                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dcviii  february 1 1907   chapters from my autobiographyxi  by mark twain   sidenote 1850  dictated march 28th 1906 about 1849 or 1850 orion severed his connection with the printinghouse in st louis and came up to hannibal and bought a weekly paper called the hannibal journal together with its plant and its goodwill for the sum of five hundred dollars cash he borrowed the cash at ten per cent interest from an old farmer named johnson who lived five miles out of town then he reduced the subscription price of the paper from two dollars to one dollar he reduced the rates for advertising in about the same proportion and thus he created one absolute and unassailable certaintyto wit that the business would never pay him a single cent of profit he took me out of the courier office and engaged my services in his own at three dollars and a half a week which was an extravagant wage but orion was always generous always liberal with everybody except himself it cost him nothing in my case for he never was able to pay me a penny as long as i was with him by the end of the first year he found he must make some economies the office rent was cheap but it was not cheap enough he could not afford to pay rent of any kind so he moved the whole plant into the house we lived in and it cramped the dwellingplace cruelly he kept that paper alive during four years but i have at this time no idea how he accomplished it toward the end of each year he had to turn out and scrape and scratch for the fifty dollars of interest due mr johnson and that fifty dollars was about the only cash he ever received or paid out i suppose while he was proprietor of that newspaper except for ink and printingpaper the paper was a dead failure it had to be that from the start finally he handed it over to mr johnson and went up to muscatine iowa and acquired a small interest in a weekly newspaper there it was not a sort of property to marry onbut no matter he came across a winning and pretty girl who lived in quincy illinois a few miles below keokuk and they became engaged he was always falling in love with girls but by some accident or other he had never gone so far as engagement before and now he achieved nothing but misfortune by it because he straightway fell in love with a keokuk girl he married the keokuk girl and they began a struggle for life which turned out to be a difficult enterprise and very unpromising  to gain a living in muscatine was plainly impossible so orion and his new wife went to keokuk to live for she wanted to be near her relatives he bought a little bit of a jobprinting planton credit of courseand at once put prices down to where not even the apprentices could get a living out of it and this sort of thing went on  sidenote 1853  i had not joined the muscatine migration just before that happened which i think was in 1853 i disappeared one night and fled to st louis there i worked in the composingroom of the evening news for a time and then started on my travels to see the world the world was new york city and there was a little worlds fair there it had just been opened where the great reservoir afterward was and where the sumptuous public library is now being builtfifth avenue and fortysecond street i arrived in new york with two or three dollars in pocket change and a tendollar bankbill concealed in the lining of my coat i got work at villainous wages in the establishment of john a gray and green in cliff street and i found board in a sufficiently villainous mechanics boardinghouse in duane street the firm paid my wages in wildcat money at its face value and my weeks wage merely sufficed to pay board and lodging by and by i went to philadelphia and worked there some months as a sub on the inquirer and the public ledger finally i made a flying trip to washington to see the sights there and in 1854 i went back to the mississippi valley sitting upright in the smokingcar two or three days and nights when i reached st louis i was exhausted i went to bed on board a steamboat that was bound for muscatine i fell asleep at once with my clothes on and didnt wake again for thirtysix hours  sidenote 1854   i worked in that little joboffice in keokuk as much as two years i should say without ever collecting a cent of wages for orion was never able to pay anythingbut dick higham and i had good times i dont know what dick got but it was probably only uncashable promises  sidenote 1856  one day in the midwinter of 1856 or 1857i think it was 1856i was coming along the main street of keokuk in the middle of the forenoon it was bitter weatherso bitter that that street was deserted almost a light dry snow was blowing here and there on the ground and on the pavement swirling this way and that way and making all sorts of beautiful figures but very chilly to look at the wind blew a piece of paper past me and it lodged against a wall of a house something about the look of it attracted my attention and i gathered it in it was a fiftydollar bill the only one i had ever seen and the largest assemblage of money i had ever encountered in one spot i advertised it in the papers and suffered more than a thousand dollars worth of solicitude and fear and distress during the next few days lest the owner should see the advertisement and come and take my fortune away as many as four days went by without an applicant then i could endure this kind of misery no longer i felt sure that another four could not go by in this safe and secure way i felt that i must take that money out of danger so i bought a ticket for cincinnati and went to that city i worked there several months in the printingoffice of wrightson and company i had been reading lieutenant herndons account of his explorations of the amazon and had been mightily attracted by what he said of coca i made up my mind that i would go to the head waters of the amazon and collect coca and trade in it and make a fortune i left for new orleans in the steamer paul jones with this great idea filling my mind one of the pilots of that boat was horace bixby little by little i got acquainted with him and pretty soon i was doing a lot of steering for him in his daylight watches when i got to new orleans i inquired about ships leaving for pará and discovered that there werent any and learned that there probably wouldnt be any during that century it had not occurred to me to inquire about those particulars before leaving cincinnati so there i was i couldnt get to the amazon i had no friends in new orleans and no money to speak of i went to horace bixby and asked him to make a pilot out of me he said he would do it for a hundred dollars cash in advance so i steered for him up to st louis borrowed the money from my brotherinlaw and closed the bargain i had acquired this brotherinlaw several years before this was mr william a moffett a merchant a virginiana fine man in every way he had married my sister pamela and the samuel e moffett of whom i have been speaking was their son within eighteen months i became a competent pilot and i served that office until the mississippi river traffic was brought to a standstill by the breaking out of the civil war   meantime orion had gone down the river and established his little jobprintingoffice in keokuk on account of charging next to nothing for the work done in his joboffice he had almost nothing to do there he was never able to comprehend that work done on a profitless basis deteriorates and is presently not worth anything and that customers are then obliged to go where they can get better work even if they must pay better prices for it he had plenty of time and he took up blackstone again he also put up a sign which offered his services to the public as a lawyer he never got a case in those days nor even an applicant although he was quite willing to transact law business for nothing and furnish the stationery himself he was always liberal that way  sidenote 1861  presently he moved to a wee little hamlet called alexandria two or three miles down the river and he put up that sign there he got no custom he was by this time very hard aground but by this time i was beginning to earn a wage of two hundred and fifty dollars a month as pilot and so i supported him thenceforth until 1861 when his ancient friend edward bates then a member of mr lincolns first cabinet got him the place of secretary of the new territory of nevada and orion and i cleared for that country in the overland stagecoach i paying the fares which were pretty heavy and carrying with me what money i had been able to savethis was eight hundred dollars i should sayand it was all in silver coin and a good deal of a nuisance because of its weight and we had another nuisance which was an unabridged dictionary it weighed about a thousand pounds and was a ruinous expense because the stagecoach company charged for extra baggage by the ounce we could have kept a family for a time on what that dictionary cost in the way of extra freightand it wasnt a good dictionary anywaydidnt have any modern words in itonly had obsolete ones that they used to use when noah webster was a child  the government of the new territory of nevada was an interesting menagerie governor nye was an old and seasoned politician from new yorkpolitician not statesman he had white hair he was in fine physical condition he had a winningly friendly face and deep lustrous brown eyes that could talk as a native language the tongue of every feeling every passion every emotion his eyes could outtalk his tongue and this is saying a good deal for he was a very remarkable talker both in private and on the stump he was a shrewd man he generally saw through surfaces and perceived what was going on inside without being suspected of having an eye on the matter  when grownup persons indulge in practical jokes the fact gauges them they have lived narrow obscure and ignorant lives and at full manhood they still retain and cherish a joblot of leftover standards and ideals that would have been discarded with their boyhood if they had then moved out into the world and a broader life there were many practical jokers in the new territory i do not take pleasure in exposing this fact for i liked those people but what i am saying is true i wish i could say a kindlier thing about them insteadthat they were burglars or hatrack thieves or something like that that wouldnt be utterly uncomplimentary i would prefer it but i cant say those things they would not be true these people were practical jokers and i will not try to disguise it in other respects they were plenty goodenough people honest people reputable and likable they played practical jokes upon each other with success and got the admiration and applause and also the envy of the rest of the community naturally they were eager to try their arts on big game and that was what the governor was but they were not able to score they made several efforts but the governor defeated these efforts without any trouble and went on smiling his pleasant smile as if nothing had happened finally the joker chiefs of carson city and virginia city conspired together to see if their combined talent couldnt win a victory for the jokers were getting into a very uncomfortable place the people were laughing at them instead of at their proposed victim they banded themselves together to the number of ten and invited the governor to what was a most extraordinary attention in those dayspickled oyster stew and champagneluxuries very seldom seen in that region and existing rather as fabrics of the imagination than as facts  the governor took me with him he said disparagingly  its a poor invention it doesnt deceive their idea is to get me drunk and leave me under the table and from their standpoint this will be very funny but they dont know me i am familiar with champagne and have no prejudices against it  the fate of the joke was not decided until two oclock in the morning at that hour the governor was serene genial comfortable contented happy and sober although he was so full that he couldnt laugh without shedding champagne tears also at that hour the last joker joined his comrades under the table drunk to the last perfection the governor remarked  this is a dry place sam lets go and get something to drink and go to bed  the governors official menagerie had been drawn from the humblest ranks of his constituents at homeharmless good fellows who had helped in his campaigns and now they had their reward in petty salaries payable in greenbacks that were worth next to nothing those boys had a hard time to make both ends meet orions salary was eighteen hundred dollars a year and he wouldnt even support his dictionary on it but the irishwoman who had come out on the governors staff charged the menagerie only ten dollars a week apiece for board and lodging orion and i were of her boarders and lodgers and so on these cheap terms the silver i had brought from home held out very well  sidenote 62 or 63  at first i roamed about the country seeking silver but at the end of 62 or the beginning of 63 when i came up from aurora to begin a journalistic life on the virginia city enterprise i was presently sent down to carson city to report the legislative session orion was soon very popular with the members of the legislature because they found that whereas they couldnt usually trust each other nor anybody else they could trust him he easily held the belt for honesty in that country but it didnt do him any good in a pecuniary way because he had no talent for either persuading or scaring legislators but i was differently situated i was there every day in the legislature to distribute compliment and censure with evenly balanced justice and spread the same over half a page of the enterprise every morning consequently i was an influence i got the legislature to pass a wise and very necessary law requiring every corporation doing business in the territory to record its charter in full without skipping a word in a record to be kept by the secretary of the territorymy brother all the charters were framed in exactly the same words for this recordservice he was authorized to charge forty cents a folio of one hundred words for making the record also five dollars for furnishing a certificate of each record and so on everybody had a tollroad franchise but no tollroad but the franchise had to be recorded and paid for everybody was a mining corporation and had to have himself recorded and pay for it very well we prospered the recordservice paid an average of a thousand dollars a month in gold  governor nye was often absent from the territory he liked to run down to san francisco every little while and enjoy a rest from territorial civilization nobody complained for he was prodigiously popular he had been a stagedriver in his early days in new york or new england and had acquired the habit of remembering names and faces and of making himself agreeable to his passengers as a politician this had been valuable to him and he kept his arts in good condition by practice by the time he had been governor a year he had shaken hands with every human being in the territory of nevada and after that he always knew these people instantly at sight and could call them by name the whole population of 20000 persons were his personal friends and he could do anything he chose to do and count upon their being contented with it whenever he was absent from the territorywhich was generallyorion served his office in his place as acting governor a title which was soon and easily shortened to governor he recklessly built and furnished a house at a cost of twelve thousand dollars and there was no other house in the sagebrush capital that could approach this property for style and cost  when governor nyes fouryear term was drawing to a close the mystery of why he had ever consented to leave the great state of new york and help inhabit that jackrabbit desert was solved he had gone out there in order to become a united states senator all that was now necessary was to turn the territory into a state he did it without any difficulty that undeveloped country and that sparse population were not well fitted for the heavy burden of a state government but no matter the people were willing to have the change and so the governors game was made  orions game was made too apparently for he was as popular because of his honesty as the governor was for more substantial reasons but at the critical moment the inborn capriciousness of his character rose up without warning and disaster followed                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dcix  february 15 1907   chapters from my autobiographyxii  by mark twain   sidenote 18645  orion clemensresumed  dictated april 5 1906 there were several candidates for all the offices in the gift of the new state of nevada save twounited states senator and secretary of state nye was certain to get a senatorship and orion was so sure to get the secretaryship that no one but him was named for that office but he was hit with one of his spasms of virtue on the very day that the republican party was to make its nominations in the convention and refused to go near the convention he was urged but all persuasions failed he said his presence there would be an unfair and improper influence and that if he was to be nominated the compliment must come to him as a free and unspotted gift this attitude would have settled his case for him without further effort but he had another attack of virtue on the same day that made it absolutely sure it had been his habit for a great many years to change his religion with his shirt and his ideas about temperance at the same time he would be a teetotaler for a while and the champion of the cause then he would change to the other side for a time on nomination day he suddenly changed from a friendly attitude toward whiskeywhich was the popular attitudeto uncompromising teetotalism and went absolutely dry his friends besought and implored but all in vain he could not be persuaded to cross the threshold of a saloon the paper next morning contained the list of chosen nominees his name was not in it he had not received a vote  his rich income ceased when the state government came into power he was without an occupation something had to be done he put up his sign as attorneyatlaw but he got no clients it was strange it was difficult to account for i cannot account for itbut if i were going to guess at a solution i should guess that by the make of him he would examine both sides of a case so diligently and so conscientiously that when he got through with his argument neither he nor a jury would know which side he was on i think that his client would find out his make in laying his case before him and would take warning and withdraw it in time to save himself from probable disaster  i had taken up my residence in san francisco about a year before the time i have just been speaking of one day i got a tip from mr camp a bold man who was always making big fortunes in ingenious speculations and losing them again in the course of six months by other speculative ingenuities camp told me to buy some shares in the hale and norcross i bought fifty shares at three hundred dollars a share i bought on a margin and put up twenty per cent it exhausted my funds i wrote orion and offered him half and asked him to send his share of the money i waited and waited he wrote and said he was going to attend to it the stock went along up pretty briskly it went higher and higher it reached a thousand dollars a share it climbed to two thousand then to three thousand then to twice that figure the money did not come but i was not disturbed by and by that stock took a turn and began to gallop down then i wrote urgently orion answered that he had sent the money long agosaid he had sent it to the occidental hotel i inquired for it they said it was not there to cut a long story short that stock went on down until it fell below the price i had paid for it then it began to eat up the margin and when at last i got out i was very badly crippled  when it was too late i found out what had become of orions money any other human being would have sent a check but he sent gold the hotel clerk put it in the safe and went on vacation and there it had reposed all this time enjoying its fatal work no doubt another man might have thought to tell me that the money was not in a letter but was in an express package but it never occurred to orion to do that  later mr camp gave me another chance he agreed to buy our tennessee land for two hundred thousand dollars pay a part of the amount in cash and give long notes for the rest his scheme was to import foreigners from grapegrowing and winemaking districts in europe settle them on the land and turn it into a winegrowing country he knew what mr longworth thought of those tennessee grapes and was satisfied i sent the contracts and things to orion for his signature he being one of the three heirs but they arrived at a bad timein a doubly bad time in fact the temperance virtue was temporarily upon him in strong force and he wrote and said that he would not be a party to debauching the country with wine also he said how could he know whether mr camp was going to deal fairly and honestly with those poor people from europe or notand so without waiting to find out he quashed the whole trade and there it fell never to be brought to life again the land from being suddenly worth two hundred thousand dollars became as suddenly worth what it was beforenothing and taxes to pay i had paid the taxes and the other expenses for some years but i dropped the tennessee land there and have never taken any interest in it since pecuniarily or otherwise until yesterday  i had supposed until yesterday that orion had frittered away the last acre and indeed that was his own impression but a gentleman arrived yesterday from tennessee and brought a map showing that by a correction of the ancient surveys we still own a thousand acres in a coal district out of the hundred thousand acres which my father left us when he died in 1847 the gentleman brought a proposition also he brought a reputable and welltodo citizen of new york the proposition was that the tennesseean gentleman should sell that land that the new york gentleman should pay all the expenses and fight all the lawsuits in case any should turn up and that of such profit as might eventuate the tennesseean gentleman should take a third the newyorker a third and sam moffett and his sister and iwho are surviving heirsthe remaining third  this time i hope we shall get rid of the tennessee land for good and all and never hear of it again  sidenote 1867  sidenote 1871  i came east in january 1867 orion remained in carson city perhaps a year longer then he sold his twelvethousanddollar house and its furniture for thirtyfive hundred in greenbacks at about sixty per cent discount he and his wife took passage in the steamer for home in keokuk about 1871 or 72 they came to new york orion had been trying to make a living in the law ever since he had arrived from the pacific coast but he had secured only two cases those he was to try free of chargebut the possible result will never be known because the parties settled the cases out of court without his help  orion got a job as proofreader on the new york evening post at ten dollars a week by and by he came to hartford and wanted me to get him a place as reporter on a hartford paper here was a chance to try my scheme again and i did it i made him go to the hartford evening post without any letter of introduction and propose to scrub and sweep and do all sorts of things for nothing on the plea that he didnt need money but only needed work and that that was what he was pining for within six weeks he was on the editorial staff of that paper at twenty dollars a week and he was worth the money he was presently called for by some other paper at better wages but i made him go to the post people and tell them about it they stood the raise and kept him it was the pleasantest berth he had ever had in his life it was an easy berth he was in every way comfortable but illluck came it was bound to come  a new republican daily was to be started in a new england city by a stock company of welltodo politicians and they offered him the chief editorship at three thousand a year he was eager to accept my beseechings and reasonings went for nothing i said  you are as weak as water those people will find it out right away they will easily see that you have no backbone that they can deal with you as they would deal with a slave you may last six months but not longer then they will not dismiss you as they would dismiss a gentleman they will fling you out as they would fling out an intruding tramp  it happened just so then he and his wife migrated to keokuk once more orion wrote from there that he was not resuming the law that he thought that what his health needed was the open air in some sort of outdoor occupation that his fatherinlaw had a strip of ground on the river border a mile above keokuk with some sort of a house on it and his idea was to buy that place and start a chickenfarm and provide keokuk with chickens and eggs and perhaps butterbut i dont know whether you can raise butter on a chickenfarm or not he said the place could be had for three thousand dollars cash and i sent the money he began to raise chickens and he made a detailed monthly report to me whereby it appeared that he was able to work off his chickens on the keokuk people at a dollar and a quarter a pair but it also appeared that it cost a dollar and sixty cents to raise the pair this did not seem to discourage orion and so i let it go meantime he was borrowing a hundred dollars per month of me regularly month by month now to show orions stern and rigid business waysand he really prided himself on his large business capacitiesthe moment he received the advance of a hundred dollars at the beginning of each month he always sent me his note for the amount and with it he sent out of that money three months interest on the hundred dollars at six per cent per annum these notes being always for three months  as i say he always sent a detailed statement of the months profit and loss on the chickensat least the months loss on the chickensand this detailed statement included the various items of expensecorn for the chickens boots for himself and so on even car fares and the weekly contribution of ten cents to help out the missionaries who were trying to damn the chinese after a plan not satisfactory to those people  i think the poultry experiment lasted about a year possibly two years it had then cost me six thousand dollars  orion returned to the law business and i suppose he remained in that harness off and on for the succeeding quarter of a century but so far as my knowledge goes he was only a lawyer in name and had no clients  sidenote 1890  my mother died in her eightyeighth year in the summer of 1890 she had saved some money and she left it to me because it had come from me i gave it to orion and he said with thanks that i had supported him long enough and now he was going to relieve me of that burden and would also hope to pay back some of that expense and maybe the whole of it accordingly he proceeded to use up that money in building a considerable addition to the house with the idea of taking boarders and getting rich we need not dwell upon this venture it was another of his failures his wife tried hard to make the scheme succeed and if anybody could have made it succeed she would have done it she was a good woman and was greatly liked she had a practical side and she would have made that boardinghouse lucrative if circumstances had not been against her  orion had other projects for recouping me but as they always required capital i stayed out of them and they did not materialize once he wanted to start a newspaper it was a ghastly idea and i squelched it with a promptness that was almost rude then he invented a woodsawing machine and patched it together himself and he really sawed wood with it it was ingenious it was capable and it would have made a comfortable little fortune for him but just at the wrong time providence interfered again orion applied for a patent and found that the same machine had already been patented and had gone into business and was thriving  presently the state of new york offered a fiftythousanddollar prize for a practical method of navigating the erie canal with steam canalboats orion worked at that thing for two or three years invented and completed a method and was once more ready to reach out and seize upon imminent wealth when somebody pointed out a defect his steam canalboat could not be used in the wintertime and in the summertime the commotion its wheels would make in the water would wash away the state of new york on both sides  innumerable were orions projects for acquiring the means to pay off the debt to me these projects extended straight through the succeeding thirty years but in every case they failed during all those thirty years his wellestablished honesty kept him in offices of trust where other peoples money had to be taken care of but where no salary was paid he was treasurer of all the benevolent institutions he took care of the money and other property of widows and orphans he never lost a cent for anybody and never made one for himself every time he changed his religion the church of his new faith was glad to get him made him treasurer at once and at once he stopped the graft and the leaks in that church he exhibited a facility in changing his political complexion that was a marvel to the whole community once the following curious thing happened and he wrote me all about it himself  one morning he was a republican and upon invitation he agreed to make a campaign speech at the republican massmeeting that night he prepared the speech after luncheon he became a democrat and agreed to write a score of exciting mottoes to be painted upon the transparencies which the democrats would carry in their torchlight procession that night he wrote these shouting democratic mottoes during the afternoon and they occupied so much of his time that it was night before he had a chance to change his politics again so he actually made a rousing republican campaign speech in the open air while his democratic transparencies passed by in front of him to the joy of every witness present  he was a most strange creaturebut in spite of his eccentricities he was beloved all his life in whatsoever community he lived and he was also held in high esteem for at bottom he was a sterling man  about twentyfive years agoalong there somewherei suggested to orion that he write an autobiography i asked him to try to tell the straight truth in it to refrain from exhibiting himself in creditable attitudes exclusively and to honorably set down all the incidents of his life which he had found interesting to him including those which were burned into his memory because he was ashamed of them i said that this had never been done and that if he could do it his autobiography would be a most valuable piece of literature i said i was offering him a job which i could not duplicate in my own case but i would cherish the hope that he might succeed with it i recognise now that i was trying to saddle upon him an impossibility i have been dictating this autobiography of mine daily for three months i have thought of fifteen hundred or two thousand incidents in my life which i am ashamed of but i have not gotten one of them to consent to go on paper yet i think that that stock will still be complete and unimpaired when i finish these memoirs if i ever finish them i believe that if i should put in all or any of those incidents i should be sure to strike them out when i came to revise this book  orion wrote his autobiography and sent it to me but great was my disappointment and my vexation too in it he was constantly making a hero of himself exactly as i should have done and am doing now and he was constantly forgetting to put in the episodes which placed him in an unheroic light i knew several incidents of his life which were distinctly and painfully unheroic but when i came across them in his autobiography they had changed color they had turned themselves inside out and were things to be intemperately proud of in my dissatisfaction i destroyed a considerable part of that autobiography but in what remains there are passages which are interesting and i shall quote from them here and there and now and then as i go along  sidenote 1898  while we were living in vienna in 1898 a cablegram came from keokuk announcing orions death he was seventytwo years old he had gone down to the kitchen in the early hours of a bitter december morning he had built the fire and had then sat down at a table to write something and there he died with the pencil in his hand and resting against the paper in the middle of an unfinished wordan indication that his release from the captivity of a long and troubled and pathetic and unprofitable life was mercifully swift and painless  dictated in 1904 a quarter of a century ago i was visiting john hay at whitelaw reids house in new york which hay was occupying for a few months while reid was absent on a holiday in europe temporarily also hay was editing reids paper the new york tribune i remember two incidents of that sunday visit particularly well i had known john hay a good many years i had known him when he was an obscure young editorial writer on the tribune in horace greelys time earning three or four times the salary he got considering the high character of the work which came from his pen in those earlier days he was a picture to look at for beauty of feature perfection of form and grace of carriage and movement he had a charm about him of a sort quite unusual to my western ignorance and inexperiencea charm of manner intonation apparently native and unstudied elocution and all thatthe groundwork of it native the ease of it the polish of it the winning naturalness of it acquired in europe where he had been chargé daffaires some time at the court of vienna he was joyous and cordial a most pleasant comrade one of the two incidents above referred to as marking that visit was this  in trading remarks concerning our ages i confessed to fortytwo and hay to forty then he asked if i had begun to write my autobiography and i said i hadnt he said that i ought to begin at once and that i had already lost two years then he said in substance this  at forty a man reaches the top of the hill of life and starts down on the sunset side the ordinary man the average man not to particularize too closely and say the commonplace man has at that age succeeded or failed in either case he has lived all of his life that is likely to be worth recording also in either case the life lived is worth setting down and cannot fail to be interesting if he comes as near to telling the truth about himself as he can and he will tell the truth in spite of himself for his facts and his fictions will work loyally together for the protection of the reader each fact and each fiction will be a dab of paint each will fall in its right place and together they will paint his portrait not the portrait he thinks they are painting but his real portrait the inside of him the soul of him his character without intending to lie he will lie all the time not bluntly consciously not dully unconsciously but halfconsciously consciousness in twilight a soft and gentle and merciful twilight which makes his general form comely with his virtuous prominences and projections discernible and his ungracious ones in shadow his truths will be recognizable as truths his modifications of facts which would tell against him will go for nothing the reader will see the fact through the film and know his man  there is a subtle devilish something or other about autobiographical composition that defeats all the writers attempts to paint his portrait his way  hay meant that he and i were ordinary average commonplace people and i did not resent my share of the verdict but nursed my wound in silence his idea that we had finished our work in life passed the summit and were westward bound downhill with me two years ahead of him and neither of us with anything further to do as benefactors to mankind was all a mistake i had written four books then possibly five i have been drowning the world in literary wisdom ever since volume after volume since that days sun went down he has been the historian of mr lincoln and his book will never perish he has been ambassador brilliant orator competent and admirable secretary of state                                                       mark twain

held by my father twenty yearsintact when he died in 1847 we began to manage it ourselves forty years afterward we had managed it all away except 10000 acres and gotten nothing to remember the sales by about 1887possibly it was earlierthe 10000 went my brother found a chance to trade it for a house and lot in the town of corry in the oil regions of pennsylvania about 1894 he sold this property for 250 that ended the tennessee land  if any penny of cash ever came out of my fathers wise investment but that i have no recollection of it no i am overlooking a detail it furnished me a field for sellers and a book out of my half of the book i got 15000 or 20000 out of the play i got 75000 or 80000just about a dollar an acre it is curious i was not alive when my father made the investment therefore he was not intending any partiality yet i was the only member of the family that ever profited by it i shall have occasion to mention this land again now and then as i go along for it influenced our life in one way or another during more than a generation whenever things grew dark it rose and put out its hopeful sellers hand and cheered us up and said do not be afraidtrust in mewait it kept us hoping and hoping during forty years and forsook us at last it put our energies to sleep and made visionaries of usdreamers and indolent we were always going to be rich next yearno occasion to work it is good to begin life poor it is good to begin life richthese are wholesome but to begin it prospectively rich the man who has not experienced it cannot imagine the curse of it  my parents removed to missouri in the early thirties i do not remember just when for i was not born then and cared nothing for such things it was a long journey in those days and must have been a rough and tiresome one the home was made in the wee village of florida in monroe county and i was born there in 1835 the village contained a hundred people and i increased the population by one per cent it is more than the best man in history ever did for any other town it may not be modest in me to refer to this but it is true there is no record of a person doing as muchnot even shakespeare but i did it for florida and it shows that i could have done it for any placeeven london i suppose  recently some one in missouri has sent me a picture of the house i was born in heretofore i have always stated that it was a palace but i shall be more guarded now  i remember only one circumstance connected with my life in it i remember it very well though i was but two and a half years old at the time the family packed up everything and started in wagons for hannibal on the mississippi thirty miles away toward night when they camped and counted up the children one was missing i was the one i had been left behind parents ought always to count the children before they start i was having a good enough time playing by myself until i found that the doors were fastened and that there was a grisly deep silence brooding over the place i knew then that the family were gone and that they had forgotten me i was well frightened and i made all the noise i could but no one was near and it did no good i spent the afternoon in captivity and was not rescued until the gloaming had fallen and the place was alive with ghosts  my brother henry was six months old at that time i used to remember his walking into a fire outdoors when he was a week old it was remarkable in me to remember a thing like that which occurred when i was so young and it was still more remarkable that i should cling to the delusion for thirty years that i did remember itfor of course it never happened he would not have been able to walk at that age if i had stopped to reflect i should not have burdened my memory with that impossible rubbish so long it is believed by many people that an impression deposited in a childs memory within the first two years of its life cannot remain there five years but that is an error the incident of benvenuto cellini and the salamander must be accepted as authentic and trustworthy and then that remarkable and indisputable instance in the experience of helen kellerhowever i will speak of that at another time for many years i believed that i remembered helping my grandfather drink his whiskey toddy when i was six weeks old but i do not tell about that any more now i am grown old and my memory is not as active as it used to be when i was younger i could remember anything whether it had happened or not but my faculties are decaying now and soon i shall be so i cannot remember any but the things that happened it is sad to go to pieces like this but we all have to do it  my uncle john a quarles was a farmer and his place was in the country four miles from florida he had eight children and fifteen or twenty negroes and was also fortunate in other ways particularly in his character i have not come across a better man than he was i was his guest for two or three months every year from the fourth year after we removed to hannibal till i was eleven or twelve years old i have never consciously used him or his wife in a book but his farm has come very handy to me in literature once or twice in huck finn and in tom sawyer detective i moved it down to arkansas it was all of six hundred miles but it was no trouble it was not a very large farm five hundred acres perhaps but i could have done it if it had been twice as large and as for the morality of it i cared nothing for that i would move a state if the exigencies of literature required it  it was a heavenly place for a boy that farm of my uncle johns the house was a double log one with a spacious floor roofed in connecting it with the kitchen in the summer the table was set in the middle of that shady and breezy floor and the sumptuous mealswell it makes me cry to think of them fried chicken roast pig wild and tame turkeys ducks and geese venison just killed squirrels rabbits pheasants partridges prairiechickens biscuits hot batter cakes hot buckwheat cakes hot wheat bread hot rolls hot corn pone fresh corn boiled on the ear succotash butterbeans stringbeans tomatoes pease irish potatoes sweetpotatoes buttermilk sweet milk clabber watermelons muskmelons cantaloupsall fresh from the gardenapple pie peach pie pumpkin pie apple dumplings peach cobbleri cant remember the rest the way that the things were cooked was perhaps the main splendorparticularly a certain few of the dishes for instance the corn bread the hot biscuits and wheat bread and the fried chicken these things have never been properly cooked in the northin fact no one there is able to learn the art so far as my experience goes the north thinks it knows how to make corn bread but this is gross superstition perhaps no bread in the world is quite as good as southern corn bread and perhaps no bread in the world is quite so bad as the northern imitation of it the north seldom tries to fry chicken and this is well the art cannot be learned north of the line of mason and dixon nor anywhere in europe this is not hearsay it is experience that is speaking in europe it is imagined that the custom of serving various kinds of bread blazing hot is american but that is too broad a spread it is custom in the south but is much less than that in the north in the north and in europe hot bread is considered unhealthy this is probably another fussy superstition like the european superstition that icewater is unhealthy europe does not need icewater and does not drink it and yet notwithstanding this its word for it is better than ours because it describes it whereas ours doesnt europe calls it iced water our word describes water made from melted icea drink which we have but little acquaintance with  it seem a pity that the world should throw away so many good things merely because they are unwholesome i doubt if god has given us any refreshment which taken in moderation is unwholesome except microbes yet there are people who strictly deprive themselves of each and every eatable drinkable and smokable which has in any way acquired a shady reputation they pay this price for health and health is all they get for it how strange it is it is like paying out your whole fortune for a cow that has gone dry  the farmhouse stood in the middle of a very large yard and the yard was fenced on three sides with rails and on the rear side with high palings against these stood the smokehouse beyond the palings was the orchard beyond the orchard were the negro quarter and the tobaccofields the front yard was entered over a stile made of sawedoff logs of graduated heights i do not remember any gate in a corner of the front yard were a dozen lofty hickorytrees and a dozen blackwalnuts and in the nutting season riches were to be gathered there  down a piece abreast the house stood a little log cabin against the rail fence and there the woody hill fell sharply away past the barns the corncrib the stables and the tobaccocuring house to a limpid brook which sang along over its gravelly bed and curved and frisked in and out and here and there and yonder in the deep shade of overhanging foliage and vinesa divine place for wading and it had swimmingpools too which were forbidden to us and therefore much frequented by us for we were little christian children and had early been taught the value of forbidden fruit  in the little log cabin lived a bedridden whiteheaded slave woman whom we visited daily and looked upon with awe for we believed she was upwards of a thousand years old and had talked with moses the younger negroes credited these statistics and had furnished them to us in good faith we accommodated all the details which came to us about her and so we believed that she had lost her health in the long desert trip coming out of egypt and had never been able to get it back again she had a round bald place on the crown of her head and we used to creep around and gaze at it in reverent silence and reflect that it was caused by fright through seeing pharaoh drowned we called her aunt hannah southern fashion she was superstitious like the other negroes also like them she was deeply religious like them she had great faith in prayer and employed it in all ordinary exigencies but not in cases where a dead certainty of result was urgent whenever witches were around she tied up the remnant of her wool in little tufts with white thread and this promptly made the witches impotent  all the negroes were friends of ours and with those of our own age we were in effect comrades i say in effect using the phrase as a modification we were comrades and yet not comrades color and condition interposed a subtle line which both parties were conscious of and which rendered complete fusion impossible we had a faithful and affectionate good friend ally and adviser in uncle danl a middleaged slave whose head was the best one in the negro quarter whose sympathies were wide and warm and whose heart was honest and simple and knew no guile he has served me well these many many years i have not seen him for more than half a century and yet spiritually i have had his welcome company a good part of that time and have staged him in books under his own name and as jim and carted him all aroundto hannibal down the mississippi on a raft and even across the desert of sahara in a balloonand he has endured it all with the patience and friendliness and loyalty which were his birthright it was on the farm that i got my strong liking for his race and my appreciation of certain of its fine qualities this feeling and this estimate have stood the test of sixty years and more and have suffered no impairment the black face is as welcome to me now as it was then  in my schoolboy days i had no aversion to slavery i was not aware that there was anything wrong about it no one arraigned it in my hearing the local papers said nothing against it the local pulpit taught us that god approved it that it was a holy thing and that the doubter need only look in the bible if he wished to settle his mindand then the texts were read aloud to us to make the matter sure if the slaves themselves had an aversion to slavery they were wise and said nothing in hannibal we seldom saw a slave misused on the farm never  there was however one small incident of my boyhood days which touched this matter and it must have meant a good deal to me or it would not have stayed in my memory clear and sharp vivid and shadowless all these slowdrifting years we had a little slave boy whom we had hired from some one there in hannibal he was from the eastern shore of maryland and had been brought away from his family and his friends halfway across the american continent and sold he was a cheery spirit innocent and gentle and the noisiest creature that ever was perhaps all day long he was singing whistling yelling whooping laughingit was maddening devastating unendurable at last one day i lost all my temper and went raging to my mother and said sandy had been singing for an hour without a single break and i couldnt stand it and wouldnt she please shut him up the tears came into her eyes and her lip trembled and she said something like this  poor thing when he sings it shows that he is not remembering and that comforts me but when he is still i am afraid he is thinking and i cannot bear it he will never see his mother again if he can sing i must not hinder it but be thankful for it if you were older you would understand me then that friendless childs noise would make you glad  it was a simple speech and made up of small words but it went home and sandys noise was not a trouble to me any more she never used large words but she had a natural gift for making small ones do effective work she lived to reach the neighborhood of ninety years and was capable with her tongue to the lastespecially when a meanness or an injustice roused her spirit she has come handy to me several times in my books where she figures as tom sawyers aunt polly i fitted her out with a dialect and tried to think up other improvements for her but did not find any i used sandy once also it was in tom sawyer i tried to get him to whitewash the fence but it did not work i do not remember what name i called him by in the book  i can see the farm yet with perfect clearness i can see all its belongings all its details the family room of the house with a trundle bed in one corner and a spinningwheel in anothera wheel whose rising and falling wail heard from a distance was the mournfulest of all sounds to me and made me homesick and lowspirited and filled my atmosphere with the wandering spirits of the dead the vast fireplace piled high on winter nights with flaming hickory logs from whose ends a sugary sap bubbled out but did not go to waste for we scraped it off and ate it the lazy cat spread out on the rough hearthstones the drowsy dogs braced against the jambs and blinking my aunt in one chimneycorner knitting my uncle in the other smoking his corncob pipe the slick and carpetless oak floor faintly mirroring the dancing flametongues and freckled with black indentations where firecoals had popped out and died a leisurely death half a dozen children romping in the background twilight splitbottomed chairs here and there some with rockers a cradleout of service but waiting with confidence in the early cold mornings a snuggle of children in shirts and chemises occupying the hearthstone and procrastinatingthey could not bear to leave that comfortable place and go out on the windswept floorspace between the house and kitchen where the general tin basin stood and wash  along outside of the front fence ran the country road dusty in the summertime and a good place for snakesthey liked to lie in it and sun themselves when they were rattlesnakes or puff adders we killed them when they were black snakes or racers or belonged to the fabled hoop breed we fled without shame when they were house snakes or garters we carried them home and put them in aunt patsys workbasket for a surprise for she was prejudiced against snakes and always when she took the basket in her lap and they began to climb out of it it disordered her mind she never could seem to get used to them her opportunities went for nothing and she was always cold toward bats too and could not bear them and yet i think a bat is as friendly a bird as there is my mother was aunt patsys sister and had the same wild superstitions a bat is beautifully soft and silky i do not know any creature that is pleasanter to the touch or is more grateful for caressings if offered in the right spirit i know all about these coleoptera because our great cave three miles below hannibal was multitudinously stocked with them and often i brought them home to amuse my mother with it was easy to manage if it was a school day because then i had ostensibly been to school and hadnt any bats she was not a suspicious person but full of trust and confidence and when i said theres something in my coat pocket for you she would put her hand in but she always took it out again herself i didnt have to tell her it was remarkable the way she couldnt learn to like private bats  i think she was never in the cave in her life but everybody else went there many excursion parties came from considerable distances up and down the river to visit the cave it was miles in extent and was a tangled wilderness of narrow and lofty clefts and passages it was an easy place to get lost in anybody could do itincluding the bats i got lost in it myself along with a lady and our last candle burned down to almost nothing before we glimpsed the searchpartys lights winding about in the distance  injun joe the halfbreed got lost in there once and would have starved to death if the bats had run short but there was no chance of that there were myriads of them he told me all his story in the book called tom sawyer i starved him entirely to death in the cave but that was in the interest of art it never happened general gaines who was our first town drunkard before jimmy finn got the place was lost in there for the space of a week and finally pushed his handkerchief out of a hole in a hilltop near saverton several miles down the river from the caves mouth and somebody saw it and dug him out there is nothing the matter with his statistics except the handkerchief i knew him for years and he hadnt any but it could have been his nose that would attract attention  beyond the road where the snakes sunned themselves was a dense young thicket and through it a dimlighted path led a quarter of a mile then out of the dimness one emerged abruptly upon a level great prairie which was covered with wild strawberryplants vividly starred with prairie pinks and walled in on all sides by forests the strawberries were fragrant and fine and in the season we were generally there in the crisp freshness of the early morning while the dewbeads still sparkled upon the grass and the woods were ringing with the first songs of the birds  down the forest slopes to the left were the swings they were made of bark stripped from hickory saplings when they became dry they were dangerous they usually broke when a child was forty feet in the air and this was why so many bones had to be mended every year i had no illluck myself but none of my cousins escaped there were eight of them and at one time and another they broke fourteen arms among them but it cost next to nothing for the doctor worked by the year25 for the whole family i remember two of the florida doctors chowning and meredith they not only tended an entire family for 25 a year but furnished the medicines themselves good measure too only the largest persons could hold a whole dose castoroil was the principal beverage the dose was half a dipperful with half a dipperful of new orleans molasses added to help it down and make it taste good which it never did the next standby was calomel the next rhubarb and the next jalap then they bled the patient and put mustardplasters on him it was a dreadful system and yet the deathrate was not heavy the calomel was nearly sure to salivate the patient and cost him some of his teeth there were no dentists when teeth became touched with decay or were otherwise ailing the doctor knew of but one thing to do he fetched his tongs and dragged them out if the jaw remained it was not his fault  doctors were not called in cases of ordinary illness the familys grandmother attended to those every old woman was a doctor and gathered her own medicines in the woods and knew how to compound doses that would stir the vitals of a castiron dog and then there was the indian doctor a grave savage remnant of his tribe deeply read in the mysteries of nature and the secret properties of herbs and most backwoodsmen had high faith in his powers and could tell of wonderful cures achieved by him in mauritius away off yonder in the solitudes of the indian ocean there is a person who answers to our indian doctor of the old times he is a negro and has had no teaching as a doctor yet there is one disease which he is master of and can cure and the doctors cant they send for him when they have a case it is a childs disease of a strange and deadly sort and the negro cures it with a herb medicine which he makes himself from a prescription which has come down to him from his father and grandfather he will not let any one see it he keeps the secret of its components to himself and it is feared that he will die without divulging it then there will be consternation in mauritius i was told these things by the people there in 1896  we had the faith doctor too in those early daysa woman her specialty was toothache she was a farmers old wife and lived five miles from hannibal she would lay her hand on the patients jaw and say believe and the cure was prompt mrs utterback i remember her very well twice i rode out there behind my mother horseback and saw the cure performed my mother was the patient  dr meredith removed to hannibal by and by and was our family physician there and saved my life several times still he was a good man and meant well let it go  i was always told that i was a sickly and precarious and tiresome and uncertain child and lived mainly on allopathic medicines during the first seven years of my life i asked my mother about this in her old ageshe was in her 88th yearand said  i suppose that during all that time you were uneasy about me  yes the whole time  afraid i wouldnt live  after a reflective pauseostensibly to think out the facts  noafraid you would  it sounds like a plagiarism but it probably wasnt the country schoolhouse was three miles from my uncles farm it stood in a clearing in the woods and would hold about twentyfive boys and girls we attended the school with more or less regularity once or twice a week in summer walking to it in the cool of the morning by the forest paths and back in the gloaming at the end of the day all the pupils brought their dinners in basketscorndodger buttermilk and other good thingsand sat in the shade of the trees at noon and ate them it is the part of my education which i look back upon with the most satisfaction my first visit to the school was when i was seven a strapping girl of fifteen in the customary sunbonnet and calico dress asked me if i used tobaccomeaning did i chew it i said no it roused her scorn she reported me to all the crowd and said  here is a boy seven years old who cant chaw tobacco  by the looks and comments which this produced i realized that i was a degraded object i was cruelly ashamed of myself i determined to reform but i only made myself sick i was not able to learn to chew tobacco i learned to smoke fairly well but that did not conciliate anybody and i remained a poor thing and characterless i longed to be respected but i never was able to rise children have but little charity for each others defects  as i have said i spent some part of every year at the farm until i was twelve or thirteen years old the life which i led there with my cousins was full of charm and so is the memory of it yet i can call back the solemn twilight and mystery of the deep woods the earthy smells the faint odors of the wild flowers the sheen of rainwashed foliage the rattling clatter of drops when the wind shook the trees the faroff hammering of woodpeckers and the muffled drumming of woodpheasants in the remoteness of the forest the snapshot glimpses of disturbed wild creatures skurrying through the grassi can call it all back and make it as real as it ever was and as blessed i can call back the prairie and its loneliness and peace and a vast hawk hanging motionless in the sky with his wings spread wide and the blue of the vault showing through the fringe of their endfeathers i can see the woods in their autumn dress the oaks purple the hickories washed with gold the maples and the sumacs luminous with crimson fires and i can hear the rustle made by the fallen leaves as we ploughed through them i can see the blue clusters of wild grapes hanging amongst the foliage of the saplings and i remember the taste of them and the smell i know how the wild blackberries looked and how they tasted and the same with the pawpaws the hazelnuts and the persimmons and i can feel the thumping rain upon my head of hickorynuts and walnuts when we were out in the frosty dawn to scramble for them with the pigs and the gusts of wind loosed them and sent them down i know the stain of blackberries and how pretty it is and i know the stain of walnut hulls and how little it minds soap and water also what grudged experience it had of either of them i know the taste of maple sap and when to gather it and how to arrange the troughs and the delivery tubes and how to boil down the juice and how to hook the sugar after it is made also how much better hooked sugar tastes than any that is honestly come by let bigots say what they will i know how a prize watermelon looks when it is sunning its fat rotundity among pumpkinvines and simblins i know how to tell when it is ripe without plugging it i know how inviting it looks when it is cooling itself in a tub of water under the bed waiting i know how it looks when it lies on the table in the sheltered great floorspace between house and kitchen and the children gathered for the sacrifice and their mouths watering i know the crackling sound it makes when the carvingknife enters its end and i can see the split fly along in front of the blade as the knife cleaves its way to the other end i can see its halves fall apart and display the rich red meat and the black seeds and the heart standing up a luxury fit for the elect i know how a boy looks behind a yardlong slice of that melon and i know how he feels for i have been there i know the taste of the watermelon which has been honestly come by and i know the taste of the watermelon which has been acquired by art both taste good but the experienced know which tastes best i know the look of green apples and peaches and pears on the trees and i know how entertaining they are when they are inside of a person i know how ripe ones look when they are piled in pyramids under the trees and how pretty they are and how vivid their colors i know how a frozen apple looks in a barrel down cellar in the wintertime and how hard it is to bite and how the frost makes the teeth ache and yet how good it is notwithstanding i know the disposition of elderly people to select the specked apples for the children and i once knew ways to beat the game i know the look of an apple that is roasting and sizzling on a hearth on a winters evening and i know the comfort that comes of eating it hot along with some sugar and a drench of cream i know the delicate art and mystery of so cracking hickorynuts and walnuts on a flatiron with a hammer that the kernels will be delivered whole and i know how the nuts taken in conjunction with winter apples cider and doughnuts make old peoples tales and old jokes sound fresh and crisp and enchanting and juggle an evening away before you know what went with the time i know the look of uncle danls kitchen as it was on privileged nights when i was a child and i can see the white and black children grouped on the hearth with the firelight playing on their faces and the shadows flickering upon the walls clear back toward the cavernous gloom of the rear and i can hear uncle danl telling the immortal tales which uncle remus harris was to gather into his books and charm the world with by and by and i can feel again the creepy joy which quivered through me when the time for the ghoststory of the golden arm was reachedand the sense of regret too which came over me for it was always the last story of the evening and there was nothing between it and the unwelcome bed  i can remember the bare wooden stairway in my uncles house and the turn to the left above the landing and the rafters and the slanting roof over my bed and the squares of moonlight on the floor and the white cold world of snow outside seen through the curtainless window i can remember the howling of the wind and the quaking of the house on stormy nights and how snug and cozy one felt under the blankets listening and how the powdery snow used to sift in around the sashes and lie in little ridges on the floor and make the place look chilly in the morning and curb the wild desire to get upin case there was any i can remember how very dark that room was in the dark of the moon and how packed it was with ghostly stillness when one woke up by accident away in the night and forgotten sins came flocking out of the secret chambers of the memory and wanted a hearing and how ill chosen the time seemed for this kind of business and how dismal was the hoohooing of the owl and the wailing of the wolf sent mourning by on the night wind  i remember the raging of the rain on that roof summer nights and how pleasant it was to lie and listen to it and enjoy the white splendor of the lightning and the majestic booming and crashing of the thunder it was a very satisfactory room and there was a lightningrod which was reachable from the window an adorable and skittish thing to climb up and down summer nights when there were duties on hand of a sort to make privacy desirable  i remember the coon and possum hunts nights with the negroes and the long marches through the black gloom of the woods and the excitement which fired everybody when the distant bay of an experienced dog announced that the game was treed then the wild scramblings and stumblings through briars and bushes and over roots to get to the spot then the lighting of a fire and the felling of the tree the joyful frenzy of the dogs and the negroes and the weird picture it all made in the red glarei remember it all well and the delight that every one got out of it except the coon  i remember the pigeon seasons when the birds would come in millions and cover the trees and by their weight break down the branches they were clubbed to death with sticks guns were not necessary and were not used i remember the squirrel hunts and the prairiechicken hunts and the wildturkey hunts and all that and how we turned out mornings while it was still dark to go on these expeditions and how chilly and dismal it was and how often i regretted that i was well enough to go a toot on a tin horn brought twice as many dogs as were needed and in their happiness they raced and scampered about and knocked small people down and made no end of unnecessary noise at the word they vanished away toward the woods and we drifted silently after them in the melancholy gloom but presently the gray dawn stole over the world the birds piped up then the sun rose and poured light and comfort all around everything was fresh and dewy and fragrant and life was a boon again after three hours of tramping we arrived back wholesomely tired overladen with game very hungry and just in time for breakfast

mark twain   dictated thursday december 6 1906  from susys biography of me        feb 27 sunday       claras reputation as a baby was always a fine one mine exactly      the contrary one often related story concerning her braveness as a      baby and her own opinion of this quality of hers is this clara and      i often got slivers in our hands and when mama took them out with a      much dreaded needle clara was always very brave and i very      cowardly one day clara got one of these slivers in her hand a      very bad one and while mama was taking it out clara stood      perfectly still without even wincing i saw how brave she was and      turning to mamma said mamma isnt she a brave little thing      presently mamma had to give the little hand quite a dig with the      needle and noticing how perfectly quiet clara was about it she      exclaimed why clara you are a brave little thing clara responded      no bodys braver but  god   claras pious remark is the main detail and susy has accurately remembered its phrasing the threeyearolders wound was of a formidable sort and not one which the mothers surgery would have been equal to the flesh of the finger had been burst by a cruel accident it was the doctor that sewed it up and to all appearances it was he and the other independent witnesses that did the main part of the suffering each stitch that he took made clara wince slightly but it shrivelled the others  i take pride in claras remark because it shows that although she was only three years old her fireside teachings were already making her a thinkera thinker and also an observer of proportions i am not claiming any credit for this i furnished to the children worldly knowledge and wisdom but was not competent to go higher and so i left their spiritual education in the hands of the mother a result of this modesty of mine was made manifest to me in a very striking way some years afterward when jean was nine years old we had recently arrived in berlin at the time and had begun housekeeping in a furnished apartment one morning at breakfast a vast card arrivedan invitation to be precise it was a command from the emperor of germany to come to dinner during several months i had encountered socially on the continent men bearing lofty titles and all this while jean was becoming more and more impressed and awed and subdued by these imposing events for she had not been abroad before and they were new to herwonders out of dreamland turned into realities the imperial card was passed from hand to hand around the table and examined with interest when it reached jean she exhibited excitement and emotion but for a time was quite speechless then she said  why papa if it keeps going on like this pretty soon there wont be anybody left for you to get acquainted with but god  it was not complimentary to think i was not acquainted in that quarter but she was young and the young jump to conclusions without reflection  necessarily i did myself the honor to obey the command of the emperor wilhelm ii prince heinrich and six or eight other guests were present the emperor did most of the talking and he talked well and in faultless english in both of these conspicuousnesses i was gratified to recognize a resemblance to myselfa very exact resemblance no almost exact but not quite thata modified exactness with the advantage in favor of the emperor my english like his is nearly faultless like him i talk well and when i have guests at dinner i prefer to do all the talking myself it is the best way and the pleasantest also the most profitable for the others  i was greatly pleased to perceive that his majesty was familiar with my books and that his attitude toward them was not uncomplimentary in the course of his talk he said that my best and most valuable book was old times on the mississippi i will refer to that remark again presently  an official who was well up in the foreign office at that time and had served under bismarck for fourteen years was still occupying his old place under chancellor caprivi smith i will call him of whom i am speaking though that is not his name he was a special friend of mine and i greatly enjoyed his society although in order to have it it was necessary for me to seek it as late as midnight and not earlier this was because government officials of his rank had to work all day after nine in the morning and then attend official banquets in the evening wherefore they were usually unable to get liferestoring fresh air and exercise for their jaded minds and bodies earlier than midnight then they turned out in groups of two or three and gratefully and violently tramped the deserted streets until two in the morning smith had been in the government service at home and abroad for more than thirty years and he was now sixty years old or close upon it he could not remember a year in which he had had a vacation of more than a fortnights length he was weary all through to the bones and the marrow now and was yearning for a holiday of a whole three monthsyearning so longingly and so poignantly that he had at last made up his mind to make a desperate cast for it and stand the consequences whatever they might be it was against all rules to ask for a vacationquite against all etiquette the shock of it would paralyze the chancellery stem etiquette and usage required another form the applicant was not privileged to ask for a vacation he must send in his resignation the chancellor would know that the applicant was not really trying to resign and didnt want to resign but was merely trying in this lefthanded way to get a vacation  the night before the emperors dinner i helped smith take his exercise after midnight and he was full of his project he had sent in his resignation that day and was trembling for the result and naturally because it might possibly be that the chancellor would be happy to fill his place with somebody else in which case he could accept the resignation without comment and without offence smith was in a very anxious frame of mind not that he feared that caprivi was dissatisfied with him for he had no such fear it was the emperor that he was afraid of he did not know how he stood with the emperor he said that while apparently it was caprivi who would decide his case it was in reality the emperor who would perform that service that the emperor kept personal watch upon everything and that no official sparrow could fall to the ground without his privity and consent that the resignation would be laid before his majesty who would accept it or decline to accept it according to his pleasure and that then his pleasure in the matter would be communicated by caprivi smith said he would know his fate the next evening after the imperial dinner that when i should escort his majesty into the large salon contiguous to the diningroom i would find there about thirty mencabinet ministers admirals generals and other great officials of the empireand that these men would be standing talking together in little separate groups of two or three persons that the emperor would move from group to group and say a word to each sometimes two words sometimes ten words and that the length of his speech whether brief or not so brief would indicate the exact standing in the emperors regard of the man accosted and that by observing this thermometer an expert could tell to half a degree the state of the imperial weather in each case that in berlin as in the imperial days of rome the emperor was the sun and that his smile or his frown meant good fortune or disaster to the man upon whom it should fall smith suggested that i watch the thermometer while the emperor went his rounds of the groups and added that if his majesty talked four minutes with any person there present it meant high favor and that the sun was in the zenith and cloudless for that man  i mentally recorded that fourminute altitude and resolved to see if any man there on that night stood in sufficient favor to achieve it  very well after the dinner i watched the emperor while he passed from group to group and privately i timed him with a watch two or three times he came near to reaching the fourminute altitude but always he fell short a little the last man he came to was smith he put his hand on smiths shoulder and began to talk to him and when he finished the thermometer had scored seven minutes the company then moved toward the smokingroom where cigars beer and anecdotes would be in brisk service until midnight and as smith passed me he whispered  that settles it the chancellor will ask me how much of a vacation i want and i shant be afraid to raise the limit i shall call for six months  sidenote 1891  sidenote 1899  smiths dream had been to spend his three months vacationin case he got a vacation instead of the other thingin one of the great capitals of the continenta capital whose name i shall suppress at present the next day the chancellor asked him how much of a vacation he wanted and where he desired to spend it smith told him his prayer was granted and rather more than granted the chancellor augmented his salary and attached him to the german embassy of that selected capital giving him a place of high dignity bearing an imposing title and with nothing to do except attend banquets of an extraordinary character at the embassy once or twice a year the term of his vacation was not specified he was to continue it until requested to come back to his work in the foreign office this was in 1891 eight years later smith was passing through vienna and he called upon me there had been no interruption of his vacation as yet and there was no likelihood that an interruption of it would occur while he should still be among the living  dictated monday december 17 1906 as i have already remarked old times on the mississippi got the kaisers best praise it was after midnight when i reached home i was usually out until toward midnight and the pleasure of being out late was poisoned every night by the dread of what i must meet at my front dooran indignant face a resentful face the face of the portier the portier was a towheaded young german twentytwo or three years old and it had been for some time apparent to me that he did not enjoy being hammered out of his sleep nights to let me in he never had a kind word for me nor a pleasant look i couldnt understand it since it was his business to be on watch and let the occupants of the several flats in at any and all hours of the night i could not see why he so distinctly failed to get reconciled to it  the fact is i was ignorantly violating every night a custom in which he was commercially interested i did not suspect this no one had told me of the custom and if i had been left to guess it it would have taken me a very long time to make a success of it it was a custom which was so well established and so universally recognized that it had all the force and dignity of law by authority of this custom whosoever entered a berlin house after ten at night must pay a trifling toll to the portier for breaking his sleep to let him in this tax was either two and a half cents or five cents i dont remember which but i had never paid it and didnt know i owed it and as i had been residing in berlin several weeks i was so far in arrears that my presence in the german capital was getting to be a serious disaster to that young fellow  i arrived from the imperial dinner sorrowful and anxious made my presence known and prepared myself to wait in patience the tedious minute or two which the portier usually allowed himself to keep me tarryingas a punishment but this time there was no stagewait the door was instantly unlocked unbolted unchained and flung wide and in it appeared the strange and welcome apparition of the portiers round face all sunshine and smiles and welcome in place of the black frowns and hostility that i was expecting plainly he had not come out of his bed he had been waiting for me watching for me he began to pour out upon me in the most enthusiastic and energetic way a generous stream of german welcome and homage meanwhile dragging me excitedly to his small bedroom beside the front door there he made me bend down over a row of german translations of my books and said  thereyou wrote them i have found it out by god i did not know it before and i ask a million pardons that one there the old times on the mississippi is the best book you ever wrote  the usual number of those curious accidents which we call coincidences have fallen to my share in this life but for picturesqueness this one puts all the others in the shade that a crowned head and a portier the very top of an empire and the very bottom of it should pass the very same criticism and deliver the very same verdict upon a book of mineand almost in the same hour and the same breathis a coincidence which outcoincidences any coincidence which i could have imagined with such powers of imagination as i have been favored with and i have not been accustomed to regard them as being small or of an inferior quality it is always a satisfaction to me to remember that whereas i do not know for sure what any other nation thinks of any one of my twentythree volumes i do at least know for a certainty what one nation of fifty millions thinks of one of them at any rate for if the mutual verdict of the top of an empire and the bottom of it does not establish for good and all the judgment of the entire nation concerning that book then the axiom that we can get a sure estimate of a thing by arriving at a general average of all the opinions involved is a fallacy  dictated monday february 10 1907 two months ago december 6 i was dictating a brief account of a private dinner in berlin where the emperor of germany was host and i the chief guest something happened day before yesterday which moves me to take up that matter again  at the dinner his majesty chatted briskly and entertainingly along in easy and flowing english and now and then he interrupted himself to address a remark to me or to some other individual of the guests when the reply had been delivered he resumed his talk i noticed that the table etiquette tallied with that which was the law of my house at home when we had guests that is to say the guests answered when the host favored them with a remark and then quieted down and behaved themselves until they got another chance if i had been in the emperors chair and he in mine i should have felt infinitely comfortable and at home and should have done a world of talking and done it well but i was guest now and consequently i felt less at home from old experience i was familiar with the rules of the game and familiar with their exercise from the high place of host but i was not familiar with the trammelled and less satisfactory position of guest therefore i felt a little strange and out of place but there was no animosityno the emperor was host therefore according to my own rule he had a right to do the talking and it was my honorable duty to intrude no interruptions or other improvements except upon invitation and of course it could be my turn some day some day on some friendly visit of inspection to america it might be my pleasure and distinction to have him as guest at my table then i would give him a rest and a remarkably quiet time  in one way there was a difference between his table and minefor instance atmosphere the guests stood in awe of him and naturally they conferred that feeling upon me for after all i am only human although i regret it when a guest answered a question he did it with deferential voice and manner he did not put any emotion into it and he did not spin it out but got it out of his system as quickly as he could and then looked relieved the emperor was used to this atmosphere and it did not chill his blood maybe it was an inspiration to him for he was alert brilliant and full of animation also he was most gracefully and felicitously complimentary to my booksand i will remark here that the happy phrasing of a compliment is one of the rarest of human gifts and the happy delivery of it another in that other chapter i mentioned the high compliment which he paid to the book old times on the mississippi but there were others among them some gratifying praise of my description in a tramp abroad of certain striking phases of german student life i mention these things here because i shall have occasion to hark back to them presently  dictated tuesday february 12 1907                                       those stars indicate the long chapter which i dictated yesterday a chapter which is much too long for magazine purposes and therefore must wait until this autobiography shall appear in book form five years hence when i am dead five years according to my calculation twentyseven years according to the prediction furnished me a week ago by the latest and most confident of all the palmists who have ever read my future in my hand the emperors dinner and its beerandanecdote appendix covered six hours of diligent industry and this accounts for the extraordinary length of that chapter  a couple of days ago a gentleman called upon me with a message he had just arrived from berlin where he had been acting for our government in a matter concerning tariff revision he being a member of the commission appointed by our government to conduct our share of the affair upon the completion of the commissions labors the emperor invited the members of it to an audience and in the course of the conversation he made a reference to me continuing he spoke of my chapter on the german language in a tramp abroad and characterized it by an adjective which is too complimentary for me to repeat here without bringing my modesty under suspicion then he paid some compliments to the innocents abroad and followed these with the remark that my account in one of my books of certain striking phases of german student life was the best and truest that had ever been written by this i perceive that he remembers that dinner of sixteen years ago for he said the same thing to me about the studentchapter at that time next he said he wished this gentleman to convey two messages to america from him and deliver themone to the president the other to me the wording of the message to me was  convey to mr clemens my kindest regards ask him if he remembers that dinner and ask him why he didnt do any talking  why how could i talk when he was talking he held the age as the pokerclergy say and two cant talk at the same time with good effect it reminds me of the man who was reproached by a friend who said  i think it a shame that you have not spoken to your wife for fifteen years how do you explain it how do you justify it  that poor man said  i didnt want to interrupt her  if the emperor had been at my table he would not have suffered from my silence he would only have suffered from the sorrows of his own solitude if i were not too old to travel i would go to berlin and introduce the etiquette of my own table which tallies with the etiquette observable at other royal tables i would say invite me again your majesty and give me a chance then i would courteously waive rank and do all the talking myself i thank his majesty for his kind message and am proud to have it and glad to express my sincere reciprocation of its sentiments  dictated january 17 1906  rev joseph t harris and i have been visiting general sickles once twenty or twentyfive years ago just as harris was coming out of his gate sunday morning to walk to his church and preach a telegram was put into his hand he read it immediately and then in a manner collapsed it said general sickles died last night at midnight he had been a chaplain under sickles through the war  sidenote 1880  it wasnt so but no matterit was so to harris at the time he walked alongwalked to the churchbut his mind was far away all his affection and homage and worship of his general had come to the fore his heart was full of these emotions he hardly knew where he was in his pulpit he stood up and began the service but with a voice over which he had almost no command the congregation had never seen him thus moved before in his pulpit they sat there and gazed at him and wondered what was the matter because he was now reading in this broken voice and with occasional tears trickling down his face what to them seemed a quite unemotional chapterthat one about moses begat aaron and aaron begat deuteronomy and deuteronomy begat st peter and st peter begat cain and cain begat abeland he was going along with this and half cryinghis voice continually breaking the congregation left the church that morning without being able to account for this most extraordinary thingas it seemed to them that a man who had been a soldier for more than four years and who had preached in that pulpit so many many times on really moving subjects without even the quiver of a lip should break all down over the begats they couldnt understand but there it isany one can see how such a mystery as that would arouse the curiosity of those people to the boilingpoint  harris has had many adventures he has more adventures in a year than anybody else has in five one saturday night he noticed a bottle on his uncles dressingbureau he thought the label said hair restorer and he took it in his room and gave his head a good drenching and sousing with it and carried it back and thought no more about it next morning when he got up his head was a bright green he sent around everywhere and couldnt get a substitute preacher so he had to go to his church himself and preachand he did it he hadnt a sermon in his barrelas it happenedof any lightsome character so he had to preach a very grave onea very serious oneand it made the matter worse the gravity of the sermon did not harmonize with the gayety of his head and the people sat all through it with handkerchiefs stuffed in their mouths to try to keep down their joy and harris told me that he was sure he never had seen his congregationthe whole body of his congregationthe entire body of his congregationabsorbed in interest in his sermon from beginning to end before always there had been an aspect of indifference here and there or wandering somewhere but this time there was nothing of the kind those people sat there as if they thought good for this day and train only we must have all there is of this show not waste any of it and he said that when he came down out of the pulpit more people waited to shake him by the hand and tell him what a good sermon it was than ever before and it seemed a pity that these people should do these fictions in such a placeright in the churchwhen it was quite plain they were not interested in the sermon at all they only wanted to get a near view of his head  well harris saidno harris didnt say i say that as the days went on and sunday followed sunday the interest in harriss hair grew and grew because it didnt stay merely and monotonously green it took on deeper and deeper shades of green and then it would change and become reddish and would go from that to some other colorpurplish yellowish bluish and so onbut it was never a solid color it was always mottled and each sunday it was a little more interesting than it was the sunday beforeand harriss head became famous and people came from new york and boston and south carolina and japan and so on to look there wasnt seatingcapacity for all the people that came while his head was undergoing these various and fascinating mottlings and it was a good thing in several ways because the business had been languishing a little and now a lot of people joined the church so that they could have the show and it was the beginning of a prosperity for that church which has never diminished in all these years                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dcxii  april 5 1907   chapters from my autobiographyxv  by mark twain  dictated october 8 1906  from susys biography of me        papa says that if the collera comes here he will take sour mash to      the mountains   sidenote 1885  this remark about the cat is followed by various entries covering a month in which jean general grant the sculptor gerhardt mrs candace wheeler miss dora wheeler mr frank stockton mrs mary mapes dodge and the widow of general custer appear and drift in procession across the page then vanish forever from the biography then susy drops this remark in the wake of the vanished procession        sour mash is a constant source of anxiety care and pleasure to      papa   i did in truth think a great deal of that old tortoiseshell harlot but i havent a doubt that in order to impress susy i was pretending agonies of solicitude which i didnt honestly feel sour mash never gave me any real anxiety she was always able to take care of herself and she was ostentatiously vain of the fact vain of it to a degree which often made me ashamed of her much as i esteemed her  many persons would like to have the society of cats during the summer vacation in the country but they deny themselves this pleasure because they think they must either take the cats along when they return to the city where they would be a trouble and an encumbrance or leave them in the country houseless and homeless these people have no ingenuity no invention no wisdom or it would occur to them to do as i do rent cats by the month for the summer and return them to their good homes at the end of it early last may i rented a kitten of a farmers wife by the month then i got a discount by taking three they have been good company for about five months now and are still kittensat least they have not grown much and to all intents and purposes are still kittens and as full of romping energy and enthusiasm as they were in the beginning this is remarkable i am an expert in cats but i have not seen a kitten keep its kittenhood nearly so long before  these are beautiful creaturesthese triplets two of them wear the blackest and shiniest and thickest of sealskin vestments all over their bodies except the lower half of their faces and the terminations of their paws the black masks reach down below the eyes therefore when the eyes are closed they are not visible the rest of the face and the gloves and stockings are snow white these markings are just the same on both catsso exactly the same that when you call one the other is likely to answer because they cannot tell each other apart since the cats are precisely alike and cant be told apart by any of us they do not need two names so they have but one between them we call both of them sackcloth and we call the gray one ashes i believe i have never seen such intelligent cats as these before they are full of the nicest discriminations when i read german aloud they weep you can see the tears run down it shows what pathos there is in the german tongue i had not noticed before that all german is pathetic no matter what the subject is nor how it is treated it was these humble observers that brought the knowledge to me i have tried all kinds of german on these cats romance poetry philosophy theology market reports and the result has always been the samethe cats sob and let the tears run down which shows that all german is pathetic french is not a familiar tongue to me and the pronunciation is difficult and comes out of me encumbered with a missouri accent but the cats like it and when i make impassioned speeches in that language they sit in a row and put up their paws palm to palm and frantically give thanks hardly any cats are affected by music but these are when i sing they go reverently away showing how deeply they feel it sour mash never cared for these things she had many noble qualities but at bottom she was not refined and cared little or nothing for theology and the arts  it is a pity to say it but these cats are not above the grade of human beings for i know by certain signs that they are not sincere in their exhibitions of emotion but exhibit them merely to show off and attract attentionconduct which is distinctly human yet with a difference they do not know enough to conceal their desire to show off but the grown human being does what is ambition it is only the desire to be conspicuous the desire for fame is only the desire to be continuously conspicuous and attract attention and be talked about  these cats are like human beings in another way when ashes began to work his fictitious emotions and show off the other members of the firm followed suit in order to be in the fashion that is the way with human beings they are afraid to be outside whatever the fashion happens to be they conform to it whether it be a pleasant fashion or the reverse they lacking the courage to ignore it and go their own way all human beings would like to dress in loose and comfortable and highly colored and showy garments and they had their desire until a century ago when a king or some other influential ass introduced sombre hues and discomfort and ugly designs into masculine clothing the meek public surrendered to the outrage and by consequence we are in that odious captivity today and are likely to remain in it for a long time to come  fortunately the women were not included in the disaster and so their graces and their beauty still have the enhancing help of delicate fabrics and varied and beautiful colors their clothing makes a great opera audience an enchanting spectacle a delight to the eye and the spirit a garden of eden for charm and color the men clothed in dismal black are scattered here and there and everywhere over the garden like so many charred stumps and they damage the effect but cannot annihilate it  in summer we poor creatures have a respite and may clothe ourselves in white garments loose soft and in some degree shapely but in the winterthe sombre winter the depressing winter the cheerless winter when white clothes and bright colors are especially needed to brighten our spirits and lift them upwe all conform to the prevailing insanity and go about in dreary black each man doing it because the others do it and not because he wants to they are really no sincerer than sackcloth and ashes at bottom the sackcloths do not care to exhibit their emotions when i am performing before them they only do it because ashes started it  i would like to dress in a loose and flowing costume made all of silks and velvets resplendent with all the stunning dyes of the rainbow and so would every sane man i have ever known but none of us dares to venture it there is such a thing as carrying conspicuousness to the point of discomfort and if i should appear on fifth avenue on a sunday morning at churchtime clothed as i would like to be clothed the churches would be vacant and i should have all the congregations tagging after me to look and secretly envy and publicly scoff it is the way human beings are made they are always keeping their real feelings shut up inside and publicly exploiting their fictitious ones  next after fine colors i like plain white one of my sorrows when the summer ends is that i must put off my cheery and comfortable white clothes and enter for the winter into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones it is midoctober now and the weather is growing cold up here in the new hampshire hills but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments for here the neighbors are few and it is only of crowds that i am afraid i made a brave experiment the other night to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged on a stormy evening i made a talk before a full house in the village clothed like a ghost and looking as conspicuously all solitary and alone on that platform as any ghost could have looked and i found to my gratification that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings i had brought  i am nearly seventyone and i recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges valuable privileges privileges which are not granted to younger persons little by little i hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter in new york it will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer of my sex will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead  that mention that i have acquired new and great privileges by grace of my age is not an uncalculated remark when i passed the seventieth milestone ten months ago i instantly realized that i had entered a new country and a new atmosphere to all the public i was become recognizably old undeniably old and from that moment everybody assumed a new attitude toward methe reverent attitude granted by custom to ageand straightway the stream of generous new privileges began to flow in upon me and refresh my life since then i have lived an ideal existence and i now believe what choate said last march and which at the time i didnt credit that the best of life begins at seventy for then your work is done you know that you have done your best let the quality of the work be what it may that you have earned your holidaya holiday of peace and contentmentand that thenceforth to the setting of your sun nothing will break it nothing interrupt it  dictated january 22 1907 in an earlier chapter i inserted some verses beginning love came at dawn which had been found among susys papers after her death i was not able to say that they were hers but i judged that they might be for the reason that she had not enclosed them in quotation marks according to her habit when storing up treasures gathered from other people stedman was not able to determine the authorship for me as the verses were new to him but the authorship has now been traced the verses were written by william wilfred campbell a canadian poet and they form a part of the contents of his book called beyond the hills of dream  the authorship of the beautiful lines which my wife and i inscribed upon susys gravestone was untraceable for a time we had found them in a book in india but had lost the book and with it the authors name but in time an application to the editor of notes and queries furnished me the authors name7 and it has been added to the verses upon the gravestone  last night at a dinnerparty where i was present mr peter dunne dooley handed to the host several dollars in satisfaction of a lost bet i seemed to see an opportunity to better my condition and i invited dooley apparently disinterestedly to come to my house friday and play billiards he accepted and i judge that there is going to be a deficit in the dooley treasury as a result in great qualities of the heart and brain dooley is gifted beyond all propriety he is brilliant he is an expert with his pen and he easily stands at the head of all the satirists of this generationbut he is going to walk in darkness friday afternoon it will be a fraternal kindness to teach him that with all his light and culture he does not know all the valuable things and it will also be a fraternal kindness to him to complete his education for himand i shall do this on friday and send him home in that perfected condition  i possess a billiard secret which can be valuable to the dooley sept after i shall have conferred it upon dooleyfor a consideration it is a discovery which i made by accident thirtyeight years ago in my fatherinlaws house in elmira there was a scarred and battered and ancient billiardtable in the garret and along with it a peck of checked and chipped balls and a rackful of crooked and headless cues i played solitaire up there every day with that difficult outfit the table was not level but slanted sharply to the southeast there wasnt a ball that was round or would complete the journey you started it on but would always get tired and stop halfway and settle with a jolty wabble to a standstill on its chipped side i tried making counts with four balls but found it difficult and discouraging so i added a fifth ball then a sixth then a seventh and kept on adding until at last i had twelve balls on the table and a thirteenth to play with my game was caromscaroms solelycaroms plain or caroms with cushion to helpanything that could furnish a count in the course of time i found to my astonishment that i was never able to run fifteen under any circumstances by huddling the balls advantageously in the beginning i could now and then coax fourteen out of them but i couldnt reach fifteen by either luck or skill sometimes the balls would get scattered into difficult positions and defeat me in that way sometimes if i managed to keep them together i would freeze and always when i froze and had to play away from the contact there was sure to be nothing to play at but a wide and uninhabited vacancy  one day mr dalton called on my brotherinlaw on a matter of business and i was asked if i could entertain him awhile until my brotherinlaw should finish an engagement with another gentleman i said i could and took him up to the billiardtable i had played with him many times at the club and knew that he could play billiards tolerably wellonly tolerably wellbut not any better than i could he and i were just a match he didnt know our table he didnt know those balls he didnt know those warped and headless cues he didnt know the southeastern slant of the table and how to allow for it i judged it would be safe and profitable to offer him a bet on my scheme i emptied the avalanche of thirteen balls on the table and said  take a ball and begin mr dalton how many can you run with an outlay like that  he said with the halfaffronted air of a mathematician who has been asked how much of the multiplication table he can recite without a break  i suppose a millioneight hundred thousand anyway  i said you shall hove the privilege of placing the balls to suit yourself and i want to bet you a dollar that you cant run fifteen  i will not dwell upon the sequel at the end of an hour his face was red and wet with perspiration his outer garments lay scattered here and there over the place he was the angriest man in the state and there wasnt a rag or remnant of an injurious adjective left in him anywhereand i had all his small change  when the summer was over we went home to hartford and one day mr george robertson arrived from boston with two or three hours to spare between then and the return train and as he was a young gentleman to whom we were in debt for much social pleasure it was my duty and a welcome duty to make his two or three hours interesting for him so i took him upstairs and set up my billiard scheme for his comfort mine was a good table in perfect repair the cues were in perfect condition the balls were ivory and flawlessbut i knew that mr robertson was my prey just the same for by exhaustive tests with this outfit i had found that my limit was thirtyone i had proved to my satisfaction that whereas i could not fairly expect to get more than six or eight or a dozen caroms out of a run i could now and then reach twenty and twentyfive and after a long procession of failures finally achieve a run of thirtyone but in no case had i ever got beyond thirtyone robertsons game as i knew was a little better than mine so i resolved to require him to make thirtytwo i believed it would entertain him he was one of these brisk and hearty and cheery and selfsatisfied young fellows who are brimful of confidence and who plunge with grateful eagerness into any enterprise that offers a showy test of their abilities i emptied the balls on the table and said  take a cue and a ball george and begin how many caroms do you think you can make out of that layout  he laughed the laugh of the gay and the carefree as became his youth and inexperience and said  i can punch caroms out of that bunch a week without a break  i said place the balls to suit yourself and begin  confidence is a necessary thing in billiards but overconfidence is bad george went at his task with much too much lightsomeness of spirit and disrespect for the situation on his first shot he scored three caroms on his second shot he scored four caroms and on his third shot he missed as simple a carom as could be devised he was very much astonished and said he would not have supposed that careful play could be needed with an acre of bunched balls in front of a person  he began again and played more carefully but still with too much lightsomeness he couldnt seem to learn to take the situation seriously he made about a dozen caroms and broke down he was irritated with himself now and he thought he caught me laughing he didnt i do not laugh publicly at my client when this game is going on i only do it insideor save it for after the exhibition is over but he thought he had caught me laughing and it increased his irritation of course i knew he thought i was laughing privatelyfor i was experienced they all think that and it has a good effect it sharpens their annoyance and debilitates their play  he made another trial and failed once more he was astonished once more he was humiliatedand as for his anger it rose to summerheat he arranged the balls again grouping them carefully and said he would win this time or die when a client reaches this condition it is a good time to damage his nerve further and this can always be done by saying some little mocking thing or other that has the outside appearance of a friendly remarkso i employed this art i suggested that a bet might tauten his nerves and that i would offer one but that as i did not want it to be an expense to him but only a help i would make it smalla cigar if he were willinga cigar that he would fail again not an expensive one but a cheap native one of the crown jewel breed such as is manufactured in hartford for the clergy it set him afire all over i could see the blue flame issue from his eyes he said  make it a hundredand no connecticut cabbageleaf product but havana 25 the box  i took him up but said i was sorry to see him do this because it did not seem to me right or fair for me to rob him under our own roof when he had been so kind to us he said with energy and acrimony  you take care of your own pocket if youll be so good and leave me to take care of mine  and he plunged at the congress of balls with a vindictiveness which was infinitely contenting to me he scored a failureand began to undress i knew it would come to that for he was in the condition now that mr dooley will be in at about that stage of the contest on friday afternoon a clothesrack will be provided for mr dooley to hang his things on as fast as he shall from time to time shed them george raised his voice four degrees and flung out the challenge  double or quits  done i responded in the gentle and compassionate voice of one who is apparently getting sorrier and sorrier  there was an hour and a half of straight disaster after that and if it was a sin to enjoy it it is no matteri did enjoy it it is half a lifetime ago but i enjoy it yet every time i think of it george made failure after failure his fury increased with each failure as he scored it with each defeat he flung off one or another rag of his raiment and every time he started on a fresh inning he made it double or quits once more twice he reached thirty and broke down once he reached thirtyone and broke down these nears made him frantic and i believe i was never so happy in my life except the time a few years later when the rev j h twichell and i walked to boston and he had the celebrated conversation with the hostler at the inn at ashford connecticut  at last when we were notified that patrick was at the door to drive him to his train george owed me five thousand cigars at twentyfive cents apiece and i was so sorry i could have hugged him but he shouted  give me ten minutes more and added stormily its double or quits again and ill win out free of debt or owe you ten thousand cigars and youll pay the funeral expenses  he began on his final effort and i believe that in all my experience among both amateurs and experts i have never seen a cue so carefully handled in my lifetime as george handled his upon this intensely interesting occasion he got safely up to twentyfive and then ceased to breathe so did i he labored along and added a point another point still another point and finally reached thirtyone he stopped there and we took a breath by this time the balls were scattered all down the cushions about a foot or two apart and there wasnt a shot in sight anywhere that any man might hope to make in a burst of anger and confessed defeat he sent his ball flying around the table at random and it crotched a ball that was packed against the cushion and sprang across to a ball against the bank on the opposite side and counted  his luck had set him free and he didnt owe me anything he had used up all his spare time but we carried his clothes to the carriage and he dressed on his way to the station greatly wondered at and admired by the ladies as he drove alongbut he got his train  i am very fond of mr dooley and shall await his coming with affectionate and pecuniary interest  ps saturday he has been here let us not talk about it

1907   chapters from my autobiographyxvi  by mark twain   dictated january 12th 1905  but i am used to having my statements discounted my mother began it before i was seven years old yet all through my life my facts have had a substratum of truth and therefore they were not without preciousness any person who is familiar with me knows how to strike my average and therefore knows how to get at the jewel of any fact of mine and dig it out of its blueclay matrix my mother knew that art when i was seven or eight or ten or twelve years oldalong therea neighbor said to her  do you ever believe anything that that boy says  my mother said  he is the wellspring of truth but you cant bring up the whole well with one bucketand she added i know his average therefore he never deceives me i discount him thirty per cent for embroidery and what is left is perfect and priceless truth without a flaw in it anywhere  now to make a jump of forty years without breaking the connection that word embroidery was used again in my presence and concerning me when i was fifty years old one night at rev frank goodwins house in hartford at a meeting of the monday evening club the monday evening club still exists it was founded about fortyfive years ago by that theological giant rev dr bushnell and some comrades of his men of large intellectual calibre and more or less distinction local or national i was admitted to membership in it in the fall of 1871 and was an active member thenceforth until i left hartford in the summer of 1891 the membership was restricted in those days to eighteen possibly twenty the meetings began about the 1st of october and were held in the private houses of the members every fortnight thereafter throughout the cold months until the 1st of may usually there were a dozen members presentsometimes as many as fifteen there was an essay and a discussion the essayists followed each other in alphabetical order through the season the essayist could choose his own subject and talk twenty minutes on it from ms or orally according to his preference then the discussion followed and each member present was allowed ten minutes in which to express his views the wives of these people were always present it was their privilege it was also their privilege to keep still they were not allowed to throw any light upon the discussion after the discussion there was a supper and talk and cigars this supper began at ten oclock promptly and the company broke up and went away at midnight at least they did except upon one occasion in my recent birthday speech i remarked upon the fact that i have always bought cheap cigars and that is true i have never bought costly ones  well that night at the club meetingas i was sayinggeorge our colored butler came to me when the supper was nearly over and i noticed that he was pale normally his complexion was a clear black and very handsome but now it had modified to old amber he said  mr clemens what are we going to do there is not a cigar in the house but those old wheeling long nines cant nobody smoke them but you they kill at thirty yards it is too late to telephonewe couldnt get any cigars out from townwhat can we do aint it best to say nothing and let on that we didnt think  no i said that would not be honest fetch out the long nineswhich he did  i had just come across those long nines a few days or a week before i hadnt seen a long nine for years when i was a cub pilot on the mississippi in the late 50s i had had a great affection for them because they were not onlyto my mindperfect but you could get a basketful of them for a centor a dime they didnt use cents out there in those days so when i saw them advertised in hartford i sent for a thousand at once they came out to me in badly battered and disreputablelooking old square pasteboard boxes two hundred in a box george brought a box which was caved in on all sides looking the worst it could and began to pass them around the conversation had been brilliantly animated up to that momentbut now a frost fell upon the company that is to say not all of a sudden but the frost fell upon each man as he took up a cigar and held it poised in the airand there in the middle his sentence broke off that kind of thing went on all around the table until when george had completed his crime the whole place was full of a thick solemnity and silence  those men began to light the cigars rev dr parker was the first man to light he took three or four heroic whiffsthen gave it up he got up with the remark that he had to go to the bedside of a sick parishioner he started out rev dr burton was the next man he took only one whiff and followed parker he furnished a pretext and you could see by the sound of his voice that he didnt think much of the pretext and was vexed with parker for getting in ahead with a fictitious ailing client rev mr twichell followed and said he had to go now because he must take the midnight train for boston boston was the first place that occurred to him i suppose  it was only a quarter to eleven when they began to distribute pretexts at ten minutes to eleven all those people were out of the house when nobody was left but george and me i was cheerfuli had no compunctions of conscience no griefs of any kind but george was beyond speech because he held the honor and credit of the family above his own and he was ashamed that this smirch had been put upon it i told him to go to bed and try to sleep it off i went to bed myself at breakfast in the morning when george was passing a cup of coffee i saw it tremble in his hand i knew by that sign that there was something on his mind he brought the cup to me and asked impressively  mr clemens how far is it from the front door to the upper gate  i said it is a hundred and twentyfive steps  he said mr clemens you can start at the front door and you can go plumb to the upper gate and tread on one of them cigars every time  it wasnt true in detail but in essentials it was  the subject under discussion on the night in question was dreams the talk passed from mouth to mouth in the usual serene way  i do not now remember what form my views concerning dreams took at the time i dont remember now what my notion about dreams was then but i do remember telling a dream by way of illustrating some detail of my speech and i also remember that when i had finished it rev dr burton made that doubting remark which contained that word i have already spoken of as having been uttered by my mother in some such connection forty or fifty years before i was probably engaged in trying to make those people believe that now and then by some accident or otherwise a dream which was prophetic turned up in the dreamers mind the date of my memorable dream was about the beginning of may 1858 it was a remarkable dream and i had been telling it several times every year for more than fifteen yearsand now i was telling it again here in the club  in 1858 i was a steersman on board the swift and popular new orleans and st louis packet pennsylvania captain kleinfelter i had been lent to mr brown one of the pilots of the pennsylvania by my owner mr horace e bixby and i had been steering for brown about eighteen months i think then in the early days of may 1858 came a tragic tripthe last trip of that fleet and famous steamboat i have told all about it in one of my books called old times on the mississippi but it is not likely that i told the dream in that book it is impossible that i can ever have published it i think because i never wanted my mother to know about the dream and she lived several years after i published that volume  i had found a place on the pennsylvania for my brother henry who was two years my junior it was not a place of profit it was only a place of promise he was mud clerk mud clerks received no salary but they were in the line of promotion they could become presently third clerk and second clerk then chief clerkthat is to say purser the dream begins when henry had been mud clerk about three months we were lying in port at st louis pilots and steersmen had nothing to do during the three days that the boat lay in port in st louis and new orleans but the mud clerk had to begin his labors at dawn and continue them into the night by the light of pineknot torches henry and i moneyless and unsalaried had billeted ourselves upon our brotherinlaw mr moffet as night lodgers while in port we took our meals on board the boat no i mean i lodged at the house not henry he spent the evenings at the house from nine until eleven then went to the boat to be ready for his early duties on the night of the dream he started away at eleven shaking hands with the family and said goodby according to custom i may mention that handshaking as a goodby was not merely the custom of that family but the custom of the regionthe custom of missouri i may say in all my life up to that time i had never seen one member of the clemens family kiss another oneexcept once when my father lay dying in our home in hannibalthe 24th of march 1847he put his arm around my sisters neck and drew her down and kissed her saying let me die i remember that and i remember the death rattle which swiftly followed those words which were his last these goodbys of henrys were always executed in the family sittingroom on the second floor and henry went from that room and downstairs without further ceremony but this time my mother went with him to the head of the stairs and said goodby again as i remember it she was moved to this by something in henrys manner and she remained at the head of the stairs while he descended when he reached the door he hesitated and climbed the stairs and shook hands goodby once more  in the morning when i awoke i had been dreaming and the dream was so vivid so like reality that it deceived me and i thought it was real in the dream i had seen henry a corpse he lay in a metallic burialcase he was dressed in a suit of my clothing and on his breast lay a great bouquet of flowers mainly white roses with a red rose in the centre the casket stood upon a couple of chairs i dressed and moved toward that door thinking i would go in there and look at it but i changed my mind i thought i could not yet bear to meet my mother i thought i would wait awhile and make some preparation for that ordeal the house was in locust street a little above 13th and i walked to 14th and to the middle of the block beyond before it suddenly flashed upon me that there was nothing real about thisit was only a dream i can still feel something of the grateful upheaval of joy of that moment and i can also still feel the remnant of doubt the suspicion that maybe it was real after all i returned to the house almost on a run flew up the stairs two or three steps at a jump and rushed into that sittingroomand was made glad again for there was no casket there  we made the usual eventless trip to new orleansno it was not eventless for it was on the way down that i had the fight with mr brown8 which resulted in his requiring that i be left ashore at new orleans in new orleans i always had a job it was my privilege to watch the freightpiles from seven in the evening until seven in the morning and get three dollars for it it was a threenight job and occurred every thirtyfive days henry always joined my watch about nine in the evening when his own duties were ended and we often walked my rounds and chatted together until midnight this time we were to part and so the night before the boat sailed i gave henry some advice i said in case of disaster to the boat dont lose your headleave that unwisdom to the passengersthey are competenttheyll attend to it but you rush for the hurricanedeck and astern to one of the lifeboats lashed aft the wheelhouse and obey the mates ordersthus you will be useful when the boat is launched give such help as you can in getting the women and children into it and be sure you dont try to get into it yourself it is summer weather the river is only a mile wide as a rule and you can swim that without any trouble two or three days afterward the boats boilers exploded at ship island below memphis early one morningand what happened afterward i have already told in old times on the mississippi as related there i followed the pennsylvania about a day later on another boat and we began to get news of the disaster at every port we touched at and so by the time we reached memphis we knew all about it  i found henry stretched upon a mattress on the floor of a great building along with thirty or forty other scalded and wounded persons and was promptly informed by some indiscreet person that he had inhaled steam that his body was badly scalded and that he would live but a little while also i was told that the physicians and nurses were giving their whole attention to persons who had a chance of being saved they were shorthanded in the matter of physicians and nurses and henry and such others as were considered to be fatally hurt were receiving only such attention as could be spared from time to time from the more urgent cases but dr peyton a fine and largehearted old physician of great reputation in the community gave me his sympathy and took vigorous hold of the case and in about a week he had brought henry around dr peyton never committed himself with prognostications which might not materialize but at eleven oclock one night he told me that henry was out of danger and would get well then he said at midnight these poor fellows lying here and there all over this place will begin to mourn and mutter and lament and make outcries and if this commotion should disturb henry it will be bad for him therefore ask the physician on watch to give him an eighth of a grain of morphine but this is not to be done unless henry shall show signs that he is being disturbed  oh well never mind the rest of it the physicians on watch were young fellows hardly out of the medical college and they made a mistakethey had no way of measuring the eighth of a grain of morphine so they guessed at it and gave him a vast quantity heaped on the end of a knifeblade and the fatal effects were soon apparent i think he died about dawn i dont remember as to that he was carried to the deadroom and i went away for a while to a citizens house and slept off some of my accumulated fatigueand meantime something was happening the coffins provided for the dead were of unpainted white pine but in this instance some of the ladies of memphis had made up a fund of sixty dollars and bought a metallic case and when i came back and entered the deadroom henry lay in that open case and he was dressed in a suit of my clothing he had borrowed it without my knowledge during our last sojourn in st louis and i recognized instantly that my dream of several weeks before was here exactly reproduced so far as these details wentand i think i missed one detail but that one was immediately supplied for just then an elderly lady entered the place with a large bouquet consisting mainly of white roses and in the centre of it was a red rose and she laid it on his breast  i told the dream there in the club that night just as i have told it here  rev dr burton swung his leonine head around focussed me with his eye and said  when was it that this happened  in june 58  it is a good many years ago have you told it several times since  yes i have a good many times  how many  why i dont know how many  well strike an average how many times a year do you think you have told it  well i have told it as many as six times a year possibly oftener  very well then youve told it well say seventy or eighty times since it happened  yes i said thats a conservative estimate  now then mark a very extraordinary thing happened to me a great many years ago and i used to tell it a number of timesa good many timesevery year for it was so wonderful that it always astonished the hearer and that astonishment gave me a distinct pleasure every time i never suspected that that tale was acquiring any auxiliary advantages through repetition until one day after i had been telling it ten or fifteen years it struck me that either i was getting old and slow in delivery or that the tale was longer than it was when it was born mark i diligently and prayerfully examined that tale with this result that i found that its proportions were now as nearly as i could make oat one part fact straight fact fact pure and undiluted golden fact and twentyfour parts embroidery i never told that tale afterwardsi was never able to tell it again for i had lost confidence in it and so the pleasure of telling it was gone and gone permanently how much of this tale of yours is embroidery  well i said i dont know i dont think any of it is embroidery i think it is all just as i have stated it detail by detail  very well he said then it is all right but i wouldnt tell it any more because if you keep on it will begin to collect embroidery sure the safest thing is to stop now  that was a great many years ago and today is the first time that i have told that dream since dr burton scared me into fatal doubts about it no i dont believe i can say that i dont believe that i ever really had any doubts whatever concerning the salient points of the dream for those points are of such a nature that they are pictures and pictures can be remembered when they are vivid much better than one can remember remarks and unconcreted facts although it has been so many years since i have told that dream i can see those pictures now just as clearly defined as if they were before me in this room i have not told the entire dream there was a good deal more of it i mean i have not told all that happened in the dreams fulfilment after the incident in the deathroom i may mention one detail and that is this when i arrived in st louis with the casket it was about eight oclock in the morning and i ran to my brotherinlaws place of business hoping to find him there but i missed him for while i was on the way to his office he was on his way from the house to the boat when i got back to the boat the casket was gone he had conveyed it out to his house i hastened thither and when i arrived the men were just removing the casket from the vehicle to carry it upstairs i stopped that procedure for i did not want my mother to see the dead face because one side of it was drawn and distorted by the effects of the opium when i went upstairs there stood the two chairsplaced to receive the coffinjust as i had seen them in my dream and if i had arrived two or three minutes later the casket would have been resting upon them precisely as in my dream of several weeks before

jean vary enthusiastically although      she with difficulty concealed her amusement just then soar mash      entered the room and jean believing her hungry asked mamma for      permission to give her

necessary to mention that that monument is in boston susy recognizes that when she mentions sour mash it is not necessary to localize her to susy sour mash is the bunker hill monument of quarry farm  ordinary cats have some partiality for living flies but none for dead ones but susy does not trouble herself to apologize for sour mashs eccentricities of taste this biography was for us and susy knew that nothing that sour mash might do could startle us or need explanation we being aware that she was not an ordinary cat but moving upon a plane far above the prejudices and superstitions which are law to common catdom  once in hartford the flies were so numerous for a time and so troublesome that mrs clemens conceived the idea of paying george9 a bounty on all the flies he might kill the children saw an opportunity here for the acquisition of sudden wealth they supposed that their mother merely wanted to accumulate dead flies for some æsthetic or scientific reason or other and they judged that the more flies she could get the happier she would be so they went into business with george on a commission straightway the dead flies began to arrive in such quantities that mrs clemens was pleased beyond words with the success of her idea next she was astonished that one house could furnish so many she was paying an extravagantly high bounty and it presently began to look as if by this addition to our expenses we were now probably living beyond our income after a few days there was peace and comfort not a fly was discoverable in the house there wasnt a straggler left still to mrs clements surprise the dead flies continued to arrive by the plateful and the bounty expense was as crushing as ever then she made inquiry and found that our innocent little rascals had established a fly trust and had hired all the children in the neighborhood to collect flies on a cheap and unburdensome commission  mrs clemenss experience in this matter was a new one for her but the governments of the world had tried it and wept over it and discarded it every halfcentury since man was created any government could have told her that the best way to increase wolves in america rabbits in australia and snakes in india is to pay a bounty on their scalps then every patriot goes to raising them  from susys biography of me        sept 10 85the other evening clara and i brought down our      new soap bubble water and we all blew soap bubles papa blew his      soap bubles and filled them with tobacco smoke and as the light      shone on then they took very beautiful opaline colors papa would      hold them and then let us catch them in our hand and they felt      delightful to the touch the mixture of the smoke and water had a      singularly pleasant effect   it is human life we are blown upon the world we float buoyantly upon the summer air a little while complacently showing off our grace of form and our dainty iridescent colors then we vanish with a little puff leaving nothing behind but a memoryand sometimes not even that i suppose that at those solemn times when we wake in the deeps of the night and reflect there is not one of us who is not willing to confess that he is really only a soapbubble and as little worth the making  i remember those days of twentyone years ago and a certain pathos clings about them susy with her manifold young charms and her iridescent mind was as lovely a bubble as any we made that dayand as transitory she passed as they passed in her youth and beauty and nothing of her is left but a heartbreak and a memory that longvanished day came vividly back to me a few weeks ago when for the first time in twentyone years i found myself again amusing a child with smokecharged soapbubbles  sidenote 1885  susys next date is november 29th 1885 the eve of my fiftieth birthday it seems a good while ago i must have been rather young for my age then for i was trying to tame an oldfashioned bicycle nine feet high it is to me almost unbelievable at my present stage of life that there have really been people willing to trust themselves upon a dizzy and unstable altitude like that and that i was one of them twichell and i took lessons every day he succeeded and became a master of the art of riding that wild vehicle but i had no gift in that direction and was never able to stay on mine long enough to get any satisfactory view of the planet every time i tried to steal a look at a pretty girl or any other kind of scenery that single moment of inattention gave the bicycle the chance it had been waiting for and i went over the front of it and struck the ground on my head or my back before i had time to realise that something was happening i didnt always go over the front way i had other ways and practised them all but no matter which way was chosen for me there was always one monotonous resultthe bicycle skinned my leg and leaped up into the air and came down on top of me sometimes its wires were so sprung by this violent performance that it had the collapsed look of an umbrella that had had a misunderstanding with a cyclone after each days practice i arrived at home with my skin hanging in ribbons from my knees down i plastered the ribbons on where they belonged and bound them there with handkerchiefs steeped in ponds extract and was ready for more adventures next day it was always a surprise to me that i had so much skin and that it held out so well there was always plenty and i soon came to understand that the supply was going to remain sufficient for all my needs it turned out that i had nine skins in layers one on top of the other like the leaves of a book and some of the doctors said it was quite remarkable  i was full of enthusiasm over this insane amusement my teacher was a young german from the bicycle factory a gentle kindly patient creature with a pathetically grave face he never smiled he never made a remark he always gathered me tenderly up when i plunged off and helped me on again without a word when he had been teaching me twice a day for three weeks i introduced a new gymnasticone that he had never seen beforeand so at last a compliment was wrung from him a thing which i had been risking my life for days to achieve he gathered me up and said mournfully mr clemens you can fall off a bicycle in more different ways than any person i ever saw before  sidenote 1849  a boys life is not all comedy much of the tragic enters into it the drunken trampmentioned in tom sawyer or huck finnwho was burned up in the village jail lay upon my conscience a hundred nights afterward and filled them with hideous dreamsdreams in which i saw his appealing face as i had seen it in the pathetic reality pressed against the windowbars with the red hell glowing behind hima face which seemed to say to me if you had not give me the matches this would not have happened you are responsible for my death i was not responsible for it for i had meant him no harm but only good when i let him have the matches but no matter mine was a trained presbyterian conscience and knew but the one dutyto hunt and harry its slave upon all pretexts and on all occasions particularly when there was no sense or reason in it the trampwho was to blamesuffered ten minutes i who was not to blame suffered three months  the shooting down of poor old smarr in the main street10 at noonday supplied me with some more dreams and in them i always saw again the grotesque closing picturethe great family bible spread open on the profane old mans breast by some thoughtful idiot and rising and sinking to the labored breathings and adding the torture of its leaden weight to the dying struggles we are curiously made in all the throng of gaping and sympathetic onlookers there was not one with common sense enough to perceive that an anvil would have been in better taste there than the bible less open to sarcastic criticism and swifter in its atrocious work in my nightmares i gasped and struggled for breath under the crush of that vast book for many a night  all within the space of a couple of years we had two or three other tragedies and i had the illluck to be too near by on each occasion there was the slave man who was struck down with a chunk of slag for some small offence i saw him die and the young california emigrant who was stabbed with a bowie knife by a drunken comrade i saw the red life gush from his breast and the case of the rowdy young hyde brothers and their harmless old uncle one of them held the old man down with his knees on his breast while the other one tried repeatedly to kill him with an allen revolver which wouldnt go off i happened along just then of course  then there was the case of the young california emigrant who got drunk and proposed to raid the welshmans house all alone one dark and threatening night11 this house stood halfway up hollidays hill cardiff hill and its sole occupants were a poor but quite respectable widow and her young and blameless daughter the invading ruffian woke the whole village with his ribald yells and coarse challenges and obscenities i went up there with a comradejohn briggs i thinkto look and listen the figure of the man was dimly risible the women were on their porch but not visible in the deep shadow of its roof but we heard the elder womans voice she had loaded an old musket with slugs and she warned the man that if he stayed where he was while she counted ten it would cost him his life she began to count slowly he began to laugh he stopped laughing at six then through the deep stillness in a steady voice followed the rest of the tale seven  eight  ninea long pause we holding our breathten a red spout of flame gushed out into the night and the man dropped with his breast riddled to rags then the rain and the thunder burst loose and the waiting town swarmed up the hill in the glare of the lightning like an invasion of ants those people saw the rest i had had my share and was satisfied i went home to dream and was not disappointed  my teaching and training enabled me to see deeper into these tragedies than an ignorant person could have done i knew what they were for i tried to disguise it from myself but down in the secret deeps of my heart i knewand i knew that i knew they were inventions of providence to beguile me to a better life it sounds curiously innocent and conceited now but to me there was nothing strange about it it was quite in accordance with the thoughtful and judicious ways of providence as i understood them it would not have surprised me nor even overflattered me if providence had killed off that whole community in trying to save an asset like me educated as i had been it would have seemed just the thing and well worth the expense why providence should take such an anxious interest in such a propertythat idea never entered my head and there was no one in that simple hamlet who would have dreamed of putting it there for one thing no one was equipped with it  it is quite true i took all the tragedies to myself and tallied them off in turn as they happened saying to myself in each case with a sigh another one goneand on my account this ought to bring me to repentance his patience will not always endure and yet privately i believed it would that is i believed it in the daytime but not in the night with the going down of the sun my faith failed and the clammy fears gathered about my heart it was then that i repented those were awful nights nights of despair nights charged with the bitterness of death after each tragedy i recognized the warning and repented repented and begged begged like a coward begged like a dog and not in the interest of those poor people who had been extinguished for my sake but only in my own interest it seems selfish when i look back on it now  my repentances were very real very earnest and after each tragedy they happened every night for a long time but as a rule they could not stand the daylight they faded out and shredded away and disappeared in the glad splendor of the sun they were the creatures of fear and darkness and they could not live out of their own place the day gave me cheer and peace and at night i repented again in all my boyhood life i am not sure that i ever tried to lead a better life in the daytimeor wanted to in my age i should never think of wishing to do such a thing but in my age as in my youth night brings me many a deep remorse i realize that from the cradle up i have been like the rest of the racenever quite sane in the night when injun joe died12  but never mind in another chapter i have already described what a raging hell of repentance i passed through then i believe that for months i was as pure as the driven snow after dark  it was back in those fardistant days1848 or 9that jim wolf came to us he was from shelbyville a hamlet thirty or forty miles back in the country and he brought all his native sweetnesses and gentlenesses and simplicities with him he was approaching seventeen a grave and slender lad trustful honest a creature to love and cling to and he was incredibly bashful  it is to this kind that untoward things happen my sister gave a candypull on a winters night i was too young to be of the company and jim was too diffident i was sent up to bed early and jim followed of his own motion his room was in the new part of the house and his window looked out on the roof of the l annex that roof was six inches deep in snow and the snow had an icecrust upon it which was as slick as glass out of the comb of the roof projected a short chimney a common resort for sentimental cats on moonlight nightsand this was a moonlight night down at the eaves below the chimney a canopy of dead vines spread away to some posts making a cozy shelter and after an hour or two the rollicking crowd of young ladies and gentlemen grouped themselves in its shade with their saucers of liquid and pipinghot candy disposed about them on the frozen ground to cool there was joyous chaffing and joking and laughterpeal upon peal of it  about this time a couple of old disreputable tomcats got up on the chimney and started a heated argument about something also about this time i gave up trying to get to sleep and went visiting to jims room he was awake and fuming about the cats and their intolerable yowling i asked him mockingly why he didnt climb out and drive them away he was nettled and said overboldly that for two cents he would  it was a rash remark and was probably repented of before it was fairly out of his mouth but it was too latehe was committed i knew him and i knew he would rather break his neck than back down if i egged him on judiciously  oh of course you would whos doubting it  it galled him and he burst out with sharp irritation  maybe you doubt it  i oh no i shouldnt think of such a thing you are always doing wonderful things with your mouth  he was in a passion now he snatched on his yarn socks and began to raise the window saying in a voice unsteady with anger  you think i dasntyou do think what you blame pleasei dont care what you think ill show you  the window made him rage it wouldnt stay up i said  never mind ill hold it  indeed i would have done anything to help i was only a boy and was already in a radiant heaven of anticipation he climbed carefully out clung to the windowsill until his feet were safely placed then began to pick his perilous way on all fours along the glassy comb a foot and a hand on each side of it i believe i enjoy it now as much as i did then yet it is a good deal over fifty years ago the frosty breeze flapped his short shirt about his lean legs the crystal roof shone like polished marble in the intense glory of the moon the unconscious cats sat erect upon the chimney alertly watching each other lashing their tails and pouring out their hollow grievances and slowly and cautiously jim crept on flapping as he went the gay and frolicsome young creatures under the vinecanopy unaware and outraging these solemnities with their misplaced laughter every time jim slipped i had a hope but always on he crept and disappointed it at last he was within reaching distance he paused raised himself carefully up measured his distance deliberately then made a frantic grab at the nearest catand missed of course he lost his balance his heels flew up he struck on his back and like a rocket he darted down the roof feet first crashed through the dead vines and landed in a sitting posture in fourteen saucers of redhot candy in the midst of all that partyand dressed as he was this lad who could not look a girl in the face with his clothes on there was a wild scramble and a storm of shrieks and jim fled up the stairs dripping broken crockery all the way  sidenote 1867  the incident was ended but i was not done with it yet though i supposed i was eighteen or twenty years later i arrived in new york from california and by that time i had failed in all my other undertakings and had stumbled into literature without intending it this was early in 1867 i was offered a large sum to write something for the sunday mercury and i answered with the tale of jim wolf and the cats i also collected the money for ittwentyfive dollars it seemed overpay but i did not say anything about that for i was not so scrupulous then as i am now  a year or two later jim wolf and the cats appeared in a tennessee paper in a new dressas to spelling spelling borrowed from artemus ward the appropriator of the tale had a wide reputation in the west and was exceedingly popular deservedly so i think he wrote some of the breeziest and funniest things i have ever read and did his work with distinguished ease and fluency his name has passed out of my memory  a couple of years went by then the original storymy own versioncropped up again and went floating around in the spelling and with my name to it soon first one paper and then another fell upon me rigorously for stealing jim wolf and the cats from the tennessee man i got a merciless beating but i did not mind it its all in the game besides i had learned a good while before that that it is not wise to keep the fire going under a slander unless you can get some large advantage out of keeping it alive few slanders can stand the wear of silence  sidenote 1873  sidenote 1900  but i was not done with jim and the cats yet in 1873 i was lecturing in london in the queens concert rooms hanover square and was living at the langham hotel portland place i had no domestic household and no official household except george dolby lectureagent and charles warren stoddard the california poet now 1900 professor of english literature in the roman catholic university washington ostensibly stoddard was my private secretary in reality he was merely my comradei hired him in order to have his company as secretary there was nothing for him to do except to scrapbook the daily reports of the great trial of the tichborne claimant for perjury but he made a sufficient job out of that for the reports filled six columns a day and he usually postponed the scrapbooking until sunday then he had 36 columns to cut out and paste ina proper labor for hercules he did his work well but if he had been older and feebler it would have killed him once a week without doubt he does his literary lectures well but also without doubt he prepares them fifteen minutes before he is due on his platform and thus gets into them a freshness and sparkle which they might lack if they underwent the staling process of overstudy  he was good company when he was awake he was refined sensitive charming gentle generous honest himself and unsuspicious of other peoples honesty and i think he was the purest male i have known in mind and speech george dolby was something of a contrast to him but the two were very friendly and sociable together nevertheless dolby was large and ruddy full of life and strength and spirits a tireless and energetic talker and always overflowing with goodnature and bursting with jollity it was a choice and satisfactory menagerie this pensive poet and this gladsome gorilla an indelicate story was a sharp distress to stoddard dolby told him twentyfive a day dolby always came home with us after the lecture and entertained stoddard till midnight me too after he left i walked the floor and talked and stoddard went to sleep on the sofa i hired him for company  dolby had been agent for concerts and theatres and charles dickens and all sorts of shows and attractions for many years he had known the human being in many aspects and he didnt much believe in him but the poet did the waifs and estrays found a friend in stoddard dolby tried to persuade him that he was dispensing his charities unworthily but he was never able to succeed  one night a young american got access to stoddard at the concert rooms and told him a moving tale he said he was living on the surrey side and for some strange reason his remittances had failed to arrive from home he had no money he was out of employment and friendless his girlwife and his new baby were actually suffering for food for the love of heaven could he lend him a sovereign until his remittances should resume stoddard was deeply touched and gave him a sovereign on my account dolby scoffed but stoddard stood his ground each told me his story later in the evening and i backed stoddards judgment dolby said we were women in disguise and not a sane kind of women either  the next week the young man came again his wife was ill with the pleurisy the baby had the bots or something i am not sure of the name of the disease the doctor and the drugs had eaten up the money the poor little family was starving if stoddard in the kindness of his heart could only spare him another sovereign etc etc stoddard was much moved and spared him a sovereign for me dolby was outraged he spoke up and said to the customer  now young man you are going to the hotel with us and state your case to the other member of the family if you dont make him believe in you i shant honor this poets drafts in your interest any longer for i dont believe in you myself  the young man was quite willing i found no fault in him on the contrary i believed in him at once and was solicitous to heal the wounds inflicted by dolbys too frank incredulity therefore i did everything i could think of to cheer him up and entertain him and make him feel at home and comfortable i spun many yarns among others the tale of jim wolf and the cats learning that he had done something in a small way in literature i offered to try to find a market for him in that line his face lighted joyfully at that and he said that if i could only sell a small manuscript to tom hoods annual for him it would be the happiest event of his sad life and he would hold me in grateful remembrance always that was a most pleasant night for three of us but dolby was disgusted and sarcastic  next week the baby died meantime i had spoken to tom hood and gained his sympathy the young man had sent his manuscript to him and the very day the child died the money for the ms camethree guineas the young man came with a poor little strip of crape around his arm and thanked me and said that nothing could have been more timely than that money and that his poor little wife was grateful beyond words for the service i had rendered he wept and in fact stoddard and i wept with him which was but natural also dolby wept at least he wiped his eyes and wrung out his handkerchief and sobbed stertorously and made other exaggerated shows of grief stoddard and i were ashamed of dolby and tried to make the young man understand that he meant no harm it was only his way the young man said sadly that he was not minding it his grief was too deep for other hurts that he was only thinking of the funeral and the heavy expenses which  we cut that short and told him not to trouble about it leave it all to us send the bills to mr dolby and  yes said dolby with a mock tremor in his voice send them to me and i will pay them what are you going you must not go alone in your worn and broken condition mr stoddard and i will go with you come stoddard we will comfort the bereaved mamma and get a lock of the babys hair  it was shocking we were ashamed of him again and said so but he was not disturbed he said  oh i know this kind the woods are full of them ill make this offer if he will show me his family i will give him twenty pounds come the young man said he would not remain to be insulted and he said goodnight and took his hat but dolby said he would go with him and stay by him until he found the family stoddard went along to soothe the young man and modify dolby they drove across the river and all over southwark but did not find the family at last the young man confessed there wasnt any  the thing he sold to tom hoods annual was jim and the cats and he did not put my name to it  so that small tale was sold three times i am selling it again now it is one of the best properties i have come across

biography of me in which the biographer does not scatter according to her custom but sticks pretty steadily to a single subject until she has fought it to a finish        feb 27 86last summer while we were in elmira an article      came out in the christian union by name what ought he to have      done treating of the government of children or rather giving an      account of a fathers battle with his little baby boy by the mother      of the child and put in the form of a question as to whether the      father disciplined the child corectly or not different people      wrote their opinions of the fathers behavior and told what they      thought he should have done mamma had long known how to disciplin      children for in fact the bringing up of children had been one of      her specialties for many years she had a great many theories but      one of them was that if a child was big enough to be nauty it was      big enough to be whipped and here we all agreed with her i      remember one morning when dr  came up to the farm he had a      long discussion with mamma upon the following topic mamma gave      this as illustrative of one important rule for punishing a child      she said we will suppose the boy has thrown a handkerchief onto the      floor i tell him to pick it up he refuses i tell him again he      refuses then i say you must either pick up the handkerchief or      have a whipping my theory is never to make a child have a whipping      and pick up the handkerchief too i say if you do not pick it up      i must punish you if he doesnt he gets the whipping but i      pick up the handkerchief if he does he gets no punishment i tell      him to do a thing if he disobeys me he is punished for so doing      but not forced to obey me afterwards       when clara and i had been very nauty or were being very nauty the      nurse would go and call mamma and she would appear suddenly and      look at us she had a way of looking at us when she was displeased      as if she could see right through us till we were ready to sink      through the floor from embarasment and total absence of knowing      what to say this look was usually followed with clara or susy      what do you mean by this do you want to come to the bathroom with      me then followed the climax for clara and i both new only too      well what going to the bathroom meant       but mammas first and foremost object was to make the child      understand that he is being punished for his sake and because      the mother so loves him that she cannot allow him to do wrong also      that it is as hard for her to punish him as for him to be punished      and even harder mamma never allowed herself to punish us when she      was angry with us she never struck us because she was enoyed at us      and felt like striking us if we had been nauty and had enoyed her      so that she thought she felt or would show the least bit of temper      toward us while punnishing us she always postponed the punishment      until she was no more chafed by our behavior she never humored      herself by striking or punishing us because or while she was the      least bit enoyed with us       our very worst nautinesses were punished by being taken to the      bathroom and being whipped by the paper cutter but after the      whipping was over mamma did not allow us to leave her until we      were perfectly happy and perfectly understood why we had been      whipped i never remember having felt the least bit bitterly toward      mamma for punishing me i always felt i had deserved my punishment      and was much happier for having received it for after mamma had      punished us and shown her displeasure she showed no signs of      further displeasure but acted as if we had not displeased her in      any way   ordinary punishments answered very well for susy she was a thinker and would reason out the purpose of them apply the lesson and achieve the reform required but it was much less easy to devise punishments that would reform clara this was because she was a philosopher who was always turning her attention to finding something good and satisfactory and entertaining in everything that came her way consequently it was sometimes pretty discouraging to the troubled mother to find that after all her pains and thought in inventing what she meant to be a severe and reformcompelling punishment the child had entirely missed the severities through her native disposition to get interest and pleasure out of them as novelties the mother in her anxiety to find a penalty that would take sharp hold and do its work effectively at last resorted with a sore heart and with a reproachful conscience to that punishment which the incorrigible criminal in the penitentiary dreads above all the other punitive miseries which the warden inflicts upon him for his goodsolitary confinement in the dark chamber the grieved and worried mother shut clara up in a very small clothescloset and went away and left her therefor fifteen minutesit was all that the motherheart could endure then she came softly back and listenedlistened for the sobs but there werent any there were muffled and inarticulate sounds but they could not be construed into sobs the mother waited half an hour longer by that time she was suffering so intensely with sorrow and compassion for the little prisoner that she was not able to wait any longer for the distressed sounds which she had counted upon to inform her when there had been punishment enough and the reform accomplished she opened the closet to set the prisoner free and take her back into her loving favor and forgiveness but the result was not the one expected the captive had manufactured a fairy cavern out of the closet and friendly fairies out of the clothes hanging from the hooks and was having a most sinful and unrepentant good time and requested permission to spend the rest of the day there  from susys biography of me        but mammas oppinions and ideas upon the subject of bringing up      children has always been more or less of a joke in our family      perticularly since papas article in the christian union and i      am sure clara and i have related the history of our old family      papercutter our punishments and privations with rather more pride      and triumph than any other sentiment because of mammas way of      rearing us       when the article what ought he to have done came out mamma read      it and was very much interested in it and when papa heard that      she had read it he went to work and secretly wrote his opinion of      what the father ought to have done he told aunt susy clara and i      about it but mamma was not to see it or hear any thing about it      till it came out he gave it to aunt susy to read and after clara      and i had gone up to get ready for bed he brought it up for us to      read he told what he thought the father ought to have done by      telling what mamma would have done the article was a beautiful      tribute to mamma and every word in it true but still in writing      about mamma he partly forgot that the article was going to be      published i think and expressed himself more fully than he would      do the second time he wrote it i think the article has done and      will do a great deal of good and i think it would have been      perfect for the family and friends enjoyment but a little bit too      private to have been published as it was and papa felt so too      because the very next day or a few days after he went down to new      york to see if he couldnt get it back before it was published but      it was too late and he had to return without it when the      christian union reached the farm and papas article in it all ready      and waiting to be read to mamma papa hadnt the courage to show it      to her for he knew she wouldnt like it at all at first and he      didnt but he might have let it go and never let her see it but      finally he gave his consent to her seeing it and told clara and i      we could take it to her which we did with tardiness and we all      stood around mamma while she read it all wondering what she would      say and think about it       she was too much surprised and pleased privately too to say      much at first but as we all expected publicly or rather when she      remembered that this article was to be read by every one that took      the christian union she was rather shocked and a little      displeased       clara and i had great fun the night papa gave it to us to read and      then hide so mamma couldnt see it for just as we were in the      midst of reading it mamma appeared papa following anxiously and      asked why we were not in bed then a scuffle ensued for we told her      it was a secret and tried to hide it but she chased us wherever we      went till she thought it was time for us to go to bed then she      surendered and left us to tuck it under claras matress       a little while after the article was published letters began to      come in to papa crittisizing it there were some very pleasant ones      but a few very disagreable one of these the very worst mamma got      hold of and read to papas great regret it was full of the most      disagreble things and so very enoying to papa that he for a time      felt he must do something to show the author of it his great      displeasure at being so insulted but he finally decided not to      because he felt the man had some cause for feeling enoyed at for      papa had spoken of him he was the babys father rather      slightingly in his christian union article       after all this papa and mamma both wished i think they might never      hear or be spoken to on the subject of the christian union article      and whenever any has spoken to me and told me how much they did      enjoy my fathers article in the christian union i almost laughed      in their faces when i remembered what a great variety of oppinions      had been expressed upon the subject of the christian union article      of papas       the article was written in july or august and just the other day      papa received quite a bright letter from a gentleman who has read      the c u article and gave his opinion of it in these words   it is missing she probably put the letter between the leaves of the biography and it got lost out she threw away the hostile letters but tried to keep the pleasantest one for her book surely there has been no kindlier biographer than this one yet to a quite creditable degree she is loyal to the responsibilities of her position as historiannot eulogistand honorably gives me a quiet prod now and then but how many many many she has withheld that i deserved i could prize them now there would be no acid in her words and it is loss to me that she did not set them all down oh susy you sweet little biographer you break my old heart with your gentle charities  i think a great deal of her work her canvases are on their easels and her brush flies about in a carefree and random way delivering a dash here a dash there and another yonder and one might suppose that there would be no definite result on the contrary i think that an intelligent reader of her little book must find that by the time he has finished it he has somehow accumulated a pretty clear and nicely shaded idea of the several members of this familyincluding susy herselfand that the random dashes on the canvases have developed into portraits i feel that my own portrait with some of the defects fined down and others left out is here and i am sure that any who knew the mother will recognize her without difficulty and will say that the lines are drawn with a just judgment and a sure hand little creature though susy was the penetration which was born in her finds its way to the surface more than once in these pages  before susy began the biography she let fall a remark now and then concerning my character which showed that she had it under observation in the record which we kept of the childrens sayings there is an instance of this she was twelve years old at the time we had established a rule that each member of the family must bring a fact to breakfasta fact drawn from a book or from any other source any fact would answer susys first contribution was in substance as follows two great exiles and former opponents in war met in ephesusscipio and hannibal scipio asked hannibal to name the greatest general the world had produced  alexanderand he explained why  and the next greatest  pyrrhusand he explained why  but where do you place yourself then  if i had conquered you i would place myself before the others  susys grave comment was  that attracted me it was just like papahe is so frank about his books  so frank in admiring them she meant   thursday march 28 1907 some months ago i commented upon a chapter of susys biography wherein she very elaborately discussed an article about the training and disciplining of children which i had published in the christian union this was twentyone years ago an article which was full of worshipful praises of mrs clemens as a mother and which little clara and susy and i had been hiding from this lovely and admirable mother because we knew she would disapprove of public and printed praises of herself at the time that i was dictating these comments several months ago i was trying to call back to my memory some of the details of that article but i was not able to do it and i wished i had a copy of the article so that i could see what there was about it which gave it such large interest for susy  yesterday afternoon i elected to walk home from the luncheon at the st regis which is in 56th street and fifth avenue for it was a fine spring day and i hadnt had a walk for a year or two and felt the need of exercise as i walked along down fifth avenue the desire to see that christian union article came into my head again i had just reached the corner of 42nd street then and there was the usual jam of wagons carriages and automobiles there i stopped to let it thin out before trying to cross the street but a stranger who didnt require as much room as i do came racing by and darted into a crack among the vehicles and made the crossing but on his way past me he thrust a couple of ancient newspaper clippings into my hand and said  there you dont know me but i have saved them in my scrapbook for twenty years and it occurred to me this morning that perhaps you would like to see them so i was carrying them downtown to mail them i not expecting to run across you in this accidental way of course but i will give them into your own hands now goodbyand he disappeared among the wagons  those scraps which he had put into my hand were ancient newspaper copies of that christian union article it is a handsome instance of mental telegraphyor if it isnt that it is a handsome case of coincidence  from the biography        march 14th 86mr laurence barrette and mr and mrs hutton      were here a little while ago and we had a very interesting visit      from them papa said mr barette never had acted so well before      when he had seen him as he did the first night he was staying with      us and mrs  said she never had seen an actor on the stage      whom she more wanted to speak with       papa has been very much interested of late in the mind cure      theory and in fact so have we all a young lady in town has worked      wonders by using the mind cure upon people she is constantly      busy now curing peoples deseases in this wayand curing her own      even which to me seems the most remarkable of all       a little while past papa was delighted with the knowledge of what      he thought the best way of curing a cold which was by starving it      this starving did work beautifully and freed him from a great many      severe colds now he says it wasnt the starving that helped his      colds but the trust in the starving the mind cure connected with      the starving       i shouldnt wonder if we finally became firm believers in mind      cure the next time papa has a cold i havent a doubt he will      send for miss h the young lady who is doctoring in the mind      cure theory to cure him of it       mamma was over at mrs george warners to lunch the other day and      miss h was there too mamma asked if anything as natural as      near sightedness could be cured she said oh yes just as well as      other deseases       when mamma came home she took me into her room and told me that      perhaps my nearsightedness could be cured by the mind cure and      that she was going to have me try the treatment any way there      could be no harm in it and there might be great good if her plan      succeeds there certainly will be a great deal in mind cure to my      oppinion for i am very near sighted and so is mamma and i never      expected there could be any more cure for it than for blindness      but now i dont know but what theres a cure for that   it was a disappointment her nearsightedness remained with her to the end she was born with it no doubt yet strangely enough she must have been four years old and possibly five before we knew of its existence it is not easy to understand how that could have happened i discovered the defect by accident i was halfway up the hall stairs one day at home and was leading her by the hand when i glanced back through the open door of the diningroom and saw what i thought she would recognise as a pretty picture it was stray kit the slender the graceful the sociable the beautiful the incomparable the cat of cats the tortoiseshell curled up as round as a wheel and sound asleep on the firered cover of the diningtable with a brilliant stream of sunlight falling across her i exclaimed about it but susy said she could see nothing there neither cat nor tablecloth the distance was so slightnot more than twenty feet perhapsthat if it had been any other child i should not have credited the statement  from the biography        march 14th 86clara sprained her ankle a little while ago      by running into a tree when coasting and while she was unable to      walk with it she played solotaire with cards a great deal while      clara was sick and papa saw her play solotaire so much he got very      much interested in the game and finally began to play it himself a      little then jean took it up and at last mamma even played it      ocasionally jeans and papas love for it rapidly increased and      now jean brings the cards every night to the table and papa and      mamma help her play and before dinner is at an end papa has      gotten a separate pack of cards and is playing alone with great      interest mamma and clara next are made subject to the contagious      solatair and there are four solotaireans at the table while you      hear nothing but fill up the place etc it is dreadful after      supper clara goes into the library and gets a little red mahogany      table and placing it under the gas fixture seats herself and      begins to play again then papa follows with another table of the      same discription and they play solatair till bedtime       we have just had our prince and pauper pictures taken two groups      and some little single ones the groups the interview and lady      jane grey scene were pretty good the lady jane scene was perfect      just as pretty as it could be the interview was not so good and      two of the little single pictures were very good indeed but one      was very bad yet on the whole we think they were a success       papa has done a great deal in his life i think that is good and      very remarkable but i think if he had had the advantages with      which he could have developed the gifts which he has made no use of      in writing his books or in any other way for other peoples      pleasure and benefit outside of his own family and intimate      friends he could have done more than he has and a great deal      more even he is known to the public as a humorist but he has much      more in him that is earnest than that is humorous he has a keen      sense of the ludicrous notices funny stories and incidents knows      how to tell them to improve upon them and does not forget them      he has been through a great many of the funny adventures related in      tom sawyer and in huckleberry finn himself and he lived among      just such boys and in just such villages all the days of his early      life his prince and pauper is his most orriginal and best      production it shows the most of any of his books what kind of      pictures are in his mind usually not that the pictures of england      in the 16th century and the adventures of a little prince and      pauper are the kind of things he mainly thinks about but that      that book and those pictures represent the train of thought and      imagination he would be likely to be thinking of today tomorrow      or next day more nearly than those given in tom sawyer or      huckleberry finn13       papa can make exceedingly bright jokes and he enjoys funny things      and when he is with people he jokes and laughs a great deal but      still he is more interested in earnest books and earnest subjects      to talk upon than in humorous ones14       when we are all alone at home nine times out of ten he talks      about some very earnest subjects with an ocasional joke thrown      in and he a good deal more often talks upon such subjects than      upon the other kind       he is as much of a pholosopher as anything i think i think he      could have done a great deal in this direction if he had studied      while young for he seems to enjoy reasoning out things no matter      what in a great many such directions he has greater ability than      in the gifts which have made him famous   thus at fourteen she had made up her mind about me and in no timorous or uncertain terms had set down her reasons for her opinion fifteen years were to pass before any other criticexcept mr howells i thinkwas to reutter that daring opinion and print it right or wrong it was a brave position for that little analyser to take she never withdrew it afterward nor modified it she has spoken of herself as lacking physical courage and has evinced her admiration of claras but she had moral courage which is the rarest of human qualities and she kept it functionable by exercising it i think that in questions of morals and politics she was usually on my side but when she was not she had her reasons and maintained her ground two years after she passed out of my life i wrote a philosophy of the three persons who have seen the manuscript only one understood it and all three condemned it if she could have read it she also would have condemned it possiblyprobably in factbut she would have understood it it would have had no difficulties for her on that score also she would have found a tireless pleasure in analyzing and discussing its problems                                                       mark twain

and papa acted some very funny      charades with mr gherhardt mr jesse grant who had come up from      new york and was spending the evening with us and mr frank      warner one of them was on his knees honyssneeze there were a      good many other funny ones all of which i dont remember mr grant      was very pleasant and began playing the charades in the most      delightful way   susys spelling has defeated me this time i cannot make out what honyssneeze stands for impromptu charades were almost a nightly pastime of ours from the childrens earliest daysthey played in them with me when they were only five or six years old as they increased in years and practice their love for the sport almost amounted to a passion and they acted their parts with a steadily increasing ability at first they required much drilling but later they were generally ready as soon as the parts were assigned and they acted them according to their own devices their stage facility and absence of constraint and selfconsciousness in the prince and pauper was a result of their charading practice  at ten and twelve susy wrote plays and she and daisy warner and clara played them in the library or upstairs in the schoolroom with only themselves and the servants for audience they were of a tragic and tremendous sort and were performed with great energy and earnestness they were dramatized freely from english history and in them mary queen of scots and elizabeth had few holidays the clothes were borrowed from the mothers wardrobe and the gowns were longer than necessary but that was not regarded as a defect in one of these plays jean three years old perhaps was sir francis bacon she was not dressed for the part and did not have to say anything but sat silent and decorous at a tiny table and was kept busy signing deathwarrants it was a really important office for few entered those plays and got out of them alive        march 26mamma and papa have been in new york for two or three      days and miss corey has been staying with us they are coming home      today at two oclock       papa has just begun to play chess and he is very fond of it so he      has engaged to play with mrs charles warner every morning from 10      to 12 he came down to supper last night full of this pleasant      prospect but evidently with something on his mind finally he said      to mamma in an appologetical tone susy warner and i have a plan       well mamma said what now i wonder       papa said that susy warner and he were going to name the chess      after some of the old bible heroes and then play chess on sunday        april 18 86mamma and papa clara and daisy have gone to new      york to see the mikado they are coming home tonight at half      past seven       last winter when

brandnew wife to rebegin life with  dictated nov 19 1906        ever since papa and mamma were married papa has written his books      and then taken them to mamma in manuscript and she has expergated      them papa read huckleberry finn to us in manuscript just before      it came out and then he would leave parts of it with mamma to      expergate while he went off up to the study to work and sometimes      clara and i would be sitting with mamma while she was looking the      manuscript over and i remember so well with what pangs of regret      we used to see her turn down the leaves of the pages which meant      that some delightfully dreadful part must be scratched out and i      remember one part pertickularly which was perfectly fascinating it      was dreadful that clara and i used to delight in and oh with what      dispair we saw mamma turn down the leaf on which it was written we      thought the book would be almost ruined without it but we      gradually came to feel as mamma did   it would be a pity to replace the vivacity and quaintness and felicity of susys innocent free spelling with the dull and petrified uniformities of the spellingbook nearly all the grimness it taken out of the expergating of my books by the subtle mollification accidentally infused into the word by susys modification of the spelling of it  i remember the special case mentioned by susy and can see the group yettwothirds of it pleading for the life of the culprit sentence that was so fascinatingly dreadful and the other third of it patiently explaining why the court could not grant the prayer of the pleaders but i do not remember what the condemned phrase was it had much company and they all went to the gallows but it is possible that that specially dreadful one which gave those little people so much delight was cunningly devised and put into the book for just that function and not with any hope or expectation that it would get by the expergator alive it is possible for i had that custom  susys quaint and effective spelling falls quite opportunely into todays atmosphere which is heavy with the rumblings and grumblings and mutterings of the simplified spelling reform andrew carnegie started this storm a couple of years ago by moving a simplifying of english orthography and establishing a fund for the prosecution and maintenance of the crusade he began gently he addressed a circular to some hundreds of his friends asking them to simplify the spelling of a dozen of our badly spelt wordsi think they were only words which end with the superfluous ugh he asked that these friends use the suggested spellings in their private correspondence  by this one perceives that the beginning was sufficiently quiet and unaggressive  next stage a small committee was appointed with brander matthews for managing director and spokesman it issued a list of three hundred words of average silliness as to spelling and proposed new and sane spellings for these words the president of the united states unsolicited adopted these simplified three hundred officially and ordered that they be used in the official documents of the government it was now remarked by all the educated and the thoughtful except the clergy that sheol was to pay this was most justly and comprehensively descriptive the indignant british lion rose with a roar that was heard across the atlantic and stood there on his little isle gazing redeyed out over the glooming seas snowflecked with driving spindrift and lathing his taila most scary spectacle to see  the lion was outraged because we a nation of children without any grownup people among us with no property in the language but using it merely by courtesy of its owner the english nation were trying to defile the sacredness of it by removing from it peculiarities which had been its ornament and which had made it holy and beautiful for ages  in truth there is a certain sardonic propriety in preserving our orthography since ours is a mongrel language which started with a childs vocabulary of three hundred words and now consists of two hundred and twentyfive thousand the whole lot with the exception of the original and legitimate three hundred borrowed stolen smouched from every unwatched language under the sun the spelling of each individual word of the lot locating the source of the theft and preserving the memory of the revered crime  why is it that i have intruded into this turmoil and manifested a desire to get our orthography purged of its asininities indeed i do not know why i should manifest any interest in the matter for at bottom i disrespect our orthography most heartily and as heartily disrespect everything that has been said by anybody in defence of it nothing professing to be a defence of our ludicrous spellings has had any basis so far as my observation goes except sentimentality in these arguments the term venerable is used instead of mouldy and hallowed instead of devilish whereas there is nothing properly venerable or antique about a language which is not yet four hundred years old and about a jumble of imbecile spellings which were grotesque in the beginning and which grow more and more grotesque with the flight of the years  dictated monday november 30 1906        jean and papa were walking out past the barn the other day when      jean saw some little newly born baby ducks she exclaimed as she      perceived them i dont see why god gives us so much ducks when      patrick kills them so   susy is mistaken as to the origin of the ducks they were not a gift i bought them i am not finding fault with her for that would be most unfair she is remarkably accurate in her statements as a historian as a rule and it would not be just to make much of this small slip of hers besides i think it was a quite natural slip for by heredity and habit ours was a religious household and it was a common thing with us whenever anybody did a handsome thing to give the credit of it to providence without examining into the matter this may be called automatic religionin fact that is what it is it is so used to its work that it can do it without your help or even your privity out of all the facts and statistics that may be placed before it it will always get the one result since it has never been taught to seek any other it is thus the unreflecting cause of much injustice as we have seen it betrayed susy into an injustice toward me it had to be automatic for she would have been far from doing me an injustice when in her right mind it was a dear little biographer and she meant me no harm and i am not censuring her now but am only desirous of correcting in advance an erroneous impression which her words would be sure to convey to a readers mind no elaboration of this matter is necessary it is sufficient to say i provided the ducks  it was in hartford the greensward sloped downhill from the house to the sluggish little river that flowed through the grounds and patrick who was fertile in good ideas had early conceived the idea of having homemade ducks for our table every morning he drove them from the stable down to the river and the children were always there to see and admire the waddling white procession they were there again at sunset to see patrick conduct the procession back to its lodgings in the stable but this was not always a gay and happy holiday show with joy in it for the witnesses no too frequently there was a tragedy connected with it and then there were tears and pain for the children there was a stranded log or two in the river and on these certain families of snappingturtles used to congregate and drowse in the sun and give thanks in their dumb way to providence for benevolence extended to them it was but another instance of misplaced credit it was the young ducks that those pious reptiles were so thankful forwhereas they were my ducks i bought the ducks  when a crop of young ducks not yet quite old enough for the table but approaching that age began to join the procession and paddle around in the sluggish water and give thanksnot to mefor that privilege the snappingturtles would suspend their songs of praise and slide off the logs and paddle along under the water and chew the feet of the young ducks presently patrick would notice that two or three of those little creatures were not moving about but were apparently at anchor and were not looking as thankful as they had been looking a short time before he early found out what that sign meanta submerged snappingturtle was taking his breakfast and silently singing his gratitude every day or two patrick would rescue and fetch up a little duck with incomplete legs to stand uponnothing left of their extremities but gnawed and bleeding stumps then the children said pitying things and weptand at dinner we finished the tragedy which the turtles had begun thus as will be seenout of season at leastit was really the turtles that gave us so much ducks at my expense        papa has written a new version of there is a happy land it is        there is a boardinghouse                far far away      where they have ham and eggs                three times a day      oh dont those boarders yell      when they hear the dinnerbell      they give that landlord rats                three times a day   again susy has made a small error it was not i that wrote the song i heard billy rice sing it in the negro minstrel show and i brought it home and sang itwith great spiritfor the elevation of the household the children admired it to the limit and made me sing it with burdensome frequency to their minds it was superior to the battle hymn of the republic  how many years ago that was where now is billy rice he was a joy to me and so were the other stars of the niggershowbilly birch david wambold backus and a delightful dozen of their brethren who made life a pleasure to me forty years ago and later birch wambold and backus are gone years ago and with them departed to return no more forever i suppose the real niggershowthe genuine niggershow the extravagant niggershowthe show which to me had no peer and whose peer has not yet arrived in my experience we have the grand opera and i have witnessed and greatly enjoyed the first act of everything which wagner created but the effect on me has always been so powerful that one act was quite sufficient whenever i have witnessed two acts i have gone away physically exhausted and whenever i have ventured an entire opera the result has been the next thing to suicide but if i could have the niggershow back again in its pristine purity and perfection i should have but little further use for opera it seems to me that to the elevated mind and the sensitive spirit the handorgan and the niggershow are a standard and a summit to whose rarefied altitude the other forms of musical art may not hope to reach  dictated september 5 1906 it is years since i have examined the childrens record i have turned over a few of its pages this morning this book is a record in which mrs clemens and i registered some of the sayings and doings of the children in the long ago when they were little chaps of course we wrote these things down at the time because they were of momentary interestthings of the passing hour and of no permanent valuebut at this distant day i find that they still possess an interest for me and also a value because it turns out that they were registrations of character the qualities then revealed by fitful glimpses in childish acts and speeches remained as a permanency in the childrens characters in the drift of the years and were always afterwards clearly and definitely recognizable  there is a masterful streak in jean that now and then moves her to set my authority aside for a moment and end a losing argument in that prompt and effective fashion and here in this old book i find evidence that she was just like that before she was quite four years old        from the childrens record quarry farm july 7 1884yesterday      evening our cows after being inspected and worshipped by jean from      the shed for an hour wandered off down into the pasture and left      her bereft i thought i was going to get back home now but that      was an error jean knew of some more cows in a field somewhere      and took my hand and led me thitherward when we turned the corner      and took the righthand road i saw that we should presently be out      of range of call and sight so i began to argue against continuing      the expedition and jean began to argue in favor of itshe using      english for light skirmishing and german for business i kept up      my end with vigor and demolished her arguments in detail one      after the other till i judged i had her about cornered she      hesitated a moment then answered up sharply       wir werden nichts mehr darüber sprechen we wont talk any      more about it       it nearly took my breath away though i thought i might possibly      have misunderstood i said       why you little rascal was hast du gesagt       but she said the same words over again and in the same decided      way i suppose i ought to have been outraged but i wasnt i was      charmed and i suppose i ought to have spanked her but i didnt i      fraternized with the enemy and we went on and spent half an hour      with the cows   that incident is followed in the record by the following paragraph which is another instance of a juvenile characteristic maintaining itself into mature age susy was persistently and conscientiously truthful throughout her life with the exception of one interruption covering several months and perhaps a year this was while she was still a little child suddenlynot graduallyshe began to lie not furtively but frankly openly and on a scale quite disproportioned to her size her mother was so stunned so nearly paralyzed for a day or two that she did not know what to do with the emergency reasonings persuasions beseechings all went for nothing they produced no effect the lying went tranquilly on other remedies were tried but they failed there is a tradition that success was finally accomplished by whipping i think the record says so but if it does it is because the record is incomplete whipping was indeed tried and was faithfully kept up during two or three weeks but the results were merely temporary the reforms achieved were discouragingly brief  fortunately for susy an incident presently occurred which put a complete stop to all the mothers efforts in the direction of reform this incident was the chance discovery in darwin of a passage which said that when a child exhibits a sudden and unaccountable disposition to forsake the truth and restrict itself to lying the explanation must be sought away back in the past that an ancestor of the child had had the same disease at the same tender age that it was irremovable by persuasion or punishment and that it had ceased as suddenly and as mysteriously as it had come when it had run its appointed course i think mr darwin said that nothing was necessary but to leave the matter alone and let the malady have its way and perish by the statute of limitations  we had confidence in darwin and after that day susy was relieved of our reformatory persecutions she went on lying without let or hindrance during several months or a year then the lying suddenly ceased and she became as conscientiously and exactingly truthful as she had been before the attack and she remained so to the end of her life  the paragraph in the record to which i have been leading up is in my handwriting and is of a date so long posterior to the time of the lying malady that she had evidently forgotten that truthspeaking had ever had any difficulties for her        mama was speaking of a servant who had been pretty unveracious but      was now trying to tell the truth susy was a good deal surprised      and said she shouldnt think anybody would have to try to tell      the truth   in the record the childrens acts and speeches quite definitely define their characters susys indicated the presence of mentality thoughtand they were generally marked by gravity she was timid on her physical side but had an abundance of moral courage clara was sturdy independent orderly practical persistent pluckyjust a little animal and very satisfactory charles dudley warner said susy was made of mind and clara of matter  when motley the kitten died some one said that the thoughts of the two children need not be inquired into they could be divined that susy was wondering if this was the end of motley and had his life been worth while whereas clara was merely interested in seeing to it that there should be a creditable funeral  in those days susy was a dreamer a thinker a poet and philosopher and clarawell clara wasnt in afteryears a passion for music developed the latent spirituality and intellectuality in clara and her practicality took second and in fact even third place jean was from the beginning orderly steady diligent persistent and remains so she picked up languages easily and kept them        susy aged eleven jean threesusy said the other day when she      saw jean bringing a cat to me of her own motion jean has found      out already that mamma loves morals and papa loves cats   it is another of susys remorselessly sound verdicts  as a child jean neglected my books when she was nine years old will gillette invited her and the rest of us to a dinner at the murray hill hotel in new york in order that we might get acquainted with mrs leslie and her daughters elsie leslie was nine years old and was a great celebrity on the stage jean was astonished and awed to see that little slip of a thing sit up at table and take part in the conversation of the grown people capably and with ease and tranquillity poor jean was obliged to keep still for the subjects discussed never happened to hit her level but at last the talk fell within her limit and she had her chance to contribute to it tom sawyer was mentioned jean spoke gratefully up and said  i know who wrote that bookharriet beecher stowe        one evening susy had prayed clara was curled up for sleep she was      reminded that it was her turn to pray now she laid oh ones      enough and dropped off to slumber       clara five years oldwe were in germany the nurse rosa was      not allowed to speak to the children otherwise than in german      clara grew very tired of it by and by the little creatures      patience was exhausted and she said aunt clara i wish god had      made rosa in english       clara four years old susy sixthis morning when clara      discovered that this is my birthday she was greatly troubled      because she had provided no gift for me and repeated her sorrow      several times finally she went musing to the nursery and presently      returned with her newest and dearest treasure a large toy horse      and said you shall have this horse for your birthday papa       i accepted it with many thanks after an hour she was racing up and      down the room with the horse when susy said       why clara you gave that horse to papa and now youve tooken it      again       clarai never give it to him for always i give it to him for      his birthday        in geneva in september i lay abed late one morning and as clara      was passing through the room i took her on my bed a moment then      the child went to clara spaulding and said       aunt clara papa is a good deal of trouble to me       is he why       well he wants me to get in bed with him and i cant do that with      jelmuls gentlemeni dont like jelmuls anyway       what you dont like gentlemen dont you like uncle theodore      crane

served ten years before came east and we were walking down broadway one day when he said how did you come to steal oliver wendell holmess dedication and put it in your book  i made a careless and inconsequential answer for i supposed he was joking but he assured me that he was in earnest he said im not discussing the question of whether you stole it or didntfor that is a question that can be settled in the first bookstore we come toi am only asking you how you came to steal it for that is where my curiosity is focalized  i couldnt accommodate him with this information as i hadnt it in stock i could have made oath that i had not stolen anything therefore my vanity was not hurt nor my spirit troubled at bottom i supposed that he had mistaken another book for mine and was now getting himself into an untenable place and preparing sorrow for himself and triumph for me we entered a bookstore and he asked for the innocents abroad and for the dainty little blue and gold edition of dr oliver wendell holmess poems he opened the books exposed their dedications and said read them it is plain that the author of the second one stole the first one isnt it  i was very much ashamed and unspeakably astonished we continued our walk but i was not able to throw any gleam of light upon that original question of his i could not remember ever having seen dr holmess dedication i knew the poems but the dedication was new to me  i did not get hold of the key to that secret until months afterward then it came in a curious way and yet it was a natural way for the natural way provided by nature and the construction of the human mind for the discovery of a forgotten event is to employ another forgotten event for its resurrection  sidenote 1866  i received a letter from the rev dr rising who had been rector of the episcopal church in virginia city in my time in which letter dr rising made reference to certain things which had happened to us in the sandwich islands six years before among things he made casual mention of the honolulu hotels poverty in the matter of literature at first i did not see the bearing of the remark it called nothing to my mind but presently it didwith a flash there was but one book in mr kirchhofs hotel and that was the first volume of dr holmess blue and gold series i had had a fortnights chance to get well acquainted with its contents for i had ridden around the big island hawaii on horseback and had brought back so many saddle boils that if there had been a duty on them it would have bankrupted me to pay it they kept me in my room unclothed and in persistent pain for two weeks with no company but cigars and the little volume of poems of course i read them almost constantly i read them from beginning to end then read them backwards then began in the middle and read them both ways then read them wrong end first and upside down in a word i read the book to rags and was infinitely grateful to the hand that wrote it  here we have an exhibition of what repetition can do when persisted in daily and hourly over a considerable stretch of time where one is merely reading for entertainment without thought or intention of preserving in the memory that which is read it is a process which in the course of years dries all the juice out of a familiar verse of scripture leaving nothing but a sapless husk behind in that case you at least know the origin of the husk but in the case in point i apparently preserved the husk but presently forgot whence it came it lay lost in some dim corner of my memory a year or two then came forward when i needed a dedication and was promptly mistaken by me as a child of my own happy fancy  i was new i was ignorant the mysteries of the human mind were a sealed book to me as yet and i stupidly looked upon myself as a tough and unforgivable criminal i wrote to dr holmes and told him the whole disgraceful affair implored him in impassioned language to believe that i had never intended to commit this crime and was unaware that i had committed it until i was confronted with the awful evidence i have lost his answer i could better have afforded to lose an uncle of these i had a surplus many of them of no real value to me but that letter was beyond price beyond uncledom and unsparable in it dr holmes laughed the kindest and healingest laugh over the whole matter and at considerable length and in happy phrase assured me that there was no crime in unconscious plagiarism that i committed it every day that he committed it every day that every man alive on the earth who writes or speaks commits it every day and not merely once or twice but every time he opens his mouth that all our phrasings are spiritualized shadows cast multitudinously from our readings that no happy phrase of ours is ever quite original with us there is nothing of our own in it except some slight change born of our temperament character environment teachings and associations that this slight change differentiates it from another mans manner of saying it stamps it with our special style and makes it our own for the time being all the rest of it being old moldy antique and smelling of the breath of a thousand generations of them that have passed it over their teeth before  in the thirtyodd years which have come and gone since then i have satisfied myself that what dr holmes said was true  i wish to make a note upon the preface of the innocents in the last paragraph of that brief preface i speak of the proprietors of the daily alta california having waived their rights in certain letters which i wrote for that journal while absent on the quaker city trip i was young then i am whiteheaded now but the insult of that word rankles yet now that i am reading that paragraph for the first time in many years reading it for the first time since it was written perhaps there were rights it is truesuch rights as the strong are able to acquire over the weak and the absent early in 66 george barnes invited me to resign my reportership on his paper the san francisco morning call and for some months thereafter i was without money or work then i had a pleasant turn of fortune the proprietors of the sacramento union a great and influential daily journal sent me to the sandwich islands to write four letters a month at twenty dollars apiece i was there four or five months and returned to find myself about the best known honest man on the pacific coast thomas mcguire proprietor of several theatres said that now was the time to make my fortunestrike while the iron was hotbreak into the lecture field i did it i announced a lecture on the sandwich islands closing the advertisement with the remark admission one dollar doors open at halfpast 7 the trouble begins at 8 a true prophecy the trouble certainly did begin at 8 when i found myself in front of the only audience i had ever faced for the fright which pervaded me from head to foot was paralyzing it lasted two minutes and was as bitter as death the memory of it is indestructible but it had its compensations for it made me immune from timidity before audiences for all time to come i lectured in all the principal californian towns and in nevada then lectured once or twice more in san francisco then retired from the field richfor meand laid out a plan to sail westward from san francisco and go around the world the proprietors of the alta engaged me to write an account of the trip for that paperfifty letters of a column and a half each which would be about two thousand words per letter and the pay to be twenty dollars per letter  i went east to st louis to say goodbye to my mother and then i was bitten by the prospectus of captain duncan of the quaker city excursion and i ended by joining it during the trip i wrote and sent the fifty letters six of them miscarried and i wrote six new ones to complete my contract then i put together a lecture on the trip and delivered it in san francisco at great and satisfactory pecuniary profit then i branched out into the country and was aghast at the result i had been entirely forgotten i never had people enough in my houses to sit as a jury of inquest on my lost reputation i inquired into this curious condition of things and found that the thrifty owners of that prodigiously rich alta newspaper had copyrighted all those poor little twentydollar letters and had threatened with prosecution any journal which should venture to copy a paragraph from them  and there i was i had contracted to furnish a large book concerning the excursion to the american publishing co of hartford and i supposed i should need all those letters to fill it out with i was in an uncomfortable situationthat is if the proprietors of this stealthily acquired copyright should refuse to let me use the letters that is just what they did mr macsomethingi have forgotten the rest of his namesaid his firm were going to make a book out of the letters in order to get back the thousand dollars which they had paid for them i said that if they had acted fairly and honorably and had allowed the country press to use the letters or portions of them my lectureskirmish on the coast would have paid me ten thousand dollars whereas the alta had lost me that amount then he offered a compromise he would publish the book and allow me ten per cent royalty on it the compromise did not appeal to me and i said so i was now quite unknown outside of san francisco the books sale would be confined to that city and my royalty would not pay me enough to board me three months whereas my eastern contract if carried out could be profitable to me for i had a sort of reputation on the atlantic seaboard acquired through the publication of six excursionletters in the new york tribune and one or two in the herald  in the end mr mac agreed to suppress his book on certain conditions in my preface i must thank the alta for waiving rights and granting me permission i objected to the thanks i could not with any large degree of sincerity thank the alta for bankrupting my lectureraid after considerable debate my point was conceded and the thanks left out  sidenote 1902  sidenote 1904  sidenote 1897  noah brooks was the editor of the alta at the time a man of sterling character and equipped with a right heart also a good historian where facts were not essential in biographical sketches of me written many years afterward 1902 he was quite eloquent in praises of the generosity of the alta people in giving to me without compensation a book which as history had afterward shown was worth a fortune after all the fuss i did not levy heavily upon the alta letters i found that they were newspaper matter not book matter they had been written here and there and yonder as opportunity had given me a chance workingmoment or two during our feverish flight around about europe or in the furnaceheat of my stateroom on board the quaker city therefore they were loosely constructed and needed to have some of the wind and water squeezed out of them i used several of themten or twelve perhaps i wrote the rest of the innocents abroad in sixty days and i could have added a fortnights labor with the pen and gotten along without the letters altogether i was very young in those days exceedingly young marvellously young younger than i am now younger than i shall ever be again by hundreds of years i worked every night from eleven or twelve until broad day in the morning and as i did two hundred thousand words in the sixty days the average was more than three thousand words a daynothing for sir walter scott nothing for louis stevenson nothing for plenty of other people but quite handsome for me in 1897 when we were living in tedworth square london and i was writing the book called following the equator my average was eighteen hundred words a day here in florence 1904 my average seems to be fourteen hundred words per sitting of four or five hours16  i was deducing from the above that i have been slowing down steadily in these thirtysix years but i perceive that my statistics have a defect three thousand words in the spring of 1868 when i was working seven or eight or nine hours at a sitting has little or no advantage over the sitting of today covering half the time and producing half the output figures often beguile me particularly when i have the arranging of them myself in which case the remark attributed to disraeli would often apply with justice and force  there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics  dictated january 23 1907the proverb says that providence protects children and idiots this is really true i know it because i have tested it it did not protect george through the most of his campaign but it saved him in his last inning and the veracity of the proverb stood confirmed  sidenote 1865  i have several times been saved by this mysterious interposition when i was manifestly in extreme peril it has been common all my life for smart people to perceive in me an easy prey for selfish designs and i have walked without suspicion into the trap set for me yet have often come out unscathed against all the likelihoods more than forty years ago in san francisco the office staff adjourned upon conclusion of its work at two oclock in the morning to a great bowling establishment where there were twelve alleys i was invited rather perfunctorily and as a matter of etiquetteby which i mean that i was invited politely but not urgently but when i diffidently declined with thanks and explained that i knew nothing about the game those lively young fellows became at once eager and anxious and urgent to have my society this flattered me for i perceived no trap and i innocently and gratefully accepted their invitation i was given an alley all to myself the boys explained the game to me and they also explained to me that there would be an hours play and that the player who scored the fewest tenstrikes in the hour would have to provide oysters and beer for the combination this disturbed me very seriously since it promised me bankruptcy and i was sorry that this detail had been overlooked in the beginning but my pride would not allow me to back out now so i stayed in and did what i could to look satisfied and glad i had come it is not likely that i looked as contented as i wanted to but the others looked glad enough to make up for it for they were quite unable to hide their evil joy they showed me how to stand and how to stoop and how to aim the ball and how to let fly and then the game began the results were astonishing in my ignorance i delivered the balls in apparently every way except the right one but no matterduring half an hour i never started a ball down the alley that didnt score a tenstrike every time at the other end the others lost their grip early and their joy along with it now and then one of them got a tenstrike but the occurrence was so rare that it made no show alongside of my giant score the boys surrendered at the end of the halfhour and put on their coats and gathered around me and in courteous but sufficiently definite language expressed their opinion of an experienceworn and seasoned expert who would stoop to lying and deception in order to rob kind and wellmeaning friends who had put their trust in him under the delusion that he was an honest and honorable person i was not able to convince them that i had not lied for now my character was gone and they refused to attach any value to anything i said the proprietor of the place stood by for a while saying nothing then he came to my defence he said it looks like a mystery gentlemen but it isnt a mystery after its explained that is a grooved alley youve only to start a ball down it any way you please and the groove will do the rest it will slam the ball against the northeast curve of the head pin every time and nothing can save the ten from going down  it was true the boys made the experiment and they found that there was no art that could send a ball down that alley and fail to score a tenstrike with it when i had told those boys that i knew nothing about that game i was speaking only the truth but it was ever thus all through my life whenever i have diverged from custom and principle and uttered a truth the rule has been that the hearer hadnt strength of mind enough to believe it  sidenote 1873  a quarter of a century ago i arrived in london to lecture a few weeks under the management of george dolby who had conducted the dickens readings in america five or six years before he took me to the albemarle and fed me and in the course of the dinner he enlarged a good deal and with great satisfaction upon his reputation as a player of fifteenball pool and when he learned by my testimony that i had never seen the game played and knew nothing of the art of pocketing balls he enlarged more and more and still more and kept on enlarging until i recognized that i was either in the presence of the very father of fifteenball pool or in the presence of his most immediate descendant at the end of the dinner dolby was eager to introduce me to the game and show me what he could do we adjourned to the billiardroom and he framed the balls in a flat pyramid and told me to fire at the apex ball and then go on and do what i could toward pocketing the fifteen after which he would take the cue and show me what a pastmaster of the game could do with those balls i did as required i began with the diffidence proper to my ignorant estate and when i had finished my inning all the balls were in the pockets and dolby was burying me under a volcanic irruption of acid sarcasms  so i was a liar in dolbys belief he thought he had been sold and at a cheap rate but he divided his sarcasms quite fairly and quite equally between the two of us he was full of ironical admiration of his childishness and innocence in letting a wandering and characterless and scandalous american load him up with deceptions of so transparent a character that they ought not to have deceived the house cat on the other hand he was remorselessly severe upon me for beguiling him by studied and discreditable artifice into bragging and boasting about his poor game in the presence of a professional expert disguised in lies and frauds who could empty more balls in billiard pockets in an hour than he could empty into a basket in a day  in the matter of fifteenball pool i never got dolbys confidence wholly back though i got it in other ways and kept it until his death i have played that game a number of times since but that first time was the only time in my life that i have ever pocketed all the fifteen in a single inning  sidenote 1876  my unsuspicious nature has made it necessary for providence to save me from traps a number of times thirty years ago a couple of elmira bankers invited me to play the game of quaker with them i had never heard of the game before and said that if it required intellect i should not be able to entertain them but they said it was merely a game of chance and required no mentalityso i agreed to make a trial of it they appointed four in the afternoon for the sacrifice as the place they chose a groundfloor room with a large window in it then they went treacherously around and advertised the sell which they were going to play upon me  i arrived on time and we began the gamewith a large and eager freelist to superintend it these superintendents were outside with their noses pressed against the windowpane the bankers described the game to me so far as i recollect the pattern of it was this they had a pile of mexican dollars on the table twelve of them were of even date fifty of them were of odd dates the bankers were to separate a coin from the pile and hide it under a hand and i must guess odd or even if i guessed correctly the coin would be mine if incorrectly i lost a dollar the first guess i made was even and was right i guessed again even and took the money they fed me another one and i guessed even again and took the money i guessed even the fourth time and took the money it seemed to me that even was a good guess and i might as well stay by it which i did i guessed even twelve times and took the twelve dollars i was doing as they secretly desired their experience of human nature had convinced them that any human being as innocent as my face proclaimed me to be would repeat his first guess if it won and would go on repeating it if it should continue to win it was their belief that an innocent would be almost sure at the beginning to guess even and not odd and that if an innocent should guess even twelve times in succession and win every time he would go on guessing even to the endso it was their purpose to let me win those twelve even dates and then advance the odd dates one by one until i should lose fifty dollars and furnish those superintendents something to laugh about for a week to come  but it did not come out in that way for by the time i had won the twelfth dollar and last even date i withdrew from the game because it was so onesided that it was monotonous and did not entertain me there was a burst of laughter from the superintendents at the window when i came out of the place but i did not know what they were laughing at nor whom they were laughing at and it was a matter of no interest to me anyway through that incident i acquired an enviable reputation for smartness and penetration but it was not my due for i had not penetrated anything that the cow could not have penetrated                                                       mark twain                         to be continued  footnote  16 with the pen i mean this autobiography is dictated not written     north american review  no dcxx  august 2 1907   chapters from my autobiographyxxi  by mark twain   from susys biography of me        feb 12 86       mamma and i have both been very much troubled of late because papa      since he has been publishing gen grants book has seemed to forget      his own books and work entirely and the other evening as papa and      i were promonading up and down the library he told me that he      didnt expect to write but one more book and then he was ready to      give up work altogether die or do anything he said that he had      written more than he had ever expected to and the only book that      he had been pertickularly anxious to write was one locked up in the      safe down stairs not yet published17       but this intended future of course will never do and although papa      usually holds to his own opinions and intents with outsiders when      mamma realy desires anything and says that it must be papa allways      gives up his plans at least so far and does as she says is right      and she is usually right if she dissagrees with him at all it      was because he knew his great tendency to being convinced by her      that he published without her knowledge that article in the      christian union concerning the government of children so judging      by the proofs of past years i think that we will be able to      persuade papa to go back to work as before and not leave off      writing with the end of his next story mamma says that she      sometimes feels and i do too that she would rather have papa      depend on his writing for a living than to have him think of giving      it up   dictated november 8 1906 i have a defect of a sort which i think is not common certainly i hope it isnt it is rare that i can call before my minds eye the form and face of either friend or enemy if i should make a list now of persons whom i know in america and abroadsay to the number of even an entire thousandit is quite unlikely that i could reproduce five of them in my minds eye of my dearest and most intimate friends i could name eight whom i have seen and talked with four days ago but when i try to call them before me they are formless shadows jean has been absent this past eight or ten days in the country and i wish i could reproduce her in the mirror of my mind but i cant do it  it may be that this defect is not constitutional but a result of lifelong absence of mind and indolent and inadequate observation once or twice in my life it has been an embarrassment to me twenty years ago in the days of susys biography of me there was a dispute one morning at the breakfasttable about the color of a neighbors eyes i was asked for a verdict but had to confess that if that valued neighbor and old friend had eyes i was not sure that i had ever seen them it was then mockingly suggested that perhaps i didnt even know the color of the eyes of my own family and i was required to shut my own at once and testify i was able to name the color of mrs clemenss eyes but was not able to even suggest a color for jeans or claras or susys  all this talk is suggested by susys remark the other evening as papa and i were promenading up and down the library down to the bottom of my heart i am thankful that i can see that picture and it is not dim but stands out clear in the unfaded light of twentyone years ago in those days susy and i used to promonade daily up and down the library with our arms about each others waists and deal in intimate communion concerning affairs of state or the deep questions of human life or our small personal affairs  it was quite natural that i should think i had written myself out when i was only fifty years old for everybody who has ever written has been smitten with that superstition at about that age not even yet have i really written myself out i have merely stopped writing because dictating is pleasanter work and because dictating has given me a strong aversion to the pen and because two hours of talking per day is enough and becausebut i am only damaging my mind with this digging around in it for pretexts where no pretext is needed and where the simple truth is for this one time better than any invention in this small emergency i shall never finish my five or six unfinished books for the reason that by forty years of slavery to the pen i have earned my freedom i detest the pen and i wouldnt use it again to sign the death warrant of my dearest enemy  dictated march 8 1906 for thirty years i have received an average of a dozen letters a year from strangers who remember me or whose fathers remember me as boy and young man but these letters are almost always disappointing i have not known these strangers nor their fathers i have not heard of the names they mention the reminiscences to which they call attention have had no part in my experience all of which means that these strangers have been mistaking me for somebody else but at last i have the refreshment this morning of a letter from a man who deals in names that were familiar to me in my boyhood the writer encloses a newspaper clipping which has been wandering through the press for four or five weeks and he wants to know if capt tonkray lately deceased was as stated in the clipping the original of huckleberry finn  i have replied that huckleberry finn was frank f as this inquirer evidently knew the hannibal of the forties he will easily recall frank franks father was at one time town drunkard an exceedingly welldefined and unofficial office of those days he succeeded general gaines and for a time he was sole and only incumbent of the office but afterward jimmy finn proved competency and disputed the place with him so we had two town drunkards at one timeand it made as much trouble in that village as christendom experienced in the fourteenth century when there were two popes at the same time  in huckleberry finn i have drawn frank exactly as he was he was ignorant unwashed insufficiently fed but he had as good a heart as ever any boy had his liberties were totally unrestricted he was the only really independent personboy or manin the community and by consequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy and was envied by all the rest of us we liked him we enjoyed his society and as his society was forbidden us by our parents the prohibition trebled and quadrupled its value and therefore we sought and got more of his society than of any other boys i heard four years ago that he was justice of the peace in a remote village in the state of  and was a good citizen and was greatly respected  during jimmy finns term he jimmy was not exclusive he was not finical he was not hypercritical he was largely and handsomely democraticand slept in the deserted tanyard with the hogs my father tried to reform him once but did not succeed my father was not a professional reformer in him the spirit of reform was spasmodic it only broke out now and then with considerable intervals between once he tried to reform injun joe that also was a failure it was a failure and we boys were glad for injun joe drunk was interesting and a benefaction to us but injun joe sober was a dreary spectacle we watched my fathers experiments upon him with a good deal of anxiety but it came out all right and we were satisfied injun joe got drunk oftener than before and became intolerably interesting  i think that in tom sawyer i starved injun joe to death in the cave but that may have been to meet the exigencies of romantic literature i cant remember now whether the real injun joe died in the cave or out of it but i do remember that the news of his death reached me at a most unhappy timethat is to say just at bedtime on a summer night when a prodigious storm of thunder and lightning accompanied by a deluging rain that turned the streets and lanes into rivers caused me to repent and resolve to lead a better life i can remember those awful thunderbursts and the white glare of the lightning yet and the wild lashing of the rain against the windowpanes by my teachings i perfectly well knew what all that wild riot was forsatan had come to get injun joe i had no shadow of doubt about it it was the proper thing when a person like injun joe was required in the under world and i should have thought it strange and unaccountable if satan had come for him in a less impressive way with every glare of lightning i shrivelled and shrunk together in mortal terror and in the interval of black darkness that followed i poured out my lamentings over my lost condition and my supplications for just one more chance with an energy and feeling and sincerity quite foreign to my nature  but in the morning i saw that it was a false alarm and concluded to resume business at the old stand and wait for another reminder  the axiom says history repeats itself a week or two ago mr blankblank dined with us at dinner he mentioned a circumstance which flashed me back over about sixty years and landed me in that little bedroom on that tempestuous night and brought to my mind how creditable to me was my conduct through the whole night and how barren it was of moral spot or fleck during that entire period he said mr x was sexton or something of the episcopal church in his town and had been for many years the competent superintendent of all the churchs worldly affairs and was regarded by the whole congregation as a stay a blessing a priceless treasure but he had a couple of defectsnot large defects but they seemed large when flung against the background of his profoundly religious character he drank a good deal and he could outswear a brakeman a movement arose to persuade him to lay aside these vices and after consulting with his pal who occupied the same position as himself in the other episcopal church and whose defects were duplicates of his own and had inspired regret in the congregation he was serving they concluded to try for reformnot wholesale but half at a time they took the liquor pledge and waited for results during nine days the results were entirely satisfactory and they were recipients of many compliments and much congratulation then on newyears eve they had business a mile and a half out of town just beyond the state line everything went well with them that evening in the barroom of the innbut at last the celebration of the occasion by those villagers came to be of a burdensome nature it was a bitter cold night and the multitudinous hot toddies that were circulating began by and by to exert a powerful influence upon the new prohibitionists at last xs friend remarked  x does it occur to you that we are outside the diocese  that ended reform no 1 then they took a chance in reform no 2 for a while that one prospered and they got much applause i now reach the incident which sent me back a matter of sixty years as i have remarked a while ago  one morning mr blankblank met x on the street and said  you have made a gallant struggle against those defects of yours i am aware that you failed on no 1 but i am also aware that you are having better luck with no 2  yes x said no 2 is all right and sound up to date and we are full of hope  blankblank said x of course you have your troubles like other people but they never show on the outside i have never seen you when you were not cheerful are you always cheerful really always cheerful  well no he said no i cant say that i am always cheerful butwell you know that kind of a night that comes sayyou wake up way in the night and the whole world is sunk in gloom and there are storms and earthquakes and all sorts of disasters in the air threatening and you get cold and clammy and when that happens to me i recognize how sinful i am and it all goes clear to my heart and wrings it and i have such terrors and terrorsoh they are indescribable those terrors that assail me and i slip out of bed and get on my knees and pray and pray and promise that i will be good if i can only have another chance and then you know in the morning the sun shines out so lovely and the birds sing and the whole world is so beautiful andb god i rally  now i will quote a brief paragraph from this letter which i have a minute ago spoken of the writer says        you no doubt are at a loss to know who i am i will tell you in my      younger days i was a resident of hannibal mo and you and i were      schoolmates attending mr dawsons school along with sam and will      bowen and andy fuqua and others whose names i have forgotten i was      then about the smallest boy in school for my age and they called      me little aleck for short   i only dimly remember him but i knew those other people as well as i knew the town drunkards i remember dawsons schoolhouse perfectly if i wanted to describe it i could save myself the trouble by conveying the description of it to these pages from tom sawyer i can remember the drowsy and inviting summer sounds that used to float in through the open windows from that distant boyparadise cardiff hill hollidays hill and mingle with the murmurs of the studying pupils and make them the more dreary by the contrast i remember andy fuqua the oldest pupila man of twentyfive i remember the youngest pupil nannie owsley a child of seven i remember george robards eighteen or twenty years old the only pupil who studied latin i rememberin some cases vividly in others vaguelythe rest of the twentyfive boys and girls i remember mr dawson very well i remember his boy theodore who was as good as he could be in fact he was inordinately good extravagantly good offensively good detestably goodand he had popeyesand i would have drowned him if i had had a chance in that school we were all about on an equality and so far as i remember the passion of envy had no place in our hearts except in the case of arch fuquathe other ones brother of course we all went barefoot in the summertime arch fuqua was about my own ageten or eleven in the winter we could stand him because he wore shoes then and his great gift was hidden from our sight and we were enabled to forget it but in the summertime he was a bitterness to us he was our envy for he could double back his big toe and let it fly and you could hear it snap thirty yards there was not another boy in the school that could approach this feat he had not a rival as regards a physical distinctionexcept in theodore eddy who could work his ears like a horse but he was no real rival because you couldnt hear him work his ears so all the advantage lay with arch fuqua  i am not done with dawsons school i will return to it in a later chapter  dictated at hamilton bermuda january 6 1907 that reminds me in conversation we are always using that phrase and seldom or never noticing how large a significance it bears it stands for a curious and interesting fact to wit that sleeping or waking dreaming or talking the thoughts which swarm through our heads are almost constantly almost continuously accompanied by a like swarm of reminders of incidents and episodes of our past a man can never know what a large traffic this commerce of association carries on in our minds until he sets out to write his autobiography he then finds that a thought is seldom born to him that does not immediately remind him of some event large or small in his past experience quite naturally these remarks remind me of various things among others this that sometimes a thought by the power of association will bring back to your mind a lost word or a lost name which you have not been able to recover by any other process known to your mental equipment yesterday we had an instance of this rev joseph h twichell is with me on this flying trip to bermuda he was with me on my last visit to bermuda and today we were trying to remember when it was we thought it was somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty years ago but that was as near as we could get at the date twichell said that the landlady in whose boardinghouse we sojourned in that ancient time could doubtless furnish us the date and we must look her up we wanted to see her anyway because she and her blooming daughter of eighteen were the only persons whose acquaintance we had made at that time for we were travelling under fictitious names and people who wear aliases are not given to seeking society and bringing themselves under suspicion but at this point in our talk we encountered an obstruction we could not recall the landladys name we hunted all around through our minds for that name using all the customary methods of research but without success the name was gone from us apparently permanently we finally gave the matter up and fell to talking about something else the talk wandered from one subject to another and finally arrived at twichells schooldays in hartfordthe hartford of something more than half a century agoand he mentioned several of his schoolmasters dwelling with special interest upon the peculiarities of an aged one named olney he remarked that olney humble village schoolmaster as he was was yet a man of superior parts and had published textbooks which had enjoyed a wide currency in america in their day i said i remembered those books and had studied olneys geography in school when i was a boy then twichell said  that reminds meour landladys name was a name that was associated with schoolbooks of some kind or other fifty or sixty years ago i wonder what it was i believe it began with k  association did the rest and did it instantly i said  kirkhams grammar  that settled it kirkham was the name and we went out to seek for the owner of it there was no trouble about that for bermuda is not large and is like the earlier garden of eden in that everybody in it knows everybody else just as it was in the serpents headquarters in adams time we easily found miss kirkhamshe that had been the blooming girl of a generation beforeand she was still keeping boarders but her mother had passed from this life she settled the date for us and did it with certainty by help of a couple of uncommon circumstances events of that ancient time she said we had sailed from bermuda on the 24th of may 1877 which was the day on which her only nephew was bornand he is now thirty years of age the other unusual circumstanceshe called it an unusual circumstance and i didnt say anythingwas that on that day the rev mr twichell bearing the assumed name of peters had made a statement to her which she regarded as a fiction i remembered the circumstance very well we had bidden the young girl goodby and had gone fifty yards perhaps when twichell said he had forgotten something i doubted it and must go back when he rejoined me he was silent and this alarmed me because i had not seen an example of it before he seemed quite uncomfortable and i asked him what the trouble was he said he had been inspired to give the girl a pleasant surprise and so had gone back and said to her  that young fellows name is not wilkinsonthats mark twain  she did not lose her mind she did not exhibit any excitement at all but said quite simply quite tranquilly  tell it to the marines mr petersif that should happen to be your name  it was very pleasant to meet her again we were whiteheaded but she was not in the sweet and unvexed spiritual atmosphere of the bermudas one does not achieve gray hairs at fortyeight  i had a dream last night and of course it was born of association like nearly everything else that drifts into a persons head asleep or awake on board ship on the passage down twichell was talking about the swiftly developing possibilities of aerial navigation and he quoted those striking verses of tennysons which forecast a future when airborne vessels of war shall meet and fight above the clouds and redden the earth below with a rain of blood this picture of carnage and blood and death reminded me of something which i had read a fortnight agostatistics of railway accidents compiled by the united states government wherein the appalling fact was set forth that on our 200000 miles of railway we annually kill 10000 persons outright and injure 80000 the warships in the air suggested the railway horrors and three nights afterward the railway horrors suggested my dream the work of association was going on in my head unconsciously all that time it was an admirable dream what there was of it  in it i saw a funeral procession i saw it from a mountain peak i saw it crawling along and curving here and there serpentlike through a level vast plain i seemed to see a hundred miles of the procession but neither the beginning of it nor the end of it was within the limits of my vision the procession was in ten divisions each division marked by a sombre flag and the whole represented ten years of our railway activities in the accident line each division was composed of 80000 cripples and was bearing its own years 10000 mutilated corpses to the grave in the aggregate 800000 cripples and 100000 dead drenched in blood                                                       mark twain

october 10 1906 susy has named a number of the friends who were assembled at onteora at the time of our visit but there were othersamong them laurence hutton charles dudley warner and carroll beckwith and their wives it was a bright and jolly company some of those choice spirits are still with us the others have passed from this life mrs clemens susy mr warner mary mapes dodge laurence hutton dean sagepeace to their ashes susy is in error in thinking mrs dodge was not there at that time we were her guests  we arrived at nightfall dreary from a tiresome journey but the dreariness did not last mrs dodge had provided a homemade banquet and the happy company sat down to it twenty strong or more then the thing happened which always happens at large dinners and is always exasperating everybody talked to his elbowmates and all talked at once and gradually raised their voices higher and higher and higher in the desperate effort to be heard it was like a riot an insurrection it was an intolerable volume of noise presently i said to the lady next me  i will subdue this riot i will silence this racket there is only one way to do it but i know the art you must tilt your head toward mine and seem to be deeply interested in what i am saying i will talk in a low voice then just because our neighbors wont be able to hear me they will want to hear me if i mumble long enoughsay two minutesyou will see that the dialogues will one after another come to a standstill and there will be silence not a sound anywhere but my mumbling  then in a very low voice i began  when i went out to chicago eleven years ago to witness the grant festivities there was a great banquet on the first night with six hundred exsoldiers present the gentleman who sat next me was mr x x he was very hard of hearing and he had a habit common to deaf people of shouting his remarks instead of delivering them in an ordinary voice he would handle his knife and fork in reflective silence for five or six minutes at a time and then suddenly fetch out a shout that would make you jump out of the united states  by this time the insurrection at mrs dodges tableat least that part of it in my immediate neighborhoodhad died down and the silence was spreading couple by couple down the long table i went on in a lower and still lower mumble and most impressively  during one of mr x xs mute intervals a man opposite us approached the end of a story which he had been telling his elbowneighbor he was speaking in a low voicethere was much noisei was deeply interested and straining my ears to catch his words stretching my neck holding my breath to hear unconscious of everything but the fascinating tale i heard him say at this point he seized her by her long hairshe shrieking and beggingbent her neck across his knee and with one awful sweep of the razor  how do you like chicaaago  that was x xs interruption hearable at thirty miles by the time i had reached that place in my mumblings mrs dodges diningroom was so silent so breathlessly still that if you had dropped a thought anywhere in it you could have heard it smack the floor18 when i delivered that yell the entire dinner company jumped as one person and punched their heads through the ceiling damaging it for it was only lath and plaster and it all came down on us and much of it went into the victuals and made them gritty but no one was hurt then i explained why it was that i had played that game and begged them to take the moral of it home to their hearts and be rational and merciful thenceforth and cease from screaming in mass and agree to let one person talk at a time and the rest listen in grateful and unvexed peace they granted my prayer and we had a happy time all the rest of the evening i do not think i have ever had a better time in my life this was largely because the new terms enabled me to keep the floornow that i had itand do all the talking myself i do like to hear myself talk susy has exposed this in her biography of me  dean sage was a delightful man yet in one way a terror to his friends for he loved them so well that he could not refrain from playing practical jokes on them we have to be pretty deeply in love with a person before we can do him the honor of joking familiarly with him dean sage was the best citizen i have known in america it takes courage to be a good citizen and he had plenty of it he allowed no individual and no corporation to infringe his smallest right and escape unpunished he was very rich and very generous and benevolent and he gave away his money with a prodigal hand but if an individual or corporation infringed a right of his to the value of ten cents he would spend thousands of dollars worth of time and labor and money and persistence on the matter and would not lower his flag until he had won his battle or lost it  he and rev mr harris had been classmates in college and to the day of sages death they were as fond of each other as an engaged pair it follows without saying that whenever sage found an opportunity to play a joke upon harris harris was sure to suffer  along about 1873 sage fell a victim to an illness which reduced him to a skeleton and defied all the efforts of the physicians to cure it he went to the adirondacks and took harris with him sage had always been an active man and he couldnt idle any day wholly away in inanition but walked every day to the limit of his strength one day toward nightfall the pair came upon a humble log cabin which bore these words painted upon a shingle entertainment for man and beast they were obliged to stop there for the night sages strength being exhausted they entered the cabin and found its owner and sole occupant there a rugged and sturdy and simplehearted man of middle age he cooked supper and placed it before the travellerssalt junk boiled beans corn bread and black coffee sages stomach could abide nothing but the most delicate food therefore this banquet revolted him and he sat at the table unemployed while harris fed ravenously limitlessly gratefully for he had been chaplain in a fighting regiment all through the war and had kept in perfection the grand and uncritical appetite and splendid physical vigor which those four years of tough fare and activity had furnished him sage went supperless to bed and tossed and writhed all night upon a shuck mattress that was full of attentive and interested corncobs in the morning harris was ravenous again and devoured the odious breakfast as contentedly and as delightedly as he had devoured its twin the night before sage sat upon the porch empty and contemplated the performance and meditated revenge presently he beckoned to the landlord and took him aside and had a confidential talk with him he said  i am the paymaster what is the bill  two suppers fifty cents two beds thirty cents two breakfasts fifty centstotal a dollar and thirty cents  sage said go back and make out the bill and fetch it to me here on the porch make it thirteen dollars  thirteen dollars why its impossible i am no robber i am charging you what i charge everybody its a dollar and thirty cents and thats all it is  my man ive got something to say about this as well as you its thirteen dollars youll make out your bill for that and youll take it too or youll not get a cent  the man was troubled and said i dont understand this i cant make it out  well i understand it i know what i am about its thirteen dollars and i want the bill made out for that theres no other terms get it ready and bring it out here i will examine it and be outraged you understand i will dispute the bill you must stand to it you must refuse to take less i will begin to lose my temper you must begin to lose yours i will call you hard names you must answer with harder ones i will raise my voice you must raise yours you must go into a ragefoam at the mouth if you can insert some soap to help it along now go along and follow your instructions  the man played his assigned part and played it well he brought the bill and stood waiting for results sages face began to cloud up his eyes to snap and his nostrils to inflate like a horses then he broke out with  thirteen dollars you mean to say that you charge thirteen dollars for these damned inhuman hospitalities of yours are you a professional buccaneer is it your custom to  the man burst in with spirit now i dont want any more out of youthats a plenty the bill is thirteen dollars and youll pay itthats all a couple of characterless adventurers bilking their way through this country and attempting to dictate terms to a gentleman a gentleman who received you supposing you were gentlemen yourselves whereas in my opinion hells full of  sage broke in  not another word of thati wont have it i regard you as the lowestdown thief that ever  dont you use that word again by  ill take you by the neck and  harris came rushing out and just as the two were about to grapple he pushed himself between them and began to implore  oh dean dont dontnow mr smith control yourself oh think of your family deanthink what a scandal  but they burst out with maledictions imprecations and all the hard names they could dig out of the rich accumulations of their educated memories and in the midst of it the man shouted  when gentlemen come to this house i treat them as gentlemen when people come to this house with the ordinary appetites of gentlemen i charge them a dollar and thirty cents for what i furnished you but when a man brings a hellfired famine here that gorges a barrel of pork and four barrels of beans at two sittings  sage broke in in a voice that was eloquent with remorse and selfreproach i never thought of that and i ask your pardon i am ashamed of myself and of my friend heres your thirteen dollars and my apologies along with it   dictated march 12 1906 i have always taken a great interest in other peoples duels one always feels an abiding interest in any heroic thing which has entered into his own experience  sidenote 1878  in 1878 fourteen years after my unmaterialized duel messieurs fortu and gambetta fought a duel which made heroes of both of them in france but made them rather ridiculous throughout the rest of the world i was living in munich that fall and winter and i was so interested in that funny tragedy that i wrote a long account of it and it is in one of my books somewherean account which had some inaccuracies in it but as an exhibition of the spirit of that duel i think it was correct and trustworthy and when i was living in vienna thirtyfour years after my ineffectual duel my interest in that kind of incident was still strong and i find here among my autobiographical manuscripts of that day a chapter which i began concerning it but did not finish i wanted to finish it but held it open in the hope that the italian ambassador m nigra would find time to furnish me the full history of señor cavalottis adventures in that line but he was a busy man there was always an interruption before he could get well started so my hope was never fulfilled the following is the unfinished chapter   sidenote 1898       as concerns duelling this pastime is as common in austria today      as it is in france but with this difference that here in the      austrian states the duel is dangerous while in france it is not      here it is tragedy in france it in comedy here it is a solemnity      there it is monkeyshines here the duellist risks his life there      he does not even risk his shirt here he fights with pistol or      sabre in france with a hairpina blunt one here the desperately      wounded man tries to walk to the hospital there they paint the      scratch so that they can find it again lay the sufferer on a      stretcher and conduct him off the field with a band of music       at the end of a french duel the pair hug and kiss and cry and      praise each others valor then the surgeons make an examination      and pick out the scratched one and the other one helps him on to      the litter and pays his fare and in return the scratched one      treats to champagne and oysters in the evening and then the      incident is closed as the french say it is all polite and      gracious and pretty and impressive at the end of an austrian      duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his hand to the      other man utters some phrases of courteous regret then bids him      goodby and goes his way and that incident also is closed the      french duellist is painstakingly protected from danger by the      rules of the game his antagonists weapon cannot reach so far as      his body if he get a scratch it will not be above his elbow but      in austria the rules of the game do not provide against danger      they carefully provide for it usually commonly the combat must      be kept up until one of the men is disabled a nondisabling slash      or stab does not retire him       for a matter of three months i watched the viennese journals and      whenever a duel was reported in their telegraphic columns i      scrapbooked it by this record i find that duelling in austria is      not confined to journalists and old maids as in france but is      indulged in by military men journalists students physicians      lawyers members of the legislature and even the cabinet the      bench and the police duelling is forbidden by law and so it seems      odd to see the makers and administrators of the laws dancing on      their work in this way some months ago count bodeni at that time      chief of the government fought a pistolduel here in the capital      city of the empire with representative wolf and both of those      distinguished christians came near getting turned out of the      churchfor the church as well as the state forbids duelling       in one case lately in hungary the police interfered and stopped      a duel after the first innings this was a sabreduel between the      chief of police and the city attorney unkind things were said      about it by the newspapers they said the police remembered their      duty uncommonly well when their own officials were the parties      concerned in duels but i think the underlings showed good      breadandbutter judgment if their superiors had carved each other      well the public would have asked where were the police and their      places would have been endangered but custom does not require them      to be around where mere unofficial citizens are explaining a thing      with sabres       there was another duela double duelgoing on in the immediate      neighborhood at the time and in this case the police obeyed custom      and did not disturb it their bread and butter was not at stake      there in this duel a physician fought a couple of surgeons and      wounded bothone of them lightly the other seriously an      undertaker wanted to keep people from interfering but that was      quite natural again       selecting at random from my record i next find a duel at tarnopol      between military men an officer of the tenth dragoons charged an      officer of the ninth dragoons with an offence against the laws of      the cardtable there was a defect or a doubt somewhere in the      matter and this had to be examined and passed upon by a court of      honor so the case was sent up to lemberg for this purpose one      would like to know what the defect was but the newspaper does not      say a man here who has fought many duels and has a graveyard says      that probably the matter in question was as to whether the      accusation was true or not that if the charge was a very grave      onecheating for instanceproof of its truth would rule the      guilty officer out of the field of honor the court would not allow      a gentleman to fight with such a person you see what a solemn      thing it is you see how particular they are any little careless      act can lose you your privilege of getting yourself shot here the      court seems to have gone into the matter in a searching and careful      fashion for several months elapsed before it reached a decision      it then sanctioned a duel and the accused killed his accuser       next i find a duel between a prince and a major first with      pistolsno result satisfactory to either party then with sabres      and the major badly hurt       next a sabreduel between journaliststhe one a strong man the      other feeble and in poor health it was brief the strong one drove      his sword through the weak one and death was immediate       next a duel between a lieutenant and a student of medicine      according to the newspaper report these are the details the      student was in a restaurant one evening passing along he halted      at a table to speak with some friends near by sat a dozen military      men the student conceived that one of these was staring at him      he asked the officer to step outside and explain this officer and      another one gathered up their caps and sabres and went out with the      student outsidethis is the students accountthe student      introduced himself to the offending officer and said you seemed      to stare at me for answer the officer struck at the student with      his fist the student parried the blow both officers drew their      sabres and attacked the young fellow and one of them gave him a      wound on the left arm then they withdrew this was saturday night      the duel followed on monday in the military ridingschoolthe      customary duellingground all over austria apparently the weapons      were pistols the duelling terms were somewhat beyond custom in the      matter of severity if i may gather that from the statement that      the combat was fought unter sehr schweren bedingungento wit      distance 15 stepswith 3 steps advance there was but one      exchange of shots the student was hit he put his hand on his      breast his body began to bend slowly forward then collapsed in      death and sank to the ground       it is pathetic there are other duels in my list but i find in      each and all of them one and the same everrecurring defectthe      principals are never present but only their sham      representatives the real principals in any duel are not the      duellists themselves but their families they do the mourning the      suffering theirs is the loss and theirs the misery they stake all      that the duellist stakes nothing but his life and that is a      trivial thing compared with what his death must cost those whom he      leaves behind him challenges should not mention the duellist he      has nothing much at stake and the real vengeance cannot reach him      the challenge should summon the offenders old gray mother and his      young wife and his little childrenthese or any to whom he is a      dear and worshipped possessionand should say you have done me      no harm but i am the meek slave of a custom which requires me to      crush the happiness out of your hearts and condemn you to years of      pain and grief in order that i may wash clean with your tears a      stain which has been put upon me by another person       the logic of it is admirable a person has robbed me of a penny i      must beggar ten innocent persons to make good my loss surely      nobodys honor is worth all that       since the duellists family are the real principals in a duel the      state ought to compel them to be present at it custom also ought      to be so amended as to require it and without it no duel ought to      be allowed to go on if that students unoffending mother had been      present and watching the officer through her tears as he raised his      pistol hewhy he would have fired in the air we know that for      we know how we are all made laws ought to be based upon the      ascertained facts of our nature it would be a simple thing to make      a duelling law which would stop duelling       as things are now the mother is never invited she submits to      this and without outward complaint for she too is the vassal of      custom and custom requires her to conceal her pain when she learns      the disastrous news that her son must go to the duellingfield and      by the powerful force that is lodged in habit and custom she is      enabled to obey this trying requirementa requirement which exacts      a miracle of her and gets it last january a neighbor of ours who      has a young son in the army was wakened by this youth at three      oclock one morning and she sat up in bed and listened to his      message       i have come to tell you something mother which will distress      you but you must be good and brave and bear it i have been      affronted by a fellow officer and we fight at three this      afternoon lie down and sleep now and think no more about it       she kissed him good night and lay down paralyzed with grief and      fear but said nothing but she did not sleep she prayed and      mourned till the first streak of dawn then fled to the nearest      church and implored the virgin for help and from that church she      went to another and another and another church after church and      still church after church and so spent all the day until three      oclock on her knees in agony and tears then dragged herself home      and sat down comfortless and desolate to count the minutes and      wait with an outward show of calm for what had been ordained for      herhappiness or endless misery presently she heard the clank of      a sabreshe had not known before what music was in that      soundand her son put his head in and said       x was in the wrong and he apologized       so that incident was closed and for the rest of her life the      mother will always find something pleasant about the clank of a      sabre no doubt       in one of my listed duelshowever let it go there is nothing      particularly striking about it except that the seconds interfered      and prematurely too for neither man was dead this was certainly      irregular neither of the men liked it it was a duel with cavalry      sabres between an editor and a lieutenant the editor walked to      the hospital the lieutenant was carried in this country an editor      who can write well is valuable but he is not likely to remain so      unless he can handle a sabre with charm       the following very recent telegram shows that also in france duels      are humanely stopped as soon as they approach the french      dangerpoint       reuters telegramparis march 5the duel between colonels      henry and picquart took place this morning in the riding school of      the ecole militaire the doors of which were strictly guarded in      order to prevent intrusion the combatants who fought with swords      were in position at ten oclock       at the first reengagement lieutenantcolonel henry was slightly      scratched in the fore arm and just at the same moment his own      blade appeared to touch his adversarys neck senator ranc who was      colonel picquarts second stopped the fight but as it was found      that his principal had not been touched the combat continued a      very sharp encounter ensued in which colonel henry was wounded in      the elbow and the duel terminated       after which the stretcher and the band in lurid contrast with      this delicate flirtation we have this fatal duel of day before      yesterday in italy where the earnest austrian duel is in vogue i      knew cavalotti slightly and this gives me a sort of personal      interest in his duel i first saw him in rome several years ago he      was sitting on a block of stone in the forum and was writing      something in his notebooka poem or a challenge or something      like thatand the friend who pointed him out to me said that is      cavalottihe has fought thirty duels do not disturb him i did      not disturb him   may 13 1907 it is a long time ago cavalottipoet orator satirist statesman patriotwas a great man and his death was deeply lamented by his countrymen many monuments to his memory testify to this in his duels he killed several of his antagonists and disabled the rest by nature he was a little irascible once when the officials of the library of bologna threw out his books the gentle poet went up there and challenged the whole fifteen his parliamentary duties were exacting but he proposed to keep coming up and fighting duels between trains until all those officials had been retired from the activities of life although he always chose the sword to fight with he had never had a lesson with that weapon when game was called he waited for nothing but always plunged at his opponent and rained such a storm of wild and original thrusts and whacks upon him that the man was dead or crippled before he could bring his science to bear but his latest antagonist discarded science and won he held his sword straight forward like a lance when cavalotti made his plungewith the result that he impaled himself upon it it entered his mouth and passed out at the back of his neck death was instantaneous   dictated december 20 1906 six months ago when i was recalling early days in san francisco i broke off at a place where i was about to tell about captain osborns odd adventure at the what cheer or perhaps it was at another cheap feedingplacethe miners restaurant it was a place where one could get good food on the cheapest possible terms and its popularity was great among the multitudes whose purses were light it was a good place to go to to observe mixed humanity captain osborn and bret harte went there one day and took a meal and in the course of it osborn fished up an interesting reminiscence of a dozen years before and told about it it was to this effect  he was a midshipman in the navy when the californian gold craze burst upon the world and set it wild with excitement his ship made the long journey around the horn and was approaching her goal the golden gate when an accident happened  it happened to me said osborn i fell overboard there was a heavy sea running but no one was much alarmed about me because we had on board a newly patented lifesaving device which was believed to be competent to rescue anything that could fall overboard from a midshipman to an anchor ours was the only ship that had this device we were very proud of it and had been anxious to give its powers a practical test this thing was lashed to the garboardstrake of the maintogallant mizzenyard amidships19 and there was nothing to do but cut the lashings and heave it over it would do the rest one day the cry of man overboard brought all hands on deck instantly the lashings were cut and the machine flung joyously over damnation it went to the bottom like an anvil by the time that the ship was brought to and a boat manned i was become but a bobbing speck on the waves half a mile astern and losing my strength very fast but by good luck there was a common seaman on board who had practical ideas in his head and hadnt waited to see what the patent machine was going to do but had run aft and sprung over after me the moment the alarm was cried through the ship i had a good deal of a start of him and the seas made his progress slow and difficult but he stuck to his work and fought his way to me and just in the nick of time he put his saving arms about me when i was about to go down he held me up until the boat reached us and rescued us by that time i was unconscious and i was still unconscious when we arrived at the ship a dangerous fever followed and i was delirious for three days then i come to myself and at once inquired for my benefactor of course he was gone we were lying at anchor in the bay and every man had deserted to the goldmines except the commissioned officers i found out nothing about my benefactor but his nameburton sandersa name which i have held in grateful memory ever since every time i have been on the coast these twelve or thirteen years i have tried to get track of him but have never succeeded i wish i could find him and make him understand that his brave act has never been forgotten by me harte i would rather see him and take him by the hand than any other man on the planet  at this stage or a little later there was an interruption a waiter near by said to another waiter pointing  take a look at that tramp thats coming in aint that the one that bilked the house last week out of ten cents  i believe it is let him alonedont pay any attention to him wait till we can get a good look at him  the tramp approached timidly and hesitatingly with the air of one unsure and apprehensive the waiters watched him furtively when he was passing behind hartes chair one of them said  hes the oneand they pounced upon him and proposed to turn him over to the police as a bilk he begged piteously he confessed his guilt but said he had been driven to his crime by necessitythat when he had eaten the plate of beans and flipped out without paying for it it was because he was starving and hadnt the ten cents to pay for it with but the waiters would listen to no explanations no palliations he must be placed in custody he brushed his hand across his eyes and said meekly that he would submit being friendless each waiter took him by an arm and faced him about to conduct him away then his melancholy eyes fell upon captain osborn and a light of glad and eager recognition flashed from them he said  werent you a midshipman once sir in the old lancaster  yes said osborn why  didnt you fall overboard  yes i did how do you come to know about it  wasnt there a new patent machine aboard and didnt they throw it over to save you  why yes said osborn laughing gently but it didnt do it  no sir it was a sailor that done it  it certainly was look here my man you are getting distinctly interesting were you of our crew  yes sir i was  i reckon you may be right you do certainly know a good deal about that incident what is your name  burton sanders  the captain sprang up excited and said  give me your hand give me both your hands id rather shake them than inherit a fortuneand then he cried to the waiters let him gotake your hands off he is my guest and can have anything and everything this house is able to furnish i am responsible  there was a lovefeast then captain osborn ordered it regardless of expense and he and harte sat there and listened while the man told stirring adventures of his life and fed himself up to the eyebrows then osborn wanted to be benefactor in his turn and pay back some of his debt the man said it could all be paid with ten dollarsthat it had been so long since he had owned that amount of money that it would seem a fortune to him and he should be grateful beyond words if the captain could spare him that amount the captain spared him ten broad twentydollar gold pieces and made him take them in spite of his modest protestations and gave him his address and said he must never fail to give him notice when he needed grateful service  several months later harte stumbled upon the man in the street he was most comfortably drunk and pleasant and chatty harte remarked upon the splendidly and movingly dramatic incident of the restaurant and said  how curious and fortunate and happy and interesting it was that you two should come together after that long separation and at exactly the right moment to save you from disaster and turn your defeat by the waiters into a victory a preacher could make a great sermon out of that for it does look as if the hand of providence was in it  the heros face assumed a sweetly genial expression and he said  well now it wasnt providence this time i was running the arrangements myself  how do you mean  oh i hadnt ever seen the gentleman before i was at the next table with my back to you the whole time he was telling about it i saw my chance and slipped out and fetched the two waiters with me and offered to give them a commission out of what i could get out of the captain if they would do a quarrel act with me and give me an opening so then after a minute or two i straggled back and you know the rest of it as well as i do                                                       mark twain                         to be continued  footnotes

autobiographyxxiii  by mark twain   sidenote 1845  dictated march 9 1906  i am talking of a time sixty years ago and upwards i remember the names of some of those schoolmates and by fitful glimpses even their faces rise dimly before me for a momentonly just long enough to be recognized then they vanish i catch glimpses of george robards the latin pupilslender pale studious bending over his book and absorbed in it his long straight black hair hanging down below his jaws like a pair of curtains on the sides of his face i can see him give his head a toss and flirt one of the curtains back around his headto get it out of his way apparently really to show off in that day it was a great thing among the boys to have hair of so flexible a sort that it could be flung back in that way with a flirt of the head george robards was the envy of us all for there was no hair among us that was so competent for this exhibition as hisexcept perhaps the yellow locks of will bowen and john robards my hair was a dense ruck of short curls and so was my brother henrys we tried all kinds of devices to get these crooks straightened out so that they would flirt but we never succeeded sometimes by soaking our heads and then combing and brushing our hair down tight and flat to our skulls we could get it straight temporarily and this gave us a comforting moment of joy but the first time we gave it a flirt it all shrivelled into curls again and our happiness was gone  john robards was the little brother of george he was a wee chap with silky golden curtains to his face which dangled to his shoulders and below and could be flung back ravishingly when he was twelve years old he crossed the plains with his father amidst the rush of the goldseekers of 49 and i remember the departure of the cavalcade when it spurred westward we were all there to see and to envy and i can still see that proud little chap sailing by on a great horse with his long locks streaming out behind we were all on hand to gaze and envy when he returned two years later in unimaginable gloryfor he had travelled none of us had ever been forty miles from home but he had crossed the continent he had been in the goldmines that fairyland of our imagination and he had done a still more wonderful thing he had been in shipsin ships on the actual ocean in ships on three actual oceans for he had sailed down the pacific and around the horn among icebergs and through snowstorms and wild wintry gales and had sailed on and turned the corner and flown northward in the trades and up through the blistering equatorial watersand there in his brown face were the proofs of what he had been through we would have sold our souls to satan for the privilege of trading places with him  i saw him when i was out on that missouri trip four years ago he was old thenthough not quite so old as iand the burden of life was upon him he said his granddaughter twelve years old had read my books and would like to see me it was a pathetic time for she was a prisoner in her room and marked for death and john knew that she was passing swiftly away twelve years oldjust her grandfathers age when he rode away on that great journey with his yellow hair flapping behind him in her i seemed to see that boy again it was as if he had come back out of that remote past and was present before me in his golden youth her malady was heart disease and her brief life came to a close a few days later  another of those schoolboys was john garth he became a prosperous banker and a prominent and valued citizen and a few years ago he died rich and honored he died it is what i have to say about so many of those boys and girls the widow still lives and there are grandchildren in her pantalette days and my barefoot days she was a schoolmate of mine i saw johns tomb when i made that missouri visit  her father mr kercheval had an apprentice in the early days when i was nine years old and he had also a slave woman who had many merits but i cant feel very kindly or forgivingly toward either that good apprentice boy or that good slave woman for they saved my life one day when i was playing on a loose log which i supposed was attached to a raftbut it wasntit tilted me into bear creek and when i had been under water twice and was coming up to make the third and fatal descent my fingers appeared above the water and that slave woman seized them and pulled me out within a week i was in again and that apprentice had to come along just at the wrong time and he plunged in and dived pawed around on the bottom and found me and dragged me out and emptied the water out of me and i was saved again i was drowned seven times after that before i learned to swimonce in bear creek and six times in the mississippi i do not now know who the people were who interfered with the intentions of a providence wiser than themselves but i hold a grudge against them yet when i told the tale of these remarkable happenings to rev dr burton of hartford he said he did not believe it he slipped on the ice the very next year and sprained his ankle  will bowen was another schoolmate and so was his brother sam who was his junior by a couple of years before the civil war broke out both became st louis and new orleans pilots both are dead long ago  sidenote 1845  dictated march 16 1906 we will return to those schoolchildren of sixty years ago i recall mary miller she was not my first sweetheart but i think she was the first one that furnished me a broken heart i fell in love with her when she was eighteen and i was nine but she scorned me and i recognized that this was a cold world i had not noticed that temperature before i believe i was as miserable as even a grown man could be but i think that this sorrow did not remain with me long as i remember it i soon transferred my worship to artimisia briggs who was a year older than mary miller when i revealed my passion to her she did not scoff at it she did not make fun of it she was very kind and gentle about it but she was also firm and said she did not want to be pestered by children  and there was mary lacy she was a schoolmate but she also was out of my class because of her advanced age she was pretty wild and determined and independent but she married and at once settled down and became in all ways a model matron and was as highly respected as any matron in the town four years ago she was still living and had been married fifty years  jimmie mcdaniel was another schoolmate his age and mine about tallied his father kept the candyshop and he was the most envied little chap in the townafter tom blankenship huck finnfor although we never saw him eating candy we supposed that it was nevertheless his ordinary diet he pretended that he never ate it and didnt care for it because there was nothing forbidden about itthere was plenty of it and he could have as much of it as he wanted he was the first human being to whom i ever told a humorous story so far as i can remember this was about jim wolfe and the cats and i gave him that tale the morning after that memorable episode i thought he would laugh his teeth out i had never been so proud and happy before and have seldom been so proud and happy since i saw him four years ago when i was out there he wore a beard gray and venerable that came halfway down to his knees and yet it was not difficult for me to recognize him he had been married fiftyfour years he had many children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren and also even posterity they all said thousandsyet the boy to whom i had told the cat story when we were callow juveniles was still present in that cheerful little old man  artimisia briggs got married not long after refusing me she married richmond the stone mason who was my methodist sundayschool teacher in the earliest days and he had one distinction which i envied him at some time or other he had hit his thumb with his hammer and the result was a thumb nail which remained permanently twisted and distorted and curved and pointed like a parrots beak i should not consider it an ornament now i suppose but it had a fascination for me then and a vast value because it was the only one in the town he was a very kindly and considerate sundayschool teacher and patient and compassionate so he was the favorite teacher with us little chaps in that school they had slender oblong pasteboard blue tickets each with a verse from the testament printed on it and you could get a blue ticket by reciting two verses by reciting five verses you could get three blue tickets and you could trade these at the bookcase and borrow a book for a week i was under mr richmonds spiritual care every now and then for two or three years and he was never hard upon me i always recited the same five verses every sunday he was always satisfied with the performance he never seemed to notice that these were the same five foolish virgins that he had been hearing about every sunday for months i always got my tickets and exchanged them for a book they were pretty dreary books for there was not a bad boy in the entire bookcase they were all good boys and good girls and drearily uninteresting but they were better society than none and i was glad to have their company and disapprove of it  sidenote 1849  twenty years ago mr richmond had become possessed of tom sawyers cave in the hills three miles from town and had made a touristresort of it in 1849 when the goldseekers were streaming through our little town of hannibal many of our grown men got the gold fever and i think that all the boys had it on the saturday holidays in summertime we used to borrow skiffs whose owners were not present and go down the river three miles to the cave hollow missourian for valley and there we staked out claims and pretended to dig gold panning out half a dollar a day at first two or three times as much later and by and by whole fortunes as our imaginations became inured to the work stupid and unprophetic lads we were doing this in play and never suspecting why that cave hollow and all the adjacent hills were made of gold but we did not know it we took it for dirt we left its rich secret in its own peaceful possession and grew up in poverty and went wandering about the world struggling for breadand this because we had not the gift of prophecy that region was all dirt and rocks to us yet all it needed was to be ground up and scientifically handled and it was gold that is to say the whole region was a cementmineand they make the finest kind of portland cement there now five thousand barrels a day with a plant that cost 2000000  for a little while reuel gridley attended that school of ours he was an elderly pupil he was perhaps twentytwo or twentythree years old then came the mexican war and he volunteered a company of infantry was raised in our town and mr hickman a tall straight handsome athlete of twentyfive was made captain of it and had a sword by his side and a broad yellow stripe down the leg of his gray pants and when that company marched back and forth through the streets in its smart uniformwhich it did several times a day for drillits evolutions were attended by all the boys whenever the school hours permitted i can see that marching company yet and i can almost feel again the consuming desire that i had to join it but they had no use for boys of twelve and thirteen and before i had a chance in another war the desire to kill people to whom i had not been introduced had passed away  i saw the splendid hickman in his old age he seemed about the oldest man i had ever seenan amazing and melancholy contrast with the showy young captain i had seen preparing his warriors for carnage so many many years before hickman is deadit is the old story as susy said what is it all for  reuel gridley went away to the wars and we heard of him no more for fifteen or sixteen years then one day in carson city while i was having a difficulty with an editor on the sidewalkan editor better built for war than i wasi heard a voice say give him the best youve got sam im at your back it was reuel gridley he said he had not recognized me by my face but by my drawling style of speech  he went down to the reese river mines about that time and presently he lost an election bet in his mining camp and by the terms of it he was obliged to buy a fiftypound sack of selfraising flour and carry it through the town preceded by music and deliver it to the winner of the bet of course the whole camp was present and full of fluid and enthusiasm the winner of the bet put up the sack at auction for the benefit of the united states sanitary fund and sold it the excitement grew and grew the sack was sold over and over again for the benefit of the fund the news of it came to virginia city by telegraph it produced great enthusiasm and reuel gridley was begged by telegraph to bring the sack and have an auction in virginia city he brought it an open barouche was provided also a brass band the sack was sold over and over again at gold hill then was brought up to virginia city toward night and soldand sold again and again and still again netting twenty or thirty thousand dollars for the sanitary fund gridley carried it across california and sold it at various towns he sold it for large sums in sacramento and in san francisco he brought it east sold it in new york and in various other cities then carried it out to a great fair at st louis and went on selling it and finally made it up into small cakes and sold those at a dollar apiece first and last the sack of flour which had originally cost ten dollars perhaps netted more than two hundred thousand dollars for the sanitary fund reuel gridley has been dead these many many yearsit is the old story  in that school were the first jews i had ever seen it took me a good while to get over the awe of it to my fancy they were clothed invisibly in the damp and cobwebby mould of antiquity they carried me back to egypt and in imagination i moved among the pharaohs and all the shadowy celebrities of that remote age the name of the boys was levin we had a collective name for them which was the only really large and handsome witticism that was ever born in that congressional district we called them twentytwoand even when the joke was old and had been worn threadbare we always followed it with the explanation to make sure that it would be understood twice levintwentytwo  there were other boys whose names remain with me irving ayresbut no matter he is dead then there was george butler whom i remember as a child of seven wearing a blue leather belt with a brass buckle and hated and envied by all the boys on account of it he was a nephew of general ben butler and fought gallantly at balls bluff and in several other actions of the civil war he is dead long and long ago  will bowen dead long ago ed stevens dead long ago and john briggs were special mates of mine john is still living  sidenote 1845  in 1845 when i was ten years old there was an epidemic of measles in the town and it made a most alarming slaughter among the little people there was a funeral almost daily and the mothers of the town were nearly demented with fright my mother was greatly troubled she worried over pamela and henry and me and took constant and extraordinary pains to keep us from coming into contact with the contagion but upon reflection i believed that her judgment was at fault it seemed to me that i could improve upon it if left to my own devices i cannot remember now whether i was frightened about the measles or not but i clearly remember that i grew very tired of the suspense i suffered on account of being continually under the threat of death i remember that i got so weary of it and so anxious to have the matter settled one way or the other and promptly that this anxiety spoiled my days and my nights i had no pleasure in them i made up my mind to end this suspense and be done with it will bowen was dangerously ill with the measles and i thought i would go down there and catch them i entered the house by the front way and slipped along through rooms and halls keeping sharp watch against discovery and at last i reached wills bedchamber in the rear of the house on the second floor and got into it uncaptured but that was as far as my victory reached his mother caught me there a moment later and snatched me out of the house and gave me a most competent scolding and drove me away she was so scared that she could hardly get her words out and her face was white i saw that i must manage better next time and i did i hung about the lane at the rear of the house and watched through cracks in the fence until i was convinced that the conditions were favorable then i slipped through the back yard and up the back way and got into the room and into the bed with will bowen without being observed i dont know how long i was in the bed i only remember that will bowen as society had no value for me for he was too sick to even notice that i was there when i heard his mother coming i covered up my head but that device was a failure it was dead summertimethe cover was nothing more than a limp blanket or sheet and anybody could see that there were two of us under it it didnt remain two very long mrs bowen snatched me out of the bed and conducted me home herself with a grip on my collar which she never loosened until she delivered me into my mothers hands along with her opinion of that kind of a boy  it was a good case of measles that resulted it brought me within a shade of deaths door it brought me to where i no longer took any interest in anything but on the contrary felt a total absence of interestwhich was most placid and enchanting i have never enjoyed anything in my life any more than i enjoyed dying that time i was in effect dying the word had been passed and the family notified to assemble around the bed and see me off i knew them all there was no doubtfulness in my vision they were all crying but that did not affect me i took but the vaguest interest in it and that merely because i was the centre of all this emotional attention and was gratified by it and vain of it  when dr cunningham had made up his mind that nothing more could be done for me he put bags of hot ashes all over me he put them on my breast on my wrists on my ankles and so very much to his astonishmentand doubtless to my regrethe dragged me back into this world and set me going again  dictated july 26 1907 in an article entitled englands ovation to mark twain sydney brooksbut never mind that now  i was in oxford by seven oclock that evening june 25 1907 and trying on the scarlet gown which the tailor had been constructing and found it rightright and surpassingly becoming at half past ten the next morning we assembled at all souls college and marched thence gowned mortarboarded and in double file down a long street to the sheldonian theatre between solid walls of the populace very much hurrahd and limitlessly kodakd we made a procession of considerable length and distinction and picturesqueness with the chancellor lord curzon late viceroy of india in his rich robe of black and gold in the lead followed by a pair of trim little boy trainbearers and the trainbearers followed by the young prince arthur of connaught who was to be made a dcl the detachment of dcls were followed by the doctors of science and these by the doctors of literature and these in turn by the doctors of music sidney colvin marched in front of me i was coupled with sidney lee and kipling followed us general booth of the salvation army was in the squadron of dcls  our journey ended we were halted in a fine old hall whence we could see through a corridor of some length the massed audience in the theatre here for a little time we moved about and chatted and made acquaintanceships then the dcls were summoned and they marched through that corridor and the shouting began in the theatre it would be some time before the doctors of literature and of science would be called for because each of those dcls had to have a couple of latin speeches made over him before his promotion would be completeone by the regius professor of civil law the other by the chancellor after a while i asked sir william ramsay if a person might smoke here and not get shot he said yes but that whoever did it and got caught would be fined a guinea and perhaps hanged later he said he knew of a place where we could accomplish at least as much as half of a smoke before any informers would be likely to chance upon us and he was ready to show the way to any who might be willing to risk the guinea and the hanging by request he led the way and kipling sir norman lockyer and i followed we crossed an unpopulated quadrangle and stood under one of its exitsan archway of massive masonryand there we lit up and began to take comfort the photographers soon arrived but they were courteous and friendly and gave us no trouble and we gave them none they grouped us in all sorts of ways and photographed us at their diligent leisure while we smoked and talked we were there more than an hour then we returned to headquarters happy content and greatly refreshed presently we filed into the theatre under a very satisfactory hurrah and waited in a crimson column dividing the crowded pit through the middle until each of us in his turn should be called to stand before the chancellor and hear our merits set forth in sonorous latin meantime kipling and i wrote autographs until some good kind soul interfered in our behalf and procured for us a rest  i will now save what is left of my modesty by quoting a paragraph from sydney brookss ovation                                       let those stars take the place of it for the present sydney brooks has done it well it makes me proud to read it as proud as i was in that old day sixtytwo years ago when i lay dying the centre of attraction with one eye piously closed upon the fleeting vanities of this lifean excellent effectand the other open a crack to observe the tears the sorrow the admirationall for meall for me  ah that was the proudest moment of my long lifeuntil oxford                                       most americans have been to oxford and will remember what a dream of the middle ages it is with its crooked lanes its gray and stately piles of ancient architecture and its meditationbreeding air of repose and dignity and unkinship with the noise and fret and hurry and bustle of these modern days as a dream of the middle ages oxford was not perfect until pageant day arrived and furnished certain details which had been for generations lacking these details began to appear at midafternoon on the 27th at that time singles couples groups and squadrons of the three thousand five hundred costumed characters who were to take part in the pageant began to ooze and drip and stream through house doors all over the old town and wend toward the meadows outside the walls soon the lanes were thronged with costumes which oxford had from time to time seen and been familiar with in bygone centuriesfashions of dress which marked off centuries as by dates and milestoned them back and back and back until history faded into legend and tradition when arthur was a fact and the round table a reality in this rich commingling of quaint and strange and brilliantly colored fashions in dress the dresschanges of oxford for twelve centuries stood livid and realized to the eye oxford as a dream of the middle ages was complete now as it had never in our day before been complete at last there was no discord the mouldering old buildings and the picturesque throngs drifting past them were in harmony soonastonishingly soonthe only persons that seemed out of place and grotesquely and offensively and criminally out of place were such persons as came intruding along clothed in the ugly and odious fashions of the twentieth century they were a bitterness to the feelings an insult to the eye  the makeups of illustrious historic personages seemed perfect both as to portraiture and costume one had no trouble in recognizing them also i was apparently quite easily recognizable myself the first corner i turned brought me suddenly face to face with henry viii a person whom i had been implacably disliking for sixty years but when he put out his hand with royal courtliness and grace and said welcome wellbeloved stranger to my century and to the hospitalities of my realm my old prejudices vanished away and i forgave him i think now that henry the eighth has been overabused and that most of us if we had been situated as he was domestically would not have been able to get along with as limited a graveyard as he forced himself to put up with i feel now that he was one of the nicest men in history personal contact with a king is more effective in removing baleful prejudices than is any amount of argument drawn from tales and histories if i had a child i would name it henry the eighth regardless of sex  do you remember charles the firstand his broad slouch with the plume in it and his slender tall figure and his body clothed in velvet doublet with lace sleeves and his legs in leather with long rapier at his side and his spurs on his heels i encountered him at the next corner and knew him in a momentknew him as perfectly and as vividly as i should know the grand chain in the mississippi if i should see it from the pilothouse after all these years he bent his body and gave his hat a sweep that fetched its plume within an inch of the ground and gave me a welcome that went to my heart this king has been much maligned i shall understand him better hereafter and shall regret him more than i have been in the habit of doing these fifty or sixty years he did some things in his time which might better have been left undone and which cast a shadow upon his namewe all know that we all concede itbut our error has been in regarding them as crimes and in calling them by that name whereas i perceive now that they were only indiscretions at every few steps i met persons of deathless name whom i had never encountered before outside of pictures and statuary and history and these were most thrilling and charming encounters i had handshakes with henry the second who had not been seen in the oxford streets for nearly eight hundred years and with the fair rosamond whom i now believe to have been chaste and blameless although i had thought differently about it before and with shakespeare one of the pleasantest foreigners i have ever gotten acquainted with and with roger bacon and with queen elizabeth who talked five minutes and never swore oncea fact which gave me a new and good opinion of her and moved me to forgive her for beheading the scottish mary if she really did it which i now doubt and with the quaintly and anciently clad young king harold harefoot of near nine hundred years ago who came flying by on a bicycle and smoking a pipe but at once checked up and got off to shake with me and also i met a bishop who had lost his way because this was the first time he had been inside the walls of oxford for as much as twelve hundred years or thereabouts by this time i had grown so used to the obliterated ages and their bestknown people that if i had met adam i should not have been either surprised or embarrassed and if he had come in a racing automobile and a cloud of dust with nothing on but his figleaf it would have seemed to me all right and harmonious                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     chapters from my

uninhabited there were farmhouses here and there at generous distances apart their occupants were descendants of ancestors who had built the houses in rip van winkles time or earlier and those ancestors were not more primitive than were this posterity of theirs the city people were as foreign and unfamiliar and strange to them as monkeys would have been and they would have respected the monkeys as much as they respected these elegant summerresorters the resorters were a puzzle to them their ways were so strange and their interests so trivial they drove the resorters over the mountain roads and listened in shamed surprise at their bursts of enthusiasm over the scenery the farmers had had that scenery on exhibition from their mountain roosts all their lives and had never noticed anything remarkable about it by way of an incident a pair of these primitives were overheard chatting about the resorters one day and in the course of their talk this remark was dropped  i was adrivin

autumn of 71 until his death nineteen years afterward it is not the privilege of the most of us to have many intimate friendsa dozen is our aggregatebut i think he could count his by the score it is seldom that a man is so beloved by both sexes and all ages as warner was there was a charm about his spirit and his ways and his words that won all that came within the sphere of its influence our children adopted him while they were little creatures and thenceforth to the end he was cousin charley to them he was uncle charley to the children of more than one other friend mrs clemens was very fond of him and he always called her by her first nameshortened warner died as she died and as i would diewithout premonition without a moments warning  uncle remus still lives and must be over a thousand years old indeed i know that this must be so because i have seen a new photograph of him in the public prints within the last month or so and in that picture his aspects are distinctly and strikingly geological and one can see he is thinking about the mastodons and plesiosaurians that he used to play with when he was young  it is just a quarter of a century since i have seen uncle remus he visited us in our home in hartford and was reverently devoured by the big eyes of susy and clara for i made a deep and awful impression upon the little creatureswho knew his book by heart through my nightly declamation of its tales to themby revealing to them privately that he was the real uncle remus whitewashed so that he could come into peoples houses the front way  he was the bashfulest grown person i have ever met when there were people about he stayed silent and seemed to suffer until they were gone but he was lovely nevertheless for the sweetness and benignity of the immortal remus looked out from his eyes and the graces and sincerities of his character shone in his face  it may be that jim wolf was as bashful as harris it hardly seems possible yet as i look back fiftysix years and consider jim wolf i am almost persuaded that he was he was our long slim apprentice in my brothers printingoffice in hannibal he was seventeen and yet he was as much as four times as bashful as i was though i was only fourteen he boarded and slept in the house but he was always tonguetied in the presence of my sister and when even my gentle mother spoke to him he could not answer save in frightened monosyllables he would not enter a room where a girl was nothing could persuade him to do such a thing once when he was in our small parlor alone two majestic old maids entered and seated themselves in such a way that jim could not escape without passing by them he would as soon have thought of passing by one of harriss plesiosaurians ninety feet long i came in presently was charmed with the situation and sat down in a corner to watch jim suffer and enjoy it my mother followed a minute later and sat down with the visitors and began to talk jim sat upright in his chair and during a quarter of an hour he did not change his position by a shadeneither general grant nor a bronze image could have maintained that immovable pose more successfully i mean as to body and limbs with the face there was a difference by fleeting revealments of the face i saw that something was happeningsomething out of the common there would be a sudden twitch of the muscles of the face an instant distortion which in the next instant had passed and left no trace these twitches gradually grew in frequency but no muscle outside of the face lost any of its rigidity or betrayed any interest in what was happening to jim i mean if something was happening to him and i knew perfectly well that that was the case at last a pair of tears began to swim slowly down his cheeks amongst the twitchings but jim sat still and let them run then i saw his right hand steal along his thigh until halfway to his knee then take a vigorous grip upon the cloth  that was a wasp that he was grabbing a colony of them were climbing up his legs and prospecting around and every time he winced they stabbed him to the hiltso for a quarter of an hour one group of excursionists after another climbed up jims legs and resented even the slightest wince or squirm that he indulged himself with in his misery when the entertainment had become nearly unbearable he conceived the idea of gripping them between his fingers and putting them out of commission he succeeded with many of them but at great cost for as he couldnt see the wasp he was as likely to take hold of the wrong end of him as he was the right then the dying wasp gave him a punch to remember the incident by  if those ladies had stayed all day and if all the wasps in missouri had come and climbed up jims legs nobody there would ever have known it but jim and the wasps and me there he would have sat until the ladies left  when they finally went away we went upstairs and he took his clothes off and his legs were a picture to look at they looked as if they were mailed all over with shirt buttons each with a single red hole in the centre the pain was intolerableno would have been intolerable but the pain of the presence of those ladies had been so much harder to bear that the pain of the wasps stings was quite pleasant and enjoyable by comparison  jim never could enjoy wasps i remember once        from susys biography of me 18856       mamma has given me a very pleasant little newspaper scrap about      papa to copy i will put it in here   thursday october 11 1906 it was a rather strong compliment i think i will leave it out it was from james redpath  the chief ingredients of redpaths makeup were honesty sincerity kindliness and pluck he wasnt afraid he was one of ossawatomie browns righthand men in the bleeding kansas days he was all through that struggle he carried his life in his hands and from one day to another it wasnt worth the price of a nights lodging he had a small body of daring men under him and they were constantly being hunted by the jayhawkers who were proslavery missourians guerillas modern free lances  friday october 12 1906  i cant think of the name of that daredevil guerilla who led the jayhawkers and chased redpath up and down the country and in turn was chased by redpath by grace of the chances of war the two men never met in the field though they several times came within an ace of it  ten or twelve years later redpath was earning his living in boston as chief of the lecture business in the united states fifteen or sixteen years after his kansas adventures i became a public lecturer and he was my agent along there somewhere was a press dinner one november night at the tremont hotel in boston and i attended it i sat near the head of the table with redpath between me and the chairman a stranger sat on my other side i tried several times to talk with the stranger but he seemed to be out of words and i presently ceased from troubling him he was manifestly a very shy man and moreover he might have been losing sleep the night before  the first man called up was redpath at the mention of the name the stranger started and showed interest he fixed a fascinated eye on redpath and lost not a word of his speech redpath told some stirring incidents of his career in kansas and said among other things  three times i came near capturing the gallant jayhawker chief and once he actually captured me but didnt know me and let me go because he said he was hot on redpaths trail and couldnt afford to waste time and rope on inconsequential small fry  my stranger was called up next and when redpath heard his name he in turn showed a startled interest the stranger said bending a caressing glance upon redpath and speaking gentlyi may even say sweetly  you realize that i was that jayhawker chief i am glad to know you now and take you to my heart and call you friendthen he added in a voice that was pathetic with regret but if i had only known you then what tumultuous happiness i should have had in your societywhile it lasted  the last quarter of a century of my life has been pretty constantly and faithfully devoted to the study of the human racethat is to say the study of myself for in my individual person i am the entire human race compacted together i have found that then is no ingredient of the race which i do not possess in either a small way or a large way when it is small as compared with the same ingredient in somebody else there is still enough of it for all the purposes of examination in my contacts with the species i find no one who possesses a quality which i do not possess the shades of difference between other people and me serve to make variety and prevent monotony but that is all broadly speaking we are all alike and so by studying myself carefully and comparing myself with other people and noting the divergences i have been enabled to acquire a knowledge of the human race which i perceive is more accurate and more comprehensive than that which has been acquired and revealed by any other member of our species as a result my private and concealed opinion of myself is not of a complimentary sort it follows that my estimate of the human race is the duplicate of my estimate of myself  i am not proposing to discuss all of the peculiarities of the human race at this time i only wish to touch lightly upon one or two of them to begin with i wonder why a man should prefer a good billiardtable to a poor one and why he should prefer straight cues to crooked ones and why he should prefer round balls to chipped ones and why he should prefer a level table to one that slants and why he should prefer responsive cushions to the dull and unresponsive kind i wonder at these things because when we examine the matter we find that the essentials involved in billiards are as competently and exhaustively furnished by a bad billiard outfit as they are by the best one one of the essentials is amusement very well if there is any more amusement to be gotten out of the one outfit than out of the other the facts are in favor of the bad outfit the bad outfit will always furnish thirty per cent more fun for the players and for the spectators than will the good outfit another essential of the game is that the outfit shall give the players full opportunity to exercise their best skill and display it in a way to compel the admiration of the spectators very well the bad outfit is nothing behind the good one in this regard it is a difficult matter to estimate correctly the eccentricities of chipped balls and a slanting table and make the right allowance for them and secure a count the finest kind of skill is required to accomplish the satisfactory result another essential of the game is that it shall add to the interest of the game by furnishing opportunities to bet very well in this regard no good outfit can claim any advantage over a bad one i know by experience that a bad outfit is as valuable as the best one that an outfit that couldnt be sold at auction for seven dollars is just as valuable for all the essentials of the game as an outfit that is worth a thousand  i acquired some of this learning in jackass gulch california more than forty years ago jackass gulch had once been a rich and thriving surfacemining camp by and by its gold deposits were exhausted then the people began to go away and the town began to decay and rapidly in my time it had disappeared where the bank and the city hall and the church and the gamblingdens and the newspaper office and the streets of brick blocks had been was nothing now but a wide and beautiful expanse of green grass a peaceful and charming solitude half a dozen scattered dwellings were still inhabited and there was still one saloon of a ruined and rickety character struggling for life but doomed in its bar was a billiard outfit that was the counterpart of the one in my fatherinlaws garret the balls were chipped the cloth was darned and patched the tables surface was undulating and the cues were headless and had the curve of a parenthesisbut the forlorn remnant of marooned miners played games there and those games were more entertaining to look at than a circus and a grand opera combined nothing but a quite extraordinary skill could score a carom on that tablea skill that required the nicest estimate of force distance and how much to allow for the various slants of the table and the other formidable peculiarities and idiosyncrasies furnished by the contradictions of the outfit last winter here in new york i saw hoppe and schaefer and sutton and the three or four other billiard champions of worldwide fame contend against each other and certainly the art and science displayed were a wonder to see yet i saw nothing there in the way of science and art that was more wonderful than shots which i had seen texas tom make on the wavy surface of that poor old wreck in the perishing saloon at jackass gulch forty years before once i saw texas tom make a string of seven points on a single inningall calculated shots and not a fluke or a scratch among them i often saw him make runs of four but when he made his great string of seven the boys went wild with enthusiasm and admiration the joy and the noise exceeded that which the great gathering at madison square produced when sutton scored five hundred points at the eighteeninch game on a worldfamous night last winter with practice that champion could score nineteen or twenty on the jackass gulch table but to start with texas tom would show him miracles that would astonish him also it might have another handsome result it might persuade the great experts to discard their own trifling game and bring the jackass gulch outfit here and exhibit their skill in a game worth a hundred of the discarded one for profound and breathless interest and for displays of almost superhuman skill  in my experience games played with a fiendish outfit furnish ecstasies of delight which games played with the other kind cannot match twentyseven years ago my budding little family spent the summer at batemans point near newport rhode island it was a comfortable boardingplace well stocked with sweet mothers and little children but the male sex was scarce however there was another young fellow besides myself and he and i had good timeshiggins was his name but that was not his fault he was a very pleasant and companionable person on the premises there was what had once been a bowlingalley it was a single alley and it was estimated that it had been out of repair for sixty yearsbut not the balls the balls were in good condition there were fortyone of them and they ranged in size from a grapefruit up to a lignumvitæ sphere that you could hardly lift higgins and i played on that alley day after day at first one of us located himself at the bottom end to set up the pins in case anything should happen to them but nothing happened the surface of that alley consisted of a rolling stretch of elevations and depressions and neither of us could by any art known to us persuade a ball to stay on the alley until it should accomplish something little balls and big the same thing always happenedthe ball left the alley before it was halfway home and went thundering down alongside of it the rest of the way and made the gamekeeper climb out and take care of himself no matter we persevered and were rewarded we examined the alley noted and located a lot of its peculiarities and little by little we learned how to deliver a ball in such a way that it would travel home and knock down a pin or two by and by we succeeded in improving our game to a point where we were able to get all of the pins with thirtyfive ballsso we made it a thirtyfiveball game if the player did not succeed with thirtyfive he had lost the game i suppose that all the balls taken together weighed five hundred pounds or maybe a tonor along there somewherebut anyway it was hot weather and by the time that a player had sent thirtyfive of them home he was in a drench of perspiration and physically exhausted  next we started cocked hatthat is to say a triangle of three pins the other seven being discarded in this game we used the three smallest balls and kept on delivering them until we got the three pins down after a day or two of practice we were able to get the chief pin with an output of four balls but it cost us a great many deliveries to get the other two but by and by we succeeded in perfecting our artat least we perfected it to our limit we reached a scientific excellence where we could get the three pins down with twelve deliveries of the three small balls making thirtysix shots to conquer the cocked hat  having reached our limit for daylight work we set up a couple of candles and played at night as the alley was fifty or sixty feet long we couldnt see the pins but the candles indicated their locality we continued this game until we were able to knock down the invisible pins with thirtysix shots having now reached the limit of the candle game we changed and played it lefthanded we continued the lefthanded game until we conquered its limit which was fiftyfour shots sometimes we sent down a succession of fifteen balls without getting anything at all we easily got out of that old alley five times the fun that anybody could have gotten out of the best alley in new york  one blazing hot day a modest and courteous officer of the regular army appeared in our den and introduced himself he was about thirtyfive years old well built and militarily erect and straight and he was hermetically sealed up in the uniform of that ignorant old daya uniform made of heavy material and much properer for january than july when he saw the venerable alley and glanced from that to the long procession of shining balls in the trough his eye lit with desire and we judged that he was our meat we politely invited him to take a hand and he could not conceal his gratitude though his breeding and the etiquette of his profession made him try we explained the game to him and said that there were fortyone balls and that the player was privileged to extend his inning and keep on playing until he had used them all uprepeatedlyand that for every tenstrike he got a prize we didnt name the prizeit wasnt necessary as no prize would ever be needed or called for he started a sarcastic smile but quenched it according to the etiquette of his profession he merely remarked that he would like to select a couple of medium balls and one small one adding that he didnt think he would need the rest  then he began and he was an astonished man he couldnt get a ball to stay on the alley when he had fired about fifteen balls and hadnt yet reached the cluster of pins his annoyance began to show out through his clothes he wouldnt let it show in his face but after another fifteen balls he was not able to control his face he didnt utter a word but he exuded mute blasphemy from every pore he asked permission to take off his coat which was granted then he turned himself loose with bitter determination and although he was only an infantry officer he could have been mistaken for a battery he got up such a volleying thunder with those balls presently he removed his cravat after a little he took off his vest and still he went bravely on higgins was suffocating my condition was the same but it would not be courteous to laugh it would be better to burst and we came near it that officer was good pluck he stood to his work without uttering a word and kept the balls going until he had expended the outfit four times making four times fortyone shots then he had to give it up and he did for he was no longer able to stand without wobbling he put on his clothes bade us a courteous goodby invited us to call at the fort and started away then he came back and said  what is the prize for the tenstrike  we had to confess that we had not selected it yet  he said gravely that he thought there was no occasion for hurry about it  i believe batemans alley was a better one than any other in america in the matter of the essentials of the game it compelled skill it provided opportunity for bets and if you could get a stranger to do the bowling for you there was more and wholesomer and delightfuler entertainment to be gotten out of his industries than out of the finest game by the best expert and played upon the best alley elsewhere in existence                                                       mark twain                         to be continued     north american review  no dcxxv  december 1907   chapters from my autobiographyxxv  by mark twain   january 11 1906 answer to a letter received this morning        dear mrs hi am forever your debtor for reminding me of that      curious passage in my life during the first year or two after it      happened i could not bear to think of it my pain and shame were      so intense and my sense of having been an imbecile so settled      established and confirmed that i drove the episode entirely from      my mindand so all these twentyeight or twentynine years i have      lived in the conviction that my performance of that time was      coarse vulgar and destitute of humor but your suggestion that you      and your family found humor in it twentyeight years ago moved me      to look into the matter so i commissioned a boston typewriter to      delve among the boston papers of that bygone time and send me a      copy of it       it came this morning and if there is any vulgarity about it i am      not able to discover it if it isnt innocently and ridiculously      funny i am no judge i will see to it that you get a copy                   address of samuel l clemens mark twain             from a report of the dinner given by the publishers                  of the atlantic monthly in honor of the                       seventieth anniversary of the          birth of john greenleaf whittier at the hotel brunswick                          boston december 17 1877                             as published in the                          boston evening transcript                              december 18 1877        mr chairmanthis is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging      up of pleasant reminiscences concerning literary folk therefore i      will drop lightly into history myself standing here on the shore      of the atlantic and contemplating certain of its largest literary      billows i am reminded of a thing which happened to me thirteen      years ago when i had just succeeded in stirring up a little      nevadian literary puddle myself whose spumeflakes were beginning      to blow thinly californiawards i started an inspection tramp      through the southern mines of california i was callow and      conceited and i resolved to try the virtue of my nom de guerre      i very soon had an opportunity i knocked at a miners lonely log      cabin in the foothills of the sierras just at nightfall it was      snowing at the time a jaded melancholy man of fifty barefooted      opened the door to me when he heard my nom de guerre he looked      more dejected than before he let me inpretty reluctantly i      thoughtand after the customary bacon and beans black coffee and      hot whiskey i took a pipe this sorrowful man had not said three      words up to this time now he spoke up and said in the voice of      one who is secretly suffering youre the fourthim going to      move the fourth what said i the fourth littery man that has      been here in twentyfour hoursim going to move you dont tell      me said i who were the others mr longfellow mr emerson      and mr oliver wendell holmesconsound the lot       you can easily believe i was interested i supplicatedthree hot      whiskeys did the restand finally the melancholy miner began said      he       they came here just at dark yesterday evening and i let them in      of course said they were going to the yosemite they were a rough      lot but thats nothing everybody looks rough that travels afoot      mr emerson was a seedy little bit of a chap redheaded mr      holmes as fat as a balloon he weighed as much as three hundred      and double chins all the way down to his stomach mr longfellow      built like a prizefighter his head was cropped and bristly like      as if he had a wig made of hairbrushes his nose lay straight down      his face like a finger with the end joint tilted up they had been      drinking i could see that and what queer talk they used mr      holmes inspected this cabin then he took me by the buttonhole and      says he        through the deep cares of thought      i hear a voice that sings      build thee more stately mansions      o my soul        says i i cant afford it mr holmes and moreover i dont want      to blamed if i liked it pretty well either coming from a      stranger that way however i started to get out my bacon and      beans when mr emerson came and looked on awhile and then he      takes me aside by the buttonhole and says        give me agates for my meat      give me cantharids to eat      from air and ocean bring me foods      from all zones and altitudes        says i mr emerson if youll excuse me this aint no hotel      you see it sort of riled mei warnt used to the ways of littery      swells but i went on asweating over my work and next comes mr      longfellow and buttonholes me and interrupts me says he        honor be to mudjekeewis      you shall hear how paupukkeewis        but i broke in and says i beg your pardon mr longfellow if      youll be so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and      let me get this grub ready youll do me proud well sir after      theyd filled up i set out the jug mr holmes looks at it and then      he fires up all of a sudden and yells        flash out a stream of bloodred wine      for i would drink to other days        by george i was getting kind of worked up i dont deny it i was      getting kind of worked up i turns to mr holmes and says i      looky here my fat friend im arunning this shanty and if the      court knows herself youll take whiskey straight or youll go      dry thems the very words i said to him now i dont want to sass      such famous littery people but you see they kind of forced me      there aint nothing onreasonable bout me i dont mind a passel of      guests atreadin on my tail three or four times but when it comes      to standing on it its different and if the court knows      herself i says youll take whiskey straight or youll go dry      well between drinks theyd swell around the cabin and strike      attitudes and spout and pretty soon they got out a greasy old deck      and went to playing euchre at ten cents a corneron trust i began      to notice some pretty suspicious things mr emerson dealt looked      at his hand shook his head says        i am the doubter and the doubt        and camly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new      layout says he        they reckon ill who leave me out      they know not well the subtle ways i keep      i pass and deal again        hangd if he didnt go ahead and do it too o he was a cool one      well in about a minute things were running pretty tight but all      of a sudden i see by mr emersons eye he judged he had em he had      already corralled two tricks and each of the others one so now he      kind of lifts a little in his chair and says        i tire of globes and aces      too long the game is played        and down he fetched a right bower mr longfellow smiles as sweet      as pie and says        thanks thanks to thee my worthy friend      for the lesson thou hast taught        and blamed if he didnt down with another right bower emerson      claps his hand on his bowie longfellow claps his on his revolver      and i went under a bunk there was going to be trouble but that      monstrous holmes rose up wobbling his double chins and says he      order gentlemen the first man that draws ill lay down on him      and smother him all quiet on the potomac you bet       they were pretty howcomeyouso by now and they begun to blow      emerson says the nobbiest thing i ever wrote was barbara      frietchie says longfellow it dont begin with my biglow      papers says holmes my thanatopsis lays over em both they      mighty near ended in a fight then they wished they had some more      companyand mr emerson pointed to me and says        is yonder squalid peasant all      that this proud nursery could breed        he was awhetting his bowie on his bootso i let it pass well      sir next they took it into their heads that they would like some      music so they made me stand up and sing when johnny comes      marching home till i droppedat thirteen minutes past four this      morning thats what ive been through my friend when i woke at      seven they were leaving thank goodness and mr longfellow had my      only boots on and hisn under his arm says i hold on there      evangeline what are you going to do with them he says going      to make tracks with em because        lives of great men all remind us      we can make our lives sublime      and departing leave behind us      footprints on the sands of time        as i said mr twain you are the fourth in twentyfour hoursand      im going to move i aint suited to a littery atmosphere       i said to the miner why my dear sir these were not the      gracious singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and      homage these were impostors       the miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while then said      he ah impostors were they are you       i did not pursue the subject and since then i have not travelled      on my nom de guerre enough to hurt such was the reminiscence i      was moved to contribute mr chairman in my enthusiasm i may have      exaggerated the details a little but you will easily forgive me      that fault since i believe it is the first time i have ever      deflected from perpendicular fact on an occasion like this   what i have said to mrs h is true i did suffer during a year or two from the deep humiliations of that episode but at last in 1888 in venice my wife and i came across mr and mrs a p c of concord massachusetts and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but death terminates the cs were very bright people and in every way charming and companionable we were together a month or two in venice and several months in rome afterwards and one day that lamented break of mine was mentioned and when i was on the point of lathering those people for bringing it to my mind when i had gotten the memory of it almost squelched i perceived with joy that the cs were indignant about the way that my performance had been received in boston they poured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty attitude of the people who were present at that performance and about the boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the matter that position was that i had been irreverent beyond belief beyond imagination very well i had accepted that as a fact for a year or two and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever i thought of itwhich was not frequently if i could help it whenever i thought of it i wondered how i ever could have been inspired to do so unholy a thing well the cs comforted me but they did not persuade me to continue to think about the unhappy episode i resisted that i tried to get it out of my mind and let it die and i succeeded until mrs hs letter came it had been a good twentyfive years since i had thought of that matter and when she said that the thing was funny i wondered if possibly she might be right at any rate my curiosity was aroused and i wrote to boston and got the whole thing copied as above set forth  i vaguely remember some of the details of that gatheringdimly i can see a hundred peopleno perhaps fiftyshadowy figures sitting at tables feeding ghosts now to me and nameless forever more i dont know who they were but i can very distinctly see seated at the grand table and facing the rest of us mr emerson supernaturally grave unsmiling mr whittier grave lovely his beautiful spirit shining out of his face mr longfellow with his silken white hair and his benignant face dr oliver wendell holmes flashing smiles and affection and all goodfellowship everywhere like a rosediamond whose facets are being turned toward the light first one way and then anothera charming man and always fascinating whether he was talking or whether he was sitting still what he would call still but what would be more or lees motion to other people i can see those figures with entire distinctness across this abyss of time  one other feature is clearwillie winter for these past thousand years dramatic editor of the new york tribune and still occupying that high post in his old age was there he was much younger then than he is now and he showed it it was always a pleasure to me to see willie winter at a banquet during a matter of twenty years i was seldom at a banquet where willie winter was not also present and where he did not read a charming poem written for the occasion he did it this time and it was up to standard dainty happy choicely phrased and as good to listen to as music and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of heart and brain  now at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable celebration of mr whittiers seventieth birthdaybecause i got up at that point and followed winter with what i have no doubt i supposed would be the gem of the eveningthe gay oration above quoted from the boston paper i had written it all out the day before and had perfectly memorized it and i stood up there at my genial and happy and selfsatisfied ease and began to deliver it those majestic guests that row of venerable and still active volcanoes listened as did everybody else in the house with attentive interest well i delivered myself ofwell say the first two hundred words of my speech i was expecting no returns from that part of the speech but this was not the case as regarded the rest of it i arrived now at the dialogue the old miner said you are the fourth im going to move the fourth what said i he answered the fourth littery man that has been here in twentyfour hours i am going to move why you dont tell me said i who were the others mr longfellow mr emerson mr oliver wendell holmes consound the lot  now then the houses attention continued but the expression of interest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost i wondered what the trouble was i didnt know i went on but with difficultyi struggled along and entered upon that miners fearful description of the bogus emerson the bogus holmes the bogus longfellow always hopingbut with a gradually perishing hopethat somebody would laugh or that somebody would at least smile but nobody did i didnt know enough to give it up and sit down i was too new to public speaking and so i went on with this awful performance and carried it clear through to the end in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with horror it was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if i had been making these remarks about the deity and the rest of the trinity there is no milder way in which to describe the petrified condition and the ghastly expression of those people  when i sat down it was with a heart which had long ceased to beat i shall never be as dead again as i was then i shall never be as miserable again as i was then i speak now as one who doesnt know what the condition of things may be in the next world but in this one i shall never be as wretched again as i was then howells who was near me tried to say a comforting word but couldnt get beyond a gasp there was no usehe understood the whole size of the disaster he had good intentions but the words froze before they could get out it was an atmosphere that would freeze anything if benvenuto cellinis salamander had been in that place he would not have survived to be put into cellinis autobiography there was a frightful pause there was an awful silence a desolating silence then the next man on the list had to get upthere was no help for it that was bishopbishop had just burst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable novel which had appeared in the atlantic monthly a place which would make any novel respectable and any author noteworthy in this case the novel itself was recognized as being without extraneous help respectable bishop was away up in the public favor and he was an object of high interest consequently there was a sort of national expectancy in the air we may say our american millions were standing from maine to texas and from alaska to florida holding their breath their lips parted their hands ready to applaud when bishop should get up on that occasion and for the first time in his life speak in public it was under these damaging conditions that he got up to make good as the vulgar say i had spoken several times before and that in the reason why i was able to go on without dying in my tracks as i ought to have donebut bishop had had no experience he was up facing those awful deitiesfacing those other people those strangersfacing human beings for the first time in his life with a speech to utter no doubt it was well packed away in his memory no doubt it was fresh and usable until i had been heard from i suppose that after that and under the smothering pall of that dreary silence it began to waste away and disappear out of his head like the rags breaking from the edge of a fog and presently there wasnt any fog left he didnt go onhe didnt last long it was not many sentences after his first before he began to hesitate and break and lose his grip and totter and wobble and at last he slumped down in a limp and mushy pile  well the programme for the occasion was probably not more than onethird finished but it ended there nobody rose the next man hadnt strength enough to get up and everybody looked so dazed so stupefied paralyzed it was impossible for anybody to do anything or even try nothing could go on in that strange atmosphere howells mournfully and without words hitched himself to bishop and me and supported us out of the room it was very kindhe was most generous he towed us tottering away into some room in that building and we sat down there i dont know what my remark was now but i know the nature of it it was the kind of remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can help your case but howells was honesthe had to say the heartbreaking things he did say that there was no help for this calamity this shipwreck this cataclysm that this was the most disastrous thing that had ever happened in anybodys historyand then he added that is for youand consider what you have done for bishop it is bad enough in your case you deserve to suffer you have committed this crime and you deserve to have all you are going to get but here is an innocent man bishop had never done you any harm and see what you have done to him he can never hold his head up again the world can never look upon bishop as being a live person he is a corpse  that is the history of that episode of twentyeight years ago which pretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two whenever it forced its way into my mind  now then i take that speech up and examine it as i said it arrived this morning from boston i have read it twice and unless i am an idiot it hasnt a single defect in it from the first word to the last it is just as good as good can be it is smart it is saturated with humor there isnt a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it anywhere what could have been the matter with that house it is amazing it is incredible that they didnt shout with laughter and those deities the loudest of them all could the fault have been with me did i lose courage when i saw those great men up there whom i was going to describe in such a strange fashion if that happened if i showed doubt that can account for it for you cant be successfully funny if you show that you are afraid of it well i cant account for it but if i had those beloved and revered old literary immortals back here now on the platform at carnegie hall i would take that same old speech deliver it word for word and melt them till theyd run all over that stage oh the fault must have been with me it is not in the speech at all  dictated october 3 1907 in some ways i was always honest even from my earliest years i could never bring myself to use money which i had acquired in questionable ways many a time i tried but principle was always stronger than desire six or eight months ago lieutenantgeneral nelson a miles was given a great dinnerparty in new york and when he and i were chatting together in the drawingroom before going out to dinner he said  ive known you as much as thirty years isnt it  i said yes thats about it i think  he mused a moment or two and then said  i wonder we didnt meet in washington in 1867 you were there at that time werent you  i said yes but there was a difference i was not known then i had not begun to budi was an obscurity but you had been adding to your fine civil war record you had just come back from your brilliant indian campaign in the far west and had been rewarded with a brigadiergeneralship in the regular army and everybody was talking about you and praising you if you had met me you wouldnt be able to remember it nowunless some unusual circumstance of the meeting had burnt it into your memory it is forty years ago and people dont remember nobodies over a stretch of time like that  i didnt wish to continue the conversation along that line so i changed the subject i could have proven to him without any trouble that we did meet in washington in 1867 but i thought it might embarrass one or the other of us so i didnt do it i remember the incident very well this was the way of it  i had just come back from the quaker city excursion and had made a contract with bliss of hartford to write the innocents abroad i was out of money and i went down to washington to see if i could earn enough there to keep me in bread and butter while i should write the book i came across william clinton brother of the astronomer and together we invented a scheme for our mutual sustenance we became the fathers and originators of what is a common feature in the newspaper world nowthe syndicate we became the old original first newspaper syndicate on the planet it was on a small scale but that is usual with untried new enterprises we had twelve journals on our list they were all weeklies all obscure and poor and all scattered far away among the back settlements it was a proud thing for those little newspapers to have a washington correspondence and a fortunate thing for us that they felt in that way about it each of the twelve took two letters a week from us at a dollar per letter each of us wrote one letter per week and sent off six duplicates of it to these benefactors thus acquiring twentyfour dollars a week to live onwhich was all we needed in our cheap and humble quarters  clinton was one of the dearest and loveliest human beings i have ever known and we led a charmed existence together in a contentment which knew no bounds clinton was refined by nature and breeding he was a gentleman by nature and breeding he was highly educated he was of a beautiful spirit he was pure in heart and speech he was a scotchman and a presbyterian a presbyterian of the old and genuine school being honest and sincere in his religion and loving it and finding serenity and peace in it he hadnt a viceunless a large and grateful sympathy with scotch whiskey may be called by that name i didnt regard it as a vice because he was a scotchman and scotch whiskey to a scotchman is as innocent as milk is to the rest of the human race in clintons case it was a virtue and not an economical one twentyfour dollars a week would really have been riches to us if we hadnt had to support that jug because of the jug we were always sailing pretty close to the wind and any tardiness in the arrival of any part of our income was sure to cause us some inconvenience  i remember a time when a shortage occurred we had to have three dollars and we had to have it before the close of the day i dont know now how we happened to want all that money at one time i only know we had to have it clinton told me to go out and find itand he said he would also go out and see what he could do he didnt seem to have any doubt that we would succeed but i knew that that was his religion working in him i hadnt the same confidence i hadnt any idea where to turn to raise all that bullion and i said so i think he was ashamed of me privately because of my weak faith he told me to give myself no uneasiness no concern and said in a simple confident and unquestioning way the lord will provide i saw that he fully believed the lord would provide but it seemed to me that if he had had my experience  but never mind that before he was done with me his strong faith had had its influence and i went forth from the place almost convinced that the lord really would provide  i wandered around the streets for an hour trying to think up some way to get that money but nothing suggested itself at last i lounged into the big lobby of the ebbitt house which was then a new hotel and sat down presently a dog came loafing along he paused glanced up at me and said with his eyes are you friendly i answered with my eyes that i was he gave his tail a grateful little wag and came forward and rested his jaw on my knee and lifted his brown eyes to my face in a winningly affectionate way he was a lovely creatureas beautiful as a girl and he was made all of silk and velvet i stroked his smooth brown head and fondled his drooping ears and we were a pair of lovers right away pretty soon brigadiergeneral miles the hero of the land came strolling by in his blue and gold splendors with everybodys admiring gaze upon him he saw the dog and stopped and there was a light in his eye which showed that he had a warm place in his heart for dogs like this gracious creature then he came forward and patted the dog and said  he is very finehe is a wonder would you sell him  i was greatly moved it seemed a marvellous thing to me the way clintons prediction had come true i said  yes  the general said  what do you ask for him  three dollars  the general was manifestly surprised he said  three dollars only three dollars why that dog is a most uncommon dog he cant possibly be worth leas than fifty if he were mine i wouldnt take a hundred for him im afraid you are not aware of his value reconsider your price if you like i dont wish to wrong you  but if he had known me he would have known that i was no more capable of wronging him than he was of wronging me i responded with the same quiet decision as before  nothree dollars that is his price  very well since you insist upon it said the general and he gave me three dollars and led the dog away and disappeared upstairs  in about ten minutes a gentlefaced middleaged gentleman came along and began to look around here and there and under tables and everywhere and i said to him  is it a dog you are looking for  his face was sad before and troubled but it lit up gladly now and he answered  yeshave you seen him  yes i said he was here a minute ago and i saw him follow a gentleman away i think i could find him for you if you would like me to try  i have seldom seen a person look so gratefuland there was gratitude in his voice too when he conceded that he would like me to try i said i would do it with great pleasure but that as it might take a little time i hoped he would not mind paying me something for my trouble he said he would do it most gladlyrepeating that phrase most gladlyand asked me how much i said  three dollars  he looked surprised and said  dear me it is nothing i will pay you ten quite willingly  but i said  no three is the priceand i started for the stairs without waiting for any further argument for clinton had said that that was the amount that the lord would provide and it seemed to me that it would be sacrilegious to take a penny more than was promised  i got the number of the generals room from the officeclerk as i passed by his wicket and when i reached the room i found the general there caressing his dog and quite happy i said  i am sorry but i have to take the dog again  he seemed very much surprised and said  take him again why he is my dog you sold him to me and at your own price  yes i said it is truebut i have to have him because the man wants him again  what man  the man that owns him he wasnt my dog  the general looked even more surprised than before and for a moment he couldnt seem to find his voice then he said  do you mean to tell me that you were selling another mans dogand knew it  yes i knew it wasnt my dog  then why did you sell him  i said  well that is a curious question to ask i sold him because you wanted him you offered to buy the dog you cant deny that i was not anxious to sell himi had not even thought of selling him but it seemed to me that if it could be any accommodation to you  he broke me off in the middle and said  accommodation to me it is the most extraordinary spirit of accommodation i have ever heard ofthe idea of your selling a dog that didnt belong to you  i broke him off there and said  there is no relevancy about this kind of argument you said yourself that the dog was probably worth a hundred dollars i only asked you three was there anything unfair about that you offered to pay more you know you did i only asked you three you cant deny it  oh what in the world has that to do with it the crux of the matter is that you didnt own the dogcant you see that you seem to think that there is no impropriety in selling property that isnt yours provided you sell it cheap now then  i said  please dont argue about it any more you cant get around the fact that the price was perfectly fair perfectly reasonableconsidering that i didnt own the dogand so arguing about it is only a waste of words i have to have him back again because the man wants him dont you see that i havent any choice in the matter put yourself in my place suppose you had sold a dog that didnt belong to you suppose you  oh he said dont muddle my brains any more with your idiotic reasonings take him along and give me a rest  so i paid back the three dollars and led the dog downstairs and passed him over to his owner and collected three for my trouble  i went away then with a good conscience because i had acted honorably i never could have used the three that i sold the dog for because it was not rightly my own but the three i got for restoring him to his rightful owner was righteously and properly mine because i had earned it that man might never have gotten that dog back at all if it hadnt been for me my principles have remained to this day what they were then i was always honest i know i can never be otherwise it is as i said in the beginningi was never able to persuade myself to use money which i had acquired in questionable ways  now then that is the tale some of it is true                                                       mark twain
