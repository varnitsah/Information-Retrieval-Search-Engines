1910 1912  mr bryces introduction to lincolns speeches is printed from plates made and type set by the university press cambridge mass usa  taken by permission from the complete works of abraham lincoln century company 1894        illustration when he sent his great voice forth out of his breast  his words fell like the winter snows nor then would any mortal contend with ulysseshomer iliad      introduction   no man since washington has become to americans so familiar or so beloved a figure as abraham lincoln he is to them the representative and typical american the man who best embodies the political ideals of the nation he is typical in the fact that he sprang from the masses of the people that he remained through his whole career a man of the people that his chief desire was to be in accord with the beliefs and wishes of the people that he never failed to trust in the people and to rely on their support every native american knows his life and his speeches his anecdotes and witticisms have passed into the thought and the conversation of the whole nation as those of no other statesman have done  he belongs however not only to the united states but to the whole of civilized mankind it is no exaggeration to say that he has within the last thirty years grown to be a conspicuous figure in the history of the modern world without him the course of events not only in the western hemisphere but in europe also would have been different for he was called to guide at the greatest crisis of its fate a state already mighty and now far more mighty than in his days and the guidance he gave has affected the march of events ever since a life and a character such as his ought to be known to and comprehended by europeans as well as by americans among europeans it is especially englishmen who ought to appreciate him and understand the significance of his life for he came of an english stock he spoke the english tongue his action told upon the progress of events and the shaping of opinion in all british communities everywhere more than it has done upon any other nation outside america itself  this collection of lincolns speeches seeks to make him known by his words as readers of history know him by his deeds in popularlygoverned countries the great statesman is almost of necessity an orator though his eminence as a speaker may be no true measure either of his momentary power or of his permanent fame for wisdom courage and tact bear little direct relation to the gift for speech but whether that gift be present in greater or in lesser degree the character and ideas of a statesman are best studied through his own words this is particularly true of lincoln because he was not what may be called a professional orator there have been famous orators whose speeches we may read for the beauty of their language or for the wealth of ideas they contain with comparatively little regard to the circumstances of time and place that led to their being delivered lincoln is not one of these his speeches need to be studied in close relation to the occasions which called them forth they are not philosophical lucubrations or brilliant displays of rhetoric they are a part of his life they are the expression of his convictions and derive no small part of their weight and dignity from the fact that they deal with grave and urgent questions and express the spirit in which he approached those questions few great characters stand out so clearly revealed by their words whether spoken or written as he does  accordingly lincolns discourses are not like those of nearly all the men whose eloquence has won them fame when we think of such men as pericles demosthenes Ã†schines cicero hortensius burke sheridan erskine canning webster gladstone bright massillon vergniaud castelar we think of exuberance of ideas or of phrases of a command of appropriate similes or metaphors of the gifts of invention and of exposition of imaginative flights or outbursts of passion fit to stir and rouse an audience to like passion we think of the orator as gifted with a powerful or finelymodulated voice an imposing presence a graceful delivery or ifremembering that lincoln was by profession a lawyer and practised until he became president of the united stateswe think of the special gifts which mark the forensic orator we should expect to find a man full of ingenuity and subtlety one dexterous in handling his case in such wise as to please and capture the judge or the jury whom he addresses one skilled in those rhetorical devices and strokes of art which can be used when need be to engage the listeners feelings and distract his mind from the real merits of the issue  of all this kind of talent there was in lincoln but little he was not an artful pleader indeed it was said of him that he could argue well only those cases in the justice of which he personally believed and was unable to make the worse appear the better reason for most of the qualities which the world admires in cicero or in burke we should look in vain in lincolns speeches they are not fine pieces of exquisite diction fit to be declaimed as school exercises or set before students as models of composition  what then are their merits and why do they deserve to be valued and remembered how comes it that a man of firstrate powers was deficient in qualities appertaining to his own profession which men less remarkable have possessed  to answer this question let us first ask what were the preparation and training abraham lincoln had for oratory whether political or forensic  born in rude and abject poverty he had never any education except what he gave himself till he was approaching manhood not even books wherewith to inform and train his mind were within his reach no school no university no legal faculty had any part in training his powers when he became a lawyer and a politician the years most favourable to continuous study had already passed and the opportunities he found for reading were very scanty he knew but few authors in general literature though he knew those few thoroughly he taught himself a little mathematics but he could read no language save his own and can have had only the faintest acquaintance with european history or with any branch of philosophy  the want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among whom his lot was cast till he was a grown man he never moved in any society from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an orator or a statesman ought to be stored even after he had gained some legal practice there was for many years no one for him to mix with except the petty practitioners of a petty town men nearly all of whom knew little more than he did himself  schools gave him nothing and society gave him nothing but he had a powerful intellect and a resolute will isolation fostered not only selfreliance but the habit of reflection and indeed of prolonged and intense reflection he made all that he knew a part of himself he thought everything out for himself his convictions were his ownclear and coherent he was not positive or opinionated and he did not deny that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided on his course but though he could keep a policy in suspense waiting for events to guide him he did not waver he paused and reconsidered but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made or to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been attained he took advice readily and left many things to his ministers but he did not lean upon his advisers without vanity or ostentation he was always independent selfcontained prepared to take full responsibility for his acts  that he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes that his mind played freely round everything it touched we know from the accounts of his talk which first made him famous in the town and neighbourhood where he lived his humour and his memory for anecdotes which he could bring out to good purpose at the right moment are qualities which europe deems distinctively american but no great man of action in the nineteenth century even in america possessed them in the same measure seldom has so acute a power of observation been found united to so abundant a power of sympathy  these remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than of his speeches yet they are not irrelevant because the interest of his speeches lies in their revelation of his character let us however return to the speeches and to the letters some of which given in this volume are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches  what are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters there is less humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us to expect they are serious grave practical we feel that the man does not care to play over the surface of the subject or to use it as a way of displaying his cleverness he is trying to get right down to the very foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it are in this respect he sometimes reminds us of bismarcks speeches which in their rude broken forthdarting way always go straight to their destined aim always hit the nail on the head so too in their effort to grapple with fundamental facts lincolns bear a sort of likeness to cromwells speeches though cromwell has far less power of utterance and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of finding language to convey to others what is plain true and weighty to himself this difficulty makes the great protector though we can usually see what he is driving at frequently confused and obscure lincoln however is always clear simplicity directness and breadth are the notes of his thought aptness clearness and again simplicity are the notes of his diction the american speakers of his generation like most of those of the preceding generation but unlike those of that earlier generation to which alexander hamilton john adams marshall and madison belonged were generally infected by a floridity which made them a byword in europe even men of brilliant talent such as edward everett were by no means free from this straining after effect by highlycoloured phrases and theatrical effects such faults have today virtually vanished from the united states largely from a change in public taste to which perhaps the example set by lincoln himself may have contributed in the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was rampant especially in the west and south where taste was less polished than in the older states that lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of his independence as well as of his greatness there is no superfluous ornament in his orations nothing tawdry nothing otiose for the most part he addresses the reason of his hearers and credits them with desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them when he does appeal to emotion he does it quietly perhaps even solemnly the note struck is always a high note the impressiveness of the appeal comes not from fervid vehemence of language but from the sincerity of his own convictions sometimes one can see that through its whole course the argument is suffused by the speakers feeling and when the time comes for the feeling to be directly expressed it glows not with fitful flashes but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul  the impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that their matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have not been learnt by heart but there is an anecdote that on one occasion early in his career lincoln went to a public meeting not in the least intending to speak but presently being called for by the audience rose in obedience to the call and delivered a long address so ardent and thrilling that the reporters dropped their pencils and absorbed in watching him forgot to take down what he said it has also been stated on good authority that on his way in the railroad cars to the dedication of the monument on the field of gettysburg he turned to a pennsylvanian gentleman who was sitting beside him and remarked i suppose i shall be expected to say something this afternoon lend me a pencil and a bit of paper and that he thereupon jotted down the notes of a speech which has become the best known and best remembered of all his utterances so that some of its words and sentences have passed into the minds of all educated men everywhere  that famous gettysburg speech is the best example one could desire of the characteristic quality of lincolns eloquence it is a short speech it is wonderfully terse in expression it is quiet so quiet that at the moment it did not make upon the audience an audience wrought up by a long and highlydecorated harangue from one of the prominent orators of the day an impression at all commensurate to that which it began to make as soon as it was read over america and europe there is in it not a touch of what we call rhetoric or of any striving after effect alike in thought and in language it is simple plain direct but it states certain truths and principles in phrases so aptly chosen and so forcible that one feels as if those truths could have been conveyed in no other words and as if this deliverance of them were made for all time words so simple and so strong could have come only from one who had meditated so long upon the primal facts of american history and popular government that the truths those facts taught him had become like the truths of mathematics in their clearness their breadth and their precision  the speeches on slavery read strange to us now when slavery as a living system has been dead for forty years dead and buried hell deep under the detestation of mankind it is hard for those whose memory does not go back to 1865 to realize that down till then it was not only a terrible fact but was defendeddefended by many otherwise good men defended not only by pseudoscientific anthropologists as being in the order of nature but by ministers of the gospel out of the sacred scriptures as part of the ordinances of god lincolns position the position of one who had to induce slaveowning fellowcitizens to listen to him and admit persuasion into their heated and prejudiced minds did not allow him to denounce it with horror as we can all so easily do today but though his language is calm and restrained he never condescends to palter with slavery he shows its innate evils and dangers with unanswerable force the speech on the dred scott decision is a lucid close and cogent piece of reasoning which in its wide view of constitutional issues sometimes reminds one of webster sometimes even of burke though it does not equal the former in weight nor the latter in splendour of diction  among the letters perhaps the most impressive is that written to mrs bixley the mother of five sons who had died fighting for the union in the armies of the north it is short and it deals with a theme on which hundreds of letters are written daily but i do not know where the nobility of selfsacrifice for a great cause and of the consolation which the thought of a sacrifice so made should bring is set forth with such simple and pathetic beauty deep must be the fountains from which there issues so pure a stream  the career of lincoln is often held up to ambitious young americans as an example to show what a man may achieve by his native strength with no advantages of birth or environment or education in this there is nothing improper nothing fanciful the moral is one which may well be drawn and in which those on whose early life fortune has not smiled may find encouragement but the example is after all no great encouragement to ordinary men for lincoln was an extraordinary man  he triumphed over the adverse conditions of his early years because nature had bestowed on him high and rare powers superficial observers who saw his homely aspect and plain manners and noted that his fellowtownsmen when asked why they so trusted him answered that it was for his commonsense failed to see that his commonsense was a part of his genius what is commonsense but the power of seeing the fundamentals of any practical question and of disengaging them from the accidental and transient features that may overlie these fundamentalsthe power to use a familiar expression of getting down to bed rock one part of this power is the faculty for perceiving what the average man will think and can be induced to do this is what keeps the superior mind in touch with the ordinary mind and this is perhaps why the name of commonsense is used because the superior mind seems in its power of comprehending others to be itself a part of the general sense of the community all men of high practical capacity have this power it is the first condition of success but in men who have received a philosophical or literary education there is a tendency to embellish for purposes of persuasion or perhaps for their own gratification the language in which they recommend their conclusions or to state those conclusions in the light of large general principles a tendency which may unless carefully watched carry them too high above the heads of the crowd lincoln never having had such an education spoke to the people as one of themselves he seemed to be saying not only what each felt but expressing the feeling just as each would have expressed it in reality he was quite as much above his neighbours in insight as was the polished orator or writer but the plain directness of his language seemed to keep him on their level his strength lay less in the form and vesture of the thought than in the thought itself in the large simple practical view which he took of the position and thus to repeat what has been said already the sterling merit of these speeches of his that which made them effective when they were delivered and makes them worth reading today is to be found in the justness of his conclusions and their fitness to the circumstances of the time when he rose into higher air when his words were clothed with stateliness and solemnity it was the force of his conviction and the emotion that thrilled through his utterance that printed the words deep upon the minds and drove them home to the hearts of the people  what is a great man common speech which after all must be our guide to the sense of the terms which the world uses gives this name to many sorts of men how far greatness lies in the power and range of the intellect how far in the strength of the will how far in elevation of view and aim and purposethis is a question too large to be debated here but of abraham lincoln it may be truly said that in his greatness all three elements were present he had not the brilliance either in thought or word or act that dazzles nor the restless activity that occasionally pushes to the front even persons with gifts not of the first order he was a patient thoughtful melancholy man whose intelligence working sometimes slowly but always steadily and surely was capacious enough to embrace and vigorous enough to master the incomparably difficult facts and problems he was called to deal with his executive talent showed itself not in sudden and startling strokes but in the calm serenity with which he formed his judgments and laid his plans in the undismayed firmness with which he adhered to them in the face of popular clamour of conflicting counsels from his advisers sometimes even of what others deemed all but hopeless failure these were the qualities needed in one who had to pilot the republic through the heaviest storm that had ever broken upon it but the mainspring of his power and the truest evidence of his greatness lay in the nobility of his aims in the fervour of his conviction in the stainless rectitude which guided his action and won for him the confidence of the people without these things neither the vigour of his intellect nor the firmness of his will would have availed  there is a vulgar saying that all great men are unscrupulous of him it may rather be said that the note of greatness we feel in his thinking and his speech and his conduct had its source in the loftiness and purity of his character lincolns

speeches and letters   lincolns first public speech from an address to the people of sangamon county march 9 1832   upon the subject of education not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it i can only say that i view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in that every man may receive at least a moderate education and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions appears to be an object of vital importance even on this account alone to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the scriptures and other works both of a religious and moral nature for themselves  for my part i desire to see the time when educationand by its means morality sobriety enterprise and industryshall become much more general than at present and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate that happy period  with regard to existing laws some alterations are thought to be necessary many respectable men have suggested that our estray lawsthe law respecting the issuing of executions the road law and some othersare deficient in their present form and require alterations but considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself i should prefer not meddling with them unless they were first attacked by others in which case i should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand which in my view might tend to the advancement of justice  but fellowcitizens i shall conclude considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth it is probable i have already been more presuming than becomes me however upon the subjects of which i have treated i have spoken as i have thought i may be wrong in regard to any or all of them but holding it a sound maxim that it is better only to be sometimes right than at all times wrong so soon as i discover my opinions to be erroneous i shall be ready to renounce them  every man is said to have his peculiar ambition whether it be true or not i can say for one that i have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellowmen by rendering myself worthy of their esteem how far i shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed i am young and unknown to many of you i was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life i have no wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend me my case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the county and if elected they will have conferred a favour upon me for which i shall be unremitting in my labours to compensate but if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background i have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined       your friend and fellowcitizen        a lincoln     letter to colonel robert allen june 21 1836   dear colonel i am told that during my absence last week you passed through this place and stated publicly that you were in possession of a fact or facts which if known to the public would entirely destroy the prospects of nw edwards and myself at the ensuing election but that through favour to us you should forbear to divulge them no one has needed favours more than i and generally few have been less unwilling to accept them but in this case favour to me would be injustice to the public and therefore i must beg your pardon for declining it that i once had the confidence of the people of sangamon is sufficiently evident and if i have since done anything either by design or misadventure which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence he that knows of that thing and conceals it is a traitor to his countrys interest  i find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or facts real or supposed you spoke but my opinion of your veracity will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you said i am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me but i do hope that on more mature reflection you will view the public interest as a paramount consideration and therefore determine to let the worst come i here assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part however low it may sink me shall never break the tie of personal friendship between us i wish an answer to this and you are at liberty to publish both if you choose     lincolns opinion on universal suffrage from a letter published in the sangamon journal june 13 1836   i go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in bearing its burdens consequently i go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms by no means excluding females     from an address before the young mens lyceum of springfield illinois january 27 1837   as a subject for the remarks of the evening the perpetuation of our political institutions is selected in the great journal of things happening under the sun we the american people find our account running under the date of the nineteenth century of the christian era we find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory fertility of soil and salubrity of climate we find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us we when remounting the stage of existence found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings we toiled not in the acquirement or the establishment of them they are a legacy bequeathed to us by a once hardy brave and patriotic but now lamented and departed race of ancestors  theirs was the task and nobly they performed it to possess themselves and through themselves us of this goodly land and to rear upon its hills and valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights tis ours only to transmit thesethe former unprofaned by the foot of the invader the latter undecayed by lapse of time this our duty to ourselves and to our posterity and love for our species in general imperatively require us to perform  how then shall we perform it at what point shall we expect the approach of danger by what means shall we fortify against it shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step across the ocean and crush us at a blow never all the armies of europe asia and africa combined with all the treasure of the earth our own excepted in their military chest with a bonaparte for a commander could not by force take a drink from the ohio or make a track on the blue ridge in a trial of a thousand years  at what point then is the approach of danger to be expected i answer if it ever reaches us it must spring up among us it cannot come from abroad if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher as a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide  there is even now something of ill omen among us i mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country the growing disposition to substitute wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice this disposition is awfully fearful in any community and that it now exists in ours though grating to our feelings to admit it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny                                       i know the american people are much attached to their government i know they would suffer much for its sake i know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another yet notwithstanding all this if the laws be continually despised and disregarded if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob the alienation of their affection for the government is the natural consequence and to that sooner or later it must come  here then is one point at which danger may be expected the question recurs how shall we fortify against it the answer is simple let every american every lover of liberty every wellwisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country and never to tolerate their violation by others as the patriots of seventysix did to the support of the declaration of independence so to the support of the constitution and the laws let every american pledge his life his property and his sacred honour let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father and to tear the charter of his own and his childrens liberty let reverence for the laws be breathed by every american mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap let it be taught in schools in seminaries and in colleges let it be written in primers spellingbooks and in almanacs let it be preached from the pulpit proclaimed in legislative halls and enforced in courts of justice and in short let it become the political religion of the nation  when i so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws let me not be understood as saying that there are no bad laws or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made i mean to say no such thing but i do mean to say that although bad laws if they exist should be repealed as soon as possible still while they continue in force for the sake of example they should be religiously observed so also in unprovided cases if such arise let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay but till then let them if not too intolerable be borne with  there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law in any case that may arise as for instance the promulgation of abolitionism one of two positions is necessarily truethat is the thing is right within itself and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens or it is wrong and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary justifiable or excusable  they histories of the revolution were pillars of the temple of liberty and now that they have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we their descendants supply their places with other pillars hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason passion has helped us but can do so no more it will in future be our enemy reasoncold calculating unimpassioned reasonmust furnish all the materials for our future support and defence let those materials be moulded into general intelligence sound morality and in particular a reverence for the constitution and laws and that we improved to the last that we remained free to the last that we revered his name to the last that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his restingplace shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our washington  upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest as the rock of its basis and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  many great and good men sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in congress a gubernatorial or a presidential chair but such belong not to the family of the lion or the brood of the eagle what think you these places would satisfy an alexander a cÃ¦sar or a napoleon never towering genius disdains a beaten path it seeks regions hitherto unexplored it sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others it denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief it scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor however illustrious it thirsts and burns for distinction and if possible it will have it whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving free men is it unreasonable then to expect that some men possessed of the loftiest genius coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch will at some time spring up among us and when such a one does it will require the people to be united with each other attached to the government and laws and generally intelligent to successfully frustrate his design  distinction will be his paramount object and although he would as willingly perhaps more so acquire it by doing good as harm yet that opportunity being passed and nothing left to be done in the way of building up he would sit down boldly to the task of pulling down here then is a probable case highly dangerous and such a one as could not well have existed heretofore                                       all honour to our revolutionary ancestors to whom we are indebted for these institutions they will not be forgotten in history we hope they will be read of and recounted so long as the bible shall be read but even granting that they will their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest at the close of that struggle nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes the consequence was that of those scenes in the form of a husband a father a son or a brother a living history was to be found in every familya history bearing the indubitable testimonies to its own authenticity in the limbs mangled in the scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes related a history too that could be read and understood alike by all the wise and the ignorant the learned and the unlearned but those histories are gone they can be read no more for ever they were a fortress of strength but what the invading foemen could never do the silent artillery of time has donethe levelling of its walls they are gone they were a forest of giant oaks but the resistless hurricane has swept over them and left only here and there a lonely trunk despoiled of its verdure shorn of its foliage unshading and unshaded to murmur in a few more gentle breezes and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms and then to sink and be no more     humorous account of his experiences with a lady he was requested to marry  a letter to mrs oh browning springfield illinois april 1 1838   dear madam without apologising for being egotistical i shall make the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since i saw you the subject of this letter and by the way i now discover that in order to give a full and intelligible account of the things i have done and suffered since i saw you i shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before  it was then in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my acquaintance and who was a great friend of mine being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives residing in kentucky proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that i would engage to become her brotherinlaw with all convenient dispatch i of course accepted the proposal for you know i could not have done otherwise had i really been averse to it but privately between you and me i was most confoundedly well pleased with the project i had seen the said sister some three years before thought her intelligent and agreeable and saw no good objection to plodding life through handinhand with her time passed on the lady took her journey and in due time returned sister in company sure enough this astonished me a little for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed that she was a trifle too willing but on reflection it occurred to me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to come without anything concerning me having been mentioned to her and so i concluded that if no other objection presented itself i would consent to waive this all this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival in the neighbourhoodfor be it remembered i had not yet seen her except about three years previous as above mentioned in a few days we had an interview and although i had seen her before she did not look as my imagination had pictured her i knew she was oversize but she now appeared a fair match for falstaff i knew she was called an old maid and i felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appellation but now when i beheld her i could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother and this not from withered featuresfor her skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinklesbut from her want of teeth weatherbeaten appearance in general and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than thirtyfive or forty years and in short i was not at all pleased with her but what could i do i had told her sister that i would take her for better or for worse and i made a point of honour and conscience in all things to stick to my word especially if others had been induced to act on it which in this case i had no doubt they had for i was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain well thought i i have said it and be the consequences what they may it shall not be my fault if i fail to do it at once i determined to consider her my wife and this done all my powers of discovery were put to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off against her defects i tried to imagine her handsome which but for her unfortunate corpulency was actually true exclusive of this no woman that i have ever seen has a finer face i also tried to convince myself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person and in this she was not inferior as i could discover to any with whom i had been acquainted  shortly after this without attempting to come to any positive understanding with her i set out for vandalia when and where you first saw me during my stay there i had letters from her which did not change my opinion of either her intellect or intention but on the contrary confirmed it in both  all this while although i was fixed firm as the surgerepelling rock in my resolution i found i was continually repenting the rashness which had led me to make it through life i have been in no bondage either real or imaginary from the thraldom of which i so much desired to be free after my return home i saw nothing to change my opinion of her in any particular she was the same and so was i i now spent my time in planning how i might get along in life after my contemplated change of circumstances should have taken place and how i might procrastinate the evil day for a time which i really dreaded as much perhaps more than an irishman does the halter  after all my sufferings upon this deeply interesting subject here i am wholly unexpectedly completely out of the scrape and i now want to know if you can guess how i got out of itout clear in every sense of the termno violation of word honour or conscience i dont believe you can guess and so i might as well tell you at once as the lawyer says it was done in the manner following to wit after i had delayed the matter as long as i thought i could in honour do which by the way had brought me round into the last fall i concluded i might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay and so i mustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct but shocking to relate she answered no at first i supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty which i thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of the case but on my renewal of the charge i found she repelled it with greater firmness than before i tried it again and again but with the same success or rather with the same want of success  i finally was forced to give it up at which i very unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance i was mortified it seemed to me in a hundred different ways my vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection that i had so long been too stupid to discover her intentions and at the same time never doubting that i understood them perfectly and also that she whom i had taught myself to believe nobody else would have had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness and to cap the whole i then for the first time began to suspect that i was really a little in love with her but let it all go ill try and outlive it others have been made fools of by the girls but this can never in truth be said of me i most emphatically in this instance made a fool of myself i have now come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying and for this reasoni can never be satisfied with any one who would be blockhead enough to have me  when you receive this write me a long yarn about something to amuse me give my respects to mr browning     from a debate between lincoln ed baker and others against douglas lamborn and others springfield december 1839                                         mr lamborn insists that the difference between the van buren party and the whigs is that although the former sometimes err in practice they are always correct in principle whereas the latter are wrong in principle and the better to impress this proposition he uses a figurative expression in these words the democrats are vulnerable in the heel but they are sound in the heart and in the head the first branch of the figurethat is that the democrats are vulnerable in the heeli admit is not merely figuratively but literally true who that looks but for a moment at their swartwouts their prices their harringtons and their hundreds of others scampering away with the public money to texas to europe and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of running fever it seems that this malady of their heels operates on the soundheaded and honesthearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the song did on its owner which when he had once got started on it the more he tried to stop it the more it would run away at the hazard of wearing this point threadbare i will relate an anecdote which seems to be too strikingly in point to be omitted a witty irish soldier who was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near but who invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of the engagement being asked by his captain why he did so replied captain i have as brave a heart as julius cÃ¦sar ever had but somehow or other whenever danger approaches my cowardly legs will run away with it so it is with mr lamborns party they take the public money into their hands for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate but before they can possibly get it out again their rascally vulnerable heels will run away with them     letter to wg anderson lawrenceville illinois october 31 1840   dear sir your note of yesterday is received in the difficulty between us of which you speak you say you think i was the aggressor i do not think i was you say my words imported insult i meant them as a fair setoff to your own statements and not otherwise and in that light alone i now wish you to understand them you ask for my present feelings on the subject i entertain no unkind feelings to you and none of any sort upon the subject except a sincere regret that i permitted myself to get into such an altercation     extract from a letter to john t stuart springfield illinois january 23 1841   for not giving you a general summary of news you must pardon me it is not in my power to do so i am now the most miserable man living if what i feel were equally distributed to the whole human family there would not be one cheerful face on earth whether i shall ever be better i cannot tell i awfully forebode i shall not to remain as i am is impossible i must die or be better it appears to me the matter you speak of on my account you may attend to as you say unless you shall hear of my condition forbidding it i say this because i fear i shall be unable to attend to any business here and a change of scene might help me if i could be myself i would rather remain at home with judge logan i can write no more     from an address before the washingtonian temperance society springfield illinois february 22 1842   although the temperance cause has been in progress for nearly twenty years it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a degree of success hitherto unparalleled  the list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties of hundreds and of thousands the cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract theory to a living breathing active and powerful chieftain going forth conquering and to conquer the citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled his temples and his altars where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made are daily desecrated and deserted the trump of the conquerors fame is sounding from hill to hill from sea to sea and from land to land and calling millions to his standard at a blast                                       but say some we are no drunkards and we shall not acknowledge ourselves such by joining a reform drunkards society whatever our influence might be surely no christian will adhere to this objection  if they believe as they profess that omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man and as such to die an ignominious death for their sakes surely they will not refuse submission to the infinitely lesser condescension for the temporal and perhaps eternal salvation of a large erring and unfortunate class of their fellowcreatures nor is the condescension very great in my judgment such of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more from the absence of appetite than from any mental or moral superiority over those who have indeed i believe if we take habitual drunkards as a class their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class there seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant and warmblooded to fall into this vice the demon of intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius and generosity what one of us but can call to mind some relative more promising in youth than all his fellows who has fallen a sacrifice to his rapacity he ever seems to have gone forth like the egyptian angel of death commissioned to slay if not the first the fairest born of every family shall he now be arrested in his desolating career in that arrest all can give aid that will and who shall be excused that can and will not far around as human breath has ever blown he keeps our fathers our brothers our sons and our friends prostrate in the chains of moral death  when the conduct of men is designed to be influenced persuasion kind unassuming persuasion should ever be adopted it is an old and a true maxim that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall so with men if you would win a man to your cause first convince him that you are his sincere friend therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart which say what you will is the great highroad to his reason and which when once gained you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause if indeed that cause really be a just one on the contrary assume to dictate to his judgment or to command his action or to mark him as one to be shunned and despised and he will retreat within himself close all the avenues to his head and his heart and though your cause be naked truth itself transformed to the heaviest lance harder than steel and sharper than steel can be made and though you throw it with more than herculean force and precision you shall be no more able to pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw such is man and so must he be understood by those who would lead him even to his own best interests  another error as it seems to me into which the old reformers fell was the position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible and therefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that the grace of temperance might abound to the temperate then and to all mankind some hundreds of years thereafter there is in this something so repugnant to humanity so uncharitable so coldblooded and feelingless that it never did nor never can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular cause we could not love the man who taught itwe could not hear him with patience the heart could not throw open its portals to it the generous man could not adopt itit could not mix with his blood it looked so fiendishly selfish so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard to lighten the boat for our security that the nobleminded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing and besides this the benefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too remote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf few can be induced to labour exclusively for posterity and none will do it enthusiastically posterity has done nothing for us and theorize on it as we may practically we shall do very little for it unless we are made to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves  what an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit to ask or expect a whole community to rise up and labour for the temporal happiness of others after themselves shall be consigned to the dust a majority of which community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal welfare at no more distant day great distance in either time or space has wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind pleasures to be enjoyed or pains to be endured after we shall be dead and gone are but little regarded even in our own cases and much less in the cases of others still in addition to this there is something so ludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to render the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned into ridicule better lay down that spade you are stealing paddy if you dont youll pay for it at the day of judgment be the powers if yell credit me so long ill take another jist     from the circular of the whig committee an address to the people of illinois march 4 1843    the system of loans is but temporary in its nature and must soon explode it is a system not only ruinous while it lasts but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute  as an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his original means devoured by interest and next no one left to borrow from so must it be with a government  we repeat then that a tariff sufficient for revenue or a direct tax must soon be resorted to and indeed we believe this alternative is now denied by no one but which system shall be adopted some of our opponents in theory admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for revenue but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff while others boldly advocate direct taxation inasmuch therefore as some of them boldly advocate direct taxation and all the restor so nearly all as to make exceptions needlessrefuse to adopt the tariff we think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of direct taxation indeed we believe they are only delaying an open avowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people will tolerate it let us then briefly compare the two systems the tariff is the cheaper system because the duties being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points will require comparatively few officers in their collection while by the direct tax system the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors going forth like swarms of egyptian locusts devouring every blade of grass and other green thing and again by the tariff system the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods and those chiefly the luxuries and not the necessaries of life by this system the man who contents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at all and surely that country is extensive enough and its products abundant and varied enough to answer all the real wants of its people in short by this system the burden of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few while the substantial and labouring many who live at home and upon home products go entirely free by the direct tax system none can escape however strictly the citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries fine cloths fine silks rich wines golden chains and diamond ringsstill for the possession of his house his barn and his homespun he is to be perpetually haunted and harassed by the taxgatherer with these views we leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are more truly democratic on the subject     from a letter to martin m morris springfield illinois march 26 1843   it is truly gratifying to me to learn that while the people of sangamon have cast me off my old friends of menard who have known me longest and best stick to me it would astonish if not amuse the older citizens to learn that i a stranger friendless uneducated penniless boy working on a flatboat at ten dollars per month have been put down here as the candidate of pride wealth and aristocratic family distinction yet so chiefly it was there was too the strangest combination of church influence against me baker is a campbellite and therefore as i suppose with few exceptions got all that church my wife has some relations in the presbyterian churches and some with the episcopal churches and therefore wherever it would tell i was set down as either the one or the other while it was everywhere contended that no christian ought to go for me because i belonged to no church was suspected of being a deist and had talked about fighting a duel with all these things baker of course had nothing to do nor do i complain of them as to his own church going for him i think that was right enough and as to the influences i have spoken of in the other though they were very strong it would be grossly untrue and unjust to charge that they acted upon them in a body or were very near so i only mean that those influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent upon my strength throughout the religious controversy but enough of this     from a letter to joshua f speed springfield october 22 1846   we have another boy born the 10th of march he is very much such a child as bob was at his age rather of a longer order bob is short and low and i expect always will be he talks very plainlyalmost as plainly as anybody he is quite smart enough i sometimes fear that he is one of the little rareripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after he has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such animal spirits since i began this letter a messenger came to tell me bob was lost but by the time i reached the house his mother had found him and had him whipped and by now very likely he is run away again     from a letter to william h herndon washington january 8 1848   dear william your letter of december 27th was received a day or two ago i am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken and promise to take in my little business there as to speechmaking by way of getting the hang of the house i made a little speech two or three days ago on a postoffice question of no general interest i find speaking here and elsewhere about the same thing i was about as badly scared and no worse as i am when i speak in court i expect to make one within a week or two in which i hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it  it is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire that i should be reelected i most heartily thank them for their partiality and i can say as mr clay said of the annexation of texas that personally i would not object to a reelection although i thought at the time and still think it would be quite as well for me to return to the law at the end of a single term i made the declaration that i would not be a candidate again more from a wish to deal fairly with others to keep peace among our friends and to keep the district from going to the enemy than for any cause personal to myself so that if it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected i could refuse the people the right of sending me again but to enter myself as a competitor of others or to authorize any one so to enter me is what my word and honour forbid      from a letter to william h herndon washington june 22 1848   as to the young men you must not wait to be brought forward by the older men for instance do you suppose that i should ever have got into notice if i had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men you young men get together and form a rough and ready club and have regular meetings and speeches take in everybody you can get harrison grimsley la enos lee kimball and cw matheny will do to begin the thing but as you go along gather up all the shrewd wild boys about town whether just of age or a little under agechris logan reddick ridgley lewis zwizler and hundreds such let every one play the part he can play bestsome speak some sing and all holler your meetings will be of evenings the older men and the women will go to hear you so that it will not only contribute to the election of old zach but will be an interesting pastime and improving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged dont fail to do this     from a letter to william h herndon washington july 10 1848   the way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him allow me to assure you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation there may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down and they will succeed too if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel to brood over the attempted injury cast about and see if this feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall into it      letter to john d johnston january 2 1851   dear johnston your request for eighty dollars i do not think it best to comply with now at the various times when i have helped you a little you have said to me we can get along very well now but in a very short time i find you in the same difficulty again now this can only happen by some defect in your conduct what that defect is i think i know you are not lazy and still you are an idler i doubt whether since i saw you you have done a good whole days work in any one day you do not very much dislike to work and still you do not work much merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it this habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty it is vastly important to you and still more so to your children that you should break the habit it is more important to them because they have longer to live and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it easier than they can get out after they are in  you are now in need of some money and what i propose is that you shall go to work tooth and nail for somebody who will give you money for it let father and your boys take charge of your things at home prepare for a crop and make the crop and you go to work for the best money wages or in discharge of any debt you owe that you can get and to secure you a fair reward for your labour i now promise you that for every dollar you will between this and the first of may get for your own labour either in money or as your own indebtedness i will then give you one other dollar by this if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month from me you will get ten more making twenty dollars a month for your work in this i do not mean you shall go off to st louis or the lead mines or the gold mines in california but i mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can get close to home in coles county now if you will do this you will be soon out of debt and what is better you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again but if i should now clear you out of debt next year you would be just as deep in as ever you say you would almost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty dollars then you value your place in heaven very cheap for i am sure you can with the offer i make get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months work you say if i will furnish you the money you will deed me the land and if you dont pay the money back you will deliver possession nonsense if you cant now live with the land how will you then live without it you have always been kind to me and i do not mean to be unkind to you on the contrary if you will but follow my advice you will find it worth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you     letter to john d johnston shelbyville november 4 1851   dear brother when i came into charleston day before yesterday i learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live and move to missouri i have been thinking of this ever since and cannot but think such a notion is utterly foolish what can you do in missouri better than here is the land any richer can you there any more than here raise corn and wheat and oats without work will anybody there any more than here do your work for you if you intend to go to work there is no better place than right where you are if you do not intend to go to work you cannot get along anywhere squirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good you have raised no crop this year and what you really want is to sell the land get the money and spend it part with the land you have and my life upon it you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in half you will get for the land you will spend in moving to missouri and the other half you will eat drink and wear out and no foot of land will be bought now i feel it my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery i feel that it is so even on your own account and particularly on mothers account the eastern forty acres i intend to keep for mother while she lives if you will not cultivate it it will rent for enough to support herat least it will rent for something her dower in the other two forties she can let you have and no thanks to me now do not misunderstand this letter i do not write it in any unkindness i write it in order if possible to get you to face the truth which truth is you are destitute because you have idled away all your time your thousand pretences for not getting along better are all nonsense they deceive nobody but yourself go to work is the only cure for your case  a word to mother chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him if i were you i would try it awhile if you get tired of it as i think you will not you can return to your own home chapman feels very kindly to you and i have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant     note for law lecture written about july 1 1850   i am not an accomplished lawyer i find quite as much material for a lecture in those points wherein i have failed as in those wherein i have been moderately successful the leading rule for a lawyer as for the man of every other calling is diligence leave nothing for tomorrow which can be done today never let your correspondence fall behind whatever piece of business you have in hand before stopping do all the labour pertaining to it which can then be done when you bring a common lawsuit if you have the facts for doing so write the declaration at once if a law point be involved examine the books and note the authority you rely on upon the declaration itself where you are sure to find it when wanted the same of defences and pleas in business not likely to be litigatedordinary collection cases foreclosures partitions and the likemake all examinations of titles and note them and even draft orders and decrees in advance the course has a triple advantage it avoids omissions and neglect saves your labour when once done performs the labour out of court when you have leisure rather than in court when you have not  extemporaneous speaking should be practised and cultivated it is the lawyers avenue to the public however able and faithful he may be in other respects people are slow to bring him business if he cannot make a speech and yet there is not a more fatal error to young lawyers than relying too much on speechmaking if any one upon his rare powers of speaking shall claim an exemption from the drudgery of the law his case is a failure in advance  discourage litigation persuade your neighbours to compromise whenever you can point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loserin fees expenses and waste of time as a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man there will still be business enough  never stir up litigation a worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles whereon to stir up strife and put money in his pocket a moral tone ought to be infused into the profession which should drive such men out of it  the matter of fees is important far beyond the mere question of bread and butter involved properly attended to fuller justice is done to both lawyer and client an exorbitant fee should never be claimed as a general rule never take your whole fee in advance nor any more than a small retainer when fully paid beforehand you are more than a common mortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was still in prospect for you as well as for your client and when you lack interest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the performance settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance then you will feel that you are working for something and you are sure to do your work faithfully and well never sell a feenoteat least not before the consideration service is performed it leads to negligence and dishonestynegligence by losing interest in the case and dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail  there is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest i say vague because when we consider to what extent confidence and honours are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by the people it appears improbable that their impression of dishonesty is very distinct and vivid yet the impression is common almost universal let no young man choosing the law for a calling for a moment yield to the popular belief resolve to be honest at all events and if in your own judgment you cannot be an honest lawyer resolve to be honest without being a lawyer choose some other occupation rather than one in the choosing of which you do in advance consent to be a knave     a fragment written about july 1 1854  equality in society alike beats inequality whether the latter be of the british aristocratic sort or of the domestic slavery sort  we know southern men declare that their slaves are better off than hired labourers amongst us how little they know whereof they speak there is no permanent class of hired labourers amongst us twentyfive years ago i was a hired labourer the hired labourer of yesterday labours on his own account today and will hire others to labour for him tomorrow  advancementimprovement in conditionis the order of things in a society of equals as labour is the common burden of our race so the effort of some to shift their share of the burden on to the shoulders of others is the great durable curse of the race originally a curse for transgression upon the whole race when as by slavery it is concentrated on a part only it becomes the doublerefined curse of god upon his creatures  free labour has the inspiration of hope pure slavery has no hope the power of hope upon human exertion and happiness is wonderful the slavemaster himself has a conception of it and hence the system of tasks among slaves the slave whom you cannot drive with the lash to break seventyfive pounds of hemp in a day if you will task him to break a hundred and promise him pay for all he does over he will break you a hundred and fifty you have substituted hope for the rod  and yet perhaps it does not occur to you that to the extent of your gain in the case you have given up the slave system and adopted the free system of labour      a fragment on slavery july 1854  if a can prove however conclusively that he may of right enslave b why may not b snatch the same argument and prove equally that he may enslave a you say a is white and b is black it is colour then the lighter having the right to enslave the darker take care by this rule you are to be slave to the first man you meet with a fairer skin than your own  you do not mean colour exactly you mean the whites are intellectually the superiors of the blacks and therefore have the right to enslave them take care again by this rule you are to be slave to the first man you meet with an intellect superior to your own  but say you it is a question of interest and if you make it your interest you have the right to enslave another very well and if he can make it his interest he has the right to enslave you     lincolns reply to senator douglas at peoria illinois the origin of the wilmot proviso october 16 1854    our war with mexico broke out in 1846 when congress was about adjourning that session president polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control to be used by him in the recess if found practicable and expedient in negotiating a treaty of peace with mexico and acquiring some part of her territory a bill was duly gotten up for the purpose and was progressing swimmingly in the house of representatives when a democratic member from pennsylvania by the name of david wilmot moved as an amendment provided that in any territory thus acquired there shall never be slavery this is the origin of the farfamed wilmot proviso it created a great flutter but it stuck like wax was voted into the bill and the bill passed with it through the house the senate however adjourned without final action on it and so both the appropriation and the proviso were lost for the time   this declared indifference but as i must think real covert zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it forces so many good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty criticizing the declaration of independence and insisting that there is no right principle of action but selfinterest  before proceeding let me say that i think i have no prejudice against the southern people they are just what we would be in their situation if slavery did not now exist among them they would not introduce it if it did now exist among us we should not instantly give it up this i believe of the masses north and south doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence we know that some southern men do free their slaves go north and become tiptop abolitionists while some northern ones go south and become most cruel slavemasters  when southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are i acknowledge the fact when it is said that the institution exists and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way i can understand and appreciate the saying i surely will not blame them for not doing what i should not know how to do myself if all earthly power were given me i should not know what to do as to the existing institution my first impulse would be to free all the slaves and send them to liberia to their own native land but a moments reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope as i think there is there may be in this in the long run its sudden execution is impossible if they were all landed there in a day they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten days what then free them all and keep them among us as underlings is it quite certain that this betters their condition i think i would not hold one in slavery at any rate yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon what next free them and make them politically and socially our equals my own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would we well know that those of the great mass of whites will not whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question if indeed it is any part of it a universal feeling whether well or ill founded cannot be safely disregarded we cannot then make them equals it does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south  equal justice to the south it is said requires us to consent to the extension of slavery to new countries that is to say that inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to nebraska therefore i must not object to your taking your slave now i admit that this is perfectly logical if there is no difference between hogs and slaves but while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro i wish to ask whether you of the south yourselves have ever been willing to do as much it is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants that percentage is no larger in the slave states than in the free the great majority south as well as north have human sympathies of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain these sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people manifest in many ways their sense of the wrong of slavery and their consciousness that after all there is humanity in the negro if they deny this let me address them a few plain questions  in 1820 you joined the north almost unanimously in declaring the african slavetrade piracy and in annexing to it the punishment of death why did you do this if you did not feel that it was wrong why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it the practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from africa to such as would buy them but you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses wild buffaloes or wild bears  again you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native tyrants known as the slavedealer he watches your necessities and crawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price if you cannot help it you sell to him but if you can help it you drive him from your door you despise him utterly you do not recognize him as a friend or even as an honest man your children must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negroes but not with the slavedealers children if you are obliged to deal with him you try to get through the job without so much as touching him it is common with you to join hands with the men you meet but with the slavedealer you avoid the ceremonyinstinctively shrinking from the snaky contact if he grows rich and retires from business you still remember him and still keep up the ban of nonintercourse upon him and his family now why is this you do not so treat the man who deals in cotton corn or tobacco  and yet again there are in the united states and territories including the district of columbia over four hundred and thirty thousand free blacks at five hundred dollars per head they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars how comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners we do not see free horses or free cattle running at large how is this all these free blacks are the descendants of slaves or have been slaves themselves and they would be slaves now but for something that has operated on their white owners inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them what is that something is there any mistaking it in all these cases it is your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the poor negro has some natural right to himselfthat those who deny it and make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings contempt and death  and now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate him as only the equal of the hog why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred millions of dollars could not induce you to do  but one great argument in support of the repeal of the missouri compromise is still to come that argument is the sacred right of selfgovernment  some poet has said       fools rush in where angels fear to tread  at the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation i meet that argumenti rush ini take that bull by the horns my faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me i extend the principle to communities of men as well as to individuals i so extend it because it is politically wise as well as naturally justpolitically wise in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us here or at washington i would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of virginia or the cranberry laws of indiana the doctrine of selfgovernment is rightabsolutely and internally right but it has no just application as here attempted or perhaps i should rather say that whether it has any application here depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man if he is not a man in that case he who is a man may as a matter of selfgovernment do just what he pleases with him but if the negro is a man is it not to that extent a total destruction of selfgovernment to say that he too shall not govern himself when the white man governs himself that is selfgovernment but when he governs himself and also governs another man that is more than selfgovernmentthat is despotism if the negro is a man then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with one mans making a slave of another  judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrases our argument by saying the white people of nebraska are good enough to govern themselves but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes  well i doubt not that the people of nebraska are and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere i do not say the contrary what i do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man without that others consent i say this is the leading principlethe sheetanchor of american republicanism  slavery is founded in the selfishness of mans natureopposition to it in his love of justice these principles are in eternal antagonism and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow repeal the missouri compromise repeal all compromises repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past historyyou still cannot repeal human nature it still will be the abundance of mans heart that slavery extension is wrong and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak  the missouri compromise ought to be restored slavery may or may not be established in nebraska but whether it be or not we shall have repudiateddiscarded from the councils of the nationthe spirit of compromise for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise the spirit of mutual concessionthat spirit which first gave us the constitution and has thrice saved the unionwe shall have strangled and cast from us for ever and what shall we have in lieu of it the south flushed with triumph and tempted to excess the north betrayed as they believed brooding on wrong and burning for revenge one side will provoke the other resent the one will taunt the other defy one aggresses the other retaliates already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraints resist the execution of the fugitive slave law and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take and hold slaves in the free states demand the revival of the slavetrade and demand a treaty with great britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from canada as yet they are but few on either side it is a grave question for lovers of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these and fatally increase the number of both   some men mostly whigs who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionists will they allow me as an old whig to tell them goodhumouredly that i think this is very silly stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong stand with the abolitionist in restoring the missouri compromise and stand against him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law in the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist what of that you are still right in both cases you are right in both cases you expose the dangerous extremes in both you stand on the middle ground and hold the ship level and steady in both you are national and nothing less than national this is the good old whig ground to desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a whig less than a man less than an american  i particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic i object to it because it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another i object to it as a dangerous dalliance for free peoplea sad evidence that feeling overprosperity we forget right that liberty as a principle we have ceased to revere i object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it the argument of necessity was the only argument they ever admitted in favour of slavery and so far and so far only as it carried them did they ever go they found the institution existing among us which they could not help and they cast the blame on the british king for having permitted its introduction thus we see the plain unmistakable spirit of their age towards slavery was hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity  but now it is to be transformed into a sacred right henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nationthe very figurehead of the ship of state little by little but steadily as mans march to the grave we have been giving up the old for the new faith near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration that for some men to enslave others is a sacred right of selfgovernment these principles cannot stand together they are as opposite as god and mammon and whoever holds to the one must despise the other  our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust let us purify it let us turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity let us return it to the position our fathers gave it and there let it rest in peace let us readopt the declaration of independence and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it let north and south let all americans let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work if we do this we shall not only have saved the union but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it for ever worthy of the saving     from letter to the hon geo robertson lexington kentucky springfield illinois august 15 1855   my dear sir  you are not a friend of slavery in the abstract in that speech you spoke of the peaceful extinction of slavery and used other expressions indicating your belief that the thing was at some time to have an end since then we have had thirtysix years of experience and this experience has demonstrated i think that there is no peaceful extinction of slavery in prospect for us the signal failure of henry clay and other good and great men in 1849 to effect anything in favour of gradual emancipation in kentucky together with a thousand other signs extinguishes that hope utterly on the question of liberty as a principle we are not what we have been when we were the political slaves of king george and wanted to be free we called the maxim that all men are created equal a selfevident truth but now when we have grown fat and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves we have become so greedy to be masters that we call the same maxim a selfevident lie the fourth of july has not quite dwindled away it is still a great day for burning firecrackers  that spirit which desired the peaceful extinction of slavery has itself become extinct with the occasion and the men of the revolution under the impulse of that occasion nearly half the states adopted systems of emancipation at once and it is a significant fact that not a single state has done the like since so far as peaceful voluntary emancipation is concerned the condition of the negro slave in america scarcely less terrible to the contemplation of the free mind is now as fixed and hopeless of change for the better as that of the lost souls of the finally impenitent the autocrat of all the russias will resign his crown and proclaim his subjects free republicans sooner than will our american masters voluntarily give up their slaves  our political problem now is can we as a nation continue together permanentlyfor everhalf slave and half free the problem is too mighty for me may god in his mercy superintend the solution       your much obliged friend and humble servant        a lincoln     extracts from letter to joshua f speed august 24 1855   you suggest that in political action now you and i would differ i suppose we would not quite so much however as you may think you know i dislike slavery and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it so far there is no cause of difference but you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the slave especially at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested you would see the union dissolved i am not aware that any one is bidding you yield that right very certainly i am not i leave that matter entirely to yourself i also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the constitution in regard to your slaves i confess i hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and unrequited toil but i bite my lips and keep quiet in 1841 you and i had together a tedious lowwater trip on a steamboat from louisville to st louis you may remember as i well do that from louisville to the mouth of the ohio there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons that sight was a continued torment to me and i see something like it every time i touch the ohio or any other slave border it is not fair for you to assume that i have no interest in a thing which has and continually exercises the power of making me miserable you ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the northern people do crucify their feelings in order to maintain their loyalty to the constitution and the union i do oppose the extension of slavery because my judgment and feeling so prompt me and i am under no obligations to the contrary if for this you and i must differ differ we must you say if you were president you would send an army and hang the leaders of the missouri outrages upon the kansas elections still if kansas fairly votes herself a slave state she must be admitted or the union must be dissolved but how if she votes herself a slave state unfairly that is by the very means for which you say you would hang men must she still be admitted or the union dissolved that will be the phase of the question when it first becomes a practical one in your assumption that there may be a fair decision of the slavery question in kansas i plainly see that you and i would differ about the nebraska law i look upon that enactment not as a law but as a violence from the beginning it was conceived in violence is maintained in violence and is being executed in violence i say it was conceived in violence because the destruction of the missouri compromise under the circumstances was nothing less than violence it was passed in violence because it could not have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of the known will of their constituents it is maintained in violence because the elections since clearly demand its repeal and the demand is openly disregarded  you say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law i say that the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its antecedents it is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first else why does no nebraska man express astonishment or condemnation poor reeder is the only public man who has been silly enough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended and he has been bravely undeceived  that kansas will form a slave constitution and with it ask to be admitted into the union i take to be already a settled question and so settled by the very means you so pointedly condemn by every principle of law ever held by any court north or south every negro taken to kansas is free yet in utter disregard of thisin the spirit of violence merelythat beautiful legislature gravely passes a law to hang any man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights this is the subject and real object of the law if like haman they should hang upon the gallows of their own building i shall not be among the mourners for their fate in my humble sphere i shall advocate the restoration of the missouri compromise so long as kansas remains a territory and when by all these foul means it seeks to come into the union as a slave state i shall oppose it i am very loath in any case to withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith but i do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to kansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man any man who has sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole nebraska business but i digress in my opposition to the admission of kansas i shall have some company but we may be beaten if we are i shall not on that account attempt to dissolve the union i think it probable however we shall be beaten standing as a unit among yourselves you can directly and indirectly bribe enough of our men to carry the day as you could on the open proposition to establish a monarchy get hold of some man in the north whose position and ability are such that he can make the support of your measure whatever it may be a democraticparty necessity and the thing is done apropos of this let me tell you an anecdote douglas introduced the nebraska bill in january in february afterward there was a called session of the illinois legislature of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body about seventy were democrats these latter held a caucus in which the nebraska bill was talked of if not formally discussed it was thereby discovered that just three and no more were in favour of the measure in a day or two douglass orders came on to have resolutions passed approving the bill and they were passed by large majorities the truth of this is vouched for by a bolting democratic member the masses too democratic as well as whig were even nearer unanimous against it but as soon as the party necessity of supporting it became apparent the way the democrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly astonishing  you say that if kansas fairly votes herself a free state as a christian you will rejoice at it all decent slaveholders talk that way and i do not doubt their candour but they never vote that way although in a private letter or conversation you will express your preference that kansas should be free you would vote for no man for congress who would say the same thing publicly no such man could be elected from any district in a slave state you think stringfellow and company ought to be hung the slavebreeders and slavetraders are a small odious and detested class among you and yet in politics they dictate the course of all of you and are as completely your masters as you are the master of your own negroes you inquire where i now stand that is a disputed point i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist when i was at washington i voted for the wilmot proviso as good as forty times and i never heard of any one attempting to unwhig me for that i now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery i am not a knownothing that is certain how could i be how can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favour of degrading classes of white people our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid as a nation we began by declaring that all men are created equal we now practically read it all men are created equal except negroes when the knownothings get control it will read all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics when it comes to this i shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving libertyto russia for instance where despotism can be taken pure and without the base alloy of hypocrisy my kindest regards to mrs speed on the leading subject of this letter i have more of her sympathy than i have of yours and yet let me say i am your friend for ever       a lincoln     mr lincolns speech may 19 1856   mr chairman and gentlemen i was over at cries of platform take the platformi say that while i was at danville court some of our friends of antinebraska got together in springfield and elected me as one delegate to represent old sangamon with them in this convention and i am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of that meeting and selection but we can hardly be called delegates strictly inasmuch as properly speaking we represent nobody but ourselves i think it altogether fair to say that we have no antinebraska party in sangamon although there is a good deal of antinebraska feeling there but i say for myself and i think i may speak also for my colleagues that we who are here fully approve of the platform and of all that has been done a voice yes and even if we are not regularly delegates it will be right for me to answer your call to speak i suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of sangamon on the great question of the repeal although we do not yet represent many numbers who have taken a distinct position on the question  we are in a trying timeit ranges above mere partyand this movement to call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good counsels it can get for unless popular opinion makes itself very strongly felt and a change is made in our present course blood will flow on account of nebraska and brothers hand will be raised against brother the last sentence was uttered in such an earnest impressive if not indeed tragic manner as to make a cold chill creep over me others gave a similar experience  i have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to illinois men by the gentleman from lawrence james s emery who has just addressed us so eloquently and forcibly i was deeply moved by his statement of the wrongs done to freestate men out there i think it just to say that all true men north should sympathize with them and ought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs but we must not promise what we ought not lest we be called on to perform what we cannot we must be calm and moderate and consider the whole difficulty and determine what is possible and just we must not be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our cooler moments we have higher aims we will have more serious business than to dally with temporary measures  we are here to stand firmly for a principleto stand firmly for a right we know that great political and moral wrongs are done and outrages committed and we denounce those wrongs and outrages although we cannot at present do much more but we desire to reach out beyond those personal outrages and establish a rule that will apply to all and so prevent any future outrages  we have seen today that every shade of popular opinion is represented here with freedom or rather freesoil as the basis we have come together as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the extension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law and the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more we comewe are here assembled togetherto protest as well as we can against a great wrong and to take measures as well as we now can to make that wrong right to place the nation as far as it may be possible now as it was before the repeal of the missouri compromise and the plain way to do this is to restore the compromise and to demand and determine that kansas shall be free immense applause while we affirm and reaffirm if necessary our devotion to the principles of the declaration of independence let our practical work here be limited to the above we know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment here on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in this convention and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped but all of us must give up something for the good of the cause there is one desire which is uppermost in the mind one wish common to us allto which no dissent will be made and i counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment to sink all personal feeling make all things work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about and which all present will agree is absolutely necessarywhich must be done by any rightful mode if there be such slavery must be kept out of kansas applause the testthe pinchis right there if we lose kansas to freedom an example will be set which will prove fatal to freedom in the end we therefore in the language of the bible must lay the axe to the root of the tree temporizing will not do longer now is the time for decisionfor firm persistent resolute action applause  the nebraska bill or rather nebraska law is not one of wholesome legislation but was and is an act of legislative usurpation whose result if not indeed intention is to make slavery national and unless headed off in some effective way we are in a fair way to see this land of boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact sensation just open your two eyes and see if this be not so i need do no more than state to command universal approval that almost the entire north as well as a large following in the border states is radically opposed to the planting of slavery in free territory probably in a popular vote throughout the nation ninetenths of the voters in the free states and at least onehalf in the border states if they could express their sentiments freely would vote no on such an issue and it is safe to say that twothirds of the votes of the entire nation would be opposed to it and yet in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment in this free country we are in a fair way to see kansas present itself for admission as a slave state indeed it is a felony by the local law of kansas to deny that slavery exists there even now by every principle of law a negro in kansas is free yet the bogus legislature makes it an infamous crime to tell him that he is free  the party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and liberty for it is a singular fact but none the less a fact and well known by the most common experience that men will do things under the terror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration do otherwise while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon without shrinking will run from the terrible name of abolitionist even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they with good reason despise for instanceto press this point a littlejudge douglas introduced his antinebraska bill in january and we had an extra session of our legislature in the succeeding february in which were seventyfive democrats and at a party caucus fully attended there were just three votes out of the whole seventyfive for the measure but in a few days orders came on from washington commanding them to approve the measure the party lash was applied and it was brought up again in caucus and passed by a large majority the masses were against it but party necessity carried it and it was passed through the lower house of congress against the will of the people for the same reason here is where the greatest danger liesthat while we profess to be a government of law and reason law will give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power like the great juggernauti think that is the namethe great idol it crushes everything that comes in its way and makes aor as i read once in a blackletter law book a slave is a human being who is legally not a person but a thing and if the safeguards to liberty are broken down as is now attempted when they have made things of all the free negroes how long think you before they will begin to make things of poor white men applause be not deceived revolutions do not go backward the founder of the democratic party declared that all men were created equal his successor in the leadership has written the word white before men making it read all white men are created equal pray will or may not the knownothings if they should get in power add the word protestant making it read all protestant white men  meanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other quarters john pettit whom tom benton paid his respects to you will recollect calls the immortal declaration a selfevident lie while at the birthplace of freedomin the shadow of bunker hill and of the cradle of liberty at the home of the adamses and warren and otischoate from our side of the house dares to fritter away the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the declaration to be a string of glittering generalities and the southern whigs working hand in hand with proslavery democrats are making choates theories practical thomas jefferson a slaveholder mindful of the moral element in slavery solemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god is just while judge douglas with an insignificant wave of the hand dont care whether slavery is voted up or voted down now if slavery is right or even negative he has a right to treat it in this trifling manner but if it is a moral and political wrong as all christendom considers it to be how can he answer to god for this attempt to spread and fortify it applause  but no man and judge douglas no more than any other can maintain a negative or merely neutral position on this question and accordingly he avows that the union was made by white men and for white men and their descendants as matter of fact the first branch of the proposition is historically true the government was made by white men and they were and are the superior race this i admit but the cornerstone of the government so to speak was the declaration that all men are created equal and all entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness applause  and not only so but the framers of the constitution were particular to keep out of that instrument the word slave the reason being that slavery would ultimately come to an end and they did not wish to have any reminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to slavery applause nor is it any argument that we are superior and the negro inferiorthat he has but one talent while we have ten let the negro possess the little he has in independence if he has but one talent he should be permitted to keep the little he has applause but slavery will endure no test of reason or logic and yet its advocates like douglas use a sort of bastard logic or noisy assumption it might better be termed like the above in order to prepare the mind for the gradual but none the less certain encroachments of the moloch of slavery upon the fair domain of freedom but however much you may argue upon it or smother it in soft phrases slavery can only be maintained by forceby violence the repeal of the missouri compromise was by violence it was a violation of both law and the sacred obligations of honour to overthrow and trample underfoot a solemn compromise obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the fairest of our western domains congress violated the will and confidence of its constituents in voting for the bill and while public sentiment as shown by the elections of 1854 demanded the restoration of this compromise congress violated its trust by refusing simply because it had the force of numbers to hold on to it and murderous violence is being used now in order to force slavery on to kansas for it cannot be done in any other way sensation  the necessary result was to establish the rule of violenceforce instead of the rule of law and reason to perpetuate and spread slavery and in time to make it general we see it at both ends of the line in washington on the very spot where the outrage was started the fearless sumner is beaten to insensibility and is now slowly dying while senators who claim to be gentlemen and christians stood by countenancing the act and even applauding it afterward in their places in the senate even douglas our man saw it all and was within helping distance yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed then at the other end of the line at the very time sumner was being murdered lawrence was being destroyed for the crime of freedom it was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in kansas and must give way to the alldominating power of slavery only two days ago judge trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the senate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in kansas  we live in the midst of alarms anxiety beclouds the future we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read are we in a healthful political state are not the tendencies plain do not the signs of the times point plainly the way in which we are going sensation  in the early days of the constitution slavery was recognized by south and north alike as an evil and the division of sentiment about it was not controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate but by moral and philanthropic views petitions for the abolition of slavery were presented to the very first congress by virginia and massachusetts alike to show the harmony which prevailed i will state that a fugitive slave law was passed in 1793 with no dissenting voice in the senate and but seven dissenting votes in the house it was however a wise law moderate and under the constitution a just one twentyfive years later a more stringent law was proposed and defeated and thirtyfive years after that the present law drafted by mason of virginia was passed by northern votes i am not just now complaining of this law but i am trying to show how the current sets for the proposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one in 1774 the continental congress pledged itself without a dissenting vote to wholly discontinue the slave trade and to neither purchase nor import any slave and less than three months before the passage of the declaration of independence the same congress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved that no slave be imported into any of the thirteen united colonies great applause  on the second day of july 1776 the draft of a declaration of independence was reported to congress by the committee and in it the slave trade was characterized as an execrable commerce as a piratical warfare as the opprobrium of infidel powers and as a cruel war against human nature applause all agreed on this except south carolina and georgia and in order to preserve harmony and from the necessity of the case these expressions were omitted indeed abolition societies existed as far south as virginia and it is a wellknown fact that washington jefferson madison lee henry mason and pendleton were qualified abolitionists and much more radical on that subject than we of the whig and democratic parties claim to be today on march 1 1784 virginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the ohio river jefferson chase of maryland and howell of rhode island as a committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded reported that no slavery should exist after the year 1800 had this report been adopted not only the northwest but kentucky tennessee alabama and mississippi also would have been free but it required the assent of nine states to ratify it north carolina was divided and thus its vote was lost and delaware georgia and new jersey refused to vote in point of fact as it was it was assented to by six states three years later on a square vote to exclude slavery from the northwest only one vote and that from new york was against it and yet thirtyseven years later five thousand citizens of illinois out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand deliberately after a long and heated contest voted to introduce slavery in illinois and today a large party in the free state of illinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of kansas notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its birth as a political community i repeat therefore the question is it not plain in what direction we are tending sensation in the colonial time mason pendleton and jefferson were as hostile to slavery in virginia as otis ames and the adamses were in massachusetts and virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old massachusetts did but circumstances were against them and they failed but not that the goodwill of its leading men was lacking yet within less than fifty years virginia changed its tune and made negrobreeding for the cotton and sugar states one of its leading industries laughter and applause  in the constitutional convention george mason of virginia made a more violent abolition speech than my friends lovejoy or codding would desire to make here todaya speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere on southern soil in this enlightened year but while there were some differences of opinion on this subject even then discussion was allowed but as you see by the kansas slave code which as you know is the missouri slave code merely ferried across the river it is a felony to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of washington and the declaration of independence sensation  in kentuckymy statein 1849 on a test vote the mighty influence of henry clay and many other good men there could not get a symptom of expression in favour of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching toward the light of civilization with ohio and illinois but the state of boone and hardin and henry clay with a nigger under each arm took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism is therecan there beany doubt about this thing and is there any doubt that we must all lay aside our prejudices and march shoulder to shoulder in the great army of freedom applause  every fourth of july our young orators all proclaim this to be the land of the free and the home of the brave well now when you orators get that off next year and may be this very year how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it laughter how would you like that but suppose kansas comes in as a slave state and all the border ruffians have barbecues about it and freestate men come trailing back to the dishonoured north like whipped dogs with their tails between their legs it isaint itevident that this is no more the land of the free and if we let it go so we wont dare to say home of the brave out loud sensation and confusion  can any man doubt that even in spite of the peoples will slavery will triumph through violence unless that will be made manifest and enforced even governor reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in kansas was to be fair but he got his eyes open at last and i believe that as a result of this moral and physical violence kansas will soon apply for admission as a slave state and yet we cant mistake that the people dont want it so and that it is a land which is free both by natural and political law no law is free law such is the understanding of all christendom in the somerset case decided nearly a century ago the great lord mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take its rise in positive as distinguished from natural law and that in no country or age could it be traced back to any other source will some one please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in kansas a voice the bogus laws aye the bogus laws and on the same principle a gang of missouri horsethieves could come into illinois and declare horsestealing to be legal laughter and it would be just as legal as slavery is in kansas but by express statute in the land of washington and jefferson we may soon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedomdarkness to light sensation  it is i believe a principle in law that when one party to a contract violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is made the other party may rescind it i will ask browning if that aint good law voices yes well now if that be right i go for rescinding the whole entire missouri compromise and thus turning missouri into a free state and i should like to know the differenceshould like for any one to point out the differencebetween our making a free state of missouri and their making a slave state of kansas great applause there aint one bit of difference except that our way would be a great mercy to humanity but i have never saidand the whig party has never saidand those who oppose the nebraska bill do not as a body say that they have any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave states our platform says just the contrary we allow slavery to exist in the slave statesnot because slavery is right or good but from the necessities of our union we grant a fugitive slave law because it is so nominated in the bond because our fathers so stipulatedhad toand we are bound to carry out this agreement but they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions where it did not previously exist on the contrary they said by their example and teachings that they did not deem it expedientdid not consider it rightto do so and it is wise and right to do just as they did about it voices good and that is what we proposenot to interfere with slavery where it exists we have never tried to do it and to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law a voice no i say yes applause it was part of the bargain and im for living up to it but i go no further im not bound to do more and i wont agree any further great applause  we here in illinois should feel especially proud of the provision of the missouri compromise excluding slavery from what is now kansas for an illinois man jesse b thomas was its father henry clay who is credited with the authorship of the compromise in general terms did not even vote for that provision but only advocated the ultimate admission by a second compromise and thomas was beyond all controversy the real author of the slavery restriction branch of the compromise to show the generosity of the northern members toward the southern side on a test vote to exclude slavery from missouri ninety voted not to exclude and eightyseven to exclude every vote from the slave states being ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free states of whom seven were from new england alone while on a vote to exclude slavery from what is now kansas the vote was one hundred and thirtyfour for to fortytwo against the scheme as a whole was of course a southern triumph it is idle to contend otherwise as is now being done by the nebraskaites it was so shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men mr lowndes of south carolina was never known to commit a political mistake his was the great judgment of that section and he declared that this measure would restore tranquillity to the countrya result demanded by every consideration of discretion of moderation of wisdom and of virtue when the measure came before president monroe for his approval he put to each member of his cabinet this question has congress the constitutional power to prohibit slavery in a territory and john c calhoun and william h crawford from the south equally with john quincy adams benjamin rush and smith thompson from the north alike answered yes without qualification or equivocation and this measure of so great consequence to the south was passed and missouri was by means of it finally enabled to knock at the door of the republic for an open passage to its brood of slaves and in spite of this freedoms share is about to be taken by violenceby the force of misrepresentative votes not called for by the popular will what name can i in common decency give to this wicked transaction sensation  but even then the contest was not over for when the missouri constitution came before congress for its approval it forbade any free negro or mulatto from entering the state in short our illinois black laws were hidden away in their constitution laughter and the controversy was thus revived then it was that mr clays talents shone out conspicuously and the controversy that shook the union to its foundation was finally settled to the satisfaction of the conservative parties on both sides of the line though not to the extremists on either and missouri was admitted by the small majority of six in the lower house how great a majority do you think would have been given had kansas also been secured for slavery a voice a majority the other way a majority the other way is answered do you think it would have been safe for a northern man to have confronted his constituents after having voted to consign both missouri and kansas to hopeless slavery and yet this man douglas who misrepresents his constituents and who has exerted his highest talents in that direction will be carried in triumph through the state and hailed with honour while applauding that act three groans for dug and this shows whither we are tending this thing of slavery is more powerful than its supporterseven than the high priests that minister at its altar it debauches even our greatest men it gathers strength like a rolling snowball by its own infamy monstrous crimes are committed in its name by persons collectively which they would not dare to commit as individuals its aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief in a despotism one might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and remorselessly into new dominions but is it not wonderful is it not even alarming to see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal sensation  it yields nothing itself it keeps all it has and gets all it can besides it really came dangerously near securing illinois in 1824 it did get missouri in 1821 the first proposition was to admit what is now arkansas and missouri as one slave state but the territory was divided and arkansas came in without serious question as a slave state and afterward missouri not as a sort of equality free but also as a slave state then we had florida and texas and now kansas is about to be forced into the dismal procession sensation and so it is wherever you look we have not forgottenit is but six years sincehow dangerously near california came to being a slave state texas is a slave state and four other slave states may be carved from its vast domain and yet in the year 1829 slavery was abolished throughout that vast region by a royal decree of the then sovereign of mexico will you please tell me by what right slavery exists in texas today by the same right as and no higher or greater than slavery is seeking dominion in kansas by political forcepeaceful if that will suffice by the torch as in kansas and the bludgeon as in the senate chamber if required and so history repeats itself and even as slavery has kept its course by craft intimidation and violence in the past so it will persist in my judgment until met and dominated by the will of a people bent on its restriction  we have this very afternoon heard bitter denunciations of brooks in washington and titus stringfellow atchison jones and shannon in kansasthe battleground of slavery i certainly am not going to advocate or shield them but they and their acts are but the necessary outcome of the nebraska law we should reserve our highest censure for the authors of the mischief and not for the catspaws which they use i believe it was shakespeare who said where the offence lies there let the axe fall and in my opinion this man douglas and the northern men in congress who advocate nebraska are more guilty than a thousand joneses and stringfellows with all their murderous practices can be applause  we have made a good beginning here today as our methodist friends would say i feel it is good to be here while extremists may find some fault with the moderation of our platform they should recollect that the battle is not always to the strong nor the race to the swift in grave emergencies moderation is generally safer than radicalism and as this struggle is likely to be long and earnest we must not by our action repel any who are in sympathy with us in the main but rather win all that we can to our standard we must not belittle nor overlook the facts of our conditionthat we are new and comparatively weak while our enemies are entrenched and relatively strong they have the administration and the political power and right or wrong at present they have the numbers our friends who urge an appeal to arms with so much force and eloquence should recollect that the government is arrayed against us and that the numbers are now arrayed against us as well or to state it nearer to the truth they are not yet expressly and affirmatively for us and we should repel friends rather than gain them by anything savouring of revolutionary methods as it now stands we must appeal to the sober sense and patriotism of the people we will make converts day by day we will grow strong by calmness and moderation we will grow strong by the violence and injustice of our adversaries and unless truth be a mockery and justice a hollow lie we will be in the majority after a while and then the revolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical from being the result of pacific measures the battle of freedom is to be fought out on principle slavery is a violation of the eternal right we have temporized with it from the necessities of our condition but as sure as god reigns and school children read that black foul lie can never be consecrated into gods hallowed truth immense applause lasting some time one of our greatest difficulties is that men who know that slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation are compelled by our peculiar condition and other circumstances to advocate it concretely though damning it in the raw henry clay was a brilliant example of this tendency others of our purest statesmen are compelled to do so and thus slavery secures actual support from those who detest it at heart yet henry clay perfected and forced through the compromise which secured to slavery a great state as well as a political advantage not that he hated slavery less but that he loved the whole union more as long as slavery profited by his great compromise the hosts of proslavery could not sufficiently cover him with praise but now that this compromise stands in their way       they never mention him      his name is never heard      their lips are now forbid to speak      that once familiar word  they have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures and his ghost would arise to rebuke them great applause  now let us harmonize my friends and appeal to the moderation and patriotism of the people to the sober second thought to the awakened public conscience the repeal of the sacred missouri compromise has installed the weapons of violence the bludgeon the incendiary torch the deathdealing rifle the bristling cannonthe weapons of kingcraft of the inquisition of ignorance of barbarism of oppression we see its fruits in the dying bed of the heroic sumner in the ruins of the free state hotel in the smoking embers of the herald of freedom in the freestate governor of kansas chained to a stake on freedoms soil like a horsethief for the crime of freedom applause we see it in christian statesmen and christian newspapers and christian pulpits applauding the cowardly act of a low bully who crawled upon his victim behind his back and dealt the deadly blow sensation and applause we note our political demoralization in the catchwords that are coming into such common use on the one hand freedomshriekers and sometimes freedomscreechers laughter and on the other hand border ruffians and that fully deserved and the significance of catchwords cannot pass unheeded for they constitute a sign of the times everything in this world jibes in with everything else and all the fruits of this nebraska bill are like the poisoned source from which they come i will not say that we may not sooner or later be compelled to meet force by force but the time has not yet come and if we are true to ourselves may never come do not mistake that the ballot is stronger than the bullet therefore let the legions of slavery use bullets but let us wait patiently till november and fire ballots at them in return and by that peaceful policy i believe we shall ultimately win applause  it was by that policy that here in illinois the early fathers fought the good fight and gained the victory in 1824 the free men of our state led by governor coles who was a native of maryland and president madisons private secretary determined that those beautiful groves should never reecho the dirge of one who has no title to himself by their resolute determination the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never cool the parched brow nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired feet of a slave but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land or the groves and their fragrance or their memory remain the humanity to which they minister shall be for ever free great applause palmer yates williams browning and some more in this convention came from kentucky to illinois instead of going to missouri not only to better their conditions but also to get away from slavery they have said so to me and it is understood among us kentuckians that we dont like it one bit now can we mindful of the blessings of liberty which the early men of illinois left to us refuse a like privilege to the free men who seek to plant freedoms banner on our western outposts no no should we not stand by our neighbours who seek to better their conditions in kansas and nebraska yes yes can we as christian men and strong and free ourselves wield the sledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race no no woe unto them it is written that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty no no  one great trouble in the matter is that slavery is an insidious and crafty power and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as by sly management of the peaceful even after the ordinance of 1787 the settlers in indiana and illinois it was all one government then tried to get congress to allow slavery temporarily and petitions to that end were sent from kaskaskia and general harrison the governor urged it from vincennes the capital if that had succeeded goodbye to liberty here but john randolph of virginia made a vigorous report against it and although they persevered so well as to get three favourable reports for it yet the united states senate with the aid of some slave states finally squelched it for good applause and that is why this hall is today a temple for free men instead of a negro livery stable great applause and laughter once let slavery get planted in a locality by ever so weak or doubtful a title and in ever so small numbers and it is like the canada thistle or bermuda grassyou cant root it out you yourself may detest slavery but your neighbour has five or six slaves and he is an excellent neighbour or your son has married his daughter and they beg you to help save their property and you vote against your interest and principles to accommodate a neighbour hoping that your vote will be on the losing side and others do the same and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold and when that is done the whole mighty unionthe force of the nationis committed to its support and that very process is working in kansas today and you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion of dollars 1000000000 while freestate men must work for sentiment alone then there are blue lodgesas they call themeverywhere doing their secret and deadly work  it is a very strange thing and not solvable by any moral law that i know of that if a man loses his horse the whole country will turn out to help hang the thief but if a man but a shade or two darker than i am is himself stolen the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to liberty such are the inconsistencies of slavery where a horse is more sacred than a man and the essence of squatter or popular sovereigntyi dont care how you call itis that if one man chooses to make a slave of another no third man shall be allowed to object and if you can do this in free kansas and it is allowed to stand the next thing you will see is shiploads of negroes from africa at the wharf at charleston for one thing is as truly lawful as the other and these are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out else they will stamp us out sensation and applause  two years ago at springfield judge douglas avowed that illinois came into the union as a slave state and that slavery was weeded out by the operation of his great patent everlasting principle of popular sovereignty laughter well now that argument must be answered for it has a little grain of truth at the bottom i do not mean that it is true in essence as he would have us believe it could not be essentially true if the ordinance of 87 was valid but in point of fact there were some degraded beings called slaves in kaskaskia and the other french settlements when our first state constitution was adopted that is a fact and i dont deny it slaves were brought here as early as 1720 and were kept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against it but slavery did not thrive here on the contrary under the influence of the ordinance the number decreased fiftyone from 1810 to 1820 while under the influence of squatter sovereignty right across the river in missouri they increased seven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time and slavery finally faded out in illinois under the influence of the law of freedom while it grew stronger and stronger in missouri under the law or practice of popular sovereignty in point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in illinois one year after its admission or one to every four hundred and seventy of its population or to state it in another way if illinois was a slave state in 1820 so were new york and new jersey much greater slave states from having had greater numbers slavery having been established there in very early times but there is this vital difference between all these states and the judges kansas experiment that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already established while the judge seeks so far as he can to disestablish freedom which had been established there by the missouri compromise voices good  the union is undergoing a fearful strain but it is a stout old ship and has weathered many a hard blow and the stars in their courses aye an invisible power greater than the puny efforts of men will fight for us but we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility nor take counsel of unworthy passions whatever duty urges us to do or to omit must be done or omitted and the recklessness with which our adversaries break the laws or counsel their violation should afford no example for us therefore let us revere the declaration of independence let us continue to obey the constitution and the laws let us keep step to the music of the union let us draw a cordon so to speak around the slave states and the hateful institution like a reptile poisoning itself will perish by its own infamy applause  but we cannot be free men if this is by our national choice to be a land of slavery those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god cannot long retain it loud applause  did you ever my friends seriously reflect upon the speed with which we are tending downward within the memory of men now present the leading statesmen of virginia could make genuine redhot abolitionist speeches in old virginia and as i have said now even in free kansas it is a crime to declare that it is free kansas the very sentiments that i and others have just uttered would entitle us and each of us to the ignominy and seclusion of a dungeon and yet i suppose that like paul we were free born but if this thing is allowed to continue it will be but one step further to impress the same rule in illinois sensation  the conclusion of all is that we must restore the missouri compromise we must highly resolve that kansas must be free great applause we must reinstate the birthday promise of the republic we must reaffirm the declaration of independence we must make good in essence as well as in form madisons vowal that the word slave ought not to appear in the constitution and we must even go further and decree that only local law and not that timehonoured instrument shall shelter a slaveholder we must make this a land of liberty in fact as it is in name but in seeking to attain these resultsso indispensable if the liberty which is our pride and boast shall endurewe will be loyal to the constitution and to the flag of our union and no matter what our grievanceeven though kansas shall come in as a slave state and no matter what theirseven if we shall restore the compromisewe will say to the southern disunionists we wont go out of the union and you shant this was the climax the audience rose to its feet en masse applauded stamped waved handkerchiefs threw hats in the air and ran riot for several minutes the archenchanter who wrought this transformation looked meanwhile like the personification of political justice  but let us meanwhile appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people and not to their prejudices let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here aroused all over these vast prairies so suggestive of freedom let us commence by electing the gallant soldier governor colonel bissell who stood for the honour of our state alike on the plains and amidst the chaparral of mexico and on the floor of congress while he defied the southern hotspur and that will have a greater moral effect than all the border ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on kansas there is both a power and a magic in popular opinion to that let us now appeal and while in all probability no resort to force will be needed our moderation and forbearance will stand us in good stead when if ever we must make an appeal to battle and to the god of hosts immense applause and a rush for the orator  this speech has been called lincolns lost speech because all the reporters present were so carried away by his eloquence that they one and all forgot to take any notes if it had not been for a young lawyer a mr hc whitney who kept his head sufficiently to take notes we would have no record of it mr whitney wrote out the speech for mcclures magazine in 1896 it was submitted to several people who were present at the bloomington convention and they said it was remarkably accurate considering that it was not taken down stenographically     from his speech on the dred scott decision springfield illinois june 26 1857    and now as to the dred scott decision that decision declares two propositionsfirst that a negro cannot sue in the united states courts and secondly that congress cannot prohibit slavery in the territories it was made by a divided courtdividing differently on the different points judge douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision and in that respect i shall follow his example believing i could no more improve on mclean and curtis than he could on taney  he denounces all who question the correctness of that decision as offering violent resistance to it but who resists it who has in spite of the decision declared dred scott free and resisted the authority of his master over him  judicial decisions have two uses first to absolutely determine the case decided and secondly to indicate to the public how other similar cases will be decided when they arise for the latter use they are called precedents and authorities  we believe as much as judge douglas perhaps more in obedience to and respect for the judicial department of government we think its decisions on constitutional questions when fully settled should control not only the particular cases decided but the general policy of the country subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the constitution as provided in that instrument itself more than this would be revolution but we think the dred scott decision is erroneous we know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we shall do what we can to have it overrule this we offer no resistance to it  judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents according to circumstances that this should be so accords both with commonsense and the customary understanding of the legal profession  if this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges and without any apparent partisan bias and in accordance with legal public expectation and with the steady practice of the departments throughout our history and had been in no part based on assumed historical facts which are not really true or if wanting in some of these it had been before the court more than once and had there been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of yearsit then might be perhaps would be factious nay even revolutionary not to acquiesce in it as a precedent  but when as is true we find it wanting in all these claims to the public confidence it is not resistance it is not factious it is not even disrespectful to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country  i have said in substance that the dred scott decision was in part based on assumed historical facts which were not really true and i ought not to leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this i therefore give an instance or two which i think fully sustain me chief justice taney in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court insists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who made or for whom was made the declaration of independence or the constitution of the united states  on the contrary judge curtis in his dissenting opinion shows that in five of the then thirteen statesto wit new hampshire massachusetts new york new jersey and north carolinafree negroes were voters and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the constitution that the white people had he shows this with so much particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth and as a sort of conclusion on that point holds the following language       the constitution was ordained and established by the people of the      united states through the action in each state of those persons      who were qualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of      themselves and all other citizens of the state in some of the      states as we have seen coloured persons were among those      qualified by law to act on the subject these coloured persons were      not only included in the body of the people of the united states      by whom the constitution was ordained and established but in at      least five of the states they had the power to act and doubtless      did act by their suffrages upon the question of its adoption  again chief justice taney says       it is difficult at this day to realize the state of public      opinion in relation to that unfortunate race which prevailed in      the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of      the declaration of independence and when the constitution of the      united states was framed and adopted  and again after quoting from the declaration he says       the general words above quoted would seem to include the whole      human family and if they were used in a similar instrument at this      day would be so understood  in these the chief justice does not directly assert but plainly assumes as a fact that the public estimate of the black man is more favourable now than it was in the days of the revolution this assumption is a mistake in some trifling particulars the condition of that race has been ameliorated but as a whole in this country the change between then and now is decidedly the other way and their ultimate destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years in two of the five statesnew jersey and north carolinathat then gave the free negro the right of voting the right has since been taken away and in a thirdnew yorkit has been greatly abridged while it has not been extended so far as i know to a single additional state though the number of the states has more than doubled in those days as i understand masters could at their own pleasure emancipate their slaves but since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition in those days legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective states but now it is becoming quite fashionable for state constitutions to withhold that power from the legislatures in those days by common consent the spread of the black mans bondage to the new countries was prohibited but now congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition and the supreme court decides that it could not if it would in those days our declaration of independence was held sacred by all and thought to include all but now to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at and torn till if its framers could rise from their graves they could not at all recognize it all the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against him mammon is after him ambition follows philosophy follows and the theology of the day is fast joining in the cry they have him in his prisonhouse they have searched his person and left no prying instrument with him one after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him and now they have him as it were bolted in with a lock of a hundred keys which can never be unlocked without the concurrence of every key the keys in the hands of a hundred different men and they scattered to a hundred different and distant places and they stand musing as to what invention in all the dominions of mind and matter can be produced to make the impossibility of escape more complete than it is it is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the negro is more favourable now than it was at the origin of the government   there is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people at the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races and judge douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself if he can by much drumming and repeating fasten the odium of that idea upon his adversaries he thinks he can struggle through the storm he therefore clings to this hope as a drowning man to the last plank he makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the dred scott decision he finds the republicans insisting that the declaration of independence includes all men black as well as white and forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all and proceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does do so only because they want to vote and eat and sleep and marry with negroes he will have it that they cannot be consistent else now i protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that because i do not want a black woman for a slave i must necessarily want her for a wife i need not have her for either i can just leave her alone in some respects she certainly is not my equal but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one else she is my equal and the equal of all others  chief justice taney in his opinion in the dred scott case admits that the language of the declaration is broad enough to include the whole human family but he and judge douglas argue that the authors of that instrument did not intend to include negroes by the fact that they did not at once actually place them on an equality with the whites now this grave argument comes to just nothing at all by the other fact that they did not at once nor ever afterward actually place all white people on an equality with one another and this is the staple argument of both the chief justice and the senator for doing this obvious violence to the plain unmistakable language of the declaration  i think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects they did not mean to say that all were equal in colour size intellect moral developments or social capacity they defined with tolerable distinctness in what respects they did consider all men created equalequal with certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness this they said and this they meant they did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them in fact they had no power to confer such a boon they meant simply to declare the right so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit  they meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all and revered by allconstantly looked to constantly laboured for and even though never perfectly attained constantly approximated and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colours everywhere the assertion that all men are created equal was of no practical use in effecting our separation from great britain and it was placed in the declaration not for that but for future use its authors meant it to be as thank god it is now proving itself a stumblingblock to all those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism they knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants and they meant when such should reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation that they should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack  i have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that part of the declaration of independence which declares that all men are created equal now let us hear judge douglass view of the same subject as i find it in the printed report of his late speech here it is       no man can vindicate the character motives and conduct of the      signers of the declaration of independence except upon the      hypothesis that they referred to the white race alone and not to      the african when they declared all men to have been created equal      that they were speaking of british subjects on this continent being      equal to british subjects born and residing in great britain that      they were entitled to the same inalienable rights and among them      were enumerated life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the      declaration was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists      in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance      from the british crown and dissolving their connection with the      mothercountry  my good friends read that carefully over some leisure hour and ponder well upon it see what a mere wreck and mangled ruin judge douglas makes of our once glorious declaration he says they were speaking of british subjects on this continent being equal to british subjects born and residing in great britain why according to this not only negroes but white people outside of great britain and america were not spoken of in that instrument the english irish and scotch along with white americans were included to be sure but the french germans and other white people of the world are all gone to pot along with the judges inferior races  i had thought that the declaration promised something better than the condition of british subjects but no it only meant that we should be equal to them in their own oppressed and unequal condition according to that it gave no promise that having kicked off the king and lords of great britain we should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of our own  i had thought the declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere but no it merely was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the british crown and dissolving their connection with the mothercountry why that object having been effected some eighty years ago the declaration is of no practical use nowmere rubbishold wadding left to rot on the battlefield after the victory is won  i understand you are preparing to celebrate the fourth tomorrow week what for the doings of that day had no reference to the present and quite half of you are not even descendants of those who were referred to at that day but i suppose you will celebrate and will even go so far as to read the declaration suppose after you read it once in the oldfashioned way you read it once more with judge douglass version it will then run thus we told these truths to be selfevident that all british subjects who were on this continent eightyone years ago were created equal to all british subjects born and then residing in great britain   the very dred scott case affords a strong test as to which party most favours amalgamation the republicans or the dear unionsaving democracy dred scott his wife and two daughters were all involved in the suit we desired the court to have held that they were citizens so far at least as to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were free or not and then also that they were in fact and in law really free could we have had our way the chances of these black girls ever mixing their blood with that of white people would have been diminished at least to the extent that it could not have been without their consent but judge douglas is delighted to have them decided to be slaves and not human enough to have a hearing even if they were free and thus left subject to the forced concubinage of their masters and liable to become the mothers of mulattoes in spite of themselvesthe very state of the case that produces ninetenths of all the mulattoes all the mixing of the blood of the nation     a house divided against itself cannot stand on lincolns nomination to the united states senate springfield illinois june 17 1858   if we could first know where we are and whither we are tending we could better judge what to do and how to do it we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not ceased but has constantly augmented in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south  have we no tendency to the latter condition let any one who doubts carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combinationpiece of machinery so to speakcompounded of the nebraska doctrine and the dred scott decision let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do and how well adapted but also let him study the history of its construction and trace if he can or rather fail if he can to trace the evidences of design and concert of action among its chief architects from the beginning  the new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the states by state constitutions and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition four days later commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition this opened all the national territory to slavery and was the first point gained  but so far congress only had acted and an indorsement by the people real or apparent was indispensable to save the point already gained and give chance for more  this necessity had not been overlooked but had been provided for as well as might be in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty otherwise called sacred right of selfgovernment which latter phrase though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this that if any one man choose to enslave another no third man shall be allowed to object that argument was incorporated into the nebraska bill itself in the language which follows it being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states then opened the roar of loose declamation in favour of squatter sovereignty and sacred right of selfgovernment but said opposition members let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery not we said the friends of the measure and down they voted the amendment  while the nebraska bill was passing through congress a law case involving the question of a negros freedom by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free state and then into a territory covered by the congressional prohibition and held him as a slave for a long time in each was passing through the united states circuit court for the district of missouri and both nebraska bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of may 1854 the negros name was dred scott which name now designates the decision finally rendered in the case before the then next presidential election the law case came to and was argued in the supreme court of the united states but the decision of it was deferred until after the election still before the election senator trumbull on the floor of the senate requested the leading advocate of the nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits and the latter answers that is a question for the supreme court  the election came mr buchanan was elected and the indorsement such as it was secured that was the second point gained the indorsement however fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes and so perhaps was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory the outgoing president in his last annual message as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement the supreme court met again did not announce their decision but ordered a reargument the presidential inauguration came and still no decision of the court but the incoming president in his inaugural address fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision whatever it might be then in a few days came the decision  the reputed author of the nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capitol indorsing the dred scott decision and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it the new president too seizes the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained  at length a squabble springs up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill on the mere question of fact whether the lecompton constitution was or was not in any just sense made by the people of kansas and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up i do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mindthe principle for which he declares he has suffered so much and is ready to suffer to the end and well may he cling to that principle if he has any parental feeling well may he cling to it that principle is the only shred left of his original nebraska doctrine under the dred scott decision squatter sovereignty squatted out of existence tumbled down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry it served through one blast and fell back into loose sandhelped to carry an election and then was kicked to the winds his late joint struggle with the republicans against the lecompton constitution involves nothing of the original nebraska doctrine that struggle was made on a pointthe right of the people to make their own constitutionupon which he and the republicans have never differed  the several points of the dred scott decision in connection with senator douglass care not policy constitute the piece of machinery in its present state of advancement this was the third point gained the working points of that machinery are  first that no negro slave imported as such from africa and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen of any state in the sense of that term as used in the constitution of the united states this point is made in order to deprive the negro in every possible event of the benefit of that provision of the united states constitution which declares that citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states  secondly that subject to the constitution of the united states neither congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from any united states territory this point is made in order that individual men may fill up the territories with slaves without danger of losing them as property and thus enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future  thirdly that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free state makes him free as against the holder the united states courts will not decide but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the negro may be forced into by the master this point is made not to be pressed immediately but if acquiesced in for a while and apparently indorsed by the people at an election then to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred scotts master might lawfully do with dred scott in the free state of illinois every other master may lawfully do with any other one or one thousand slaves in illinois or in any other free state  auxiliary to all this and working handinhand with it the nebraska doctrine or what is left of it is to educate and mould public opinion not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up this shows exactly where we now are and partially also whither we are tending  it will throw additional light on the latter to go back and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring the people were to be left perfectly free subject only to the constitution what the constitution had to do with it outsiders could not then see plainly enough now it was an exactly fitted niche for the dred scott decision to afterwards come in and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all why was the amendment expressly declaring the right of the people voted down plainly enough now the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the dred scott decision why was the court decision held up why even a senators individual opinion withheld till after the presidential election plainly enough now the speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried why the outgoing presidents felicitation on the indorsement why the delay of a reargument why the incoming presidents advance exhortation in favour of the decision these things look like the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall and why the hasty afterindorsement of the decision by the president and others  we cannot absolutely know that all these adaptations are the result of preconcert but when we see a lot of framed timbers different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmenstephen franklin roger and james for instance douglas pierce taney buchananand when we see those timbers joined together and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places and not a piece too many or too few not omitting even scaffoldingor if a single piece be lacking we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece inin such a case we find it impossible not to believe that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understood one another from the beginning and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was struck  it should not be overlooked that by the nebraska bill the people of a state as well as territory were to be left perfectly free subject only to the constitution why mention a state they were legislating for territories and not for or about states certainly the people of a state are and ought to be subject to the constitution of the united states but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial law why are the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lumped together and their relation to the constitution therein treated as being precisely the same while the opinion of the court by chief justice taney in the dred scott case and the separate opinions of all the concurring judges expressly declare that the constitution of the united states neither permits congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united states territory they all omit to declare whether or not the same constitution permits a state or the people of a state to exclude it possibly this is a mere omission but who can be quite sure if mclean or curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from their limitsjust as chase and mace sought to get such declaration in behalf of the people of a territory into the nebraska billi ask who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down in the one case as it had been in the other the nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a state over slavery is made by judge nelson he approaches it more than once using the precise idea and almost the language too of the nebraska act on one occasion his exact language is except in cases where the power is restrained by the constitution of the united states the law of the state is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction in what cases the power of the state is so restrained by the united states constitution is left an open question precisely as the same question as to the restraint on the power of the territories was left open in the nebraska act put this and that together and we have another nice little niche which we may ere long see filled with another supreme court decision declaring that the constitution of the united states does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its limits and this may especially be expected if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made  such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the states welcome or unwelcome such decision is probably coming and will soon be upon us unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown we shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of missouri are on the verge of making their state free and we shall awake to the reality instead that the supreme court has made illinois a slave state to meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation that is what we have to do how can we best do it  there are those who denounce us openly to their own friends and yet whisper to us softly that senator douglas is the aptest instrument there is with which to effect that object they wish us to infer all from the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of that dynasty and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point upon which he and we have never differed they remind us that he is a great man and that the largest of us are very small ones let this be granted but a living dog is better than a dead lion judge douglas if not a dead lion for this work is at least a caged and toothless one how can he oppose the advances of slavery he dont care anything about it his avowed mission is impressing the public heart to care nothing about it a leading douglas democratic newspaper thinks douglass superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the african slavetrade does douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching he has not said so does he really think so but if it is how can he resist it for years he has laboured to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new territories can he possibly show that it is a less sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest and unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in africa than in virginia he has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property and as such how can he oppose the foreign slavetradehow can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free unless he does it as a protection to home production and as the home producers will probably not ask the protection he will be wholly without a ground of opposition  senator douglas holds we know that a man may rightfully be wiser today than he was yesterdaythat he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong but can we for that reason run ahead and infer that he will make any particular change of which he himself has given no intimation can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference  now as ever i wish not to misrepresent judge douglass position question his motives or do aught that can be personally offensive to him whenever if ever he and we can come together on principle so that our cause may have assistance from his great ability i hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacle but clearly he is not now with ushe does not pretend to behe does not promise ever to be  our cause then must be intrusted to and conducted by its own undoubted friendsthose whose hands are free whose hearts are in the work who do care for the result two years ago the republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong we did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger with every external circumstance against us of strange discordant and even hostile elements we gathered from the four winds and formed and fought the battle through under the constant hot fire of a disciplined proud and pampered enemy did we brave all then to falter nownow when that same enemy is wavering dissevered and belligerent the result is not doubtful we shall not fail if we stand firm we shall not fail wise counsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it but sooner or later the victory is sure to come     lincolns reply to judge douglas at chicago on popular sovereignty the nebraska bill etc july 10 1858    popular sovereignty everlasting popular sovereignty let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty what is popular sovereignty we recollect that at an early period in the history of this struggle there was another name for the same thingsquatter sovereignty it was not exactly popular sovereignty but squatter sovereignty what do these terms mean what do those terms mean when used now and vast credit is taken by our friend the judge in regard to his support of it when he declares the last years of his life have been and all the future years of his life shall be devoted to this matter of popular sovereignty what is it why it is the sovereignty of the people what was squatter sovereignty i suppose if it had any signification at all it was the right of the people to govern themselves to be sovereign in their own affairs while they were squatted down in a country not their ownwhile they had squatted on a territory that did not belong to them in the sense that a state belongs to the people who inhabit itwhen it belonged to the nation such right to govern themselves was called squatter sovereignty  now i wish you to mark what has become of that squatter sovereignty what has become of it can you get anybody to tell you now that the people of a territory have any authority to govern themselves in regard to this mooted question of slavery before they form a state constitution no such thing at all although there is a general running fire and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that side assuming that policy had given to the people of a territory the right to govern themselves upon this question yet the point is dodged today it has been decidedno more than a year ago it was decided by the supreme court of the united states and is insisted upon todaythat the people of a territory have no right to exclude slavery from a territory that if any one man chooses to take slaves into a territory all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out this being so and this decision being made one of the points that the judge approved and one in the approval of which he says he means to keep me downput me down i should not say for i have never been up he says he is in favour of it and sticks to it and expects to win his battle on that decision which says that there is no such thing as squatter sovereignty but that any one man may take slaves into a territory and all the other men in the territory may be opposed to it and yet by reason of the constitution they cannot prohibit it when that is so how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty i should like to know  when we get back we get to the point of the right of the people to make a constitution kansas was settled for example in 1854 it was a territory yet without having formed a constitution in a very regular way for three years all this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few individuals and by that decision of the supreme court which the judge approves all the rest of the people cannot keep it out but when they come to make a constitution they may say they will not have slavery but it is there they are obliged to tolerate it in some way and all experience shows it will be sofor they will not take the negro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them all experience shows this to be so all that space of time that runs from the beginning of the settlement of the territory until there is a sufficiency of people to make a state constitutionall that portion of time popular sovereignty is given up the seal is absolutely put down upon it by the court decision and judge douglas puts his own upon the top of that yet he is appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular sovereignty  again when we get to the question of the right of the people to form a state constitution as they please to form it with slavery or without slaveryif that is anything new i confess i dont know it has there ever been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a territory itself should form a constitution what is now in it that judge douglas should have fought several years of his life and pledge himself to fight all the remaining years of his life for can judge douglas find anybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a constitution for a people it is enough for my purpose to ask whenever a republican said anything against it they never said anything against it but they have constantly spoken for it and whosoever will undertake to examine the platform and the speeches of responsible men of the party and of irresponsible men too if you please will be unable to find one word from anybody in the republican ranks opposed to that popular sovereignty which judge douglas thinks he has invented i suppose that judge douglas will claim in a little while that he is the inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves that nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward we do not remember that in that old declaration of independence it is said that we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed there is the origin of popular sovereignty who then shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it the lecompton constitution connects itself with this question for it is in this matter of the lecompton constitution that our friend judge douglas claims such vast credit i agree that in opposing the lecompton constitution so far as i can perceive he was right i do not deny that at all and gentlemen you will readily see why i could not deny it even if i wanted to but i do not wish to for all the republicans in the nation opposed it and they would have opposed it just as much without judge douglass aid as with it they had all taken ground against it long before he did why the reason that he urges against that constitution i urged against him a year before i have the printed speech in my hand the argument that he makes why that constitution should not be adopted that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote i pointed out in a speech a year ago which i hold in my hand now that no fair chance was to be given to the people   a little more now as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the lecompton constitution the lecompton constitution as the judge tells us was defeated the defeat of it was a good thing or it was not he thinks the defeat of it was a good thing and so do i and we agree in that who defeated it a voice judge douglas yes he furnished himself and if you suppose he controlled the other democrats that went with him he furnished three votes while the republicans furnished twenty  that is what he did to defeat it in the house of representatives he and his friends furnished some twenty votes and the republicans furnished ninety odd now who was it that did the work a voice douglas why yes douglas did it to be sure he did  let us however put that proposition another way the republicans could not have done it without judge douglas could he have done it without them which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other ground was taken against it by the republicans long before douglas did it the proposition of opposition to that measure is about five to one a voice why dont they come out on it you dont know what you are talking about my friend i am quite willing to answer any gentleman in the crowd who asks an intelligent question  now who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of judge douglass way of thinking and who have acted upon this main question that have ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of judge trumbull i defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a democratic meeting i take it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution large or small of a democratic meeting in favour of judge trumbull or any of the five to one republicans who beat that bill everything must be for the democrats they did everything and the five to the one that really did the thing they snub over and they do not seem to remember that they have an existence upon the face of the earth  gentlemen i fear that i shall become tedious i leave this branch of the subject to take hold of another i take up that part of judge douglass speech in which he respectfully attended to me  judge douglas made two points upon my recent speech at springfield he says they are to be the issues of this campaign the first one of these points he bases upon the language in a speech which i delivered at springfield which i believe i can quote correctly from memory i said that we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not ceased but has constantly augmented i believe it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi am quoting from my speechi do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south  that is the paragraph in this paragraph which i have quoted in your hearing and to which i ask the attention of all judge douglas thinks he discovers great political heresy i want your attention particularly to what he has inferred from it he says i am in favour of making all the states of this union uniform in all their internal regulations that in all their domestic concerns i am in favour of making them entirely uniform he draws this inference from the language i have quoted to you he says that i am in favour of making war by the north upon the south for the extinction of slavery that i am also in favour of inviting as he expresses it the south to a war upon the north for the purpose of nationalizing slavery now it is singular enough if you will carefully read that passage over that i did not say that i was in favour of anything in it i only said what i expected would take place i made a prediction onlyit may have been a foolish one perhaps i did not even say that i desired that slavery should be put in course of ultimate extinction i do say so now however so there need be no longer any difficulty about that it may be written down in the great speech  gentlemen judge douglas informed you that this speech of mine was probably carefully prepared i admit that it was i am not master of language i have not a fine education i am not capable of entering into a disquisition upon dialectics as i believe you call it but i do not believe the language i employed bears any such construction as judge douglas puts upon it but i dont care about a quibble in regard to words i know what i meant and i will not leave this crowd in doubt if i can explain it to them what i really meant in the use of that paragraph  i am not in the first place unaware that this government has endured eightytwo years half slave and half free i know that i am tolerably well acquainted with the history of the country and i know that it has endured eightytwo years half slave and half free i believeand that is what i meant to allude to therei believe it has endured because during all that time until the introduction of the nebraska bill the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that slavery was in course of ultimate extinction that was what gave us the rest that we had through that period of eightytwo years at least so i believe i have always hated slavery i think as much as any abolitionisti have been an oldline whigi have always hated it but i have always been quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the nebraska bill began i always believed that everybody was against it and that it was in course of ultimate extinction they had reason so to believe  the adoption of the constitution and its attendant history led the people to believe so and that such was the belief of the framers of the constitution itself why did those old men about the time of the adoption of the constitution decree that slavery should not go into the new territory where it had not already gone why declare that within twenty years the african slavetrade by which slaves are supplied might be cut off by congress why were all these acts i might enumerate more of these acts but enough what were they but a clear indication that the framers of the constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that institution and now when i sayas i said in my speech that judge douglas has quoted fromwhen i say that i think the opponents of slavery will resist the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction i only mean to say that they will place it where the founders of this government originally placed it  i have said a hundred times and i have now no inclination to take it back that i believe there is no right and ought to be no inclination in the people of the free states to enter into the slave states and interfere with the question of slavery at all i have said that always judge douglas has heard me say it and when it is said that i am in favour of interfering with slavery where it exists i know it is unwarranted by anything i have ever intended and as i believe by anything i have ever said if by any means i have ever used language which could fairly be so construed as however i believe i never have i now correct it  so much then for the inference that judge douglas draws that i am in favour of setting the sections at war with one another i know that i never meant any such thing and i believe that no fair mind can infer any such thing from anything i have said  now in relation to his inference that i am in favour of a general consolidation of all the local institutions of the various states i have said very many times in judge douglass hearing that no man believed more than i in the principle of selfgovernment that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just government from beginning to end i have denied that his use of that term applies properly but for the thing itself i deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his devotion to the principle whatever he may have done in efficiency in advocating it i think that i have said it in your hearing that i believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labour so far as it in no wise interferes with any other mans rights that each community as a state has a right to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that state that interfere with the right of no other state and that the general government upon principle has no right to interfere with anything other than that general class of things that does concern the whole i have said that at all times i have said as illustrations that i do not believe in the right of illinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of indiana the oyster laws of virginia or the liquor laws of maine  how is it then that judge douglas infers because i hope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction that i am in favour of illinois going over and interfering with the cranberry laws of indiana what can authorize him to draw any such inference i suppose there might be one thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference that would not be true with me or many others that is because he looks upon all this matter of slavery as an exceedingly little thingthis matter of keeping onesixth of the population of the whole nation in a state of oppression and tyranny unequalled in the world he looks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing only equal to the question of the cranberry laws of indiana as something having no moral question in it as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture his land with cattle or plant it with tobacco so little and so small a thing that he concludes if i could desire that anything should be done to bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing i must be in favour of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little things in the union now it so happensand there i presume is the foundation of this mistakethat the judge thinks thus and it so happens that there is a vast portion of the american people that do not look upon that matter as being this very little thing they look upon it as a vast moral evil they can prove it as such by the writings of those who gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy and that they so looked upon it and not as an evil merely confining itself to the states where it is situated and while we agree that by the constitution we assented to in the states where it exists we have no right to interfere with it because it is in the constitution we are both by duty and inclination to stick by that constitution in all its letter and spirit from beginning to end  so much then as to my disposition my wish to have all the state legislatures blotted out and to have one consolidated government and a uniformity of domestic regulations in all the states by which i suppose it is meant if we raise corn here we must make sugarcane grow here too and we must make those things which grow north grow in the south all this i suppose he understands i am in favour of doing now so much for all this nonsensefor i must call it so the judge can have no issue with me on a question of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the states  a little now on the other pointthe dred scott decision another of the issues he says that is to be made with me is upon his devotion to the dred scott decision and my opposition to it  i have expressed heretofore and i now repeat my opposition to the dred scott decision but i should be allowed to state the nature of that opposition and i ask your indulgence while i do so what is fairly implied by the term judge douglas has used resistance to the decision i do not resist it if i wanted to take dred scott from his master i would be interfering with property and that terrible difficulty that judge douglas speaks of of interfering with property would arise but i am doing no such thing as that all that i am doing is refusing to obey it as a political rule if i were in congress and a vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new territory in spite of the dred scott decision i would vote that it should  that is what i would do judge douglas said last night that before the decision he might advance his opinion and it might be contrary to the decision when it was made but after it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed just so we let this property abide by the decision but we will try to reverse that decision we will try to put it where judge douglas would not object for he says he will obey it until it is reversed somebody has to reverse that decision since it is made and we mean to reverse it and we mean to do it peaceably  what are the uses of decisions of courts they have two uses first they decide upon the question before the court they decide in this case that dred scott is a slave nobody resists that not only that but they say to everybody else that persons standing just as dred scott stands are as he is that is they say that when a question comes up upon another person it will be so decided again unless the court decides another way unless the court overrules its decision well we mean to do what we can to have the court decide the other way that is one thing we mean to try to do  the sacredness that judge douglas throws around this decision is a degree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other decision i have never heard of such a thing why decisions apparently contrary to that decision or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that decision have been made by that very court before it is the first of its kind it is an astonisher in legal history it is a new wonder of the world it is based upon falsehood in the main as to the factsallegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instancesand no decision made on any questionthe first instance of a decision made under so many unfavourable circumstancesthus placed has ever been held by the profession as law and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law but judge douglas will have it that all hands must take this extraordinary decision made under these extraordinary circumstances and give their vote in congress in accordance with it yield to it and obey it in every possible sense circumstances alter cases do not gentlemen here remember the case of that same supreme court some twentyfive or thirty years ago deciding that a national bank was constitutional i ask if somebody does not remember that a national bank was declared to be constitutional such is the truth whether it be remembered or not the bank charter ran out and a recharter was granted by congress that recharter was laid before general jackson it was urged upon him when he denied the constitutionality of the bank that the supreme court had decided that it was constitutional and general jackson then said that the supreme court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government the members of which had sworn to support the constitutionthat each member had sworn to support the constitution as he understood it i will venture here to say that i have heard judge douglas say that he approved of general jackson for that act what has now become of all his tirade against resistance to the supreme court  my fellowcitizens getting back a littlefor i pass from these pointswhen judge douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the alliance he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall upon the leaders of the republican party almost every word he utters and every distinction he makes has its significance he means for the republicans who do not count themselves as leaders to be his friends he makes no fuss over them it is the leaders that he is making war upon he wants it understood that the mass of the republican party are really his friends it is only the leaders that are doing something that are intolerant and require extermination at his hands as this is clearly and unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter i want to ask your attention addressing myself to republicans here that i may ask you some questions as to where you as the republican party would be placed if you sustained judge douglas in his present position by a reelection i do not claim gentlemen to be unselfish i do not pretend that i would not like to go to the united states senatei make no such hypocritical pretence but i do say to you that in this mighty issue it is nothing to you nothing to the mass of the people of the nation whether or not judge douglas or myself shall ever be heard of after this night it may be a trifle to either of us but in connection with this mighty question upon which hang the destinies of the nation perhaps it is absolutely nothing but where will you be placed if you reindorse judge douglas dont you know how apt he is how exceedingly anxious he is at all times to seize upon anything and everything to persuade you that something he has done you did yourselves why he tried to persuade you last night that our illinois legislature instructed him to introduce the nebraska bill there was nobody in that legislature ever thought of it but still he fights furiously for the proposition and that he did it because there was a standing instruction to our senators to be always introducing nebraska bills he tells you he is for the cincinnati platform he tells you he is for the dred scott decision he tells younot in his speech last night but substantially in a former speechthat he cares not if slavery is voted up or down he tells you the struggle on lecompton is pastit may come up again or not and if it does he stands where he stood when in spite of him and his opposition you built up the republican party if you indorse him you tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down and he will close or try to close your mouths with his declaration repeated by the day the week the month and the year i think in the position in which judge douglas stood in opposing the lecompton constitution he was right he does not know that it will return but if it does we may know where to find him and if it does not we may know where to look for him and that is on the cincinnati platform now i could ask the republican party after all the hard names judge douglas has called them by  all his declarations of black republicanismby the way we are improving the black has got rubbed off but with all that if he be indorsed by republican votes where do you stand plainly you stand ready saddled bridled and harnessed and waiting to be driven over to the slaveryextension camp of the nationjust ready to be driven over tied together in a lotto be driven over every man with a rope around his neck that halter being held by judge douglas that is the question if republican men have been in earnest in what they have done i think they had better not do it but i think the republican party is made up of those who as far as they can peaceably will oppose the extension of slavery and who will hope for its ultimate extinction if they believe it is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent and keeping them from the settlement of free white labourers who want the land to bring up their families upon if they are in earnestalthough they may make a mistake they will grow restless and the time will come when they will come back again and reorganize if not by the same name at least upon the same principles as their party now has it is better then to save the work while it is begun you have done the labour maintain it keep it if men choose to serve you go with them but as you have made up your organization upon principle stand by it for as surely as god reigns over you and has inspired your minds and given you a sense of propriety and continues to give you hope so surely will you still cling to these ideas and you will at last come back again after your wanderings merely to do your work over again  we were oftenmore than once at leastin the course of judge douglass speech last night reminded that this government was made for white menthat he believed it was made for white men well that is putting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it but the judge then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted i protest now and for ever against that counterfeit logic which presumes that because i do not want a negro woman for a slave i do necessarily want her for a wife my understanding is that i need not have her for either but as god made us separate we can leave one another alone and do one another much good thereby there are white men enough to marry all the white women and enough black men to marry all the black women and in gods name let them be so married the judge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture of races that the inferior race bears the superior down why judge if we do not let them get together in the territories they wont mix there i should say at least that that was a selfevident truth  now it happens that we meet together once every year somewhere about the 4th of july for some reason or other these 4th of july gatherings i suppose have their uses if you will indulge me i will state what i suppose to be some of them  we are now a mighty nation we are thirty or about thirty millions of people and we own and inhabit about onefifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth we run our memory back over the pages of history for about eightytwo years and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers vastly inferior to what we are now with a vastly less extent of country with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity and we fix upon something that happened away back as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity we find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers they were iron men they fought for the principle that they were contending for and we understand that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy has come to us we hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of timeof how it was done and who did it and how we are historically connected with it and we go from these meetings in better humour with ourselveswe feel more attached the one to the other and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit in every way we are better men in the age and race and country in which we live for these celebrations but after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole there is something else connected with it we have besides these mendescended by blood from our ancestorsamong us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men they are men who have come from europegerman irish french and scandinavianmen that have come from europe themselves or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here finding themselves our equal in all things if they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood they find they have none they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us but when they look through that old declaration of independence they find that those old men say that we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men that it is the father of all moral principle in them and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that declaration and so they are that is the electric cord in that declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and libertyloving men together that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world  now sirs for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of dont care if slavery is voted up or voted down for sustaining the dred scott decision for holding that the declaration of independence did not mean anything at allwe have judge douglas giving his exposition of what the declaration of independence means and we have him saying that the people of america are equal to the people of england according to his construction you germans are not connected with it now i ask you in all soberness if all these things if indulged in if ratified if confirmed and indorsed if taught to our children and repeated to them do not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country and to transform this government into a government of some other form those arguments that are made that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allowwhat are these arguments they are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world you will find that all the arguments in favour of kingcraft were of this class they always bestrode the necks of the peoplenot that they wanted to do it but because the people were better off for being ridden that is their argument and this argument of the judge is the same old serpent that says you work and i eat you toil and i will enjoy the fruits of it turn in whatever way you willwhether it come from the mouth of a king an excuse for enslaving the people of his country or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another raceit is all the same old serpent and i hold if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this should be granted it does not stop with the negro i should like to knowtaking this old declaration of independence which declares that all men are equal upon principle and making exceptions to itwhere will it stop if one man says it does not mean a negro why not another say it does not mean some other man if that declaration is not the truth let us get the statutebook in which we find it and tear it out who is so bold as to do it if it is not true let us tear it out cries of no no let us stick to it then let us stand firmly by it then  it may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must submit to it i think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government we had slaves among us we could not get our constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more but having by necessity submitted to that much it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties let that charter stand as our standard  my friend has said to me that i am a poor hand to quote scripture i will try it again however it is said in one of the admonitions of our lord be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect the saviour i suppose did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the father in heaven but he said as your father in heaven is perfect be ye also perfect he set that up as a standard and he who did most toward reaching that standard attained the highest degree of moral perfection so i say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal let it be as nearly reached as we can if we cannot give freedom to every creature let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any other creature let us then turn this government back into the channel in which the framers of the constitution originally placed it let us stand firmly by each other if we do not do so we are tending in the contrary direction that our friend judge douglas proposesnot intentionallyworking in the traces that tend to make this one universal slave nation he is one that runs in that direction and as such i resist him  my friends i have detained you about as long as i desired to do and i have only to say let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man this race and that race and the other race being inferior and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position let us discard all these things and unite as one people throughout this land until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal  my friends i could not without launching off upon some new topic which would detain you too long continue tonight i thank you for this most extensive audience that you have furnished me tonight i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal     from a speech at springfield illinois july 17 1858    there is still another disadvantage under which we labour and to which i will ask your attention it arises out of the relative positions of the two persons who stand before the state as candidates for the senate senator douglas is of worldwide renown all the anxious politicians of his party or who have been of his party for years past have been looking upon him as certainly at no distant day to be the president of the united states they have seen in his round jolly fruitful face postoffices landoffices marshalships and cabinet appointments chargÃ©ships and foreign missions bursting and sprouting out in wonderful exuberance ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands and as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so long they cannot in the little distraction that has taken place in the party bring themselves to give up the charming hope but with greedier anxiety they rush about him sustain him and give him marches triumphal entries and receptions beyond what even in the days of his highest prosperity they could have brought about in his favour on the contrary nobody has ever expected me to be president in my poor lean lank face nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out these are disadvantages all taken together that the republicans labour under we have to fight this battle upon principle and upon principle alone i am in a certain sense made the standardbearer in behalf of the republicans i was made so merely because there had to be some one so placedi being in no wise preferable to any other one of the twentyfive perhaps a hundred we have in the republican ranks then i say i wish it to be distinctly understood and borne in mind that we have to fight this battle without manyperhaps without anyof the external aids which are brought to bear against us so i hope those with whom i am surrounded have principle enough to nerve themselves for the task and leave nothing undone that can fairly be done to bring about the right result as appears by two speeches i have heard him deliver since his arrival in illinois he gave special attention to the speech of mine delivered on the sixteenth of june he says that he carefully read that speech he told us that at chicago a week ago last night and he repeated it at bloomington last night he says it was evidently prepared with great care i freely admit it was prepared with care but i was very careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter of fact or make any inferences which did not appear to me to be true and fully warrantable if i had made any mistake i was willing to be corrected if i had drawn any inference in regard to judge douglas or any one else which was not warranted i was fully prepared to modify it as soon as discovered i planted myself upon the truth and the truth only so far as i knew it or could be brought to know it  having made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward judge douglas as manifested therein i was gratified when i found that he had carefully examined it and had detected no error of fact nor any inference against him nor any misrepresentations of which he thought fit to complain he seizes upon the doctrines he supposes to be included in that speech and declares that upon them will turn the issues of the campaign he then quotes or attempts to quote from my speech i will not say that he wilfully misquotes but he does fail to quote accurately his attempt at quoting is from a passage which i believe i can quote accurately from memory i shall make the quotation now with some comments upon it as i have already said in order that the judge shall be left entirely without excuse for misrepresenting me i do so now as i hope for the last time i do this in great caution in order that if he repeats his misrepresentation it shall be plain to all that he does so wilfully if after all he still persists i shall be compelled to reconstruct the course i have marked out for myself and draw upon such humble resources as i have for a new course better suited to the real exigencies of the case i set out in this campaign with the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman in substance at least if not in the outside polish the latter i shall never be but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman i hope i understand and am not less inclined to practise than others it was my purpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon principle and with fairness on both sides and it shall not be my fault if this purpose and expectation shall be given up  he charges in substance that i invite a war of sections that i propose all local institutions of the different states shall become consolidated and uniform what is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction i have again and again said that i would not enter into any one of the states to disturb the institution of slavery judge douglas said at bloomington that i used language most able and ingenious for concealing what i really meant and that while i had protested against entering into the slave states i nevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the ohio and throw missiles into kentucky to disturb them in their domestic institutions   i have said that i do not understand the declaration to mean that all men were created equal in all respects the negroes are not our equals in colour but i suppose it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some respects they are equal in their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness certainly the negro is not our equal in colour perhaps not in many other respects still in the right to put into his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned he is the equal of every other man white or black in pointing out that more has been given you you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has been given him all i ask for the negro is that if you do not like him let him alone if god gave him but little that little let him enjoy   one more point on this springfield speech which judge douglas says he has read so carefully i expressed my belief in the existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize slavery i did not profess to know it nor do i now i showed the part judge douglas had played in the string of facts constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy i showed the parts played by others  i charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last presidential election by the impression that the people of the territories might exclude slavery if they chose when it was known in advance by the conspirators that the court was to decide that neither congress nor the people could so exclude slavery these charges are more distinctly made than anything else in the speech  judge douglas has carefully read and reread that speech he has not so far as i know contradicted those charges in the two speeches which i heard he certainly did not on his own tacit admission i renew that charge i charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to that deception for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery     from lincolns reply to douglas in the first joint debate at ottawa illinois august 21 1858   when a man bears himself somewhat misrepresented it provokes himat least i find it so with myself but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable it is more apt to amuse him after stating the charge of an arrangement between himself and judge trumbull  now all i have to say upon that subject is that i think no mannot even judge douglascan prove it because it is not true i have no doubt he is conscientious in saying it as to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read as being the platform of the republican party in 1854 i say i never had anything to do with them and i think trumbull never had judge douglas cannot show that either of us ever had anything to do with them  now about this story that judge douglas tells of trumbull bargaining to sell out the old democratic party and lincoln agreeing to sell out the old whig party i have the means of knowing about that judge douglas cannot have and i know there is no substance to it whatever  a man cannot prove a negative but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says i certainly cannot introduce testimony to show the negative about things but i have a right to claim that if a man says he knows a thing then he must show how he knows it i always have a right to claim this and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be conscientious on the subject   anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words by which a man can prove a horsechestnut to be a chestnut horse i will say here while upon this subject that i have no purpose either directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races there is a physical difference between the two which in my judgment will probably for ever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference i as well as judge douglas am in favour of the race to which i belong having the superior position i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independencethe right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man i agree with judge douglas he is not my equal in many respects certainly not in colour perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment but in the right to eat the bread without the leave of anybody which his own hand earns he is my equal and the equal of judge douglas and the equal of any living man   as i have not used up so much of my time as i had supposed i will dwell a little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which the judge has spoken he has read from my speech at springfield in which i say that a house divided against itself cannot stand does the judge say it can stand i dont know whether he does or not the judge does not seem to be attending to me just now but i would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself can stand if he does then there is a question of veracity not between him and me but between the judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character  now my friends i ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of saying something seriously i know that the judge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the saviour is true but he may allege that i misapply it and the judge has a right to urge that in my application i do misapply it and then i have a right to show that i do not misapply it when he undertakes to say that because i think this nation so far as the question of slavery is concerned will all become one thing or all the other i am in favour of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various states in all their institutions he argues erroneously the great variety of local institutions in the states springing from differences in the soil differences in the face of the country and in the climate are bonds of union they do not make a house divided against itself but they make a house united if they produce in one section of the country what is called for by the wants of another section and this other section can supply the wants of the first they are not matters of discord but bonds of union true bonds of union but can this question of slavery be considered as among these varieties in the institutions of the country i leave it for you to say whether in the history of our government this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union and on the contrary been an apple of discord and an element of division in the house i ask you to consider whether so long as the moral constitution of mens minds shall continue to be the same after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave and another race shall arise with the same moral and intellectual development we havewhether if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is it will not continue an element of division  if so then i have a right to say that in regard to this question the union is a house divided against itself and when the judge reminds me that i have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some states and yet it does not exist in some others i agree to the fact and i account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed itrestricting it from the new territories where it had not gone and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slavetrade thus putting the seal of legislation against its spread the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction but lately i thinkand in this i charge nothing on the judges motiveslately i think that he and those acting with him have placed that institution on a new basis which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery and while it is placed on this new basis i say and i have said that i believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or on the other hand that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south now i believe if we could arrest the spread and place it where washington and jefferson and madison placed it it would be in the course of ultimate extinction and the public mind would as for eighty years past believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction the crisis would be past and the institution might be let alone for a hundred yearsif it should live so longin the states where it exists yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races a voice then do you repudiate popular sovereignty well then let us talk about popular sovereignty what is popular sovereignty is it the right of the people to have slavery or not to have it as they see fit in the territories i will stateand i have an able man to watch memy understanding is that popular sovereignty as now applied to the question of slavery does allow the people of a territory to have slavery if they want to but does not allow them not to have it if they do not want it i do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a territory of the united states any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one but i do say that as i understand the dred scott decision if any one man wants slaves all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them  when i made my speech at springfield of which the judge complains and from which he quotes i really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all i had no thought in the world that i was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave states i had no thought in the world that i was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races it never occurred to me that i was doing anything or favouring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various states but i must say in all fairness to him if he thinks i am doing something which leads to these bad results it is none the better that i did not mean it it is just as fatal to the country if i have any influence in producing it whether i intend it or not but can it be true that placing this institution upon the original basisthe basis upon which our fathers placed itcan have any tendency to set the northern and the southern states at war with one another or that it can have any tendency to make the people of vermont raise sugarcane because they raise it in louisiana or that it can compel the people of illinois to cut pine logs on the grand prairie where they will not grow because they cut pine logs in maine where they do grow the judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question does the judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of the government i think he says in some of his speechesindeed i have one here nowthat he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line while north of it it should be excluded and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy and therefore he set about studying the subject upon original principles and upon original principles he got up the nebraska bill i am fighting it upon these original principlesfighting it in the jeffersonian washingtonian madisonian fashion  if i have brought forward anything not a fact if he judge douglas will point it out it will not even ruffle me to take it back but if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence is it not rather for him to show by a comparison of the evidence that i have reasoned falsely than to call the kind amiable intelligent gentleman a liar  i want to ask your attention to a portion of the nebraska bill which judge douglas has quoted it being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states thereupon judge douglas and others began to argue in favour of popular sovereigntythe right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them and to exclude slavery if they did not want them but said in substance a senator from ohio mr chase i believe we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to and if you do mean it accept an amendment which i propose expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery i believe i have the amendment here before me which was offered and under which the people of the territory through their proper representatives might if they saw fit prohibit the existence of slavery therein  and now i state it as a fact to be taken back if there is any mistake about it that judge douglas and those acting with him voted that amendment down i now think that those who voted it down had a real reason for doing so they know what that reason was it looks to us since we have seen the dred scott decision pronounced holding that under the constitution the people cannot exclude slaveryi say it looks to outsiders poor simple amiable intelligent gentlemen as though the niche was left as a place to put that dred scott decision in a niche that would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment and now i say again if this was not the reason it will avail the judge much more to calmly and goodhumouredly point out to these people what that other reason was for voting the amendment down than swelling himself up to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar  again there is in that same quotation from the nebraska bill this clause it being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any territory or state i have always been puzzled to know what business the word state had in that connection judge douglas knowshe put it there he knows what he put it there for we outsiders cannot say what he put it there for the law they were passing was not about states and was not making provision for states what was it placed there for after seeing the dred scott decision which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a territory if another dred scott decision shall come holding that they cannot exclude it from a state we shall discover that when the word was originally put there it was in view of something that was to come in due time we shall see that it was the other half of something i now say again if there was any different reason for putting it there judge douglas in a goodhumoured way without calling anybody a liar can tell what the reason was  now my friends  i ask the attention of the people here assembled and elsewhere to the course that judge douglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national not going back to the records but taking the speeches he makes the speeches he made yesterday and the day before and makes constantly all over the country i ask your attention to them in the first place what is necessary to make the institution national not war there is no danger that the people of kentucky will shoulder their muskets and  march into illinois to force the blacks upon us there is no danger of our going over there and making war upon them then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery it is simply the next dred scott decision it is merely for the supreme court to decide that no state under the constitution can exclude it just as they have already decided that under the constitution neither congress nor the territorial legislature can do it when that is decided and acquiesced in the whole thing is done this being true and this being the way as i think that slavery is to be made national let us consider what judge douglas is doing every day to that end in the first place let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment in this and like communities public sentiment is everything with public sentiment nothing can fail without it nothing can succeed consequently he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions he makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed this must be borne in mind as also the additional fact that judge douglas is a man of vast influence so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything when they once find out that judge douglas professes to believe it consider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large partya party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country  this man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a territory to exclude slavery and he does so not because he says it is right in itselfhe does not give any opinion on thatbut because it has been decided by the court and being decided by the court he is and you are bound to take it in your political action as lawnot that he judges at all of its merits but because a decision of the court is to him a thus saith the lord he places it on that ground alone and you will bear in mind that thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision commits himself just as firmly to the next one as to this he did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision but it is a thus saith the lord the next decision as much as this will be a thus saith the lord there is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision it is nothing that i point out to him that his great prototype general jackson did not believe in the binding force of decisions it is nothing to him that jefferson did not so believe i have said that i have often heard him approve of jacksons course in disregarding the decision of the supreme court pronouncing a national bank constitutional he says i did not hear him say so he denies the accuracy of my recollection i say he ought to know better than i but i will make no question about this thing though it still seems to me that i heard him say it twenty times i will tell him though that he now claims to stand on the cincinnati platform which affirms that congress cannot charter a national bank in the teeth of that old standing decision that congress can charter a bank and i remind him of another piece of illinois history on the question of respect for judicial decisions and it is a piece of illinois history belonging to a time when a large party to which judge douglas belonged were displeased with a decision of the supreme court of illinois because they had decided that a governor could not remove a secretary of state and i know that judge douglas will not deny that he was then in favour of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding five new judges so as to vote down the four old ones not only so but it ended in the judges sitting down on the very bench as one of the five new judges to break down the four old ones it was in this way precisely that he got his title of judge now when the judge tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members of a court will have to be catechized beforehand upon some subject i say you know judge you have tried it when he says a court of this kind will lose the confidence of all men will be prostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding i say you know best judge you have been through the mill  but i cannot shake judge douglass teeth loose from the dred scott decision like some obstinate animal i mean no disrespect that will hang on when he has once got his teeth fixedyou may cut off a leg or you may tear away an arm still he will not relax his hold and so i may point out to the judge and say that he is bespattered all over from the beginning of his political life to the present time with attacks upon judicial decisionsi may cut off limb after limb of his public record and strive to wrench from him a single dictum of the court yet i cannot divert him from it he hangs to the last to the dred scott decision henry clay my beau ideal of a statesman  once said of a class of men who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation that they must if they would do this go back to the era of our independence and muzzle the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return that they must blow out the moral lights around us they must penetrate the human soul and eradicate there the love of liberty and then and not till then could they perpetuate slavery in this country to my thinking judge douglas is by his example and vast influence doing that very thing in this community when he says that the negro has nothing in the declaration of independence henry clay plainly understood the contrary judge douglas is going back to the era of our revolution and to the extent of his ability muzzling the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return when he invites any people willing to have slavery to establish it he is blowing out the moral lights around us when he says he cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted upthat it is a sacred right of selfgovernmenthe is in my judgment penetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty in this american people and now i will only say that when by all these means and appliances judge douglas shall succeed in bringing public sentiment to an exact accordance with his own views when these vast assemblages shall echo back all these sentiments when they shall come to repeat his views and avow his principles and to say all that he says on these mighty questionsthen it needs only the formality of a second dred scott decision which he indorses in advance to make slavery alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south     lincolns reply to judge douglas in the second joint debate freeport illinois august 27 1858   the plain truth is this at the introduction of the nebraska policy we believed there was a new era being introduced in the history of the republic which tended to the spread and perpetuation of slavery but in our opposition to that measure we did not agree with one another in everything the people in the north end of the state were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the southern and central portions of the state but we were all opposed to the nebraska doctrine we had that one feeling and one sentiment in common you at the north end met in your conventions and passed your resolutions we in the middle of the state and further south did not hold such conventions and pass the same resolutions although we had in general a common view and a common sentiment so that these meetings which the judge has alluded to and the resolutions he has read from were local and did not spread over the whole state we at last met together in 1856 from all parts of the state and we agreed upon a common platform you who held more extreme notions either yielded those notions or if not wholly yielding them agreed to yield them practically for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward at that time we met you then and if there was anything yielded it was for practical purposes we agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire state of illinois and now we are all bound as a party to that platform and i say here to you if any one expects of me in the case of my election that i will do anything not signified by our republican platform and my answers here today i tell you very frankly that person will be deceived i do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that i have secret purposes or pledges that i dare not speak out if i should never be elected to any office i trust i may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation notwithstanding the hard opinions judge douglas chooses to entertain of me     from lincolns reply at jonesboro september 15 1858   ladies and gentlemen there is very much in the principles that judge douglas has here enunciated that i most cordially approve and over which i shall have no controversy with him in so far as he insisted that all the states have the right to do exactly as they please about all their domestic relations including that of slavery i agree entirely with him he places me wrong in spite of all i tell him though i repeat it again and again insisting that i have made no difference with him upon this subject i have made a great many speeches some of which have been printed and it will be utterly impossible for him to find anything that i have ever put in print contrary to what i now say on the subject i hold myself under constitutional obligations to allow the people in all the states without interference direct or indirect to do exactly as they please and i deny that i have any inclination to interfere with them even if there were no such constitutional obligation i can only say again that i am placed improperlyaltogether improperly in spite of all that i can saywhen it is insisted that i entertain any other view or purpose in regard to that matter  while i am upon this subject i will make some answers briefly to certain propositions that judge douglas has put he says why cant this union endure permanently half slave and half free i have said that i supposed it could not and i will try before this new audience to give briefly some of the reasons for entertaining that opinion another form of his question is why cant we let it stand as our fathers placed it that is the exact difficulty between us i say that judge douglas and his friends have changed it from the position in which our fathers originally placed it  i say in the way our fathers originally left the slavery question the institution was in the course of ultimate extinction i say when this government was first established it was the policy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new territories of the united states where it had not existed but judge douglas and his friends have broken up that policy and placed it upon a new basis by which it is to become national and perpetual all i have asked or desired anywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the basis that the fathers of our government originally placed it upon i have no doubt that it would become extinct for all time to come if we had but readopted the policy of the fathers by restricting it to the limits it has already coveredrestricting it from the new territories  i do not wish to dwell on this branch of the subject at great length at this time but allow me to repeat one thing that i have stated before brooks the man who assaulted senator sumner on the floor of the senate and who was complimented with dinners and silver pitchers and goldheaded canes and a good many other things for that feat in one of his speeches declared that when this government was originally established nobody expected that the institution of slavery would last until this day that was but the opinion of one man but it is such an opinion as we can never get from judge douglas or anybody in favour of slavery in the north at all you can sometimes get it from a southern man he said at the same time that the framers of our government did not have the knowledge that experience has taught usthat experience and the invention of the cotton gin have taught us that the perpetuation of slavery is a necessity he insisted therefore upon its being changed from the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the basis of perpetuation and nationalization  i insist that this is the difference between judge douglas and myselfthat judge douglas is helping the change along i insist upon this government being placed where our fathers originally placed it   when he asks me why we cannot get along with it slavery in the attitude where our fathers placed it he had better clear up the evidences that he has himself changed it from that basis that he has himself been chiefly instrumental in changing the policy of the fathers any one who will read his speech of the twentysecond of march last will see that he there makes an open confession showing that he set about fixing the institution upon an altogether different set of principles  now fellowcitizens in regard to this matter about a contract between myself and judge trumbull and myself and all that long portion of judge douglass speech on this subject i wish simply to say what i have said to him before that he cannot know whether it is true or not and i do know that there is not a word of truth in it and i have told him so before i dont want any harsh language indulged in but i do not know how to deal with this persistent insisting on a story that i know to be utterly without truth it used to be the fashion amongst men that when a charge was made some sort of proof was brought forward to establish it and if no proof was found to exist it was dropped i dont know how to meet this kind of an argument i dont want to have a fight with judge douglas and i have no way of making an argument up into the consistency of a corncob and stopping his mouth with it all i can do is goodhumouredly to say that from the beginning to the end of all that story about a bargain between judge trumbull and myself there is not a word of truth in it  when that compromise of 1850 was made it did not repeal the old missouri compromise it left a region of united states territory half as large as the present territory of the united states north of the line of 36Â° 30 in which slavery was prohibited by act of congress this compromise did not repeal that one it did not affect nor propose to repeal it but at last it became judge douglass duty as he thought and i find no fault with him as chairman of the committee on territories to bring in a bill for the organization of a territorial governmentfirst of one then of two territories north of that line when he did so it ended in his inserting a provision substantially repealing the missouri compromise that was because the compromise of 1850 had not repealed it and now i ask why he could not have left that compromise alone we were quiet from the agitation of the slavery question we were making no fuss about it all had acquiesced in the compromise measures of 1850 we never had been seriously disturbed by any abolition agitation before that period i close this part of the discussion on my part by asking him the question again why when we had peace under the missouri compromise could you not have let it alone                                       he tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the states of the union that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil climate of the face of the country and the difference of the natural features of the states i agree to all that have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us not at all have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in louisiana designed to regulate the commerce that springs from the production of sugar or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this state have they produced any differences not at all they are the very cements of this union they dont make the house a house divided against itself they are the props that hold up the house and sustain the union  but has it been so with this element of slavery have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it and when will we cease to have quarrels over it like causes produce like effects it is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory whenever it has been limited to its present bounds and there has been no effort to spread it there has been peace all the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory it was thus at the date of the missouri compromise it was so again with the annexation of texas so with the territory acquired by the mexican war and it is so now whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance now i appeal to this audience very few of whom are my political friends as rational men whether we have reason to expect that the agitation in regard to this subject will cease while the causes that tend to reproduce agitation are actively at work will not the same cause that produced agitation in 1820 when the missouri compromise was formedthat which produced the agitation upon the annexation of texas and at other timeswork out the same results always do you think that the nature of man will be changed that the same causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another  this has been the result so far as my observation of the slavery question and my reading in history extend what right have we then to hope that the trouble will cease that the agitation will come to an end until it shall either be placed back where it originally stood and where the fathers originally placed it or on the other hand until it shall entirely master all opposition this is the view i entertain and this is the reason why i entertained it as judge douglas has read from my springfield speech   at freeport i answered several interrogatories that had been propounded to me by judge douglas at the ottawa meeting at the same time i propounded four interrogatories to him claiming it as a right that he should answer as many for me as i did for him and i would reserve myself for a future instalment when i got them ready the judge in answering me upon that occasion put in what i suppose he intends as answers to all four of my interrogatories the first one of these i have before me and it is in these words       question 1 if the people of kansas shall by means entirely      unobjectionable in all other respects adopt a state constitution      and ask admission into the union under it before they have the      requisite number of inhabitants according to the english billsome      93000will you vote to admit them  as i read the judges answer in the newspaper and as i remember it as pronounced at the time he does not give any answer which is equivalent to yes or noi will or i wont he answers at very considerable length rather quarrelling with me for asking the question and insisting that judge trumbull had done something that i ought to say something about and finally getting out such statements as induce me to infer that he means to be understood he will in that supposed case vote for the admission of kansas i only bring this forward now for the purpose of saying that if he chooses to put a different construction upon his answer he may do it but if he does not i shall from this time forward assume that he will vote for the admission of kansas in disregard of the english bill he has the right to remove any misunderstanding i may have i only mention it now that i may hereafter assume this to have been the true construction of his answer if he does not now choose to correct me  the second interrogatory i propounded to him was this       question 2 can the people of a united states territory in any      lawful way against the wish of any citizen of the united states      exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state      constitution  to this judge douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery from the territory prior to the formation of a constitution he goes on to tell us how it can be done as i understand him he holds that it can be done by the territorial legislature refusing to make any enactments for the protection of slavery in the territory and especially by adopting unfriendly legislation to it for the sake of clearness i state it again that they can exclude slavery from the territoryfirst by withholding what he assumes to be an indispensable assistance to it in the way of legislation and second by unfriendly legislation if i rightly understand him i wish to ask your attention for a while to his position  in the first place the supreme court of the united states has decided that any congressional prohibition of slavery in the territories is unconstitutional they have reached this proposition as a conclusion from their former proposition that the constitution of the united states expressly recognizes property in slaves and from that other constitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law hence they reach the conclusion that as the constitution of the united states expressly recognizes property in slaves and prohibits any person from being deprived of property without due process of law to pass an act of congress by which a man who owned a slave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on the other side is depriving him of that property without due process of law that i understand to be the decision of the supreme court i understand also that judge douglas adheres most firmly to that decision and the difficulty is how is it possible for any power to exclude slavery from the territory unless in violation of that decision that is the difficulty  in the senate of the united states in 1856 judge trumbull in a speech substantially if not directly put the same interrogatory to judge douglas as to whether the people of a territory had the lawful power to exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution judge douglas then answered at considerable length and his answer will be found in the congressional globe under date of june 9 1856 the judge said that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution or not was a question to be decided by the supreme court he put that proposition as will be seen by the congressional globe in a variety of forms all running to the same thing in substancethat it was a question for the supreme court i maintain that when he says after the supreme court has decided the question that the people may yet exclude slavery by any means whatever he does virtually say that it is not a question for the supreme court he shifts his ground i appeal to you whether he did not say it was a question for the supreme court has not the supreme court decided that question when he now says that the people may exclude slavery does he not make it a question for the people does he not virtually shift his ground and say that it is not a question for the court but for the people this is a very simple propositiona very plain and naked one it seems to me that there is no difficulty in deciding it in a variety of ways he said that it was a question for the supreme court he did not stop then to tell us that whatever the supreme court decides the people can by withholding necessary police regulations keep slavery out he did not make any such answer i submit to you now whether the new state of the case has not induced the judge to sheer away from his original ground would not this be the impression of every fairminded man  i hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false it is not true at all i hold that the history of this country shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these police regulations which the judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it not only so but is there not another facthow came this dred scott decision to be made it was made upon the case of a negro being taken and actually held in slavery in minnesota territory claiming his freedom because the act of congress prohibited his being so held there will the judge pretend that dred scott was not held there without police regulations there is at least one matter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the territory not only without police regulations but in the teeth of congressional legislation supposed to be valid at the time this shows that there is vigour enough in slavery to plant itself in a new country even against unfriendly legislation it takes not only law but the enforcement of law to keep it out that is the history of this country upon the subject  i wish to ask one other question it being understood that the constitution of the united states guarantees property in slaves in the territories if there is any infringement of the right of that property would not the united states courts organized for the government of the territory apply such remedy as might be necessary in that case it is a maxim held by the courts that there is no wrong without its remedy and the courts have a remedy for whatever is acknowledged and treated as a wrong  again i will ask you my friends if you were elected members of the legislature what would be the first thing you would have to do before entering upon your duties swear to support the constitution of the united states suppose you believe as judge douglas does that the constitution of the united states guarantees to your neighbour the right to hold slaves in that territorythat they are his propertyhow can you clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is necessary to enable him to enjoy that property what do you understand by supporting the constitution of a state or of the united states is it not to give such constitutional helps to the rights established by that constitution as may be practically needed can you if you swear to support the constitution and believe that the constitution establishes a right clear your oath without giving it support do you support the constitution if knowing or believing there is a right established under it which needs specific legislation you withhold that legislation do you not violate and disregard your oath i can conceive of nothing plainer in the world there can be nothing in the words support the constitution if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any right established under the constitution and what i say here will hold with still more force against the judges doctrine of unfriendly legislation how could you having sworn to support the constitution and believing that it guaranteed the right to hold slaves in the territories assist in legislation intended to defeat that right that would be violating your own view of the constitution not only so but if you were to do so how long would it take the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void not a moment  lastly i would ask is not congress itself under obligation to give legislative support to any right that is established under the united states constitution i repeat the question is not congress itself bound to give legislative support to any right that is established in the united states constitution a member of congress swears to support the constitution of the united states and if he sees a right established by that constitution which needs specific legislative protection can he clear his oath without giving that protection let me ask you why many of us who are opposed to slavery upon principle give our acquiescence to a fugitiveslave law why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law and abide by it when passed because the constitution makes provision that the owners of slaves shall have the right to reclaim them it gives the right to reclaim slaves and that right is as judge douglas says a barren right unless there is legislation that will enforce it  the mere declaration no person held to service or labour in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labour but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due is powerless without specific legislation to enforce it now on what ground would a member of congress who is opposed to slavery in the abstract vote for a fugitive law as i would deem it my duty to do because there is a constitutional right which needs legislation to enforce it and although it is distasteful to me i have sworn to support the constitution and having so sworn i cannot conceive that i do support it if i withhold from that right any necessary legislation to make it practical and if that is true in regard to a fugitiveslave law is the right to have fugitive slaves reclaimed any better fixed in the constitution than the right to hold slaves in the territories for this decision is a just exposition of the constitution as judge douglas thinks is the one right any better than the other if i wished to refuse to give legislative support to slave property in the territories if a member of congress i could not do it holding the view that the constitution establishes that right if i did it at all it would be because i deny that this decision properly construes the constitution but if i acknowledge with judge douglas that this decision properly construes the constitution i cannot conceive that i would be less than a perjured man if i should refuse in congress to give such protection to that property as in its nature it needed     from lincolns reply to judge douglas at charleston illinois september 18 1858   judge douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an answer to the question whether i am in favour of negro citizenship so far as i know the judge never asked me the question before he shall have no occasion ever to ask it again for i tell him very frankly that i am not in favour of negro citizenship now my opinion is that the different states have the power to make a negro a citizen under the constitution of the united states if they choose the dred scott decision decides that they have not that power if the state of illinois had that power i should be opposed to the exercise of it that is all i have to say about it  judge douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my speeches south  and there was a very different cast of sentiment in the speeches made at the different points i will not charge upon judge douglas that he wilfully misrepresents me but i call upon every fairminded man to take these speeches and read them and i dare him to point out any difference between my speeches north and south while i am here perhaps i ought to say a word if i have the time in regard to the latter portion of the judges speech which was a sort of declamation in reference to my having said that i entertained the belief that this government would not endure half slave and half free i have said so and i did not say it without what seemed to me good reasons it perhaps would require more time than i have now to set forth those reasons in detail but let me ask you a few questions have we ever had any peace on this slavery question when are we to have peace upon it if it is kept in the position it now occupies how are we ever to have peace upon it that is an important question to be sure if we will all stop and allow judge douglas and his friends to march on in their present career until they plant the institution all over the nation here and wherever else our flag waves and we acquiesce in it there will be peace but let me ask judge douglas how he is going to get the people to do that they have been wrangling over this question for forty years this was the cause of the agitation resulting in the missouri compromise this produced the troubles at the annexation of texas in the acquisition of the territory acquired in the mexican war again this was the trouble quieted by the compromise of 1850 when it was settled for ever as both the great political parties declared in their national conventions that for ever turned out to be just four years when judge douglas himself reopened it  when is it likely to come to an end he introduced the nebraska bill in 1854 to put another end to the slavery agitation he promised that it would finish it all up immediately and he has never made a speech since until he got into a quarrel with the president about the lecompton constitution in which he has not declared that we are just at the end of the slavery agitation but in one speech i think last winter he did say that he didnt quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would come now he tells us again that it is all over and the people of kansas have voted down the lecompton constitution how is it over that was only one of the attempts to put an end to the slavery agitationone of these final settlements is kansas in the union has she formed a constitution that she is likely to come in under is not the slavery agitation still an open question in that territory if kansas should sink today and leave a great vacant space in the earths surface this vexed question would still be among us i say then there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it no way but to keep it out of our new territoriesto restrict it for ever to the old states where it now exists then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction that is one way of putting an end to the slavery agitation  the other way is for us to surrender and let judge douglas and his friends have their way and plant slavery over all the statescease speaking of it as in any way a wrongregard slavery as one of the common matters of property and speak of our negroes as we do of our horse and cattle     from lincolns reply to judge douglas at galesburg illinois october 7 1858    the judge has alluded to the declaration of independence and insisted that negroes are not included in that declaration and that it is a slander on the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes were meant therein and he asks you is it possible to believe that mr jefferson who penned that immortal paper could have supposed himself applying the language of that instrument to the negro race and yet held a portion of that race in slavery would he not at once have freed them i only have to remark upon this part of his speech and that too very briefly for i shall not detain myself or you upon that point for any great length of time that i believe the entire records of the world from the date of the declaration of independence up to within three years ago may be searched in vain for one single affirmation from one single man that the negro was not included in the declaration of independence i think i may defy judge douglas to show that he ever said so that washington ever said so that any president ever said so that any member of congress ever said so or that any living man upon the whole earth ever said so until the necessities of the present policy of the democratic party in regard to slavery had to invent that affirmation and i will remind judge douglas and this audience that while mr jefferson was the owner of slaves as undoubtedly he was in speaking on this very subject he used the strong language that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god was just and i will offer the highest premium in my power to judge douglas if he will show that he in all his life ever uttered a sentiment at all akin to that of jefferson   i want to call to the judges attention an attack he made upon me in the first one of these debates in order to fix extreme abolitionism upon me judge douglas read a set of resolutions which he declared had been passed by a republican state convention in october 1854 held at springfield illinois and he declared that i had taken a part in that convention it turned out that although a few men calling themselves an antinebraska state convention had sat at springfield about that time yet neither did i take any part in it nor did it pass the resolutions or any such resolutions as judge douglas read so apparent had it become that the resolutions that he read had not been passed at springfield at all nor by any state convention in which i had taken part that seven days later at freeport  judge douglas declared that he had been misled  and promised  that when he went to springfield he would investigate the matter i have waited as i think a sufficient time for the report of that investigation   a fraud an absolute forgery was committed and the perpetration of it was traced to the threelanphier harris and douglas whether it can be narrowed in any way so as to exonerate any one of them is what judge douglass report would probably show the main object of that forgery at that time was to beat yates and elect harris to congress and that object was known to be exceedingly dear to judge douglas at that time   the fraud having been apparently successful upon that occasion both harris and douglas have more than once since then been attempting to put it to new uses as the fishermans wife whose drowned husband was brought home with his body full of eels said when she was asked what was to be done with him take out the eels and set him again so harris and douglas have shown a disposition to take the eels out of that stale fraud by which they gained harriss election and set the fraud again more than once and now that it has been discovered publicly to be a fraud we find that judge douglas manifests no surprise at all but meanwhile the three are agreed that each is a most honourable man     notes for speeches october 1858   suppose it is true that the negro is inferior to the white in the gifts of nature is it not the exact reverse of justice that the white should for that reason take from the negro any part of the little which he has had given him give to him that is needy is the christian rule of charity but take from him that is needy is the rule of slavery  the sum of proslavery theology seems to be this slavery is not universally right nor yet universally wrong it is better for some people to be slaves and in such cases it is the will of god that they be such  certainly there is no contending against the will of god but still there is some difficulty in ascertaining and applying it to particular cases for instance we will suppose the rev dr ross has a slave named sambo and the question is is it the will of god that sambo shall remain a slave or be set free the almighty gives no audible answer to the question and his revelation the bible gives noneor at most none but such as admits of a squabble as to its meaning no one thinks of asking sambos opinion on it so at last it comes to this that dr ross is to decide the question and while he considers it he sits in the shade with gloves on his hands and subsists on the bread that sambo is earning in the burning sun if he decides that god wills sambo to continue a slave he thereby retains his own comfortable position but if he decides that god wills sambo to be free he thereby has to walk out of the shade throw off his gloves and delve for his own bread will dr ross be actuated by the perfect impartiality which has ever been considered most favourable to correct decisions  we have in this nation the element of domestic slavery it is a matter of absolute certainty that it is a disturbing element it is the opinion of all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it that it is a dangerous element we keep up a controversy in regard to it that controversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion and if we can learn exactlycan reduce to the lowest elementswhat that difference of opinion is we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that disturbing element  i suggest that the difference of opinion reduced to its lowest terms is no other than the difference between the men who think slavery a wrong and those who do not think it wrong the republican party think it wrongwe think it is a moral a social and a political wrong we think it is a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the states where it exists but that it is a wrong which in its tendency to say the least affects the existence of the whole nation because we think it wrong we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong  we deal with it as with any other wrong in so far as we can prevent its growing any larger and so deal with it that in the run of time there may be some promise of an end to it we have a due regard to the actual presence of it amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way and all the constitutional obligations thrown about it i suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in the nation and to our constitutional obligations we have no right at all to disturb it in the states where it exists and we profess that we have no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it we go further than that we dont propose to disturb it where in one instance we think the constitution would permit us we think the constitution would permit us to disturb it in the district of columbia still we do not propose to do that unless it should be in terms which i dont suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree tothe terms of making the emancipation gradual and compensating the unwilling owners where we suppose we have the constitutional right we restrain ourselves in reference to the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties thrown about it we also oppose it as an evil so far as it seeks to spread itself we insist on the policy that shall restrict it to its present limits we dont suppose that in doing this we violate anything due to the actual presence of the institution or anything due to the constitutional guaranties thrown around it  we oppose the dred scott decision in a certain way upon which i ought perhaps to address you in a few words we do not propose that when dred scott has been decided to be a slave by the court we as a mob will decide him to be free we do not propose that when any other one or one thousand shall be decided by that court to be slaves we will in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule which shall be binding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong which shall be binding on the members of congress or the president to favour no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision we do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way because we think it lays the foundation not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the states themselves we propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can and a new judicial rule established upon this subject  i will add this that if there be any man who does not believe that slavery is wrong in the three aspects which i have mentioned or in any one of them that man is misplaced and ought to leave us while on the other hand if there be any man in the republican party who is impatient over the necessity springing from its actual presence and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties thrown around it and would act in disregard of these he too is misplaced standing with us he will find his place somewhere else for we have a due regard so far as we are capable of understanding them for all these things this gentlemen as well as i can give it is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity  i will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to mea sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong and therefore goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong that policy is the democratic policy and that sentiment is the democratic sentiment if there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the democratic party in relation to this subject i ask him to bear with me while i state a few things tending as i think to prove that proposition  in the first place the leading mani think i may do my friend judge douglas the honour of calling him suchadvocating the present democratic policy never himself says it is wrong he has the high distinction so far as i know of never having said slavery is either right or wrong almost everybody else says one or the other but the judge never does if there be a man in the democratic party who thinks it is wrong and yet clings to that party i suggest to him in the first place that his leader dont talk as he does for he never says that it is wrong  in the second place i suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it if you will examine the arguments that are made on it you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery  perhaps that democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as i am will tell me that i am wrong about this i wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little you say it is wrong but dont you constantly object to anybody else saying so do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it you say it must not be opposed in the free states because slavery is not there it must not be opposed in the slave states because it is there it must not be opposed in politics because that will make a fuss it must not be opposed in the pulpit because it is not religion then where is the place to oppose it there is no suitable place to oppose it there is no plan in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent which you say yourself is coming frank blair and gratz brown tried to get up a system of gradual emancipation in missouri had an election in august and got beat and you mr democrat threw up your hat and hallooed hurrah for democracy  so i say again that in regard to the arguments that are made when judge douglas says he dont care whether slavery is voted up or voted down whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment or only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy it is alike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he dont see anything wrong in it but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong he cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down when judge douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves they have a right to have them he is perfectly logical if there is nothing wrong in the institution but if you admit that it is wrong he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong when he says that slave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go into the territories upon the principles of equality he is reasoning truly if there is no difference between them as property but if the one is property held rightfully and the other is wrong then there is no equality between the right and wrong so that turn it in any way you can in all the arguments sustaining the democratic policy and in that policy itself there is a careful studied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery  let us understand this i am not just here trying to prove that we are right and they are wrong i have been stating where we and they stand and trying to show what is the real difference between us and i now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly statedcan get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrongthen and not till then i think will we in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation     mr lincolns reply to judge douglas in the seventh and last debate alton illinois october 15 1858    but is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery springs from officeseekingfrom the mere ambition of politicians is that the truth how many times have we had danger from this question go back to the day of the missouri compromise go back to the nullification question at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question go back to the time of the annexation of texas go back to the troubles that led to the compromise of 1850 you will find that every time with the single exception of the nullification question they sprung from an endeavour to spread this institution there never was a party in the history of this country and there probably never will be of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves but does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder what divided the great methodist church into two parts north and south what has raised this constant disturbance in every presbyterian general assembly that meets what disturbed the unitarian church in this very city two years ago what has jarred and shaken the great american tract society recentlynot yet splitting it but sure to divide it in the end is it not this same mighty deepseated power that somehow operates on the minds of men exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of society in politics in religion in literature in morals in all the manifold relations of life is this the work of politicians is that irresistible power which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people to be stilled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing and we ought not to talk about it if you will get everybody else to stop talking about it i assure you that i will quit before they have half done so but where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than half a century which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutions i say where is the philosophy or the statesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it yet this is the policy here in the north that douglas is advocatingthat we are to care nothing about it i ask you if it is not a false philosophy is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most abouta thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about   the judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive right which the states have to decide the whole thing for themselves i agree with him very readily our controversy with him is in regard to the new territories we agree that when states come in as states they have the right and power to do as they please we profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the states what i insist upon is that the new territories shall be kept free from it while in the territorial condition    these are false issues upon which judge douglas has tried to force the controversy  the real issue in this controversythe one dressing upon every mindis the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong the sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the republican party it is the sentiment around which all their actions all their arguments circle from which all their propositions radiate they look upon it as being a moral social and political wrong and while they contemplate it as such they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it yet having a due regard for these they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger they insist that it as far as may be be treated as a wrong and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger they also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery some time as being a wrong these are the views they entertain in regard to it as i understand them and all their sentiments all their arguments and propositions are brought within this range i have said and i here repeat it that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which i have spoken he is misplaced and ought not to be with us and if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it that man is misplaced if he is on our platform we disclaim sympathy with him in practical action he is not placed properly with us  on this subject of treating it as a wrong and limiting its spread let me say a word has anything ever threatened the existence of this union save and except this very institution of slavery what is it that we hold most dear amongst us our own liberty and prosperity what has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity save and except this institution of slavery if this is true how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slaveryby spreading it out and making it bigger you may have a wen or a cancer upon your person and not be able to cut it out lest you bleed to death but surely it is no way to cure it to engraft it and spread it over your whole body that is no proper way of treating what you regard as a wrong you see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrongrestricting the spread of it and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed that is the peaceful waythe oldfashioned waythe way in which the fathers themselves set us the example  on the other hand i have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not being wrong that is the democratic sentiment of this day i do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right that class will include all who positively assert that it is right and all who like judge douglas treat it as indifferent and do not say it is either right or wrong these two classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong and if there be among you anybody who supposes that he as a democrat can consider himself as much opposed to slavery as anybody i would like to reason with him you never treat it as a wrong what other thing that you consider a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that perhaps you say it is wrong but your leader never does and you quarrel with anybody who says it is wrong although you pretend to say so yourself you can find no fit place to deal with it as a wrong you must not say anything about it in the free states because it is not here you must not say anything about it in the slave states because it is there you must not say anything about it in the pulpit because that is religion and has nothing to do with it you must not say anything about it in politics because that will disturb the security of my place there is no place to talk about it as being a wrong although you say yourself it is a wrong but finally you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the people of the slave states should adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the slavery question you would be in favour of it you would be in favour of it you say that is getting it in the right place and you would be glad to see it succeed but you are deceiving yourself you all know that frank blair and gratz brown down there in st louis undertook to introduce that system in missouri they fought as valiantly as they could for the system of gradual emancipation which you pretend you would be glad to see succeed now i will bring you to the test after a hard fight they were beaten and when the news came over here you threw up your hats and hurrahed for democracy more than that take all the argument made in favour of the system you have proposed and it carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in the institution of slavery the arguments to sustain that policy carefully exclude it even here today you heard judge douglas quarrel with me because i uttered a wish that it might sometime come to an end although henry clay could say he wished every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors i am denounced by those who pretend to respect henry clay for uttering a wish that it might sometime in some peaceful way come to an end  the democratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate the merest breath the slightest hint of the least degree of wrong about it try it by some of judge douglass arguments he says he dont care whether it is voted up or voted down in the territories i do not care myself in dealing with that expression whether it is intended to be expressive of his individual sentiments on the subject or only of the national policy he desires to have established  but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it because no man can logically say he dont care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down any man can say that who does not see anything wrong in slavery but if it is a wrong he cannot say that people have a right to do wrong he says that upon the score of equality slaves should be allowed to go into a new territory like other property this is strictly logical if there is no difference between it and other property but if you insist that one is wrong and the other right there is no use to institute a comparison between right and wrong the democratic policy everywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it  that is the real issue that is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of judge douglas and myself shall be silent it is the eternal struggle between these two principlesright and wrongthroughout the world they are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time and will ever continue to struggle  the one is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings it is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself it is the same spirit that says you toil and work and earn bread and ill eat it no matter in what shape it comes whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labour or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another raceit is the same tyrannical principle whenever the issue can be distinctly made and all extraneous matter thrown out so that men can fairly see the real difference between the parties this controversy will soon be settled and it will be done peaceably too there will be no war no violence it will be placed again where the wisest and best men of the world placed it     from a speech at columbus ohio on the slave trade popular sovereignty etc september 16 1859    the republican party as i understand its principles and policy believes that there is great danger of the institution of slavery being spread out and extended until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all the states of this union so believing to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation is the original and chief purpose of the republican organization  i say chief purpose of the republican organization for it is certainly true that if the national house shall fall into the hands of the republicans they will have to attend to all the matters of national housekeeping as well as this the chief and real purpose of the republican party is eminently conservative it proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery and there to maintain it looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the government themselves expected and looked forward to  the chief danger to this purpose of the republican party is not just now the revival of the african slavetrade or the passage of a congressional slavecode  but the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that insidious douglas popular sovereignty this is the miner and sapper while it does not propose to revive the african slavetrade nor to pass a slavecode nor to make a second dred scott decision it is preparing us for the onslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to come on and the word of command for them to advance shall be given i say this douglas popular sovereigntyfor there is a broad distinction as i now understand it between that article and a genuine popular sovereignty  i believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty i think a definition of genuine popular sovereignty in the abstract would be about this that each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself and with all those things which exclusively concern him applied to governments this principle would be that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them i understand that this government of the united states under which we live is based upon this principle and i am misunderstood if it is supposed that i have any war to make upon that principle  now what is judge douglass popular sovereignty it is as a principle no other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man neither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object applied in government as he seeks to apply it it is this if in a new territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits or to establish it there however one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that territory or the other members of the families of communities of which they are but an incipient member or the general head of the family of states as parent of allhowever their action may affect one or the other of these there is no power or right to interfere that is douglas popular sovereignty applied   i cannot but express my gratitude that this true view of this element of discord among us as i believe it is is attracting more and more attention i do not believe that governor seward uttered that sentiment because i had done so before but because he reflected upon this subject and saw the truth of it nor do i believe because governor seward or i uttered it that mr hickman of pennsylvania in different language since that time has declared his belief in the utter antagonism which exists between the principles of liberty and slavery you see we are multiplying now while i am speaking of hickman let me say i know but little about him i have never seen him and know scarcely anything about the man but i will say this much about him of all the antilecompton democracy that have been brought to my notice he alone has the true genuine ring of the metal   judge douglas  proceeds to assume without proving it that slavery is one of those little unimportant trivial matters which are of just about as much consequence as the question would be to me whether my neighbour should raise horned cattle or plant tobacco that there is no moral question about it but that it is altogether a matter of dollars and cents that when a new territory is opened for settlement the first man who goes into it may plant there a thing which like the canada thistle or some other of those pests of the soil cannot be dug out by the millions of men who will come thereafter that it is one of those little things that is so trivial in its nature that it has no effect upon anybody save the few men who first plant upon the soil that it is not a thing which in any way affects the family of communities composing these states nor any way endangers the general government judge douglas ignores altogether the very wellknown fact that we have never had a serious menace to our political existence except it sprang from this thing which he chooses to regard as only upon a par with onions and potatoes   did you ever five years ago hear of anybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in the declaration of national independence that it did not mean negroes at all and when all men were spoken of negroes were not included   then i suppose that all now express the belief that the declaration of independence never did mean negroes i call upon one of them to say that he said it five years ago if you think that now and did not think it then the next thing that strikes me is to remark that there has been a change wrought in you and a very significant change it is being no less than changing the negro in your estimation from the rank of a man to that of a brute  is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change public opinion in this country is everything in a nation like ours this popular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the public mind to the extent i have stated   now if you are opposed to slavery honestly i ask you to note that fact the popularsovereignty of judge douglas and the like of which is to follow to be plastered on layer after layer until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro everywhere as with the brute if public sentiment has not been debauched already to this point a new turn of the screw in that direction is all that is wanting and this is constantly being done by the teachers of this insidious popular sovereignty you need but one or two turns further until your minds now ripening under these teachings will be ready for all these things and you will receive and support or submit to the slavetrade revived with all its horrorsa slavecode enforced in our territoriesand a new dred scott decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the free north   i ask attention to the fact that in a preeminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work blowing out the moral lights around us teaching that the negro is no longer a man but a brute that the declaration has nothing to do with him that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile that man with body and soul is a matter of dollars and cents i suggest to this portion of the ohio republicans or democrats if there be any present the serious consideration of this fact that there is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on this subject with this my friends i bid you adieu     from a speech at cincinnati ohio on the intentions of black republicans the relation of labour and capital etc september 17 1859    i say then in the first place to the kentuckians that i am what they call as i understand it a black republican i think slavery is wrong morally and politically i desire that it should be no further spread in these united states and i should not object if it should gradually terminate in the whole union while i say this for myself i say to you kentuckians that i understand you differ radically with me upon this proposition that you believe slavery is a good thing that slavery is right that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this union now there being this broad difference between us i do not pretend in addressing myself to you kentuckians to attempt proselyting you that would be a vain effort i do not enter upon it i only propose to try to show you that you ought to nominate for the next presidency at charleston my distinguished friend judge douglas in all that there is no real difference between you and him i understand he is as sincerely for you and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves i will try to demonstrate that proposition  in kentucky perhapsin many of the slave states certainlyyou are trying to establish the rightfulness of slavery by reference to the bible you are trying to show that slavery existed in the bible times by divine ordinance now douglas is wiser than you for your own benefit upon that subject douglas knows that whenever you establish that slavery was right by the bible it will occur that that slavery was the slavery of the white manof men without reference to colourand he knows very well that you may entertain that idea in kentucky as much as you please but you will never win any northern support upon it he makes a wiser argument for you he makes the argument that the slavery of the black manthe slavery of the man who has a skin of a different colour from your ownis right he thereby brings to your support northern voters who could not for a moment be brought by your own argument of the bible right of slavery   at memphis he judge douglas declared that in all contests between the negro and the white man he was for the white man but that in all questions between the negro and the crocodile he was for the negro he did not make that declaration accidentally  he made it a great many times  the first inference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro you are wronging the white man in some way or other and that whoever is opposed to the negro being enslaved is in some way or other against the white man is not that a falsehood if there was a necessary conflict between the white man and the negro i should be for the white man as much as judge douglas but i say there is no such necessary conflict i say there is room enough for us all to be free and that it not only does not wrong the white man that the negro should be free but it positively wrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be enslavedthat the mass of white men are really injured by the effects of slave labour in the vicinity of the fields of their own labour  there is one other thing that i will say to you in this relation it is but my opinion i give it to you without a fee it is my opinion that it is for you to take him or be defeated and that if you do take him you may be beaten you will surely be beaten if you do not take him we the republicans and others forming the opposition of the country intend to stand by our guns to be patient and firm and in the long run to beat you whether you take him or not we know that before we fairly beat you we have to beat you both together we know that you are all of a feather and that we have to beat you all together and we expect to do it we dont intend to be very impatient about it we mean to be as deliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be but as firm and resolved as it is possible for men to be when we do as we say beat you you perhaps want to know what we will do with you  i will tell you so far as i am authorized to speak for the opposition what we mean to do with you we mean to treat you as near as we possibly can as washington jefferson and madison treated you we mean to leave you alone and in no way to interfere with your institution to abide by all and every compromise of the constitution and in a word coming back to the original proposition to treat you so far as degenerate men if we have degenerated may according to the example of those noble fatherswashington jefferson and madison we mean to remember that you are as good as we that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances we mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people or as we claim to have and to treat you accordingly we mean to marry your girls when we have a chancethe white ones i mean and i have the honour to inform you that i once did have a chance in that way  i have told you what we mean to do i want to know now when that thing takes place what do you mean to do i often hear it intimated that you mean to divide the union whenever a republican or anything like it is elected president of the united states a voice that is so that is so one of them says i wonder if he is a kentuckian a voice he is a douglas man well then i want to know what you are going to do with your half of it are you going to split the ohio down through and push your half off a piece or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows or are you going to build up a wall some way between your country and ours by which that movable property of yours cant come over here any more to the danger of your losing it do you think you can better yourselves on that subject by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither  you have divided the union because we would not do right with you as you think upon that subject when we cease to be under obligation to do anything for you how much better off do you think you will be will you make war upon us and kill us all why gentlemen i think you are as gallant and as brave men as live that you can fight as bravely in a good cause man for man as any other people living that you have shown yourselves capable of this upon various occasions but man for man you are not better than we are and there are not so many of you as there are of us you will never make much of a hand at whipping us if we were fewer in numbers than you i think that you could whip us if we were equal it would likely be a drawn battle but being inferior in numbers you will make nothing by attempting to master us  labour is the great source from which nearly all if not all human comforts and necessities are drawn there is a difference in opinion about the elements of labour in society some men assume that there is a necessary connection between capital and labour and that connection draws within it the whole of the labour of the community they assume that nobody works unless capital excites them to work they begin next to consider what is the best way they say there are but two waysone is to hire men and to allure them to labour by their consent the other is to buy the men and drive them to it and that is slavery having assumed that they proceed to discuss the question of whether the labourers themselves are better off in the condition of slaves or of hired labourers and they usually decide that they are better off in the condition of slaves  in the first place i say the whole thing is a mistake that there is a certain relation between capital and labour i admit that it does exist and rightfully exist i think is true that men who are industrious and sober and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a while accumulate capital and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in peace and also if they should choose when they have accumulated it to use it to save themselves from actual labour and hire other people to labour for themis right in doing so they do not wrong the man they employ for they find men who have not their own land to work upon or shops to work in and who are benefited by working for othershired labourers receiving their capital for it thus a few men that own capital hire a few others and these establish the relation of capital and labour rightfullya relation of which i make no complaint but i insist that that relation after all does not embrace more than oneeighth of the labour of the country  there are a plenty of men in the slave states that are altogether good enough for me to be either president or vicepresident provided they will profess their sympathy with our purpose and will place themselves on such ground that our men upon principle can vote for them there are scores of themgood men in their character for intelligence for talent and integrity if such an one will place himself upon the right ground i am for his occupying one place upon the next republican or opposition ticket i will go heartily for him but unless he does so place himself i think it is perfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis that if a union be made the elements will so scatter that there can be no success for such a ticket the good old maxims of the bible are applicable and truly applicable to human affairs and in this as in other things we may say that he who is not for us is against us he who gathereth not with us scattereth i should be glad to have some of the many good and able and noble men of the south place themselves where we can confer upon them the high honour of an election upon one or the other end of our ticket it would do my soul good to do that thing it would enable us to teach them that inasmuch as we select one of their own number to carry out our principles we are free from the charge that we mean more than we say     from a letter to jw fell december 20 1859   i was born february 12 1809 in hardin county kentucky my parents were both born in virginia of undistinguished familiessecond families perhaps i should say my mother who died in my tenth year was of a family of the name of hanks some of whom now reside in adams and others in macon county illinois my paternal grandfather abraham lincoln emigrated from rockingham county virginia to kentucky about 1781 or 1782 where a year or two later he was killed by the indians not in battle but by stealth when he was labouring to open a farm in the forest his ancestors who were quakers went to virginia from berks county pennsylvania an effort to identify them with the new england family of the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of christian names in both families such as enoch levi mordecai solomon abraham and the like  my father at the death of his father was but six years of age and he grew up literally without education he removed from kentucky to what is now spencer county indiana in my eighth year we reached our new home about the time the state came into the union it was a wild region with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods there i grew up there were some schools so called but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond readin writin and cipherin to the rule of three if a straggler supposed to understand latin happened to sojourn in the neighbourhood he was looked upon as a wizard there was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education of course when i came of age i did not know much still somehow i could read write and cipher to the rule of three but that was all i have not been to school since the little advance i now have upon this store of education i have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity  i was raised to farm work which i continued till i was twentytwo at twentyone i came to illinois macon county then i got to new salem at that time in sangamon now in menard county where i remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store  then came the black hawk war and i was elected a captain of volunteers a success which gave me more pleasure than any i have had since i went the campaign was elated ran for the legislature the same year 1832 and was beatenthe only time i ever have been beaten by the people the next and three succeeding biennial elections i was elected to the legislature i was not a candidate afterward during this legislative period i had studied law and removed to springfield to practise it in 1846 i was once elected to the lower house of congress was not a candidate for reelection from 1849 to 1854 both inclusive practised law more assiduously than ever before always a whig in politics and generally on the whig electoral tickets making active canvasses i was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again what i have done since then is pretty well known  if any personal description of me is thought desirable it may be said i am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes no other marks or brands recollected     from an address delivered at cooper institute new york february 27 1860    now and hear let me guard a little against being misunderstood i do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did to do so would be to discard all the lights of current experienceto reject all progress all improvement what i do say is that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case we should do so on evidence so conclusive and argument so clear that even their great authority fairly considered and weighed cannot stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we  if any man at this day sincerely believes that the proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories he is right to say so and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument he can but he has no right to mislead others who have less access to history and less leisure to study it into the false belief that our fathers who framed the government under which we live were of the same opinionthus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument if any man at this day sincerely believes our fathers who framed the government under which we live used and applied principles in other cases which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the constitution forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories he is right to say so but he should at the same time have the responsibility of declaring that in his opinion he understands their principles better than they did themselves and especially should he not shirk the responsibility by asserting that they understood the question just as well and even better than we do now  but enough let all who believe that our fathers who framed the government under which we live understood this question just as well and even better than we do now speak as they spoke and act as they acted upon it this is all republicans ask all republicans desire in relation to slavery as those fathers marked it so let it again be marked as an evil not to be extended but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not grudgingly but fully and fairly maintained for this republicans contend and with this so far as i know or believe they will be content  and now if they would listenas i suppose they will noti would address a few words to the southern people  i would say to them you consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people still when you speak of us republicans you do so only to denounce us as reptiles or at the best as no better than outlaws you will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers but nothing like it to black republicans in all your contentions with one another each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attended to indeed such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisitelicense so to speakamong you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all now can you or not be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us or even to yourselves bring forward your charges and specifications and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify  you say we are sectional we deny it that makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you you produce your proof and what is it why that our party has no existence in your sectiongets no votes in your section the fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue if it does then in case we should without change of principle begin to get votes in your section we should thereby cease to be sectional you cannot escape this conclusion and yet are you willing to abide by it if you are you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional for we shall get votes in your section this very year you will then begin to discover as the truth plainly is that your proof does not touch the issue the fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making and not of ours  and if there be fault in that fact that fault is primarily yours and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice the fault is ours but this brings you to where you ought to have startedto a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle if our principle put in practice would wrong your section for the benefit of ours or for any other object then our principle and we with it are sectional and are justly opposed and denounced as such meet us then on the question of whether our principle put in practice would wrong your section and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said on our side do you accept the challenge no then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it and indorse it again and again upon their official oaths is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moments consideration  some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by washington in his farewell address less than eight years before washington gave that warning he had as president of the united states approved and signed an act of congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory which act embodied the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it he wrote lafayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states  bearing this in mind and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject is that warning a weapon in your hands against us or in our hands against you could washington himself speak would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us who sustain his policy or upon you who repudiate it we respect that warning of washington and we commend it to you together with his example pointing to the right application of it  but you say you are conservativeeminently conservativewhile we are revolutionary destructive or something of the sort  what is conservatism is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried we stick to contend for the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy and insist upon substituting something new  true you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be you are divided on new propositions and plans but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers some of you are for reviving the foreign slavetrade some for a congressional slavecode for the territories some for congress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery within their limits some for maintaining slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gurreat purrinciple that if one man would enslave another no third man should object fantastically called popular sovereignty but never a man among you is in favour of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated  consider then whether your claim for conservatism for yourselves and your charge of destructiveness against us are based on the most clear and stable foundations  again you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was we deny it we admit that it is more prominent but we deny that we made it so it was not we but you who discarded the old policy of the fathers we resisted and still resist your innovation and thence comes the greater prominence of the question would you have that question reduced to its former proportions go back to that old policy what has been will be again under the same conditions if you would have the peace of the old times readopt the precepts and policy of the old times  you charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves we deny it and what is your proof harpers ferry john brown john brown was no republican and you have failed to implicate a single republican in his harpers ferry enterprise if any member of our party is guilty in that matter you know it or you do not know it if you do know it you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact if you do not know it you are inexcusable for asserting it and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof you need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander  some of you admit that no republican designedly aided or encouraged the harpers ferry affair but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results we do not believe it we know we hold no doctrine and make no declaration which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government under which we live you never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair when it occurred some important state elections were near at hand and you were in evident glee with the belief that by charging the blame upon us you could get an advantage of us in those elections the elections came and your expectations were not quite fulfilled every republican man knew that as to himself at least your charge was a slander and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favour republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves or with you about your slaves surely this does not encourage them to revolt true we do in common with our fathers who framed the government under which we live declare our belief that slavery is wrong but the slaves do not hear us declare even this for anything we say or do the slaves would scarcely know there is a republican party i believe they would not in fact generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing in your political contests among yourselves each faction charges the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then to give point to the charge defines black republicanism to simply be insurrection blood and thunder among the slaves  slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the republican party was organized what induced the southampton insurrection twentyeight years ago in which at least three times as many lives were lost as at harpers ferry you can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that southampton was got up by black republicanism in the present state of things in the united states i do not think a general or even a very extensive slave insurrection is possible the indispensable concert of action cannot be attained the slaves have no means of rapid communication nor can incendiary freemen black or white supply it the explosive materials are everywhere in parcels but there neither are nor can be supplied the indispensable connecting trains  much is said by southern people about the affection of slaves for their masters and mistresses and a part of it at least is true a plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals before some one of them to save the life of a favourite master or mistress would divulge it this is the rule and the slave revolution in haiti was not an exception to it but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances the gunpowder plot of british history though not connected with slaves was more in point in that case only about twenty were admitted to the secret and yet one of them in his anxiety to save a friend betrayed the plot to that friend and by consequence averted the calamity occasional poisonings from the kitchen and open or stealthy assassinations in the field and local revolts extending to a score or so will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery but no general insurrection of slaves as i think can happen in this country for a long time whoever much fears or much hopes for such an event will be alike disappointed  in the language of mr jefferson uttered many years ago it is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably and in such slow degrees as that the evil will wear off insensibly and their places be pari passu filled up by free white labourers if on the contrary it is left to force itself on human nature must shudder at the prospect held up  mr jefferson did not mean to say nor do i that the power of emancipation is in the federal government he spoke of virginia and as to the power of emancipation i speak of the slaveholding states only the federal government however as we insist has the power of restraining the extension of the institutionthe power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which is now free from slavery  john browns effort was peculiar it was not a slave insurrection it was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves in which the slaves refused to participate in fact it was so absurd that the slaves with all their ignorance saw plainly enough it could not succeed that affair in its philosophy corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors an enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them he ventures the attempt which ends in little else than his own execution orsinis attempt on louis napoleon and john browns attempt at harpers ferry were in their philosophy precisely the same the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case and on new england in the other does not disprove the sameness of the two things  and how much would it avail you if you could by the use of john brown helpers book and the like break up the republican organization human action can be modified to some extent but human nature cannot be changed there is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation which cast at least a million and a half of votes you cannot destroy that judgment and feelingthat sentimentby breaking up the political organization which rallies around it you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire but if you could how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballotbox into some other channel what would that other channel probably be would the number of john browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation  but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights  that has a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliated if not fully justified were we proposing by the mere force of numbers to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the constitution but we are proposing no such thing  when you make these declarations you have a specific and wellunderstood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the federal territories and to hold them there as property but no such right is specifically written in the constitution that instrument is literally silent about any such right we on the contrary deny that such a right has any existence in the constitution even by implication  your purpose then plainly stated is that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and force the constitution as you please on all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruin in all events  this plainly stated is your language perhaps you will say the supreme court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favour not quite so but waiving the lawyers distinction between dictum and decision the court has decided the question for you in a sort of way the court has substantially said it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories and to hold them there as property when i say the decision was made in a sort of way i mean it was made in a divided court by a bare majority of the judges and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of factthe statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution  an inspection of the constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in it bear in mind the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the constitution but they pledge their veracity that it is distinctly and expressly affirmed theredistinctly that is not mingled with anything else expressly that is in words meaning just that without the aid of any inference and susceptible of no other meaning  if they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication it would be open to others to show that neither the word slave nor slavery is to be found in the constitution nor the word property even in any connection with language alluding to the things slave or slavery and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to he is called a person and wherever his masters legal right in relation to him is alluded to it is spoken of as service or labour which may be dueas a debt payable in service or labour also it would be open to show by contemporaneous history that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery instead of speaking of them was employed on purpose to exclude from the constitution the idea that there could be property in man  to show all this is easy and certain  when this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement and reconsider the conclusion based upon it  and then it is to be remembered that our fathers who framed the government under which we livethe men who made the constitutiondecided this same constitutional question in our favour long ago decided it without division among themselves when making the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made and so far as any evidence is left without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts  under all these circumstances do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action but you will not abide the election of a republican president in that supposed event you say you will destroy the union and then you say the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us that is cool a highwayman holds a pistol to my ear and mutters through his teeth stand and deliver or i shall kill you and then you will be a murderer  to be sure what the robber demanded of memy moneywas my own and i had a clear right to keep it but it was no more my own than my vote is my own and the threat of death to me to extort my money and the threat of destruction to the union to extort my vote can scarcely be distinguished in principle                                       wrong as we think slavery is we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we while our votes will prevent it allow it to spread into the national territories and to overrun us here in these free states if our sense of duty forbids this then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabouredcontrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of dont care on a question about which all true men do care such as union appeals beseeching true union men to yield to disunionists reversing the divine rule and calling not the sinners but the righteous to repentance such as invocations to washington imploring men to unsay what washington said and undo what washington did  neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government nor of dungeons to ourselves let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it     lincolns farewell address at springfield illinois february 11 1861   my friends no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting to this place and the kindness of these people i owe everything here i have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from a young to an old man here my children have been born and one is buried i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington without the assistance of that divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed with that assistance i cannot fail trusting in him who can go with me and remain with you and be everywhere for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commending you as i hope in your prayers you will commend me i bid you an affectionate farewell     a letter to the hon geo ashmun accepting his nomination for the presidency may 23 1860   i accept the nomination tendered me by the convention over which you presided and of which i am formally apprized in the letter of yourself and others acting as a committee of the convention for that purpose  the declaration of principles and sentiments which accompanies your letter meets my approval and it shall be my care not to violate or disregard it in any part  imploring the assistance of divine providence and with due regard to the views and feelings of all who were represented in the convention to the rights of all the states and territories and people of the nation to the inviolability of the constitution and the perpetual union harmony and prosperity of alli am most happy to cooperate for the practical success of the principles declared by the convention       your obliged friend and fellowcitizen        a lincoln     letter to miss grace bedell springfield illinois october 19 1860   my dear little miss your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received i regret the necessity of saying i have no daughter i have three sonsone seventeen one nine and one seven years of age they with their mother constitute my whole family as to the whiskers having never worn any do you not think people would call it a piece of silly affectation if i were to begin it now     from an address to the legislature at indianapolis indiana february 12 1861   fellowcitizens of the state of indiana i am here to thank you much for this magnificent welcome and still more for the generous support given by your state to that political cause which i think is the true and just cause of the whole country and the whole world  solomon says there is a time to keep silence and when men wrangle by the mouth with no certainty that they mean the same thing while using the same word it perhaps were as well if they would keep silence  the words coercion and invasion are much used in these days and often with some temper and hot blood let us make sure if we can that we do not misunderstand the meaning of those who use them let us get exact definitions of these words not from dictionaries but from the men themselves who certainly deprecate the things they would represent by the use of words what then is coercion what is invasion would the marching of an army into south carolina without the consent of her people and with hostile intent towards them be invasion i certainly think it would and it would be coercion also if the south carolinians were forced to submit but if the united states should merely retake and hold its own forts and other property and collect the duties on foreign importations or even withhold the mails from places where they were habitually violated would any or all these things be invasion or coercion do our professed lovers of the union but who spitefully resolve that they will resist coercion and invasion understand that such things as these on the part of the united states would be coercion or invasion of a state if so their idea of means to preserve the object of their affection would seem exceedingly thin and airy if sick the little pills of the homoeopathist would be much too large for them to swallow in their view the union as a family relation would seem to be no regular marriage but a sort of freelove arrangement to be maintained only on passional attraction  by the way in what consists the special sacredness of a state i speak not of the position assigned to a state in the union by the constitution for that by the bond we all recognize that position however a state cannot carry out of the union with it i speak of that assumed primary right of a state to rule all which is less than itself and ruin all which is larger than itself if a state and a county in a given case should be equal in extent of territory and equal in number of inhabitants in what as a matter of principle is the state better than the county would an exchange of names be an exchange of rights upon principle on what rightful principle may a state being not more than onefiftieth part of the nation in soil and population break up the nation and then coerce a proportionally larger subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way what mysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country with its people by merely calling it a state  fellowcitizens i am not asserting anything i am merely asking questions for you to consider and now allow me to bid you farewell     from his address to the legislature at columbus ohio february 13 1861   it is true as has been said by the president of the senate that a very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the american people have called me i am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility i cannot but know what you all know that without a name perhaps without a reason why i should have a name there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the father of his country and so feeling i cannot but turn and look for that support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task i turn then and look to the great american people and to that god who has never forsaken them allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new administration in this i have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence and from others some deprecation i still think i was right  in the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present and without a precedent which could enable me to judge by the past it has seemed fitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country i should have gained a view of the whole field being at liberty to modify and change the course of policy as future events may make a change necessary  i have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety it is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety for there is nothing going wrong it is a consoling circumstance that when we look out there is nothing that really hurts anybody we entertain different views upon political questions but nobody is suffering anything this is a most consoling circumstance and from it we may conclude that all we want is time patience and a reliance on that god who has never forsaken this people     from his remarks at pittsburgh pennsylvania february 15 1861   the condition of the country is an extraordinary one and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety it is my intention to give this subject all the consideration i possibly can before specially deciding in regard to it so that when i do speak it may be as nearly right as possible when i do speak i hope i may say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the constitution contrary to the integrity of the union or which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people or to the peace of the whole country and furthermore when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject i hope i may say nothing to disappoint the people generally throughout the country especially if the expectation has been based upon anything which i have heretofore said   if the great american people only keep their temper on both sides of the line the troubles will come to an end and the question which now distracts the country will be settled just as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted let the people on both sides keep their selfpossession and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore   it is often said that the tariff is the specialty of pennsylvania assuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted the tariff question must be as durable as the government itself it is a question of national housekeeping it is to the government what replenishing the mealtub is to the family evervarying circumstances will require frequent modifications as to the amount needed and the sources of supply so far there is little difference of opinion among the people it is only whether and how far duties on imports shall be adjusted to favour home productions in the home market that controversy begins one party insists that too much protection oppresses one class for the advantage of another while the other party argues that with all its incidents in the long run all classes are benefited in the chicago platform there is a plank upon this subject which should be a general law to the incoming administration we should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason to believe we would when they gave us their votes that plank is as i now read       that while providing revenue for the support of the general      government by duties upon imports sound policy requires such an      adjustment of these imposts as will encourage the development of      the industrial interest of the whole country and we commend that      policy of national exchanges which secures to workingmen liberal      wages to agriculture remunerating prices to mechanics and      manufacturers adequate reward for their skill labour and      enterprise and to the nation commercial prosperity and      independence   my political education strongly inclines me against a very free use of any of the means by the executive to control the legislation of the country as a rule i think it better that congress should originate as well as perfect its measures without external bias i therefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be a member of the next congress to take an enlarged view and post himself thoroughly so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the tariff as shall provide a sufficient revenue and in its other bearings so far as possible be just and equal to all sections of the country and classes of the people     from his speech at trenton to the senate of new jersey february 21 1861    i cannot but remember the place that new jersey holds in our early history in the early revolutionary struggle few of the states among the old thirteen had more of the battlefields of the country within their limits than old new jersey may i be pardoned if upon this occasion i mention that away back in my childhood the earliest days of my being able to read i got hold of a small book such a one as few of the younger members have ever seenweemss life of washington i remember all the accounts there given of the battlefields and struggles for the liberties of the country and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at trenton new jersey the crossing of the river the contest with the hessians the great hardships endured at that timeall fixed themselves upon my memory more than any single revolutionary event and you all know for you have all been boys how those early impressions last longer than any others i recollect thinking then boy even though i was that there must have been something more than common that these men struggled for i am exceedingly anxious that that thingthat something even more than national independence that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world for all time to comei am exceedingly anxious that this union the constitution and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which the struggle was made and i shall be most happy indeed if i shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the almighty and of this his most chosen people for perpetuating the object of that great struggle     address in independence hall philadelphia february 22 1861   i am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing in this place where were collected together the wisdom the patriotism the devotion to principle from which sprang the institutions under which we live  you have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to our distracted country i can say in return sir that all the political sentiments i entertain have been drawn so far as i have been able to draw them from the sentiments which originated in and were given to the world from this hall i have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence  i have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted that declaration i have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence i have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea it was that kept this confederacy so long together it was not the mere matter of separation of the colonies from the motherland but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country but hope to all the world for all future time it was that which gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance this is the sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence  now my friends can this country be saved on that basis if it can i will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if i can help to save it if it cannot be saved upon that principle it will be truly awful but if this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle i was about to say i would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it  now in my view of the present aspect of affairs there is no need of bloodshed and war there is no necessity for it i am not in favour of such a course and i may say in advance that there will be no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the government the government will not use force unless force is used against it  my friends this is wholly an unprepared speech i did not expect to be called on to say a word when i came here i supposed i was merely to do something toward raising a flag i may therefore have said something indiscreet but i have said nothing but what i am willing to live by and if it be the pleasure of almighty god to die by     reply to the mayor of washington dc february 27 1861   mr mayor i thank you and through you the municipal authorities of this city who accompany you for this welcome and as it is the first time in my life since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this country that i have said anything publicly within a region of country where the institution of slavery exists i will take this occasion to say that i think very much of the illfeeling that has existed and still exists between the people in the section from which i came and the people here is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one another i therefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you mr mayor and all the gentlemen present that i have not now and never have had any other than as kindly feelings towards you as to the people of my own section i have not now and never have had any disposition to treat you in any respect otherwise than as my own neighbours i have not now any purpose to withhold from you any of the benefits of the constitution under any circumstances that i would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own neighbours and i hope in a word that when we become better acquaintedand i say it with great confidencewe shall like each other the more i thank you for the kindness of this reception     first inaugural address march 4 1861   fellowcitizens of the united states in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself i appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of his office  i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement  apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them and more than this they placed in the platform for my acceptance and as a law to themselves and to me the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read       resolved that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the      states and especially the right of each state to order and control      its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment      exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the      perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend and we      denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any      state or territory no matter under what pretext as among the      gravest of crimes  i now reiterate these sentiments and in doing so i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property peace and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration i add too that all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the laws can be given will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded for whatever causeas cheerfully to one section as to another  there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labour the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions       no person held to service or labour in one state under the laws      thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or      regulation therein be discharged from such service or labour but      shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or      labour may be due  it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitutionto this provision as much as to any other to the proposition then that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up their oaths are unanimous now if they would make the effort in good temper could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath  there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one if the slave is to be surrendered it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done and should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept  again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizen of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states  i take the official oath today with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced i do suggest that it will be much safer for all both in official and private stations to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional  it is seventytwo years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the government they have conducted it through many perils and generally with great success yet with all this scope of precedent i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty a disruption of the federal union heretofore only menaced is now formidably attempted  i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution and the union will endure for everit being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself  again if the united states be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate itbreak it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it  descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in 1774 it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776 it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in 1778 and finally in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union  but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity  it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances  i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself  in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices  the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favourable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections  that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them to those however who really love the union may i not speak  before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly fromwill you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake  all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied i think not happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolutioncertainly would if such a right were a vital one but such is not our case all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guaranties and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions shall fugitives from labour be surrendered by national or by state authority the constitution does not expressly say may congress prohibit slavery in the territories the constitution does not expressly say must congress protect slavery in the territories the constitution does not expressly say  from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities if the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or the government must cease there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other  if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority for instance why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this  is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession  plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism unanimity is impossible the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement is wholly inadmissible so that rejecting the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left  i do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes  one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended this is the only substantial dispute the fugitiveslave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slavetrade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each this i think cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before the foreign slavetrade now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all by the other  physically speaking we cannot separate we cannot remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this they cannot but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between them is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends suppose you go to war you cannot fight always and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease fighting the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you  this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it i cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended while i make no recommendation of amendments i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself and i should under existing circumstances favour rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse i understand a proposed amendment to the constitutionwhich amendment however i have not seenhas passed congress to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states including that of persons held to service to avoid misconstruction of what i have said i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable  the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states the people themselves can do this also if they choose but the executive as such has nothing to do with it his duty is to administer the present government as it came to his hands and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor  why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people is there any better or equal hope in the world in our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right if the almighty ruler of nations with his eternal truth and justice be on your side of the north or on yours of the south that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people  by the frame of the government under which we live this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals while the people retain their virtue and vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years  my countrymen one and all think calmly and well upon this whole subject nothing valuable can be lost by taking time if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired and on the sensitive point the laws of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power if it would to change either if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute there still is no single good reason for precipitate action intelligence patriotism christianity and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favoured land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty  in your hands my dissatisfied fellowcountrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war the government will not assail you you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it  i am loath to close we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature     address at utica new york february 18 1861   ladies and gentlemen i have no speech to make to you and no time to speak in i appear before you that i may see you and that you may see me and i am willing to admit that so far as the ladies are concerned i have the best of the bargain though i wish it to be understood that i do not make the same acknowledgment concerning the men     from his first message to congress at the special session july 4 1861    it is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of fort sumter was in no sense a matter of selfdefence on the part of the assailants they well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them they knewthey were expressly notifiedthat the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted unless themselves by resisting so much should provoke more they knew that this government desired to keep the garrison in the fort not to assail them but merely to maintain visible possession and thus to preserve the union from actual and immediate dissolutiontrusting as hereinbefore stated to time discussion and the ballotbox for final adjustment and they assailed and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse objectto drive out the visible authority of the federal union and thus force it to immediate dissolution  that this was their object the executive well understood and having said to them in the inaugural address you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors he took pains not only to keep this declaration good but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand it  by the affair at fort sumter with its surrounding circumstances that point was reached then and thereby the assailants of the government began the conflict of arms without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return their fire save only the few in the fort sent to that harbour years before for their own protection and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful in this act discarding all else they have forced upon the country the distinct issue immediate dissolution or blood  and this issue embraces more than the fate of these united states it presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracya government of the people by the same peoplecan or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes it presents the question whether discontented individuals too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case can always upon the pretences made in this case or any other pretences or arbitrarily without any pretence break up their government and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth it forces us to ask is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberties of its own people or too weak to maintain its own existence  so viewing the issue no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation  the call was made and the response of the country was most gratifying surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation   the people of virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make its nest within her bordersand this government has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it and it has the less regret as the loyal citizens have in due form claimed its protection those loyal citizens this government is bound to recognize and protect as being virginia  in the border states so calledin fact the middle statesthere are those who favour a policy which they call armed neutrality that is an arming of those states to prevent the union forces passing one way or the disunion the other over their soil this would be disunion completed figuratively speaking it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separationand yet not quite an impassable one for under the guise of neutrality it would tie the hands of union men and freely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists which it could not do as an open enemy at a stroke it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession except only what proceeds from the external blockade it would do for the disunionists that which of all things they most desirefeed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of their own it recognizes no fidelity to the constitution no obligation to maintain the union and while very many who have favoured it are doubtless loyal citizens it is nevertheless very injurious in effect   the forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so long continued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our national union was probable while this on discovery gave the executive some concern he is now happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the united states are now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers and a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world   it is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this contest a short and decisive one that you place at the control of the government for the work at least four hundred thousand men and 400000000 that number of men is about onetenth of those of proper ages within the regions where apparently all are willing to engage and the sum is less than a twentythird part of the money value owned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole   a right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten times the men and ten times the money the evidences reaching us from the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction and the hand of the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency one of the greatest perplexities of the government is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them in a word the people will save their government if the government itself will do its part only indifferently well  it might seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the present movement at the south be called secession or rebellion the movers however well understand the difference at the beginning they knew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by any name which implies violation of law they knew their people possessed as much of moral sense as much of devotion to law and order and as much pride in and reverence for the history and government of their common country as any other civilized and patriotic people they knew they could make no advancement directly in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments accordingly they commenced by an insidious debauching of the public mind they invented an ingenious sophism which if conceded was followed by perfectly logical steps through all the incidents to the complete destruction of the union the sophism itself is that any state of the union may consistently with the national constitution and therefore lawfully and peacefully withdraw from the union without the consent of the union or of any other state the little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only for just cause themselves to be the sole judges of its justice is too thin to merit any notice  with rebellion thus sugarcoated they have been drugging the public mind of their section for more than thirty years and until at length they have brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the government the day after some assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretence of taking their state out of the union who could have been brought to no such thing the day before  this sophism derives much perhaps the whole of its currency from the assumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining to a stateto each state of our federal union our states have neither more nor less power than that reserved to them in the union by the constitution no one of them ever having been a state out of the union the original ones passed into the union even before they cast off their british colonial dependence and the new ones each came into the union directly from a condition of dependence excepting texas and even texas in its temporary independence was never designated a state the new ones only took the designation of states on coming into the union while that name was first adopted for the old ones in and by the declaration of independence therein the united colonies were declared to be free and independent states but even then the object plainly was not to declare their independence of one another or of the union but directly the contrary as their mutual pledges and their mutual action before at the time and afterward abundantly show the express plighting of faith by each and all of the original thirteen in the articles of confederation two years later that the union shall be perpetual is most conclusive having never been states either in substance or name outside of the union whence this magical omnipotence of staterights asserting a claim of power to lawfully destroy the union itself much is said about the sovereignty of the states but the word is not in the national constitution nor as is believed in any of the state constitutions what is sovereignty in the political sense of the term would it be far wrong to define it a political community without a political superior tested by this no one of our states except texas ever was a sovereignty and even texas gave up the character on coming into the union by which act she acknowledged the constitution of the united states and the laws and treaties of the united states made in pursuance of the constitution to be for her the supreme law of the land the states have their status in the union and they have no other legal status if they break from this they can only do so against law and by revolution the union and not themselves separately procured their independence and their liberty by conquest or purchase the union gave each of them whatever of independence or liberty it has the union is older than any of the states and in fact it created them as states originally some dependent colonies made the union and in turn the union threw off their old dependence for them and made them states such as they are not one of them ever had a state constitution independent of the union of course it is not forgotten that all the new states framed their constitutions before they entered the unionnevertheless dependent upon and preparatory to coming into the union  unquestionably the states have the powers and the rights reserved to them in and by the national constitution but among these surely are not included all conceivable powers however mischievous or destructive but at most such only as were known in the world at the time as governmental powers and certainly a power to destroy the government itself had never been known as a governmentalas a merely administrative power this relative matter of national power and states rights as a principle is no other than the principle of generality and locality whatever concerns the whole world should be confided to the wholeto the general government while whatever concerns only the state should be left exclusively to the state this is all there is of original principle about it what is now combated is the position that secession is consistent with the constitutionis lawful and peaceful it is not contended that there is any express law for it and nothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences  the nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of these states were formed is it just that they shall go off without leave and without refunding the nation paid very large sums in the aggregate i believe nearly a hundred millions to relieve florida of the aboriginal tribes is it just that she shall now be off without consent or without making any return the nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these socalled seceding states in common with the rest is it just that the creditors shall go unpaid or the remaining states pay the whole again if one state may secede so may another and when all shall have seceded none is left to pay the debts is this quite just to the creditors did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money if we now recognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go in peace it is difficult to see what we can do if others choose to go or to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain  the seceders insist that our constitution admits of secession they have assumed to make a national constitution of their own in which of necessity they have either discarded or retained the right of secession as they insist it exists in ours if they have discarded it they thereby admit that on principle it ought not to be in ours if they have retained it by their own construction of ours they show that to be consistent they must secede from one another whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling their debts or effecting any other or selfish or unjust object the principle itself is one of disintegration and upon which no government can stand  if all the states save one should assert the power to drive that one out of the union it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians would at once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon state rights but suppose that precisely the same act instead of being called driving the one out should be called the seceding of the others from that one it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do unless indeed they make the point that the one because it is a minority may rightfully do what the others because they are a majority may not rightfully do  it may be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we enjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole people beyond any example in the world of this we now have a striking and an impressive illustration so large an army as the government has now on foot was never before known without a soldier in it but who has taken his place there of his own free choice but more than this there are many single regiments whose members one and another possess full practical knowledge of all the arts sciences and professions and whatever else whether useful or elegant is known in the world and there is scarcely one from which there could not be selected a president a cabinet a congress and perhaps a court abundantly competent to administer the government itself nor do i say that this is not true also in the army of our late friends now adversaries in this contest but if it is so much the better reason why the government which has conferred such benefits on both them and us should not be broken up whoever in any section proposes to abandon such a government would do well to consider in deference to what principle it is that he does it what better he is likely to get in its stead whether the substitute will give or be intended to give so much of good to the people there are some foreshadowings on this subject our adversaries have adopted some declarations of independence in which unlike the good old one penned by jefferson they omit the words all men are created equal why they have adopted a temporary national constitution in the preamble of which unlike our good old one signed by washington they omit we the people and substitute we the deputies of the sovereign and independent states why why this deliberate pressing out of view the rights of men and the authority of the people  this is essentially a peoples contest on the side of the union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of mento lift artificial weights from all shoulders to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life yielding to partial and temporary departures from necessity this is the leading object of the government for the existence of which we contend  i am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate this it is worthy of note that while in this the governments hour of trial large numbers of those in the army and navy who have been favoured with the offices have resigned and proved false to the hand which had pampered them not one common soldier or common sailor is known to have deserted his flag  our popular government has often been called an experiment two points in it our people have already settledthe successful establishing and the successful administering of it one still remainsits successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it it is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion that ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided there can be no successful appeal back to bullets that there can be no successful appeal except to ballots themselves at succeeding elections such will be a great lesson of peace teaching men that what they cannot take by an election neither can they take by a war teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war     from his message to congress at its regular session december 3 1861   fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives in the midst of unprecedented political troubles we have cause of great gratitude to god for unusual good health and abundant harvests  you will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the times our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs  a disloyal portion of the american people have during the whole year been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the union a nation which endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect abroad and one party if not both is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign intervention nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be injurious and unfortunate to those adopting them  the disloyal citizens of the united states who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected if it were just to suppose as the insurgents have seemed to assume that foreign nations in this case discarding all moral social and treaty obligations would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce including especially the acquisition of cotton those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the union if we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this i am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it  the principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us as already intimated is the embarrassment of commerce those nations however not improbably saw from the first that it was the union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce they can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty and that one strong nation promises a more durable peace and a more extensive valuable and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments                                       it continues to develop that the insurrection is largely if not exclusively a war upon the first principle of popular governmentthe rights of the people conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents as well as in the general tone of the insurgents in those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers except the legislative boldly advocated with laboured arguments to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people  in my present position i could scarcely be justified were i to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism  it is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favour of popular institutions but there is one point with its connections not so hackneyed as most others to which i ask a brief attention it is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with if not above labour in the structure of government it is assumed that labour is available only in connection with capital that nobody labours unless somebody else owning capital somehow by the use of it induces him to labour this assumed it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire labourers and thus induce them to work by their own consent or buy them and drive them to it without their consent having proceeded thus far it is naturally concluded that all labourers are either hired labourers or what we call slaves and further it is assumed that whoever is once a hired labourer is fixed in that condition for life  now there is no such relation between capital and labour as assumed nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired labourer both these assumptions are false and all inferences from them are groundless  labour is prior to and independent of capital capital is only the fruit of labour and could never have existed if labour had not first existed labour is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration capital has its rights which are as worthy of protection as any other rights nor is it denied that there is and probably always will be a relation between labour and capital producing mutual benefits the error is in assuming that the whole labour of the community exists within that relation a few men own capital and that few avoid labour themselves and with their capital hire or buy another few to labour for them a large majority belong to neither classneither work for others nor have others working for them in most of the southern states a majority of the whole people of all colours are neither slaves nor masters while in the northern a majority are neither hirers nor hired men with their familieswives sons and daughterswork for themselves on their farms in their houses and in their shops taking the whole product to themselves and asking no favours of capital on the one hand nor of hired labourers or slaves on the other it is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labour with capitalthat is they labour with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labour for them but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class no principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class  again as has already been said there is not of necessity any such thing as the free hired labourer being fixed to that condition for life many independent men everywhere in these states a few years back in their lives were hired labourers the prudent penniless beginner in the world labours for wages a while saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself then labours on his own account another while and at length hires another new beginner to help him this is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all gives hope to all and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all no men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost     letter to general gb mcclellan washington february 3 1862   my dear sir you and i have distinct and different plans for a movement of the army of the potomacyours to be down the chesapeake up the rappahannock to urbana and across land to the terminus of the railroad on the york river mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest of manassas  if you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions i shall gladly yield my plan to yours  first does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and money than mine  second wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine  third wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine  fourth in fact would it not be less valuable in this that it would break no great line of the enemys communications while mine would  fifth in case of disaster would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine  i have just assisted the secretary of war in framing part of a despatch to you relating to army corps which despatch of course will have reached you long before this will  i wish to say a few words to you privately on this subject i ordered the army corps organization not only on the unanimous opinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and assigned as generals of division but also on the unanimous opinion of every military man i could get an opinion from and every modern military book yourself only excepted of course i did not on my own judgment pretend to understand the subject i now think it indispensable for you to know how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot entirely disregard it is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or two pets and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals i have had no word from sumner heintzelman or keyes the commanders of these corps are of course the three highest officers with you but i am constantly told that you have no consultation or communication with themthat you consult and communicate with nobody but general fitz john porter and perhaps general franklin i do not say these complaints are true or just but at all events it is proper you should know of their existence do the commanders of corps disobey your orders in anything   are you strong enoughare you strong enough even with my helpto set your foot upon the necks of sumner heintzelman and keyes all at once this is a practical and a very serious question for you     lincolns proclamation revoking general hunters order setting the slaves free may 19 1862    general hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized by the government of the united states to make proclamation declaring the slaves of any state free and that the supposed proclamation now in question whether genuine or false is altogether void so far as respects such declaration on the sixth day of march last by a special message i recommended to congress the adoption of a joint resolution to be substantially as followsresolved that the united states ought to cooperate with any state which may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery giving to such state earnest expression to compensate for its inconveniences public and private produced by such change of system  the resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large majorities in both branches of congress and now stands an authentic definite and solemn proposal of the nation to the states and people most immediately interested in the subjectmatter to the people of those states i now earnestly appeal i do not arguei beseech you to make arguments for yourselves you cannot if you would be blind to the signs of the times i beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them ranging if it may be far above personal and partisan politics the proposal makes common cause for a common object casting no reproaches upon any it acts not the pharisee the change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven not rending or wrecking anything will you not embrace it so much good has not been done by one effort in all past time as in the providence of god it is now your high privilege to do may the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it     appeal to the border states in behalf of compensated emancipation july 12 1862   after the adjournment of congress now near i shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several months believing that you of the border states hold more power for good than any other equal number of members i feel it a duty which i cannot justifiably waive to make this appeal to you  i do not speak of emancipation at once but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually room in south america for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another the freed people will not be so reluctant to go  i am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentionedone which threatens division among those who united are none too strong general hunter is an honest man he was and i hope still is my friend i valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be free he proclaimed all men free within certain states and i repudiated the proclamation he expected more good and less harm from the measure than i could believe would follow yet in repudiating it i gave dissatisfaction if not offence to many whose support the country cannot afford to lose and this is not the end of it the pressure in this direction is still upon me and is increasing by conceding what i now ask you can relieve me and much more can relieve the country in this important point  upon these considerations i have again begged your attention to the message of march last before leaving the capitol consider and discuss it among yourselves you are patriots and statesmen and as such i pray you consider this proposition and at the least commend it to the consideration of your states and people as you would perpetuate popular government for the best people in the world i beseech you that you do in no wise omit this our common country is in great peril demanding the loftiest views and boldest action to bring it speedy relief once relieved its form of government is saved to the world its beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated and its happy future fully assured and rendered inconceivably grand  i intend no reproach or complaint when i assure you that in my opinion if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradualemancipation message of last march the war would now be substantially ended and the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of ending it let the states which are in rebellion see definitely and certainly that in no event will the states you represent ever join their proposed confederacy and they cannot much longer maintain the contest but you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own states beat them at elections as you have overwhelmingly done and nothing daunted they still claim you as their own you and i know what the lever of their power is break that lever before their faces and they can shake you no more for ever  most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and i trust you will not now think i improperly touch what is exclusively your own when for the sake of the whole country i ask can you for your states do better than to take the course i urge discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case can you do better in any possible event you prefer that the constitutional relation of the states to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the institution and if this were done my whole duty in this respect under the constitution and my oath of office would be performed but it is not done and we are trying to accomplish it by war the incidents of the war cannot be avoided if the war continues long as it must if the object be not sooner attained the institution in your states will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasionby the mere incidents of the war it will be gone and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it much of its value is gone already how much better for you and for your people to take the step which at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event how much better to thus save the money which else we sink for ever in the war how much better to do it while we can lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it how much better for you as seller and the nation as buyer to sell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been than to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one anothers throats     from a letter to cuthbert bullitt july 28 1862   now i think the true remedy is very different from that suggested by mr durant it does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war but in removing the necessity for the war the people of louisiana who wish protection to person and property have but to reach forth their hands and take it let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority and set up a state government conforming thereto under the constitution they know how to do it and can have the protection of the army while doing it the army will be withdrawn as soon as such government can dispense with its presence and the people of the state can then upon the old constitutional terms govern themselves to their own liking this is very simple and easy  if they will not do this if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the government it is for them to consider whether it is probable that i will surrender the government to save them from losing all if they decline what i suggest you will scarcely need to ask what i will do  what would you do in my position would you drop the war where it is or would you prosecute it in future with elderstalk squirts charged with rosewater would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones would you give up the contest leaving any available means untried  i am in no boastful mood i shall not do more than i can but i shall do all i can to save the government which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination i shall do nothing in malice what i deal with is too vast for malicious dealing     letter to august belmont july 31 1862   dear sir you send to mr w an extract from a letter written at new orleans the 9th instant which is shown to me you do not give the writers name but plainly he is a man of ability and probably of some note he says the time has arrived when mr lincoln must take a decisive course trying to please everybody he will satisfy nobody a vacillating policy in matters of importance is the very worst now is the time if ever for honest men who love their country to rally to its support why will not the north say officially that it wishes for the restoration of the union as it was  and so it seems this is the point on which the writer thinks i have no policy why will he not read and understand what i have said  the substance of the very declaration he desires is in the inaugural in each of the two regular messages to congress and in many if not all the minor documents issued by the executive since the inauguration  broken eggs cannot be mended but louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the union as it was barring the already broken eggs the sooner she does so the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending this government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all and its enemies stake nothing those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government and if they fail still come back into the union unhurt if they expect in any contingency to ever have the union as it was i join with the writer in saying now is the time  how much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this under the protection of the army at new orleans than to have sat down in a closet writing complaining letters northward     his letter to horace greeley august 22 1862   i have just read yours of the 19th instant addressed to myself through the new york tribune  if there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which i may know to be erroneous i do not now and here controvert them  if there be in it any inferences which i may believe to be falsely drawn i do not now and here argue against them  if there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone i waive it in deference to an old friend whose heart i have always supposed to be right  as to the policy i seem to be pursuing as you say i have not meant to leave any one in doubt i would save the union i would save it in the shortest way under the constitution  the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will bethe union as it was  if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them  if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery i do not agree with them  my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and not either to save or to destroy slavery  if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that  what i do about slavery and the coloured race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union  i shall do less whenever i shall believe that what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause  i shall try to correct errors where shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views as fast as they shall appear to be true views  i have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty and i intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free     from his reply to the chicago committee of united religious denominations september 13 1862   the subject presented in the memorial is one upon which i have thought much for weeks past and i may even say for months i am approached with the most opposite opinions and advice and that by religious men who are equally certain that they represent the divine will i am sure that either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief and perhaps in some respects both i hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that god would reveal his will to others on a point so connected with my duty it might be supposed that he would reveal it directly to me for unless i am more deceived in myself than i often am it is my earnest desire to know the will of providence in this matter and if i can learn what it is i will do it these are not however the days of miracles and i suppose it will be granted that i am not to expect a direct revelation i must study the plain physical facts of the case ascertain what is possible and learn what appears to be wise and right  the subject is difficult and good men do not agree for instance four gentlemen of standing and intelligence from new york called as a delegation on business connected with the war but before leaving two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general emancipation upon which the other two at once attacked them you also know that the last session of congress had a decided majority of antislavery men yet they could not unite on this policy and the same is true of the religious people  why the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness i fear than our own troops and expecting god to favour their side for one of our soldiers who had been taken prisoner told senator wilson a few days since that he met nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers but we will talk over the merits of the case  what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do especially as we are now situated i do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative like the popes bull against the comet would my word free the slaves when i cannot even enforce the constitution in the rebel states is there a single court or magistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there  and what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of congress which i approved and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines yet i cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to us and suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us what should we do with them how can we feed and care for such a multitude general butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command they eat and that is all though it is true general butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand for it nearly amounts to a famine there if now the pressure of the war should call off our forces from new orleans to defend some other point what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again for i am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners free or slave they immediately auction them off they did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the tennessee river a few days ago and then i am very ungenerously attacked for it for instance when after the late battles at and near bull run an expedition went out from washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help and sent them into slavery horace greeley said in his paper that the government would probably do nothing about it what could i do  now then tell me if you please what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire understand i raise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds for as commanderinchief of the army and navy in time of war i suppose i have a right to take any measures which may best subdue the enemy nor do i urge objections of a moral nature in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the south i view this matter as a practical warmeasure to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion  the committee had said that emancipation would secure us the sympathy of the world slavery being the cause of the war to which the president replied  i admit that slavery is at the root of the rebellion or at least its sine qua non the ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act but they would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument i will also concede that emancipation would help us in europe and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition i grant further that it would help somewhat at the north though not so much i fear as you and those you represent imagine still some additional strength would be added in that way to the warand then unquestionably it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their labourers which is of great importance but i am not so sure that we could do much with the blacks if we were to arm them i fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels and indeed thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops i will mention another thing though it meet only your scorn and contempt there are fifty thousand bayonets in the union armies from the border slave states it would be a serious matter if in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire they should go over to the rebels i do not think they all wouldnot so many indeed as a year ago nor as six months ago not so many today as yesterday every day increases their union feeling they are also getting their pride enlisted and want to beat the rebels let me say one thing more i think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people in the fact that constitutional government is at stake this is a fundamental idea going down about as deep as anything  do not misunderstand me because i have mentioned these objections they indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire i have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves but hold the matter under advisement and i can assure you that the subject is on my mind by day and night more than any other whatever shall appear to be gods will i will do i trust that in the freedom with which i have canvassed your views i have not in any respect injured your feelings      from the annual message to congress december 1 1862   since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed and while it has not pleased the almighty to bless us with a return of peace we can but press on guided by the best light he gives us trusting that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well  the correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted in virtual compliance with a request to that effect made by the house of representatives near the close of the last session of congress  if the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended in the month of june last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties so unwisely and unnecessarily as we think recognized the insurgents as a belligerent would soon recede from that position which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country but the temporary reverses which afterward befell the national arms and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice  the civil war which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the american people has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century it has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world in this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states and between parties or factions in such states we have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution but we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs our struggle has been of course contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves nevertheless complaint on the part of this government even if it were just would certainly be unwise  there is no line straight or crooked suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide trace through from east to west upon the line between the free and the slave country and we shall find a little more than onethird of its length are rivers easy to be crossed and populated or soon to be populated thickly upon both sides while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors lines over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence no part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary the fact of separation if it comes gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitiveslave clause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from while i should expect no treaty stipulation would be ever made to take its place  but there is another difficulty the great interior region bounded east by the alleghanies north by the british dominions west by the rocky mountains and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets  already has above ten millions of people and will have fifty millions within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake it contains more than onethird of the country owned by the united statescertainly more than one million of square miles once half as populous as massachusetts already is and it would have more than seventyfive millions of people a glance at the map shows that territorially speaking it is the great body of the republic the other parts are but marginal borders to it the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources in the production of provisions grains grasses and all which proceed from them this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented and yet this region has no seacoast touches no ocean anywhere as part of one nation its people now find and may for ever find their way to europe by new york to south america and africa by new orleans and to asia by san francisco but separate our common country into two nations as designed by the present rebellion and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from one or more of these outletsnot perhaps by a physical barrier but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations  and this is true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed place it between the now free and slave country or place it south of kentucky or north of ohio and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them these outlets east west and south are indispensable to the wellbeing of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region which of the three may be the best is no proper question all are better than either and all of right belong to that people and their successors for ever true to themselves they will not ask where a line of separation shall be but will vow rather that there shall be no such line nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world they too and each of them must have access to this egypt of the west without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary  our national strife springs not from our permanent part not from the land we inhabit not from our national homestead there is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us in all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation in fact it would ere long force reunion however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost  fellowcitizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honour or dishonour to the latest generation we say we are for the union the world will not forget that we say this we know how to save the union the world knows we do know how to save it  we even we here hold the power and bear the responsibility in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the freehonourable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth other means may succeed this could not fail the way is plain peaceful generous justa way which if followed the world will for ever applaud and god must for ever bless     emancipation proclamation january 1 1863   whereas on the twentysecond day of september in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtytwo a proclamation was issued by the president of the united states containing among other things the following to wit  that on the first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and for ever free and the executive government of the united states including the military and naval authority thereof will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons or any of them in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom  that the executive will on the first day of january aforesaid by proclamation designate the states and parts of states if any in which the people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion against the united states and the fact that any state or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the congress of the united states by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such state shall have participated shall in the absence of strong countervailing testimony be deemed conclusive evidence that such state and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the united states  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states by virtue of the power in me vested as commanderinchief of the army and navy of the united states in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the united states and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion do on this first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree and in accordance with my purpose so to do publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days from the day first above mentioned order and designate as the states and parts of states wherein the people thereof respectively are this day in rebellion against the united states the following to wit  arkansas texas louisiana except the parishes of st bernard plaquemines

general grant july 13 1863   my dear general i do not remember that you and i ever met personally i write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you have done the country i wish to say a word further when you first reached the vicinity of vicksburg i thought you should do what you finally didmarch the troops across the neck run the batteries with the transports and thus go below and i never had any faith except a general hope that you knew better than i that the yazoo pass expedition and the like could succeed when you got below and took port gibson grand gulf and vicinity i thought you should go down the river and join general banks and when you turned northward east of the big black i feared it was a mistake i now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right and i was wrong       yours very truly        a lincoln     letter to  moulton washington july 31 1863  my dear sir there has been a good deal of complaint against you by your superior officers of the provostmarshalgenerals department and your removal has been strongly urged on the ground of persistent disobedience of orders and neglect of duty firmly convinced as i am of the patriotism of your motives i am unwilling to do anything in your case which may seem unnecessarily harsh or at variance with the feelings of personal respect and esteem with which i have always regarded you i consider your services in your district valuable and should be sorry to lose them it is unnecessary for me to state however that when differences of opinion arise between officers of the government the ranking officer must be obeyed you of course recognize as clearly as i do the importance of this rule i hope you will conclude to go on in your present position under the regulations of the department i wish you would write to me     letter to mrs lincoln washington august 8 1863   my dear wife all as well as usual and no particular trouble anyway i put the money into the treasury at five per cent with the privilege of withdrawing it any time upon thirty days notice i suppose you are glad to learn this tell dear tad poor nanny goat is lost and mrs cuthbert and i are in distress about it the day you left nanny was found resting herself and chewing her little cud on the middle of tads bed but now shes gone the gardener kept complaining that she destroyed the flowers till it was concluded to bring her down to the white house this was done and the second day she had disappeared and has not been heard of since this is the last we know of poor nanny     letter to james h hackett washington august 17 1863   my dear sir months ago i should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind note and i now have to beg your pardon for not having done so  for one of my age i have seen very little of the drama the first presentation of falstaff i ever saw was yours here last winter or spring perhaps the best compliment i can pay is to say as i truly can i am very anxious to see it again some of shakespeares plays i have never read while others i have gone over perhaps as frequently as any unprofessional reader among the latter are lear richard iii henry viii hamlet and especially macbeth i think nothing equals macbeth it is wonderful  unlike you gentlemen of the profession i think the soliloquy in hamlet commencing oh my offence is rank surpasses that commencing to be or not to be but pardon this small attempt at criticism i should like to hear you pronounce the opening speech of richard iii will you not soon visit washington again if you do please call and let me make your personal acquaintance     note to secretary stanton washington november 11 1863   dear sir i personally wish jacob freese of new jersey to be appointed colonel of a coloured regiment and this regardless of whether he can tell the exact shade of julius cÃ¦sars hair     the letter to james c conkling august 26 1863   your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional union men to be held at the capital of illinois on the third day of september has been received it would be very agreeable to me to thus meet my old friends at my own home but i cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require  the meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the union and i am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering as i do the nations gratitude to those and other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nations life  there are those who are dissatisfied with me to such i would say you desire peace and you blame me that we do not have it but how can we attain it there are but three conceivable ways first to suppress the rebellion by force of arms this i am trying to do are you for it if you are so far we are agreed if you are not for it a second way is to give up the union i am against this are you for it if you are you should say so plainly if you are not for force nor yet for dissolution there only remains some imaginable compromise i do not believe any compromise embracing the maintenance of the union is now possible all i learn leads to a directly opposite belief the strength of the rebellion is its military its army that army dominates all the country and all the people within its range any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range in opposition to that army is simply nothing for the present because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise if one were made with them  to illustrate suppose refugees from the south and peace men of the north get together in convention and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the union in what way can that compromise be used to keep lees army out of pennsylvania meades army can keep lees out of pennsylvania and i think can ultimately drive it out of existence but no paper compromise to which the controllers of lees army are not agreed can at all affect that army in an effort at such compromise we should waste time which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage and that would be all a compromise to be effective must be made either with those who control the rebel army or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army now allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army or from any of the men controlling it in relation to any peace compromise has ever come to my knowledge or belief all charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless and i promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you i freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people according to the bond of servicethe united states constitutionand that as such i am responsible to them  but to be plain you are dissatisfied with me about the negro quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject i certainly wish that all men could be free while i suppose you do not yet i have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your views provided you are for the union i suggested compensated emancipation to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes but i had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the union exclusively by other means  you dislike the emancipation proclamation and perhaps would have it retracted you say it is unconstitutional i think differently i think the constitution invests its commanderinchief with the law of war in time of war the most that can be saidif so muchis that slaves are property is there has there ever been any question that by the law of war property both of enemies and friends may be taken when needed and is it not needed whenever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy armies the world over destroy enemies property when they cannot use it and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and noncombatants male and female  but the proclamation as law either is valid or is not valid if it is not valid it needs no retraction if it is valid it cannot be retracted any more than the dead can be brought to life some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favourably for the union why better after the retraction than before the issue there was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance the war has certainly progressed as favourably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before i know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes believe the emancipation policy and the use of coloured troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion and that at least one of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism or with republican party politics but who hold them purely as military opinions i submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith  you say you will not fight to free negroes some of them seem willing to fight for you but no matter fight you then exclusively to save the union i issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the union if i shall urge you to continue fighting it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes  i thought that in your struggle for the union to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you do you think differently i thought that whatever negroes could be got to do as soldiers leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the union does it appear otherwise to you but negroes like other people act upon motives why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them if they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive even the promise of freedom and the promise being made must be kept  the signs look better the father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea thanks to the great northwest for it nor yet wholly to them three hundred miles up they met new england empire keystone and jersey hewing their way right and left the sunny south too in more colours than one also lent a hand on the spot their part of the history was jotted down in black and white the job was a great national one and let none be banned who bore an honourable part in it and while those who cleared the great river may well be proud even that is not all it is hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at antietam murfreesboro gettysburg and on many fields of lesser note nor must uncle sams webfeet be forgotten at all the watery margins they have been present not only on the deep sea the broad bay and the rapid river but also up the narrow muddy bayou and wherever the ground was a little damp they have been and made their tracks thanks to allfor the great republic for the principle it lives by and keeps alive for mans vast futurethanks to all  peace does not appear so distant as it did i hope it will come soon and come to stay and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time it will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost and then there will be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue and clenched teeth and steady eye and wellpoised bayonet they have helped mankind on to this great consummation while i fear there will be some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they strove to hinder it  still let us not be oversanguine of a speedy final triumph let us be quite sober let us diligently apply the means never doubting that a just god in his own good time will give us the rightful result     his proclamation for a day of thanksgiving october 3 1863   the year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies to these bounties which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the everwatchful providence of almighty god  in the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and provoke their aggressions peace has been preserved with all nations order has been maintained the laws have been respected and obeyed and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the union  needful diversions of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence have not arrested the plough the shuttle or the ship the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements and the mines as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore population has steadily increased notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp the siege and the battlefield and the country rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigour is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom  no human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things they are the gracious gifts of the most high god who while dealing with us in anger for our sins hath nevertheless remembered mercy  it has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole american people i do therefore invite my fellowcitizens in every part of the united states and also those who are at sea and those sojourning in foreign lands to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens and i recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience commend to his tender care all those who have become widows orphans mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged and fervently implore the interposition of the almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace harmony tranquillity and union     address at the dedication of the national cemetery at gettysburg november 19 1863   fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal  now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final restingplace for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this  but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honoured dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth     from the annual message to congress december 8 1863    when congress assembled a year ago the war had already lasted nearly twenty months and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea with varying results the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits yet the tone of public feeling and opinion at home and abroad was not satisfactory with other signs the popular elections then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves while amid much that was cold and menacing the kindest words coming from europe were uttered in accents of pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause our commerce was suffering greatly from a few vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the seas and raise our blockade we had failed to elicit from european governments anything hopeful upon this subject the preliminary emancipation proclamation issued in september was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year a month later the final proclamation came including the announcement that coloured men of suitable condition would be received into the war service the policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict according to our political system as a matter of civil administration the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any state and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure it was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be presented it came and as was anticipated was followed by dark and doubtful days eleven months having now passed we are permitted to take another review the rebel borders are pressed still farther back and by the complete opening of the mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts with no practical communication between them tennessee and arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control and influential citizens in each owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion now declare openly for emancipation in their respective states of those states not included in the emancipation proclamation maryland and missouri neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits  of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full one hundred thousand are now in the united states military service about onehalf of which number actually bear arms in the ranks thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labour from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men so far as tested it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any no servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks these measures have been much discussed in foreign countries and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved at home the same measures have been fully discussed supported criticized and denounced and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial thus we have the new reckoning the crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the union is passed     letter to secretary stanton washington march 1 1864   my dear sir a poor widow by the name of baird has a son in the army that for some offence has been sentenced to serve a long time without pay or at most with very little pay i do not like this punishment of withholding payit falls so very hard upon poor families after he had been serving in this way for several months at the tearful appeal of the poor mother i made a direction that he be allowed to enlist for a new term on the same condition as others she now comes and says she cannot get it acted upon please do it     letter to governor michael hahn washington march 13 1864   my dear sir i congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the first freestate governor of louisiana now you are about to have a convention which among other things will probably define the elective franchise i barely suggest for your private consideration whether some of the coloured people may not be let inas for instance the very intelligent and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks they would probably help in some trying time to come to keep the jewel of liberty within the family of freedom but this is only a suggestion not to the public but to you alone     an address at a fair for the sanitary commission march 18 1864   i appear to say but a word this extraordinary war in which we are engaged falls heavily upon all classes of people but the most heavily upon the soldier for it has been said all that a man hath will he give for his life and while all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his life at stake and often yields it up in his countrys cause the highest merit then is due to the soldier  in this extraordinary war extraordinary developments have manifested themselves such as have not been seen in former wars and amongst these manifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of suffering soldiers and their families and the chief agents in these fairs are the women of america  i am not accustomed to the language of eulogy i have never studied the art of paying compliments to women but i must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of america it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war i will close by saying god bless the women of america     letter to ag hodges of kentucky april 4 1864   i am naturally antislavery if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong i cannot remember when i did not so think and feel and yet i have never understood that the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling it was in the oath that i took that i would to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states i could not take office without taking the oath nor was it my view that i might take an oath to get power and break the oath in using the power i understood too that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery i had publicly declared this many times and in many ways and i aver that to this day i have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract feeling and judgment on slavery i did understand however that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every indispensable means that governmentthat nationof which that constitution was the organic law was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life but a life is never wisely given to save a limb i felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation right or wrong i assumed this ground and now avow it i could not feel that to the best of my ability i had even tried to preserve the constitution if to save slavery or any minor matter i should permit the wreck of government country and constitution all together when early in the war general fremont attempted military emancipation i forbade it because i did not then think it an indispensable necessity when a little later general cameron then secretary of war suggested the arming of the blacks i objected because i did not think it an indispensable necessity when still later general hunter attempted military emancipation i again forbade it because i did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come when in march and may and july 1862 i made earnest and successive appeals to the border states to favour compensated emancipation i believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks would come unless averted by that measure they declined the proposition and i was in my best judgment driven to the alternative of either surrendering the union and with it the constitution or laying strong hand upon the coloured element i chose the latter in choosing it i hoped for greater gain than loss but of this i was not entirely confident more than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations none in our home popular sentiment none in our white military forceno loss by it anyhow or anywhere on the contrary it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers seamen and labourers these are palpable facts about which as facts there can be no cavilling we have the men and we could not have had them without the measure  and now let any union man who complains of the measure test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms and in the next that he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men from the union side and placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns if he cannot face his case so stated it is only because he cannot face the truth  i add a word which was not in the verbal conversation in telling this tale i attempt no compliment to my own sagacity i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected god alone can claim it whither it is tending seems plain if god now wills the removal of a great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god     from an address at a sanitary fair in baltimore april 18 1864    the world has never had a good definition of the word liberty and the american people just now are much in want of one we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing with some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labour while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labour here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same nameliberty and it follows that each of the things is by the respective parties called by two different and incompatible namesliberty and tyranny  the shepherd drives the wolf from the sheeps throat for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty especially as the sheep was a black one plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty and precisely the same difference prevails today among us human creatures even in the north and all professing to love liberty hence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty recently as it seems the people of maryland have been doing something to define liberty and thanks to them that in what they have done the wolfs dictionary has been repudiated     letter to general grant april 30 1864   not expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens i wish to express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this time so far as i understand it the particulars of your plans i neither know nor seek to know you are vigilant and selfreliant and pleased with this i wish not to obtrude any constraints nor restraints upon you while i am very anxious that any great disaster or capture of our men in great numbers shall be avoided i know these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine if there is anything wanting which is within my power to give do not fail to let me know it and now with a brave army and a just cause may god sustain you     from an address to the 166th ohio regiment august 22 1864   i almost always feel inclined when i happen to say anything to soldiers to impress upon them in a few brief remarks the importance of success in this contest it is not merely for today but for all time to come that we should perpetuate for our childrens children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives i beg you to remember this not merely for my sake but for yours i happen temporarily to occupy this white house i am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my fathers child has it is in order that each one of you may have through this free government which we have enjoyed an open field and a fair chance for your industry enterprise and intelligence that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life with all its desirable human aspirations it is for this the struggle should be maintained that we may not lose our birthrightnot only for one but for two or three years the nation is worth fighting for to secure such an inestimable jewel     reply to a serenade november 10 1864   it has long been a grave question whether any government not too strong for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies on this point the present rebellion brought our republic to a severe test and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion added not a little to the strain  if the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves but the election was a necessity we cannot have free government without elections and if the rebellion could force us to forego or postpone a national election it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us the strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case what has occurred in this case must ever occur in similar cases human nature will not change in any future great national trial compared with the men of this we shall have as weak and as strong as silly and as wise as bad and as good let us therefore study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be revenged but the election along with its incidental and undesirable strife has done good too it has demonstrated that a peoples government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war gold is good in its place but living brave patriotic men are better than gold  but the rebellion continues and now that the election is over may not all having a common interest reunite in a common effort to save our common country for my own part i have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way so long as i have been here i have not willingly planted a thorn in any mans bosom while i am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a reelection and duly grateful as i trust to almighty god for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion as i think for their own good it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the result  may i ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have and now let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen and their gallant and skilful commanders     a letter to mrs bixley of boston november 21 1864   dear madam i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutantgeneral of massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom       yours very sincerely and respectfully        abraham lincoln     letter to general grant washington january 19 1865   please read and answer this letter as though i was not president but only a friend my son now in his twentysecond year having graduated at harvard wishes to see something of the war before it ends i do not wish to put him in the ranks nor yet to give him a commission to which those who have already served long are better entitled and better qualified to hold could he without embarrassment to you or detriment to the service go into your military family with some nominal rank i and not the public furnishing his necessary means if no say so without the least hesitation because i am as anxious and as deeply interested that you shall not be encumbered as you can be yourself     the second inaugural address march 4 1865   fellowcountrymen at this second appearance to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper now at the expiration of four years during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation little that is new could be presented the progress of our arms upon which all else chiefly depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is i trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all with high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it is ventured  on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war all dreaded itall sought to avert it while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place devoted altogether to saving the union without war insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without warseeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came  oneeighth of the whole population were coloured slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it  with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the rightlet us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations     a letter to thurlow weed executive mansion washington march 15 1865   dear mr weed every one likes a compliment thank you for yours on my little notification speech and on the recent inaugural address i expect the latter to wear as well asperhaps better thananything i have produced but i believe it is not immediately popular men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the almighty and them to deny it however in this case is to deny that there is a god governing the world it is a truth which i thought needed to be told and as whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most directly on myself i thought others might afford for me to tell it       truly yours        a lincoln     from an address to an indiana regiment march 17 1865   there are but few aspects of this great war on which i have not already expressed my views by speaking or writing there is onethe recent effort of our erring brethren sometimes so called to employ the slaves in their armies the great question with them has been will the negro fight for them they ought to know better than we and doubtless do know better than we i may incidentally remark that having in my life heard many argumentsor strings of words meant to pass for argumentsintended to show that the negro ought to be a slaveif he shall now really fight to keep himself a slave it will be a far better argument why he should remain a slave than i have ever before heard he perhaps ought to be a slave if he desires it ardently enough to fight for it or if one out of four will for his own freedom fight to keep the other three in slavery he ought to be a slave for his selfish meanness i have always thought that all men should be free but if any should be slaves it should be first those who desire it for themselves and secondly those who desire it for others whenever i hear any one arguing for slavery i feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally     from his reply to a serenade lincolns last public address april 11 1865   fellowcitizens we meet this evening not in sorrow but in gladness of heart the evacuation of richmond and petersburg and the surrender of the principal insurgent army give the hope of a just and speedy peace the joyous expression of which cannot be restrained in all this joy however he from whom all blessings flow must not be forgotten a call for a national thanksgiving is in the course of preparation and will be duly promulgated nor must those whose harder part give us the cause for rejoicing be overlooked their honours must not be parcelled out with others i myself was near the front and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you but no part of the honour for plan or execution is mine to general grant his skilful officers and brave men all belongs the gallant navy stood ready but was not in reach to take an active part  by these recent successes the reinauguration of the national authorityreconstructionwhich has had a large share of thought from the first is pressed much more closely upon our attention it is fraught with great difficulty unlike a case of war between independent nations there is no organized organ for us to treat withno one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man we simply must begin with and mould from disorganized and discordant elements nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we the loyal people differ among ourselves as to the mode manner and measure of reconstruction as a general rule i abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself wishing not to be provoked by that to which i cannot properly offer an answer in spite of this precaution however it comes to my knowledge that i am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new state government of louisiana  in this i have done just so much as and no more than the public knows in the annual message of december 1863 and in the accompanying proclamation i presented a plan of reconstruction as the phrase goes which i promised if adopted by any state should be acceptable to and sustained by the executive government of the nation i distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which might possibly be acceptable and i also distinctly protested that the executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in congress from such states this plan was in advance submitted to the then cabinet and approved by every member of it  when the message of 1863 with the plan before mentioned reached new orleans general banks wrote me that he was confident that the people with his military cooperation would reconstruct substantially on that plan i wrote him and some of them to try it they tried it and the result is known such has been my only agency in getting up the louisiana government as to sustaining it my promise is out as before stated but as bad promises are better broken than kept i shall treat this as a bad promise and break it whenever i shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest but i have not yet been so convinced i have been shown a letter on this subject supposed to be an able one in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded states so called are in the union or out of it it would perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that since i have found professed union men endeavouring to answer that question i have purposely forborne any public expression upon it  we all agree that the seceded states so called are out of their proper practical relation with the union and that the sole object of the government civil and military in regard to those states is to again get them into that proper practical relation i believe that it is not only possible but in fact easier to do this without deciding or even considering whether these states have ever been out of the union than with it finding themselves safely at home it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these states and the union and each for ever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the states from without into the union or only gave them proper assistance they never having been out of it the amount of constituency so to speak on which the new louisiana government rests would be more satisfactory to all if it contained forty thousand or thirty thousand or even twenty thousand instead of only about twelve thousand as it does it is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the coloured man i would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers  still the question is not whether the louisiana government as it stands is quite all that is desirable the question is will it be wiser to take it as it is and help to improve it or to reject and disperse it can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave state of louisiana have sworn allegiance to the union assumed to be the rightful political power of the state held elections organized a state government adopted a freestate constitution giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white and empowering the legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the coloured man their legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by congress abolishing slavery throughout the nation these twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the union and to perpetual freedom in the statecommitted to the very things and nearly all the things the nation wantsand they ask the nations recognition and its assistance to make good their committal  if we reject and spurn them we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them we in effect say to the white man you are worthless or worse we will neither help you nor be helped by you to the blacks we say this cup of liberty which these your old masters hold to your lips we will dash from you and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when where and how if this course discouraging and paralyzing both white and black has any tendency to bring louisiana into proper practical relations with the union i have so far been unable to perceive it if on the contrary we recognize and sustain the new government of louisiana the converse of all this is made true we encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work and argue for it and proselyte for it and fight for it and feed it and grow it and ripen it to a complete success the coloured man too in seeing all united for him is inspired with vigilance and energy and daring to the same end grant that he desires the elective franchise will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it than by running backward over them   i repeat the question can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government   what has been said of louisiana will apply generally to other states and yet so great peculiarities pertain to each state and such important and sudden changes occur in the same state and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement important principles may and must be inflexible in the present situation as the phrase goes it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the south i am considering and shall not fail to act when satisfied that action will be proper     appendix     anecdotes   lincolns entry into richmond the day after it was taken  as described at that time by a writer in the atlantic monthly  they gathered around the president ran ahead hovered about the flanks of the little company and hung like a dark cloud upon the rear men women and children joined the constantlyincreasing throng they came from all the bystreets running in breathless haste shouting and hallooing and dancing with delight the men threw up their hats the women waved their bonnets and handkerchiefs clapped their hands and sang glory to god glory glory rendering all the praise to god who had heard their wailings in the past their moanings for wives husbands children and friends sold out of their sight had given them freedom and after long years of waiting had permitted them thus unexpectedly to behold the face of their great benefactor  i thank you dear jesus that i behold president linkum was the exclamation of a woman who stood upon the threshold of her humble home and with streaming eyes and clasped hands gave thanks aloud to the saviour of men  another more demonstrative in her joy was jumping and striking her hands with all her might crying bless de lord bless de lord bless de lord as if there could be no end to her thanksgiving  the air rang with a tumultuous chorus of voices the street became almost impassable on account of the increasing multitude till soldiers were summoned to clear the way  the walk was long and the president halted a moment to rest may de good lord bless you president linkum said an old negro removing his hat and bowing with tears of joy rolling down his cheeks the president removed his own hat and bowed in silence but it was a bow which upset the forms laws customs and ceremonies of centuries it was a deathshock to chivalry and a mortal wound to caste recognize a nigger fough a woman in an adjoining house beheld it and turned from the scene in unspeakable disgust        the following nine anecdotes were related by frank b carpenter      the painter who while executing his picture of the first reading      in cabinet council of the emancipation proclamation had the      freedom of mr lincolns private office and saw much of the      president while he posed and whose relations with him became of an      intimate character   you dont wear hoopsand i will  pardon your brother  a distinguished citizen of ohio had an appointment with the president one evening at six oclock as he entered the vestibule of the white house his attention was attracted by a poorlyclad young woman who was violently sobbing he asked her the cause of her distress she said she had been ordered away by the servants after vainly waiting many hours to see the president about her only brother who had been condemned to death her story was thisshe and her brother were foreigners and orphans they had been in this country several years her brother enlisted in the army but through bad influences was induced to desert he was captured tried and sentenced to be shotthe old story the poor girl had obtained the signatures of some persons who had formerly known him to a petition for a pardon and alone had come to washington to lay the case before the president thronged as the waitingrooms always were she had passed the long hours of two days trying in vain to get an audience and had at length been ordered away  the gentlemans feelings were touched he said to her that he had come to see the president but did not know as he should succeed he told her however to follow him upstairs and he would see what could be done for her just before reaching the door mr lincoln came out and meeting his friend said goodhumouredly are you not ahead of time the gentleman showed him his watch with the hand upon the hour of six well returned mr lincoln i have been so busy today that i have not had time to get a lunch go in and sit down i will be back directly  the gentleman made the young woman accompany him into the office and when they were seated said to her now my good girl i want you to muster all the courage you have in the world when the president comes back he will sit down in that armchair i shall get up to speak to him and as i do so you must force yourself between us and insist upon the examination of your papers telling him it is a case of life and death and admits of no delay these instructions were carried out to the letter mr lincoln was at first somewhat surprised at the apparent forwardness of the young woman but observing her distressed appearance he ceased conversation with his friend and commenced an examination of the document she had placed in his hands glancing from it to the face of the petitioner whose tears had broken forth afresh he studied its expression for a moment and then his eye fell upon her scanty but neat dress instantly his face lighted up my poor girl said he you have come here with no governor or senator or member of congress to plead your cause you seem honest and truthful and you dont wear hoopsand i will be whipped but i will pardon your brother   his joy in giving a pardon  one night schuyler colfax left all other business to ask him to respite the son of a constituent who was sentenced to be shot at davenport for desertion he heard the story with his usual patience though he was wearied out with incessant calls and anxious for rest and then repliedsome of our generals complain that i impair discipline and subordination in the army by my pardons and respites but it makes me rested after a hard days work if i can find some good excuse for saving a mans life and i go to bed happy as i think how joyous the signing of my name will make him and his family and his friends and with a happy smile beaming over that carefurrowed face he signed that name that saved that life   his simplicity and unostentatiousness  the simplicity and absence of all ostentation on the part of mr lincoln is well illustrated by an incident which occurred on the occasion of a visit he made to commodore porter at fortress monroe noticing that the banks of the river were dotted with flowers he said commodore tad the pet name for his youngest son who had accompanied him on the excursion is very fond of flowers wont you let a couple of men take a boat and go with him for an hour or two along the banks of the river and gather the flowers look at this picture and then endeavour to imagine the head of a european nation making a similar request in this humble way of one of his subordinates   a penitent man can be pardoned  one day i took a couple of friends from new york upstairs who wished to be introduced to the president it was after the hour for business calls and we found him alone and for once at leisure soon after the introduction one of my friends took occasion to indorse very decidedly the presidents amnesty proclamation which had been severely censured by many friends of the administration mr ss approval touched mr lincoln he said with a great deal of emphasis and with an expression of countenance i shall never forget when a man is sincerely penitent for his misdeeds and gives satisfactory evidence of the same he can safely be pardoned and there is no exception to the rule   keep silence and well get you safe across  at the white house one day some gentlemen were present from the west excited and troubled about the commissions and omissions of the administration the president heard them patiently and then replied gentlemen suppose all the property you were worth was in gold and you had put it in the hands of blondin to carry across the niagara river on a rope would you shake the cable or keep shouting out to him blondin stand up a little straighterblondin stoop a little morego a little fasterlean a little more to the northlean a little more to the south no you would hold your breath as well as your tongue and keep your hands off until he was safe over the government are carrying an immense weight untold treasures are in their hands they are doing the very best they can dont badger them keep silence and well get you safe across   rebuff to a man with a small claim  during a public reception a farmer from one of the border counties of virginia told the president that the union soldiers in passing his farm had helped themselves not only to hay but his horse and he hoped the president would urge the proper officer to consider his claim immediately  mr lincoln said that this reminded him of an old acquaintance of his jack chase who used to be a lumberman on the illinois a steady sober man and the best raftsman on the river it was quite a trick twentyfive years ago to take the logs over the rapids but he was skilful with a raft and always kept her straight in the channel finally a steamer was put on and jack was made captain of her he always used to take the wheel going through the rapids one day when the boat was plunging and wallowing along the boiling current and jacks utmost vigilance was being exercised to keep her in the narrow channel a boy pulled his coattail and hailed him with say mister captain i wish you would just stop your boat a minuteive lost my apple overboard   the presidents silence over criticisms  the president was once speaking about an attack made on him by the committee on the conduct of the war for a certain alleged blunder or something worse in the southwestthe matter involved being one which had fallen directly under the observation of the officer to whom he was talking who possessed official evidence completely upsetting all the conclusions of the committee  might it not be well for me queried the officer to set this matter right in a letter to some paper stating the facts as they actually transpired  oh no replied the president at least not now if i were to try to read much less answer all the attacks made on me this shop might as well be closed for any other business i do the very best i know howthe very best i can and i mean to keep doing so until the end if the end brings me out all right what is said against me wont amount to anything if the end brings me out wrong ten angels swearing i was right would make no difference   glad of it  on the occasion when the telegram from cumberland gap reached mr lincoln that firing was heard in the direction of knoxville he remarked that he was glad of it some person present who had the perils of burnsides position uppermost in his mind could not see why mr lincoln should be glad of it and so expressed himself why you see responded the president it reminds me of mistress sallie ward a neighbour of mine who had a very large family occasionally one of her numerous progeny would be heard crying in some outoftheway place upon which mrs ward would exclaim theres one of my children that isnt dead yet   his democratic bearing  the evening before i left washington an incident occurred illustrating very perfectly the character of the man for two days my large painting had been on exhibition upon its completion in the east room which had been thronged with visitors late in the afternoon of the second day the blackhorse cavalry escort drew up as usual in front of the portico preparatory to the presidents leaving for the soldiers home where he spent the midsummer nights while the carriage was waiting i looked around for him wishing to say a farewell word knowing that i should have no other opportunity presently i saw him standing halfway between the portico and the gateway leading to the war department leaning against the iron fenceone arm thrown over the railing and one foot on the stone coping which supports it evidently having been intercepted on his way in from the war department by a plainlooking man who was giving him very diffidently an account of a difficulty which he had been unable to have rectified while waiting i walked out leisurely to the presidents side he said very little to the man but was intently studying the expression of his face while he was narrating his trouble when he had finished mr lincoln said to him have you a blank card the man searched his pockets but finding none a gentleman standing near who had overheard the question came forward and said here is one mr president several persons had in the meantime gathered around taking the card and a pencil mr lincoln sat down upon the stone coping which is not more than five or six inches above the pavement presenting almost the appearance of sitting upon the pavement itself and wrote an order upon the card to the proper official to examine this mans case while writing this i observed several persons passing down the promenade smiling at each other at what i presume they thought the undignified appearance of the head of the nation who however seemed utterly unconscious either of any impropriety in the action or of attracting any attention to me it was not only a touching picture of the native goodness of the man but of innate nobility of character exemplified not so much by a disregard of conventionalities as in unconsciousness that there could be any breach of etiquette or dignity in the manner of an honest attempt to serve or secure justice to a citizen of the republic however humble he may be    illustration      everyman      i will go with thee       be thy guide      in thy most need      to go by thy side
