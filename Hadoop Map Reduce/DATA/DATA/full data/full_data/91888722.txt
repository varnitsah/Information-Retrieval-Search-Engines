91888722	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     the lady of the barge   the master of the barge arabella sat in the stern of his craft with his right arm leaning on the tiller  a desultory conversation with the mate of a schooner who was hanging over the side of his craft a few yards off had come to a conclusion owing to a difference of opinion on the subject of religion  the skipper had argued so warmly that he almost fancied he must have inherited the tenets of the seventhday baptists from his mother while the mate had surprised himself by the warmth of his advocacy of a form of wesleyanism which would have made the members of that sect open their eyes with horror  he had moreover confirmed the skipper in the error of his ways by calling him a bargee the ranks of the baptists receiving a defender if not a recruit from that hour  with the influence of the religious argument still upon him the skipper as the long summers day gave place to night fell to wondering where his own mate who was also his brotherinlaw had got to  lights which had been struggling with the twilight now burnt bright and strong and the skipper moving from the shadow to where a band of light fell across the deck took out a worn silver watch and saw that it was ten oclock  almost at the same moment a dark figure appeared on the jetty above and began to descend the ladder and a strongly built young man of twentytwo sprang nimbly to the deck  ten oclock ted said the skipper slowly  it ll be eleven in an hours time said the mate calmly  that ll do said the skipper in a somewhat loud voice as he noticed that his late adversary still occupied his favourite strained position and a fortuitous expression of his mothers occurred to him dont talk to me ive been arguing with a son of belial for the last halfhour  bargee said the son of belial in a dispassionate voice  dont take no notice of him ted said the skipper pityingly  he wasnt talking to me said ted  but never mind about him i want to speak to you in private  fire away my lad said the other in a patronizing voice  speak up said the voice from the schooner encouragingly  im listening  there was no reply from the bargee  the master led the way to the cabin and lighting a lamp which appealed to more senses than one took a seat on a locker and again requested the other to fire away  well you see its this way began the mate with a preliminary wriggle theres a certain young woman  a certain young what shouted the master of the arabella  woman repeated the mate snappishly youve heard of a woman afore havent you  well theres a certain young woman im walking out with i  walking out  gasped the skipper  why i never eard o such a thing  you would ha done if youd been better looking praps retorted the other  well ive offered this young woman to come for a trip with us  oh you have ave you  said the skipper sharply  and what do you think louisa will say to it  thats your look out said louisas brother cheerfully  ill make her up a bed forard and well all be as happy as you please  he started suddenly  the mate of the schooner was indulging in a series of whistles of the most amatory description  there she is he said  i told her to wait outside  he ran upon deck and his perturbed brotherinlaw following at his leisure was just in time to see him descending the ladder with a young woman and a small handbag  this is my brotherinlaw capn gibbs said ted introducing the new arrival smartest man at a barge on the river  the girl extended a neatly gloved hand shook the skippers affably and looked wonderingly about her  its very close to the water ted she said dubiously  the skipper coughed  we dont take passengers as a rule he said awkwardly we aint got much convenience for them  never mind said the girl kindly i shant expect too much  she turned away and following the mate down to the cabin went into ecstasies over the spacesaving contrivances she found there  the drawers fitted in the skippers bunk were a source of particular interest and the owner watched with strong disapprobation through the skylight her efforts to make him an applepie bed with the limited means at her disposal  he went down below at once as a wet blanket  i was just shaking your bed up a bit said miss harris reddening  i see you was said the skipper briefly  he tried to pluck up courage to tell her that he couldnt take her but only succeeded in giving vent to an inhospitable cough  ill get the supper said the mate suddenly you sit down old man and talk to lucy  in honour of the visitor he spread a small cloth and then proceeded to produce cold beef pickles and accessories in a manner which reminded miss harris of white rabbits from a conjurers hat  captain gibbs accepting the inevitable ate his supper in silence and left them to their glances  we must make you up a bed forard lucy said the mate when they had finished  miss harris started  wheres that  she inquired  other end o the boat replied the mate gathering up some bedding under his arm  you might bring a lantern john  the skipper who was feeling more sociable after a couple of glasses of beer complied and accompanied the couple to the tiny forecastle  a smell compounded of bilge tar paint and other healthy disinfectants emerged as the scuttle was pushed back  the skipper dangled the lantern down and almost smiled  i cant sleep there said the girl with decision  i shall die o fright  youll get used to it said ted encouragingly as he helped her down its quite dry and comfortable  he put his arm round her waist and squeezed her hand and aided by this moral support miss harris not only consented to remain but found various advantages in the forecastle over the cabin which had escaped the notice of previous voyagers  ill leave you the lantern said the mate making it fast and we shall be on deck most o the night  we get under way at two  he quitted the forecastle followed by the skipper after a polite but futile attempt to give him precedence and made his way to the cabin for two or three hours sleep  therell be a row at the other end ted said the skipper nervously as he got into his bunk  louisas sure to blame me for letting you keep company with a gal like this  we was talking about you only the other day and she said if you was married five years from now it ud be quite soon enough  let loo mind her own business said the mate sharply shes not going to nag me  shes not my wife thank goodness  he turned over and fell fast asleep waking up fresh and bright three hours later to commence what he fondly thought would be the pleasantest voyage of his life  the arabella dropped slowly down with the tide the wind being so light that she was becalmed by every tall warehouse on the way  off greenwich however the breeze freshened somewhat and a little later miss harris looking somewhat pale as to complexion and untidy as to hair came slowly on deck  wheres the lookingglass  she asked as ted hastened to greet her how does my hair look  all wavy said the infatuated young man all little curls and squiggles  come down in the cabin theres a glass there  miss harris with a light nod to the skipper as he sat at the tiller followed the mate below and giving vent to a little cry of indignation as she saw herself in the glass waved the amorous ted on deck and started work on her disarranged hair  at breakfasttime a little friction was caused by what the mate bitterly termed the narrowminded oldfashioned ways of the skipper  he had arranged that the skipper should steer while he and miss harris breakfasted but the coffee was no sooner on the table than the skipper called him and relinquishing the helm in his favour went below to do the honours  the mate protested  its not proper said the skipper  me and er will ave our meals together and then you must have yours  shes under my care  miss harris assented blithely and talk and laughter greeted the ears of the indignant mate as he steered  he went down at last to cold coffee and lukewarm herrings returning to the deck after a hurried meal to find the skipper narrating some of his choicest experiences to an audience which hung on his lightest word  the disregard they showed for his feelings was maddening and for the first time in his life he became a prey to jealousy in its worst form it was quite clear to him that the girl had become desperately enamoured of the skipper and he racked his brain in a wild effort to discover the reason  with an idea of reminding his brotherinlaw of his position he alluded two or three times in a casual fashion to his wife  the skipper hardly listened to him and patting miss harriss cheek in a fatherly manner regaled her with an anecdote of the mates boyhood which the latter had spent a goodly portion of his life in denying  he denied it again hotly and miss harris conquering for a time her laughter reprimanded him severely for contradicting  by the time dinner was ready he was in a state of sullen apathy and when the meal was over and the couple came on deck again so far forgot himself as to compliment miss harris upon her appetite  im ashamed of you ted said the skipper with severity  im glad you know what shame is retorted the mate  if you cant beave yourself youd better keep a bit forard till you get in a better temper continued the skipper  ill be pleased to said the smarting mate  i wish the barge was longer  it couldnt be too long for me said miss harris tossing her head  beaving like a schoolboy murmured the skipper  i know how to behave myself said the mate as he disappeared below his head suddenly appeared again over the companion  if some people dont he added and disappeared again  he was pleased to notice as he ate his dinner that the giddy prattle above had ceased and with his back turned toward the couple when he appeared on deck again he lounged slowly forward until the skipper called him back again  wot was them words you said just now ted he inquired  the mate repeated them with gusto  very good said the skipper sharply very good  dont you ever speak to me again said miss harris with a stately air because i wont answer you if you do  the mate displayed more of his schoolboy nature  wait till youre spoken to he said rudely  this is your gratefulness i suppose  gratefulness said miss harris with her chin in the air  what for  for bringing you for a trip replied the mate sternly  you bringing me for a trip said miss harris scornfully  captain gibbs is the master here i suppose  he is giving me the trip  youre only the mate  just so said the mate with a grin at his brotherinlaw which made that worthy shift uneasily  i wonder what loo will say when she sees you with a lady aboard  she came to please you said captain gibbs with haste  ho  she did did she jeered the mate  prove it only dont look to me to back you thats all  the other eyed him in consternation and his manner changed  dont play the fool ted he said not unkindly you know what loo is  well im reckoning on that said the mate deliberately  im going forard dont let me interrupt you two  so long  he went slowly forward and lighting his pipe sprawled carelessly on the deck and renounced the entire sex forthwith  at teatime the skipper attempted to reverse the procedure at the other meals but as miss harris steadfastly declined to sit at the same table as the mate his good intentions came to naught  he made an appeal to what he termed the mates better nature after miss harris had retired to the seclusion of her bedchamber but in vain  shes nothing to do with me declared the mate majestically  i wash my hands of her  shes a flirt  im like louisa i cant bear flirts  the skipper said no more but his face was so worn that miss harris when she came on deck in the early morning and found the barge gliding gently between the grassy banks of a river attributed it to the difficulty of navigating so large a craft on so small and winding a stream  we shall be alongside in arf an hour said the skipper eyeing her  miss harris expressed her gratification  praps you wouldnt mind going down the focsle and staying there till weve made fast said the other  id take it as a favour  my owners dont like me to carry passengers  miss harris who understood perfectly said certainly and with a cold stare at the mate who was at no pains to conceal his amusement went below at once thoughtfully closing the scuttle after her  theres no call to make mischief ted said the skipper somewhat anxiously as they swept round the last bend and came into view of coalsham  the mate said nothing but stood by to take in sail as they ran swiftly toward the little quay  the pace slackened and the arabella as though conscious of the contraband in her forecastle crept slowly to where a stout middleaged woman who bore a strong likeness to the mate stood upon the quay  theres poor loo said the mate with a sigh  the skipper made no reply to this infernal insinuation  the barge ran alongside the quay and made fast  i thought youd be up said mrs gibbs to her husband  now come along to breakfast ted ll follow on  captain gibbs dived down below for his coat and slipping ashore thankfully prepared to move off with his wife  come on as soon as you can ted said the latter  why what on earth is he making that face for  she turned in amazement as her brother making a pretence of catching her husbands eye screwed his face up into a note of interrogation and gave a slight jerk with his thumb  come along said captain gibbs taking her arm with much affection  but whats ted looking like that for  demanded his wife as she easily intercepted another choice facial expression of the mates  oh its his fun replied her husband walking on  fun repeated mrs gibbs sharply  whats the matter ted  nothing replied the mate  touch o toothache said the skipper  come along loo i can just do with one o your breakfasts  mrs gibbs suffered herself to be led on and had got at least five yards on the way home when she turned and looked back  the mate had still got the toothache and was at that moment in all the agonies of a phenomenal twinge  theres something wrong here said mrs gibbs as she retraced her steps  ted what are you making that face for  its my own face said the mate evasively  mrs gibbs conceded the point and added bitterly that it couldnt be helped  all the same she wanted to know what he meant by it  ask john said the vindictive mate  mrs gibbs asked  her husband said he didnt know and added that ted had been like it before but he had not told her for fear of frightening her  then he tried to induce her to go with him to the chemists to get something for it  mrs gibbs shook her head firmly and boarding the barge took a seat on the hatch and proceeded to catechise her brother as to his symptoms  he denied that there was anything the matter with him while his eyes openly sought those of captain gibbs as though asking for instruction  you come home ted she said at length  i cant said the mate  i cant leave the ship  why not demanded his sister  ask john said the mate again  at this mrs gibbss temper which had been rising gave way altogether and she stamped fiercely upon the deck  a stamp of the foot has been for all time a roughandready means of signalling the forescuttle was drawn back and the face of a young and pretty girl appeared framed in the opening  the mate raised his eyebrows with a helpless gesture and as for the unfortunate skipper any jury would have found him guilty without leaving the box  the wife of his bosom with a flaming visage turned and regarded him   illustration you villain she said in a choking voice   you villain  she said in a choking voice  captain gibbs caught his breath and looked appealingly at the mate  its a little surprise for you my dear he faltered its teds young lady  nothing of the kind said the mate sharply  its not  how dare you say such a thing  demanded miss harris stepping on to the deck  well you brought her aboard ted you know you did pleaded the unhappy skipper  the mate did not deny it but his face was so full of grief and surprise that the others heart sank within him  all right said the mate at last have it your own way  hold your tongue ted shouted mrs gibbs youre trying to shield him  i tell you ted brought her aboard and they had a lovers quarrel said her unhappy spouse  its nothing to do with me at all  and thats why you told me ted had got the toothache and tried to get me off to the chemists i spose retorted his wife with virulence do you think im a fool  how dare you ask a young woman on this barge how dare you  i didnt ask her said her husband  i spose she came without being asked sneered his wife turning her regards to the passenger she looks the sort that might  you brazen faced girl  here go easy loo interrupted the mate flushing as he saw the girls pale face  mind your own business said his sister violently  it is my business said the repentant mate  i brought her aboard and then we quarrelled  ive no doubt said his sister bitterly its very pretty but it wont do  i swear its the truth said the mate  why did john keep it so quiet and hide her for then  demanded his sister  i came down for the trip said miss harris that is all about it there is nothing to make a fuss about  how much is it captain gibbs  she produced a little purse from her pocket but before the embarrassed skipper could reply his infuriated wife struck it out of her hand  the mate sprang instinctively forward but too late and the purse fell with a splash into the water  the girl gave a faint cry and clasped her hands  how am i to get back  she gasped  ill see to that lucy said the mate  im very sorryive been a brute  you  said the indignant girl  i would sooner drown myself than be beholden to you  im very sorry repeated the mate humbly  theres enough of this playacting interposed mrs gibbs  get off this barge  you stay where you are said the mate authoritatively  send that girl off this barge screamed mrs gibbs to her husband  captain gibbs smiled in a silly fashion and scratched his head  where is she to go  he asked feebly  what does it matter to you where she goes  cried his wife fiercely send her off  the girl eyed her haughtily and repulsing the mate as he strove to detain her stepped to the side  then she paused as he suddenly threw off his coat and sitting down on the hatch hastily removed his boots the skipper divining his intentions seized him by the arm  dont be a fool ted he gasped youll get under the barge  the mate shook him off and went in with a splash which half drowned his adviser  miss harris clasping her hands ran to the side and gazed fearfully at the spot where he had disappeared while his sister in a terrible voice seized the opportunity to point out to her husband the probably fatal results of his illdoing  there was an anxious interval and then the mates head appeared above the water and after a breathing space disappeared again  the skipper watching uneasily stood by with a lifebelt  come out ted screamed his sister as he came up for breath again  the mate disappeared once more but coming up for the third time hung on to the side of the barge to recover a bit  a clothed man in the water savours of disaster and looks alarming  miss harris began to cry  youll be drowned she whimpered  come out said mrs gibbs in a raspy voice  she knelt on the deck and twined her fingers in his hair  the mate addressed her in terms rendered brotherly by pain  never mind about the purse sobbed miss harris it doesnt matter  will you make it up if i come out then demanded the diver  no ill never speak to you again as long as i live said the girl passionately  the mate disappeared again  this time he was out of sight longer than usual and when he came up merely tossed his arms weakly and went down again  there was a scream from the women and a mighty splash as the skipper went overboard with a lifebelt  the mates head black and shining showed for a moment the skipper grabbed him by the hair and towed him to the barges side and in the midst of a considerable hubbub both men were drawn from the water  the skipper shook himself like a dog but the mate lay on the deck inert in a puddle of water  mrs gibbs frantically slapped his hands and miss harris bending over him rendered first aid by kissing him wildly  captain gibbs pushed her away  he wont come round while youre akissing of him he cried roughly  to his indignant surprise the drowned man opened one eye and winked acquiescence  the skipper dropped his arms by his side and stared at him stupidly  i saw his eyelid twitch cried mrs gibbs joyfully  hes all right said her indignant husband e aint born to be drowned e aint  ive spoilt a good suit of clothes for nothing  to his wifes amazement he actually walked away from the insensible man and with a boathook reached for his hat which was floating by  mrs gibbs still gazing in blank astonishment caught a seraphic smile on the face of her brother as miss harris continued her ministrations and in a pardonable fit of temper the overwrought woman gave him a box on the ear which brought him round at once  where am i  he inquired artlessly  mrs gibbs told him  she also told him her opinion of him and without plagiarizing her husbands words came to the same conclusion as to his ultimate fate  you come along home with me she said turning in a friendly fashion to the bewildered girl  they deserve what theyve gotboth of em  i only hope that theyll both get such awful colds that they wont find their voices for a twelvemonth  she took the girl by the arm and helped her ashore  they turned their heads once in the direction of the barge and saw the justly incensed skipper keeping the mates explanations and apologies at bay with a boat hook  then they went in to breakfast
