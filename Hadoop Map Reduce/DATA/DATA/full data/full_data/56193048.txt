56193048	brother jacob   chapter i   among the many fatalities attending the bloom of young desire that of blindly taking to the confectionery line has not perhaps been sufficiently considered  how is the son of a british yeoman who has been fed principally on salt pork and yeast dumplings to know that there is satiety for the human stomach even in a paradise of glass jars full of sugared almonds and pink lozenges and that the tedium of life can reach a pitch where plumbuns at discretion cease to offer the slightest excitement  or how at the tender age when a confectioner seems to him a very prince whom all the world must envywho breakfasts on macaroons dines on meringues sups on twelfthcake and fills up the intermediate hours with sugarcandy or pepperminthow is he to foresee the day of sad wisdom when he will discern that the confectioners calling is not socially influential or favourable to a soaring ambition  i have known a man who turned out to have a metaphysical genius incautiously in the period of youthful buoyancy commence his career as a dancingmaster and you may imagine the use that was made of this initial mistake by opponents who felt themselves bound to warn the public against his doctrine of the inconceivable  he could not give up his dancinglessons because he made his bread by them and metaphysics would not have found him in so much as salt to his bread  it was really the same with mr david faux and the confectionery business  his uncle the butler at the great house close by brigford had made a pet of him in his early boyhood and it was on a visit to this uncle that the confectioners shops in that brilliant town had on a single day fired his tender imagination  he carried home the pleasing illusion that a confectioner must be at once the happiest and the foremost of men since the things he made were not only the most beautiful to behold but the very best eating and such as the lord mayor must always order largely for his private recreation so that when his father declared he must be put to a trade david chose his line without a moments hesitation and with a rashness inspired by a sweet tooth wedded himself irrevocably to confectionery  soon however the tooth lost its relish and fell into blank indifference and all the while his mind expanded his ambition took new shapes which could hardly be satisfied within the sphere his youthful ardour had chosen  but what was he to do  he was a young man of much mental activity and above all gifted with a spirit of contrivance but then his faculties would not tell with great effect in any other medium than that of candied sugars conserves and pastry  say what you will about the identity of the reasoning process in all branches of thought or about the advantage of coming to subjects with a fresh mind the adjustment of butter to flour and of heat to pastry is not the best preparation for the office of prime minister besides in the present imperfectlyorganized state of society there are social barriers  david could invent delightful things in the way of dropcakes and he had the widest views of the sugar department but in other directions he certainly felt hampered by the want of knowledge and practical skill and the world is so inconveniently constituted that the vague consciousness of being a fine fellow is no guarantee of success in any line of business  this difficulty pressed with some severity on mr david faux even before his apprenticeship was ended  his soul swelled with an impatient sense that he ought to become something very remarkablethat it was quite out of the question for him to put up with a narrow lot as other men did he scorned the idea that he could accept an average  he was sure there was nothing average about him even such a person as mrs tibbits the washer woman perceived it and probably had a preference for his linen  at that particular period he was weighing out gingerbread nuts but such an anomaly could not continue  no position could be suited to mr david faux that was not in the highest degree easy to the flesh and flattering to the spirit  if he had fallen on the present times and enjoyed the advantages of a mechanics institute he would certainly have taken to literature and have written reviews but his education had not been liberal  he had read some novels from the adjoining circulating library and had even bought the story of inkle and yarico which had made him feel very sorry for poor mr inkle so that his ideas might not have been below a certain mark of the literary calling but his spelling and diction were too unconventional  when a man is not adequately appreciated or comfortably placed in his own country his thoughts naturally turn towards foreign climes and davids imagination circled round and round the utmost limits of his geographical knowledge in search of a country where a young gentleman of pasty visage lipless mouth and stumpy hair would be likely to be received with the hospitable enthusiasm which he had a right to expect  having a general idea of america as a country where the population was chiefly black it appeared to him the most propitious destination for an emigrant who to begin with had the broad and easily recognizable merit of whiteness and this idea gradually took such strong possession of him that satan seized the opportunity of suggesting to him that he might emigrate under easier circumstances if he supplied himself with a little money from his masters till  but that evil spirit whose understanding i am convinced has been much overrated quite wasted his time on this occasion  david would certainly have liked well to have some of his masters money in his pocket if he had been sure his master would have been the only man to suffer for it but he was a cautious youth and quite determined to run no risks on his own account  so he stayed out his apprenticeship and committed no act of dishonesty that was at all likely to be discovered reserving his plan of emigration for a future opportunity  and the circumstances under which he carried it out were in this wise  having been at home a week or two partaking of the family beans he had used his leisure in ascertaining a fact which was of considerable importance to him namely that his mother had a small sum in guineas painfully saved from her maiden perquisites and kept in the corner of a drawer where her babylinen had reposed for the last twenty yearsever since her son david had taken to his feet with a slight promise of bowlegs which had not been altogether unfulfilled  mr faux senior had told his son very frankly that he must not look to being set up in business by him with seven sons and one of them a very healthy and welldeveloped idiot who consumed a dumpling about eight inches in diameter every day it was pretty well if they got a hundred apiece at his death  under these circumstances what was david to do  it was certainly hard that he should take his mothers money but he saw no other ready means of getting any and it was not to be expected that a young man of his merit should put up with inconveniences that could be avoided  besides it is not robbery to take property belonging to your mother she doesnt prosecute you  and david was very well behaved to his mother he comforted her by speaking highly of himself to her and assuring her that he never fell into the vices he saw practised by other youths of his own age and that he was particularly fond of honesty  if his mother would have given him her twenty guineas as a reward of this noble disposition he really would not have stolen them from her and it would have been more agreeable to his feelings  nevertheless to an active mind like davids ingenuity is not without its pleasures it was rather an interesting occupation to become stealthily acquainted with the wards of his mothers simple key not in the least like chubbs patent and to get one that would do its work equally well and also to arrange a little drama by which he would escape suspicion and run no risk of forfeiting the prospective hundred at his fathers death which would be convenient in the improbable case of his not making a large fortune in the indies  first he spoke freely of his intention to start shortly for liverpool and take ship for america a resolution which cost his good mother some pain for after jacob the idiot there was not one of her sons to whom her heart clung more than to her youngestborn david  next it appeared to him that sunday afternoon when everybody was gone to church except jacob and the cowboy was so singularly favourable an opportunity for sons who wanted to appropriate their mothers guineas that he half thought it must have been kindly intended by providence for such purposes  especially the third sunday in lent because jacob had been out on one of his occasional wanderings for the last two days and david being a timid young man had a considerable dread and hatred of jacob as of a large personage who went about habitually with a pitchfork in his hand  nothing could be easier then than for david on this sunday afternoon to decline going to church on the ground that he was going to tea at mr lunns whose pretty daughter sally had been an early flame of his and when the churchgoers were at a safe distance to abstract the guineas from their wooden box and slip them into a small canvas bagnothing easier than to call to the cowboy that he was going and tell him to keep an eye on the house for fear of sunday tramps  david thought it would be easy too to get to a small thicket and bury his bag in a hole he had already made and covered up under the roots of an old hollow ash and he had in fact found the hole without a moments difficulty had uncovered it and was about gently to drop the bag into it when the sound of a large body rustling towards him with something like a bellow was such a surprise to david who as a gentleman gifted with much contrivance was naturally only prepared for what he expected that instead of dropping the bag gently he let it fall so as to make it untwist and vomit forth the shining guineas  in the same moment he looked up and saw his dear brother jacob close upon him holding the pitchfork so that the bright smooth prongs were a yard in advance of his own body and about a foot off davids  a learned friend to whom i once narrated this history observed that it was davids guilt which made these prongs formidable and that the mens nil conscia sibi strips a pitchfork of all terrors  i thought this idea so valuable that i obtained his leave to use it on condition of suppressing his name  nevertheless david did not entirely lose his presence of mind for in that case he would have sunk on the earth or started backward whereas he kept his ground and smiled at jacob who nodded his head up and down and said hoich zavy in a painfully equivocal manner  davids heart was beating audibly and if he had had any lips they would have been pale but his mental activity instead of being paralysed was stimulated  while he was inwardly praying he always prayed when he was much frightenedoh save me this once and ill never get into danger againhe was thrusting his hand into his pocket in search of a box of yellow lozenges which he had brought with him from brigford among other delicacies of the same portable kind as a means of conciliating proud beauty and more particularly the beauty of miss sarah lunn  not one of these delicacies had he ever offered to poor jacob for david was not a young man to waste his jujubes and barleysugar in giving pleasure to people from whom he expected nothing  but an idiot with equivocal intentions and a pitchfork is as well worth flattering and cajoling as if he were louis napoleon  so david with a promptitude equal to the occasion drew out his box of yellow lozenges lifted the lid and performed a pantomime with his mouth and fingers which was meant to imply that he was delighted to see his dear brother jacob and seized the opportunity of making him a small present which he would find particularly agreeable to the taste  jacob you understand was not an intense idiot but within a certain limited range knew how to choose the good and reject the evil he took one lozenge by way of test and sucked it as if he had been a philosopher then in as great an ecstacy at its new and complex savour as caliban at the taste of trinculos wine chuckled and stroked this suddenly beneficent brother and held out his hand for more for except in fits of anger jacob was not ferocious or needlessly predatory  davids courage half returned and he left off praying pouring a dozen lozenges into jacobs palm and trying to look very fond of him  he congratulated himself that he had formed the plan of going to see miss sally lunn this afternoon and that as a consequence he had brought with him these propitiatory delicacies he was certainly a lucky fellow indeed it was always likely providence should be fonder of him than of other apprentices and since he was to be interrupted why an idiot was preferable to any other sort of witness  for the first time in his life david thought he saw the advantage of idiots  as for jacob he had thrust his pitchfork into the ground and had thrown himself down beside it in thorough abandonment to the unprecedented pleasure of having five lozenges in his mouth at once blinking meanwhile and making inarticulate sounds of gustative content  he had not yet given any sign of noticing the guineas but in seating himself he had laid his broad right hand on them and unconsciously kept it in that position absorbed in the sensations of his palate  if he could only be kept so occupied with the lozenges as not to see the guineas before david could manage to cover them  that was davids best hope of safety for jacob knew his mothers guineas it had been part of their common experience as boys to be allowed to look at these handsome coins and rattle them in their box on high days and holidays and among all jacobs narrow experiences as to money this was likely to be the most memorable  here jacob said david in an insinuating tone handing the box to him ill give em all to you  runmake hasteelse somebodyll come and take em  david not having studied the psychology of idiots was not aware that they are not to be wrought upon by imaginative fears  jacob took the box with his left hand but saw no necessity for running away  was ever a promising young man wishing to lay the foundation of his fortune by appropriating his mothers guineas obstructed by such a daymare as this but the moment must come when jacob would move his right hand to draw off the lid of the tin box and then david would sweep the guineas into the hole with the utmost address and swiftness and immediately seat himself upon them  ah no  its of no use to have foresight when you are dealing with an idiot he is not to be calculated upon  jacobs right hand was given to vague clutching and throwing it suddenly clutched the guineas as if they had been so many pebbles and was raised in an attitude which promised to scatter them like seed over a distant bramble when from some prompting or otherprobably of an unwonted sensationit paused descended to jacobs knee and opened slowly under the inspection of jacobs dull eyes  david began to pray again but immediately desistedanother resource having occurred to him  mother zinnies exclaimed the innocent jacob  then looking at david he said interrogatively box  hush hush said david summoning all his ingenuity in this severe strait  see jacob  he took the tin box from his brothers hand and emptied it of the lozenges returning half of them to jacob but secretly keeping the rest in his own hand  then he held out the empty box and said heres the box jacob  the box for the guineas gently sweeping them from jacobs palm into the box  this procedure was not objectionable to jacob on the contrary the guineas clinked so pleasantly as they fell that he wished for a repetition of the sound and seizing the box began to rattle it very gleefully  david seizing the opportunity deposited his reserve of lozenges in the ground and hastily swept some earth over them  look jacob he said at last  jacob paused from his clinking and looked into the hole while david began to scratch away the earth as if in doubtful expectation  when the lozenges were laid bare he took them out one by one and gave them to jacob  hush he said in a loud whisper tell nobodyall for jacobhushshsh  put guineas in the holetheyll come out like this  to make the lesson more complete he took a guinea and lowering it into the hole said put in so  then as he took the last lozenge out he said come out so and put the lozenge into jacobs hospitable mouth  jacob turned his head on one side looked first at his brother and then at the hole like a reflective monkey and finally laid the box of guineas in the hole with much decision  david made haste to add every one of the stray coins put on the lid and covered it well with earth saying in his meet coaxing tone  take m out tomorrow jacob all for jacob  hushshsh  jacob to whom this once indifferent brother had all at once become a sort of sweettasted fetish stroked davids best coat with his adhesive fingers and then hugged him with an accompaniment of that mingled chuckling and gurgling by which he was accustomed to express the milder passions  but if he had chosen to bite a small morsel out of his beneficent brothers cheek david would have been obliged to bear it  and here i must pause to point out to you the shortsightedness of human contrivance  this ingenious young man mr david faux thought he had achieved a triumph of cunning when he had associated himself in his brothers rudimentary mind with the flavour of yellow lozenges  but he had yet to learn that it is a dreadful thing to make an idiot fond of you when you yourself are not of an affectionate disposition especially an idiot with a pitchforkobviously a difficult friend to shake off by rough usage  it may seem to you rather a blundering contrivance for a clever young man to bury the guineas  but if everything had turned out as david had calculated you would have seen that his plan was worthy of his talents the guineas would have lain safely in the earth while the theft was discovered and david with the calm of conscious innocence would have lingered at home reluctant to say goodbye to his dear mother while she was in grief about her guineas till at length on the eve of his departure he would have disinterred them in the strictest privacy and carried them on his own person without inconvenience  but david you perceive had reckoned without his host or to speak more precisely without his idiot brotheran item of so uncertain and fluctuating a character that i doubt whether he would not have puzzled the astute heroes of m de balzac whose foresight is so remarkably at home in the future  it was clear to david now that he had only one alternative before him he must either renounce the guineas by quietly putting them back in his mothers drawer a course not unattended with difficulty or he must leave more than a suspicion behind him by departing early the next morning without giving notice and with the guineas in his pocket  for if he gave notice that he was going his mother he knew would insist on fetching from her box of guineas the three she had always promised him as his share indeed in his original plan he had counted on this as a means by which the theft would be discovered under circumstances that would themselves speak for his innocence but now as i need hardly explain that wellcombined plan was completely frustrated  even if david could have bribed jacob with perpetual lozenges an idiots secrecy is itself betrayal  he dared not even go to tea at mr lunns for in that case he would have lost sight of jacob who in his impatience for the crop of lozenges might scratch up the box again while he was absent and carry it homedepriving him at once of reputation and guineas  no he must think of nothing all the rest of this day but of coaxing jacob and keeping him out of mischief  it was a fatiguing and anxious evening to david nevertheless he dared not go to sleep without tying a piece of string to his thumb and great toe to secure his frequent waking for he meant to be up with the first peep of dawn and be far out of reach before breakfasttime  his father he thought would certainly cut him off with a shilling but what then  such a striking young man as he would be sure to be well received in the west indies in foreign countries there are always openingseven for cats  it was probable that some princess yarico would want him to marry her and make him presents of very large jewels beforehand after which he neednt marry her unless he liked  david had made up his mind not to steal any more even from people who were fond of him it was an unpleasant way of making your fortune in a world where you were likely to surprised in the act by brothers  such alarms did not agree with davids constitution and he had felt so much nausea this evening that no doubt his liver was affected  besides he would have been greatly hurt not to be thought well of in the world he always meant to make a figure and be thought worthy of the best seats and the best morsels  ruminating to this effect on the brilliant future in reserve for him david by the help of his checkstring kept himself on the alert to seize the time of earliest dawn for his rising and departure  his brothers of course were early risers but he should anticipate them by at least an hour and a half and the little room which he had to himself as only an occasional visitor had its window over the horseblock so that he could slip out through the window without the least difficulty  jacob the horrible jacob had an awkward trick of getting up before everybody else to stem his hunger by emptying the milkbowl that was duly set for him but of late he had taken to sleeping in the hayloft and if he came into the house it would be on the opposite side to that from which david was making his exit  there was no need to think of jacob yet david was liberal enough to bestow a curse on himit was the only thing he ever did bestow gratuitously  his small bundle of clothes was ready packed and he was soon treading lightly on the steps of the horseblock soon walking at a smart pace across the fields towards the thicket  it would take him no more than two minutes to get out the box he could make out the tree it was under by the pale strip where the bark was off although the dawning light was rather dimmer in the thicket  but what in the name ofburnt pastrywas that large body with a staff planted beside it close at the foot of the ashtree  david paused not to make up his mind as to the nature of the apparitionhe had not the happiness of doubting for a moment that the staff was jacobs pitchforkbut to gather the selfcommand necessary for addressing his brother with a sufficiently honeyed accent  jacob was absorbed in scratching up the earth and had not heard davids approach  i say jacob said david in a loud whisper just as the tin box was lifted out of the hole  jacob looked up and discerning his sweetflavoured brother nodded and grinned in the dim light in a way that made him seem to david like a triumphant demon  if he had been of an impetuous disposition he would have snatched the pitchfork from the ground and impaled this fraternal demon  but david was by no means impetuous he was a young man greatly given to calculate consequences a habit which has been held to be the foundation of virtue  but somehow it had not precisely that effect in david he calculated whether an action would harm himself or whether it would only harm other people  in the former case he was very timid about satisfying his immediate desires but in the latter he would risk the result with much courage  give it me jacob he said stooping down and patting his brother  let us see  jacob finding the lid rather tight gave the box to his brother in perfect faith  david raised the lids and shook his head while jacob put his finger in and took out a guinea to taste whether the metamorphosis into lozenges was complete and satisfactory  no jacob too soon too soon said david when the guinea had been tasted  give it me well go and bury it somewhere else well put it in yonder he added pointing vaguely toward the distance  david screwed on the lid while jacob looking grave rose and grasped his pitchfork  then seeing davids bundle he snatched it like a too officious newfoundland stuck his pitchfork into it and carried it over his shoulder in triumph as he accompanied david and the box out of the thicket  what on earth was david to do  it would have been easy to frown at jacob and kick him and order him to get away but david dared as soon have kicked the bull  jacob was quiet as long as he was treated indulgently but on the slightest show of anger he became unmanageable and was liable to fits of fury which would have made him formidable even without his pitchfork  there was no mastery to be obtained over him except by kindness or guile  david tried guile  go jacob he said when they were out of the thicketpointing towards the house as he spoke go and fetch me a spadea spade  but give me the bundle he added trying to reach it from the fork where it hung high above jacobs tall shoulder  but jacob showed as much alacrity in obeying as a wasp shows in leaving a sugarbasin  near david he felt himself in the vicinity of lozenges he chuckled and rubbed his brothers back brandishing the bundle higher out of reach  david with an inward groan changed his tactics and walked on as fast as he could  it was not safe to linger  jacob would get tired of following him or at all events could be eluded  if they could once get to the distant highroad a coach would overtake them david would mount it having previously by some ingenious means secured his bundle and then jacob might howl and flourish his pitchfork as much as he liked  meanwhile he was under the fatal necessity of being very kind to this ogre and of providing a large breakfast for him when they stopped at a roadside inn  it was already three hours since they had started and david was tired  would no coach be coming up soon he inquired  no coach for the next two hours  but there was a carriers cart to come immediately on its way to the next town  if he could slip out even leaving his bundle behind and get into the cart without jacob but there was a new obstacle  jacob had recently discovered a remnant of sugarcandy in one of his brothers tailpockets and since then had cautiously kept his hold on that limb of the garment perhaps with an expectation that there would be a further development of sugarcandy after a longer or shorter interval  now every one who has worn a coat will understand the sensibilities that must keep a man from starting away in a hurry when there is a grasp on his coattail  david looked forward to being well received among strangers but it might make a difference if he had only one tail to his coat  he felt himself in a cold perspiration  he could walk no more he must get into the cart and let jacob get in with him  presently a cheering idea occurred to him after so large a breakfast jacob would be sure to go to sleep in the cart you see at once that david meant to seize his bundle jump out and be free  his expectation was partly fulfilled jacob did go to sleep in the cart but it was in a peculiar attitudeit was with his arms tightly fastened round his dear brothers body and if ever david attempted to move the grasp tightened with the force of an affectionate boaconstrictor  th innicents fond on you observed the carrier thinking that david was probably an amiable brother and wishing to pay him a compliment  david groaned  the ways of thieving were not ways of pleasantness  oh why had he an idiot brother  oh why in general was the world so constituted that a man could not take his mothers guineas comfortably david became grimly speculative  copious dinner at noon for jacob but little dinner because little appetite for david  instead of eating he plied jacob with beer for through this liberality he descried a hope  jacob fell into a dead sleep at last without having his arms round david who paid the reckoning took his bundle and walked off  in another halfhour he was on the coach on his way to liverpool smiling the smile of the triumphant wicked  he was rid of jacobhe was bound for the indies where a gullible princess awaited him  he would never steal any more but there would be no need he would show himself so deserving that people would make him presents freely  he must give up the notion of his fathers legacy but it was not likely he would ever want that trifle and even if he didwhy it was a compensation to think that in being for ever divided from his family he was divided from jacob more terrible than gorgon or demogorgon to davids timid green eyes  thank heaven he should never see jacob any more     chapter ii   it was nearly six years after the departure of mr david faux for the west indies that the vacant shop in the marketplace at grimworth was understood to have been let to the stranger with a sallow complexion and a buff cravat whose first appearance had caused some excitement in the bar of the woolpack where he had called to wait for the coach  grimworth to a discerning eye was a good place to set up shopkeeping in  there was no competition in it at present the churchpeople had their own grocer and draper the dissenters had theirs and the two or three butchers found a ready market for their joints without strict reference to religious persuasionexcept that the rectors wife had given a general order for the veal sweetbreads and the mutton kidneys while mr rodd the baptist minister had requested that so far as was compatible with the fair accommodation of other customers the sheeps trotters might be reserved for him  and it was likely to be a growing place for the trustees of mr zephaniah crypts charity under the stimulus of a late visitation by commissioners were beginning to apply longaccumulating funds to the rebuilding of the yellow coat school which was henceforth to be carried forward on a greatlyextended scale the testator having left no restrictions concerning the curriculum but only concerning the coat  the shopkeepers at grimworth were by no means unanimous as to the advantages promised by this prospect of increased population and trading being substantial men who liked doing a quiet business in which they were sure of their customers and could calculate their returns to a nicety  hitherto it had been held a point of honour by the families in grimworth parish to buy their sugar and their flannel at the shop where their fathers and mothers had bought before them but if newcomers were to bring in the system of neckandneck trading and solicit feminine eyes by gownpieces laid in fanlike folds and surmounted by artificial flowers giving them a factitious charm for on what human figure would a gown sit like a fan or what female head was like a bunch of chinaasters or if new grocers were to fill their windows with mountains of currants and sugar made seductive by contrast and ticketswhat security was there for grimworth that a vagrant spirit in shopping once introduced would not in the end carry the most important families to the larger market town of cattleton where business being done on a system of small profits and quick returns the fashions were of the freshest and goods of all kinds might be bought at an advantage  with this view of the times predominant among the tradespeople at grimworth their uncertainty concerning the nature of the business which the sallowcomplexioned stranger was about to set up in the vacant shop naturally gave some additional strength to the fears of the less sanguine  if he was going to sell drapery it was probable that a pale faced fellow like that would deal in showy and inferior articlesprinted cottons and muslins which would leave their dye in the washtub jobbed linen full of knots and flannel that would soon look like gauze  if grocery then it was to be hoped that no mother of a family would trust the teas of an untried grocer  such things had been known in some parishes as tradesmen going about canvassing for custom with cards in their pockets when people came from nobody knew where there was no knowing what they might do  it was a thousand pities that mr moffat the auctioneer and broker had died without leaving anybody to follow him in the business and mrs cleves trustee ought to have known better than to let a shop to a stranger  even the discovery that ovens were being put up on the premises and that the shop was in fact being fitted up for a confectioner and pastrycooks business hitherto unknown in grimworth did not quite suffice to turn the scale in the newcomers favour though the landlady at the woolpack defended him warmly said he seemed to be a very clever young man and from what she could make out came of a very good family indeed was most likely a good many peoples betters  it certainly made a blaze of light and colour almost as if a rainbow had suddenly descended into the marketplace when one fine morning the shutters were taken down from the new shop and the two windows displayed their decorations  on one side there were the variegated tints of collared and marbled meats set off by bright green leaves the pale brown of glazed pies the rich tones of sauces and bottled fruits enclosed in their veil of glassaltogether a sight to bring tears into the eyes of a dutch painter and on the other there was a predominance of the more delicate hues of pink and white and yellow and buff in the abundant lozenges candies sweet biscuits and icings which to the eyes of a bilious person might easily have been blended into a faery landscape in turners latest style  what a sight to dawn upon the eyes of grimworth children  they almost forgot to go to their dinner that day their appetites being preoccupied with imaginary sugarplums and i think even punch setting up his tabernacle in the marketplace would not have succeeded in drawing them away from those shopwindows where they stood according to gradations of size and strength the biggest and strongest being nearest the window and the little ones in the outermost rows lifting wideopen eyes and mouths towards the upper tier of jars like small birds at mealtime  the elder inhabitants pished and pshawed a little at the folly of the new shopkeeper in venturing on such an outlay in goods that would not keep to be sure christmas was coming but what housewife in grimworth would not think shame to furnish forth her table with articles that were not homecooked  no no  mr edward freely as he called himself was deceived if he thought grimworth money was to flow into his pockets on such terms  edward freely was the name that shone in gilt letters on a mazarine ground over the doorplace of the new shopa generoussounding name that might have belonged to the openhearted improvident hero of an old comedy who would have delighted in raining sugared almonds like a new mannagift among that small generation outside the windows  but mr edward freely was a man whose impulses were kept in due subordination he held that the desire for sweets and pastry must only be satisfied in a direct ratio with the power of paying for them  if the smallest child in grimworth would go to him with a halfpenny in its tiny fist he would after ringing the halfpenny deliver a just equivalent in rock  he was not a man to cheat even the smallest childhe often said so observing at the same time that he loved honesty and also that he was very tender hearted though he didnt show his feelings as some people did  either in reward of such virtue or according to some more hidden law of sequence mr freelys business in spite of prejudice started under favourable auspices  for mrs chaloner the rectors wife was among the earliest customers at the shop thinking it only right to encourage a new parishioner who had made a decorous appearance at church and she found mr freely a most civil obliging young man and intelligent to a surprising degree for a confectioner wellprincipled too for in giving her useful hints about choosing sugars he had thrown much light on the dishonesty of other tradesmen  moreover he had been in the west indies and had seen the very estate which had been her poor grandfathers property and he said the missionaries were the only cause of the negros discontentan observing young man evidently  mrs chaloner ordered winebiscuits and olives and gave mr freely to understand that she should find his shop a great convenience  so did the doctors wife and so did mrs gate at the large cardingmill who having high connexions frequently visiting her might be expected to have a large consumption of ratafias and macaroons  the less aristocratic matrons of grimworth seemed likely at first to justify their husbands confidence that they would never pay a percentage of profits on dropcakes instead of making their own or get up a hollow show of liberal housekeeping by purchasing slices of collared meat when a neighbour came in for supper  but it is my task to narrate the gradual corruption of grimworth manners from their primitive simplicitya melancholy task if it were not cheered by the prospect of the fine peripateia or downfall by which the progress of the corruption was ultimately checked  it was young mrs steene the veterinary surgeons wife who first gave way to temptation  i fear she had been rather overeducated for her station in life for she knew by heart many passages in lalla rookh the corsair and the siege of corinth which had given her a distaste for domestic occupations and caused her a withering disappointment at the discovery that mr steene since his marriage had lost all interest in the bulbul openly preferred discussing the nature of spavin with a coarse neighbour and was angry if the pudding turned out wateryindeed was simply a topbooted vet who came in hungry at dinnertime and not in the least like a nobleman turned corsair out of pure scorn for his race or like a renegade with a turban and crescent unless it were in the irritability of his temper  and scorn is such a very different thing in topboots  this brutal man had invited a supperparty for christmas eve when he would expect to see mincepies on the table  mrs steene had prepared her mincemeat and had devoted much butter fine flour and labour to the making of a batch of pies in the morning but they proved to be so very heavy when they came out of the oven that she could only think with trembling of the moment when her husband should catch sight of them on the suppertable  he would storm at her she was certain and before all the company and then she should never help crying it was so dreadful to think she had come to that after the bulbul and everything  suddenly the thought darted through her mind that this once she might send for a dish of mincepies from freelys she knew he had some  but what was to become of the eighteen heavy mincepies  oh it was of no use thinking about that it was very expensiveindeed making mincepies at all was a great expense when they were not sure to turn out well it would be much better to buy them readymade  you paid a little more for them but there was no risk of waste  such was the sophistry with which this misguided young womanenough mrs steene sent for the mincepies and i am grieved to add garbled her household accounts in order to conceal the fact from her husband this was the second step in a downward course all owing to a young womans being out of harmony with her circumstances yearning after renegades and bulbuls and being subject to claims from a veterinary surgeon fond of mincepies  the third step was to harden herself by telling the fact of the bought mincepies to her intimate friend mrs mole who had already guessed it and who subsequently encouraged herself in buying a mould of jelly instead of exerting her own skill by the reflection that other people did the same sort of thing  the infection spread soon there was a party or clique in grimworth on the side of buying at freelys and many husbands kept for some time in the dark on this point innocently swallowed at two mouthfuls a tart on which they were paying a profit of a hundred per cent and as innocently encouraged a fatal disingenuousness in the partners of their bosoms by praising the pastry  others more keensighted winked at the too frequent presentation on washingdays and at impromptu suppers of superior spicedbeef which flattered their palates more than the cold remnants they had formerly been contented with  every housewife who had once bought at freelys felt a secret joy when she detected a similar perversion in her neighbours practice and soon only two or three old fashioned mistresses of families held out in the protest against the growing demoralization saying to their neighbours who came to sup with them i cant offer you freelys beef or freelys cheesecakes everything in our house is homemade im afraid youll hardly have any appetite for our plain pastry  the doctor whose cook was not satisfactory the curate who kept no cook and the mining agent who was a great bon vivant even began to rely on freely for the greater part of their dinner when they wished to give an entertainment of some brilliancy  in short the business of manufacturing the more fanciful viands was fast passing out of the hinds of maids and matrons in private families and was becoming the work of a special commercial organ  i am not ignorant that this sort of thing is called the inevitable course of civilization division of labour and so forth and that the maids and matrons may be said to have had their hands set free from cookery to add to the wealth of society in some other way  only it happened at grimworth which to be sure was a low place that the maids and matrons could do nothing with their hands at all better than cooking not even those who had always made heavy cakes and leathery pastry  and so it came to pass that the progress of civilization at grimworth was not otherwise apparent than in the impoverishment of men the gossiping idleness of women and the heightening prosperity of mr edward freely  the yellow coat school was a double source of profit to the calculating confectioner for he opened an eatingroom for the superior workmen employed on the new school and he accommodated the pupils at the old school by giving great attention to the fancysugar department  when i think of the sweettasted swans and other ingenious white shapes crunched by the small teeth of that rising generation i am glad to remember that a certain amount of calcareous food has been held good for young creatures whose bones are not quite formed for i have observed these delicacies to have an inorganic flavour which would have recommended them greatly to that young lady of the spectators acquaintance who habitually made her dessert on the stems of tobaccopipes  as for the confectioner himself he made his way gradually into grimworth homes as his commodities did in spite of some initial repugnance somehow or other his reception as a guest seemed a thing that required justifying like the purchasing of his pastry  in the first place he was a stranger and therefore open to suspicion secondly the confectionery business was so entirely new at grimworth that its place in the scale of rank had not been distinctly ascertained  there was no doubt about drapers and grocers when they came of good old grimworth families like mr luff and mr prettyman they visited with the palfreys who farmed their own land played many a game at whist with the doctor and condescended a little towards the timbermerchant who had lately taken to the coaltrade also and had got new furniture but whether a confectioner should be admitted to this higher level of respectability or should be understood to find his associates among butchers and bakers was a new question on which tradition threw no light  his being a bachelor was in his favour and would perhaps have been enough to turn the scale even if mr edward freelys other personal pretensions had been of an entirely insignificant cast  but so far from this it very soon appeared that he was a remarkable young man who had been in the west indies and had seen many wonders by sea and land so that he could charm the ears of grimworth desdemonas with stories of strange fishes especially sharks which he had stabbed in the nick of time by bravely plunging overboard just as the monster was turning on his side to devour the cooks mate of terrible fevers which he had undergone in a land where the wind blows from all quarters at once of rounds of toast cut straight from the breadfruit trees of toes bitten off by land crabs of large honours that had been offered to him as a man who knew what was what and was therefore particularly needed in a tropical climate and of a creole heiress who had wept bitterly at his departure such conversational talents as these we know will overcome disadvantages of complexion and young towers whose cheeks were of the finest pink set off by a fringe of dark whisker was quite eclipsed by the presence of the sallow mr freely  so exceptional a confectioner elevated the business and might well begin to make disengaged hearts flutter a little  fathers and mothers were naturally more slow and cautious in their recognition of the newcomers merits  hes an amusing fellow said mr prettyman the highly respectable grocer  mrs prettyman was a miss fothergill and her sister had married a london mercer  hes an amusing fellow and ive no objection to his making one at the oyster club but hes a bit too fond of riding the high horse  hes uncommonly knowing ill allow but how came he to go to the indies  i should like that answered  its unnatural in a confectioner  im not fond of people that have been beyond seas if they cant give a good account how they happened to go  when folks go so far off its because theyve got little credit nearer homethats my opinion  however hes got some good rum but i dont want to be hand and glove with him for all that  it was this kind of dim suspicion which beclouded the view of mr freelys qualities in the maturer minds of grimworth through the early months of his residence there  but when the confectioner ceased to be a novelty the suspicions also ceased to be novel and people got tired of hinting at them especially as they seemed to be refuted by his advancing prosperity and importance  mr freely was becoming a person of influence in the parish he was found useful as an overseer of the poor having great firmness in enduring other peoples pain which firmness he said was due to his great benevolence he always did what was good for people in the end  mr chaloner had even selected him as clergymans churchwarden for he was a very handy man and much more of mr chaloners opinion in everything about church business than the older parishioners  mr freely was a very regular churchman but at the oyster club he was sometimes a little free in his conversation more than hinting at a life of sultanic selfindulgence which he had passed in the west indies shaking his head now and then and smiling rather bitterly as men are wont to do when they intimate that they have become a little too wise to be instructed about a world which has long been flat and stale to them  for some time he was quite general in his attentions to the fair sex combining the gallantries of a ladys man with a severity of criticism on the person and manners of absent belles which tended rather to stimulate in the feminine breast the desire to conquer the approval of so fastidious a judge  nothing short of the very best in the department of female charms and virtues could suffice to kindle the ardour of mr edward freely who had become familiar with the most luxuriant and dazzling beauty in the west indies  it may seem incredible that a confectioner should have ideas and conversation so much resembling those to be met with in a higher walk of life but it must be remembered that he had not merely travelled he had also bowlegs and a sallow small featured visage so that nature herself had stamped him for a fastidious connoisseur of the fair sex  at last however it seemed clear that cupid had found a sharper arrow than usual and that mr freelys heart was pierced  it was the general talk among the young people at grimworth  but was it really love and not rather ambition  miss fullilove the timbermerchants daughter was quite sure that if she were miss penny palfrey she would be cautious it was not a good sign when men looked so much above themselves for a wife  for it was no less a person than miss penelope palfrey second daughter of the mr palfrey who farmed his own land that had attracted mr freelys peculiar regard and conquered his fastidiousness and no wonder for the ideal as exhibited in the finest waxwork was perhaps never so closely approached by the real as in the person of the pretty penelope  her yellowish flaxen hair did not curl naturally i admit but its bright crisp ringlets were such smooth perfect miniature tubes that you would have longed to pass your little finger through them and feel their soft elasticity  she wore them in a crop for in those days when society was in a healthier state young ladies wore crops long after they were twenty and penelope was not yet nineteen  like the waxen ideal she had round blue eyes and round nostrils in her little nose and teeth such as the ideal would be seen to have if it ever showed them altogether she was a small round thing as neat as a pink and white double daisy and as guileless for i hope it does not argue guile in a pretty damsel of nineteen to think that she should like to have a beau and be engaged when her elder sister had already been in that position a year and a half  to be sure there was young towers always coming to the house but penny felt convinced he only came to see her brother for he never had anything to say to her and never offered her his arm and was as awkward and silent as possible  it is not unlikely that mr freely had early been smitten by pennys charms as brought under his observation at church but he had to make his way in society a little before he could come into nearer contact with them and even after he was well received in grimworth families it was a long while before he could converse with penny otherwise than in an incidental meeting at mr luffs  it was not so easy to get invited to long meadows the residence of the palfreys for though mr palfrey had been losing money of late years not being able quite to recover his feet after the terrible murrain which forced him to borrow his family were far from considering themselves on the same level even as the oldestablished tradespeople with whom they visited  the greatest people even kings and queens must visit with somebody and the equals of the great are scarce  they were especially scarce at grimworth which as i have before observed was a low parish mentioned with the most scornful brevity in gazetteers  even the great people there were far behind those of their own standing in other parts of this realm  mr palfreys farmyard doors had the paint all worn off them and the front garden walks had long been merged in a general weediness  still his father had been called squire palfrey and had been respected by the last grimworth generation as a man who could afford to drink too much in his own house  pretty penny was not blind to the fact that mr freely admired her and she felt sure that it was he who had sent her a beautiful valentine but her sister seemed to think so lightly of him all young ladies think lightly of the gentlemen to whom they are not engaged that penny never dared mention him and trembled and blushed whenever they met him thinking of the valentine which was very strong in its expressions and which she felt guilty of knowing by heart  a man who had been to the indies and knew the sea so well seemed to her a sort of public character almost like robinson crusoe or captain cook and penny had always wished her husband to be a remarkable personage likely to be put in mangnalls questions with which register of the immortals she had become acquainted during her one year at a boardingschool  only it seemed strange that a remarkable man should be a confectioner and pastry cook and this anomaly quite disturbed pennys dreams  her brothers she knew laughed at men who couldnt sit on horseback well and called them tailors but her brothers were very rough and were quite without that power of anecdote which made mr freely such a delightful companion  he was a very good man she thought for she had heard him say at mr luffs one day that he always wished to do his duty in whatever state of life he might be placed and he knew a great deal of poetry for one day he had repeated a verse of a song  she wondered if he had made the words of the valentineit ended in this way     without thee it is pain to live    but with thee it were sweet to die  poor mr freely her father would very likely objectshe felt sure he would for he always called mr freely that sugarplum fellow  oh it was very cruel when true love was crossed in that way and all because mr freely was a confectioner well penny would be true to him for all that and since his being a confectioner gave her an opportunity of showing her faithfulness she was glad of it  edward freely was a pretty name much better than john towers  young towers had offered her a rose out of his buttonhole the other day blushing very much but she refused it and thought with delight how much mr freely would be comforted if he knew her firmness of mind  poor little penny the days were so very long among the daisies on a grazing farm and thought is so activehow was it possible that the inward drama should not get the start of the outward  i have known young ladies much better educated and with an outward world diversified by instructive lectures to say nothing of literature and highlydeveloped fancywork who have spun a cocoon of visionary joys and sorrows for themselves just as penny did  her elder sister letitia who had a prouder style of beauty and a more worldly ambition was engaged to a woolfactor who came all the way from cattelton to see her and everybody knows that a woolfactor takes a very high rank sometimes driving a doublebodied gig  lettys notions got higher every day and penny never dared to speak of her cherished griefs to her lofty sisternever dared to propose that they should call at mr freelys to buy liquorice though she had prepared for such an incident by mentioning a slight sore throat  so she had to pass the shop on the other side of the marketplace and reflect with a suppressed sigh that behind those pink and white jars somebody was thinking of her tenderly unconscious of the small space that divided her from him  and it was quite true that when business permitted mr freely thought a great deal of penny  he thought her prettiness comparable to the loveliest things in confectionery he judged her to be of submissive temperlikely to wait upon him as well as if she had been a negress and to be silently terrified when his liver made him irritable and he considered the palfrey family quite the best in the parish possessing marriageable daughters  on the whole he thought her worthy to become mrs edward freely and all the more so because it would probably require some ingenuity to win her  mr palfrey was capable of horsewhipping a too rash pretender to his daughters hand and moreover he had three tall sons it was clear that a suitor would be at a disadvantage with such a family unless travel and natural acumen had given him a countervailing power of contrivance  and the first idea that occurred to him in the matter was that mr palfrey would object less if he knew that the freelys were a much higher family than his own  it had been foolish modesty in him hitherto to conceal the fact that a branch of the freelys held a manor in yorkshire and to shut up the portrait of his great uncle the admiral instead of hanging it up where a family portrait should be hungover the mantelpiece in the parlour  admiral freely kcb once placed in this conspicuous position was seen to have had one arm only and one eyein these points resembling the heroic nelsonwhile a certain pallid insignificance of feature confirmed the relationship between himself and his grandnephew  next mr freely was seized with an irrepressible ambition to posses mrs palfreys receipt for brawn hers being pronounced on all hands to be superior to his ownas he informed her in a very flattering letter carried by his errandboy  now mrs palfrey like other geniuses wrought by instinct rather than by rule and possessed no receiptsindeed despised all people who used them observing that people who pickled by book must pickle by weights and measures and such nonsense as for herself her weights and measures were the tip of her finger and the tip of her tongue and if you went nearer why of course for dry goods like flour and spice you went by handfuls and pinches and for wet there was a middlesized jugquite the best thing whether for much or little because you might know how much a teacupful was if youd got any use of your senses and you might be sure it would take five middlesized jugs to make a gallon  knowledge of this kind is like titians colouring difficult to communicate and as mrs palfrey once remarkably handsome had now become rather stout and asthmatical and scarcely ever left home her oral teaching could hardly be given anywhere except at long meadows  even a matron is not insusceptible to flattery and the prospect of a visitor whose great object would be to listen to her conversation was not without its charms to mrs palfrey  since there was no receipt to be sent in reply to mr freelys humble request she called on her more docile daughter penny to write a note telling him that her mother would be glad to see him and talk with him on brawn any day that he could call at long meadows  penny obeyed with a trembling hand thinking how wonderfully things came about in this world  in this way mr freely got himself introduced into the home of the palfreys and notwithstanding a tendency in the male part of the family to jeer at him a little as peaky and bowlegged he presently established his position as an accepted and frequent guest  young towers looked at him with increasing disgust when they met at the house on a sunday and secretly longed to try his ferret upon him as a piece of vermin which that valuable animal would be likely to tackle with unhesitating vigour  butso blind sometimes are parentsneither mr nor mrs palfrey suspected that penny would have anything to say to a tradesman of questionable rank whose youthful bloom was much withered young towers they thought had an eye to her and that was likely enough to be a match some day but penny was a child at present  and all the while penny was imagining the circumstances under which mr freely would make her an offer perhaps down by the row of damsontrees when they were in the garden before tea perhaps by letterin which case how would the letter begin  dearest penelope or my dear miss penelope or straight off without dear anything as seemed the most natural when people were embarrassed  but however he might make the offer she would not accept it without her fathers consent she would always be true to mr freely but she would not disobey her father  for penny was a good girl though some of her female friends were afterwards of opinion that it spoke ill for her not to have felt an instinctive repugnance to mr freely  but he was cautious and wished to be quite sure of the ground he trod on  his views on marriage were not entirely sentimental but were as duly mingled with considerations of what would be advantageous to a man in his position as if he had had a very large amount of money spent on his education  he was not a man to fall in love in the wrong place and so he applied himself quite as much to conciliate the favour of the parents as to secure the attachment of penny  mrs palfrey had not been inaccessible to flattery and her husband being also of mortal mould would not it might be hoped be proof against rumthat very fine jamaica rumof which mr freely expected always to have a supply sent him from jamaica  it was not easy to get mr palfrey into the parlour behind the shop where a mild backstreet light fell on the features of the heroic admiral but by getting hold of him rather late one evening as he was about to return home from grimworth the aspiring lover succeeded in persuading him to sup on some collared beef which after mrs palfreys brawn he would find the very best of cold eating  from that hour mr freely felt sure of success being in privacy with an estimable man old enough to be his father and being rather lonely in the world it was natural he should unbosom himself a little on subjects which he could not speak of in a mixed circleespecially concerning his expectations from his uncle in jamaica who had no children and loved his nephew edward better than any one else in the world though he had been so hurt at his leaving jamaica that he had threatened to cut him off with a shilling  however he had since written to state his full forgiveness and though he was an eccentric old gentleman and could not bear to give away money during his life mr edward freely could show mr palfrey the letter which declared plainly enough who would be the affectionate uncles heir  mr palfrey actually saw the letter and could not help admiring the spirit of the nephew who declared that such brilliant hopes as these made no difference to his conduct he should work at his humble business and make his modest fortune at it all the same  if the jamaica estate was to come to himwell and good  it was nothing very surprising for one of the freely family to have an estate left him considering the lands that family had possessed in time gone bynay still possessed in the northumberland branch  would not mr palfrey take another glass of rum and also look at the last years balance of the accounts  mr freely was a man who cared to possess personal virtues and did not pique himself on his family though some men would  we know how easily the great leviathan may be led when once there is a hook in his nose or a bridle in his jaws  mr palfrey was a large man but like leviathans his bulk went against him when once he had taken a turning  he was not a mercurial man who easily changed his point of view  enough  before two months were over he had given his consent to mr freelys marriage with his daughter penny and having hit on a formula by which he could justify it fenced off all doubts and objections his own included  the formula was this im not a man to put my head up an entry before i know where it leads  little penny was very proud and fluttering but hardly so happy as she expected to be in an engagement  she wondered if young towers cared much about it for he had not been to the house lately and her sister and brothers were rather inclined to sneer than to sympathize  grimworth rang with the news  all men extolled mr freelys good fortune while the women with the tender solicitude characteristic of the sex wished the marriage might turn out well  while affairs were at this triumphant juncture mr freely one morning observed that a stonecarver who had been breakfasting in the eatingroom had left a newspaper behind  it was the xshire gazette and xshire being a county not unknown to mr freely he felt some curiosity to glance over it and especially over the advertisements  a slight flush came over his face as he read  it was produced by the following announcementif david faux son of jonathan faux late of gilsbrook will apply at the office of mr strutt attorney of rodham he will hear of something to his advantage  fathers dead exclaimed mr freely involuntarily  can he have left me a legacy     chapter iii   perhaps it was a result quite different from your expectations that mr david faux should have returned from the west indies only a few years after his arrival there and have set up in his old business like any plain man who has never travelled  but these cases do occur in life since as we know men change their skies and see new constellations without changing their souls it will follow sometimes that they dont change their business under those novel circumstances  certainly this result was contrary to davids own expectations  he had looked forward you are aware to a brilliant career among the blacks but either because they had already seen too many white men or for some other reason they did not at once recognize him as a superior order of human being besides there were no princesses among them  nobody in jamaica was anxious to maintain david for the mere pleasure of his society and those hidden merits of a man which are so well known to himself were as little recognized there as they notoriously are in the effete society of the old world  so that in the dark hints that david threw out at the oyster club about that life of sultanic selfindulgence spent by him in the luxurious indies i really think he was doing himself a wrong i believe he worked for his bread and in fact took to cooking as after all the only department in which he could offer skilled labour  he had formed several ingenious plans by which he meant to circumvent people of large fortune and small faculty but then he never met with exactly the right circumstances  davids devices for getting rich without work had apparently no direct relation with the world outside him as his confectionery receipts had  it is possible to pass a great many bad half pennies and bad halfcrowns but i believe there has no instance been known of passing a halfpenny or a halfcrown as a sovereign  a sharper can drive a brisk trade in this world it is undeniable that there may be a fine career for him if he will dare consequences but david was too timid to be a sharper or venture in any way among the mantraps of the law  he dared rob nobody but his mother and so he had to fall back on the genuine value there was in himto be content to pass as a good halfpenny or to speak more accurately as a good confectioner  for in spite of some additional reading and observation there was nothing else he could make so much money by nay he found in himself even a capability of extending his skill in this direction and embracing all forms of cookery while in other branches of human labour he began to see that it was not possible for him to shine  fate was too strong for him he had thought to master her inclination and had fled over the seas to that end but she caught him tied an apron round him and snatching him from all other devices made him devise cakes and patties in a kitchen at kingstown  he was getting submissive to her since she paid him with tolerable gains but fevers and prickly heat and other evils incidental to cooks in ardent climates made him long for his native land so he took ship once more carrying his six years savings and seeing distinctly this time what were fates intentions as to his career  if you question me closely as to whether all the money with which he set up at grimworth consisted of pure and simple earnings i am obliged to confess that he got a sum or two for charitably abstaining from mentioning some other peoples misdemeanours altogether since no prospects were attached to his family name and since a new christening seemed a suitable commencement of a new life mr david faux thought it as well to call himself mr edward freely  but lo now in opposition to all calculable probability some benefit appeared to be attached to the name of david faux  should he neglect it as beneath the attention of a prosperous tradesman  it might bring him into contact with his family again and he felt no yearnings in that direction moreover he had small belief that the something to his advantage could be anything considerable  on the other hand even a small gain is pleasant and the promise of it in this instance was so surprising that david felt his curiosity awakened  the scale dipped at last on the side of writing to the lawyer and to be brief the correspondence ended in an appointment for a meeting between david and his eldest brother at mr strutts the vague something having been defined as a legacy from his father of eightytwo pounds three shillings  david you know had expected to be disinherited and so he would have been if he had not like some other indifferent sons come of excellent parents whose conscience made them scrupulous where much more highly instructed people often feel themselves warranted in following the bent of their indignation  good mrs faux could never forget that she had brought this illconditioned son into the world when he was in that entirely helpless state which excluded the smallest choice on his part and somehow or other she felt that his going wrong would be his fathers and mothers fault if they failed in one tittle of their parental duty  her notion of parental duty was not of a high and subtle kind but it included giving him his due share of the family property for when a man had got a little honest money of his own was he so likely to steal  to cut the delinquent son off with a shilling was like delivering him over to his evil propensities  no let the sum of twenty guineas which he had stolen be deducted from his share and then let the sum of three guineas be put back from it seeing that his mother had always considered three of the twenty guineas as his and though he had run away and was perhaps gone across the sea let the money be left to him all the same and be kept in reserve for his possible return  mr faux agreed to his wifes views and made a codicil to his will accordingly in time to die with a clear conscience  but for some time his family thought it likely that david would never reappear and the eldest son who had the charge of jacob on his hands often thought it a little hard that david might perhaps be dead and yet for want of certitude on that point his legacy could not fall to his legal heir  but in this state of things the opposite certitudenamely that david was still alive and in englandseemed to be brought by the testimony of a neighbour who having been on a journey to cattelton was pretty sure he had seen david in a gig with a stout man driving by his side  he could swear it was david though he could give no account why for he had no marks on him but no more had a white dog and that didnt hinder folks from knowing a white dog  it was this incident which had led to the advertisement  the legacy was paid of course after a few preliminary disclosures as to mr davids actual position  he begged to send his love to his mother and to say that he hoped to pay her a dutiful visit by and by but at present his business and near prospect of marriage made it difficult for him to leave home  his brother replied with much frankness  my mother may do as she likes about having you to see her but for my part i dont want to catch sight of you on the premises again  when folks have taken a new name theyd better keep to their new quinetance  david pocketed the insult along with the eightytwo pounds three and travelled home again in some triumph at the ease of a transaction which had enriched him to this extent  he had no intention of offending his brother by further claims on his fraternal recognition and relapsed with full contentment into the character of mr edward freely the orphan scion of a great but reduced family with an eccentric uncle in the west indies  i have already hinted that he had some acquaintance with imaginative literature and being of a practical turn he had you perceive applied even this form of knowledge to practical purposes  it was little more than a week after the return from his fruitful journey that the day of his marriage with penny having been fixed it was agreed that mrs palfrey should overcome her reluctance to move from home and that she and her husband should bring their two daughters to inspect little pennys future abode and decide on the new arrangements to be made for the reception of the bride  mr freely meant her to have a house so pretty and comfortable that she need not envy even a woolfactors wife  of course the upper room over the shop was to be the best sittingroom but also the parlour behind the shop was to be made a suitable bower for the lovely penny who would naturally wish to be near her husband though mr freely declared his resolution never to allow his wife to wait in the shop  the decisions about the parlour furniture were left till last because the party was to take tea there and about five oclock they were all seated there with the best muffins and buttered buns before them little penny blushing and smiling with her crop in the best order and a blue frock showing her little white shoulders while her opinion was being always asked and never given  she secretly wished to have a particular sort of chimney ornaments but she could not have brought herself to mention it  seated by the side of her yellow and rather withered lover who though he had not reached his thirtieth year had already crowsfeet about his eyes she was quite tremulous at the greatness of her lot in being married to a man who had travelled so muchand before her sister letty  the handsome letitia looked rather proud and contemptuous thought her nature brotherinlaw an odious person and was vexed with her father and mother for letting penny marry him  dear little penny  she certainly did look like a fresh whiteheart cherry going to be bitten off the stem by that lipless mouth would no deliverer come to make a slip between that cherry and that mouth without a lip  quite a family likeness between the admiral and you mr freely observed mrs palfrey who was looking at the family portrait for the first time  its wonderful and only a granduncle  do you feature the rest of your family as you know of  i cant say said mr freely with a sigh  my family have mostly thought themselves too high to take any notice of me  at this moment an extraordinary disturbance was heard in the shop as of a heavy animal stamping about and making angry noises and then of a glass vessel falling in shivers while the voice of the apprentice was heard calling master in great alarm  mr freely rose in anxious astonishment and hastened into the shop followed by the four palfreys who made a group at the parlourdoor transfixed with wonder at seeing a large man in a smockfrock with a pitchfork in his hand rush up to mr freely and hug him crying outzavy zavy bother zavy  it was jacob and for some moments david lost all presence of mind  he felt arrested for having stolen his mothers guineas  he turned cold and trembled in his brothers grasp  why hows this said mr palfrey advancing from the door  who is he  jacob supplied the answer by saying over and over again  ise zacob bother zacob  come o zee zavytill hunger prompted him to relax his grasp and to seize a large raised pie which he lifted to his mouth  by this time davids power of device had begun to return but it was a very hard task for his prudence to master his rage and hatred towards poor jacob  i dont know who he is he must be drunk he said in a low tone to mr palfrey  but hes dangerous with that pitchfork  hell never let it go  then checking himself on the point of betraying too great an intimacy with jacobs habits he added you watch him while i run for the constable  and he hurried out of the shop  why where do you come from my man said mr palfrey speaking to jacob in a conciliatory tone  jacob was eating his pie by large mouthfuls and looking round at the other good things in the shop while he embraced his pitchfork with his left arm and laid his left hand on some bath buns  he was in the rare position of a person who recovers a long absent friend and finds him richer than ever in the characteristics that won his heart  is zacobbother zacobt home  i love zavybother zavy he said as soon as mr palfrey had drawn his attention  zavy come back from z indiesgot mothers zinnies  wheres zavy he added looking round and then turning to the others with a questioning air puzzled by davids disappearance  its very odd observed mr palfrey to his wife and daughters  he seems to say freelys his brother come back from th indies  what a pleasant relation for us said letitia sarcastically  i think hes a good deal like mr freely  hes got just the same sort of nose and his eyes are the same colour  poor penny was ready to cry  but now mr freely reentered the shop without the constable  during his walk of a few yards he had had time and calmness enough to widen his view of consequences and he saw that to get jacob taken to the workhouse or to the lockup house as an offensive stranger might have awkward effects if his family took the trouble of inquiring after him  he must resign himself to more patient measures  on second thoughts he said beckoning to mr palfrey and whispering to him while jacobs back was turned hes a poor halfwitted fellow perhaps his friends will come after him  i dont mind giving him something to eat and letting him lie down for the night  hes got it into his head that he knows methey do get these fancies idiots do hell perhaps go away again in an hour or two and make no more ado  im a kindhearted man myselfi shouldnt like to have the poor fellow ill used  why hell eat a sovereigns worth in no time said mr palfrey thinking mr freely a little too magnificent in his generosity  eh zavy come back exclaimed jacob giving his dear brother another hug which crushed mr freelys features inconveniently against the stale of the pitchfork  aye aye said mr freely smiling with every capability of murder in his mind except the courage to commit it  he wished the bath buns might by chance have arsenic in them  mothers zinnies said jacob pointing to a glass jar of yellow lozenges that stood in the window  zive em me  david dared not do otherwise than reach down the glass jar and give jacob a handful  he received them in his smockfrock which he held out for more  theyll keep him quiet a bit at any rate thought david and emptied the jar  jacob grinned and mowed with delight  youre very good to this stranger mr freely said letitia and then spitefully as david joined the party at the parlourdoor i think you could hardly treat him better if he was really your brother  ive always thought it a duty to be good to idiots said mr freely striving after the most moral view of the subject  we might have been idiots ourselveseverybody might have been born idiots instead of having their right senses  i dont know where thered ha been victual for us all then observed mrs palfrey regarding the matter in a housewifely light  but let us sit down again and finish our tea said mr freely  let us leave the poor creature to himself  they walked into the parlour again but jacob not apparently appreciating the kindness of leaving him to himself immediately followed his brother and seated himself pitchfork grounded at the table  well said miss letitia rising i dont know whether you mean to stay mother but i shall go home  oh me too said penny frightened to death at jacob who had begun to nod and grin at her  well i think we had better be going mr palfrey said the mother rising more slowly  mr freely whose complexion had become decidedly yellower during the last halfhour did not resist this proposition  he hoped they should meet again under happier circumstances  its my belief the man is his brother said letitia when they were all on their way home  nonsense said mr palfrey  freelys got no brotherhes said so many and many a time hes an orphan hes got nothing but unclesleastwise one  whats it matter what an idiot says  what call had freely to tell lies  letitia tossed her head and was silent  mr freely left alone with his affectionate brother jacob brooded over the possibility of luring him out of the town early the next morning and getting him conveyed to gilsbrook without further betrayals  but the thing was difficult  he saw clearly that if he took jacob himself his absence conjoined with the disappearance of the stranger would either cause the conviction that he was really a relative or would oblige him to the dangerous course of inventing a story to account for his disappearance and his own absence at the same time  david groaned there come occasions when falsehood is felt to be inconvenient  it would perhaps have been a longerheaded device if he had never told any of those clever fibs about his uncles grand and otherwise for the palfreys were simple people and shared the popular prejudice against lying  even if he could get jacob away this time what security was there that he would not come again having once found the way  o guineas  o lozenges what enviable people those were who had never robbed their mothers and had never told fibs  david spent a sleepless night while jacob was snoring close by  was this the upshot of travelling to the indies and acquiring experience combined with anecdote  he rose at break of day as he had once before done when he was in fear of jacob and took all gentle means to rouse this fatal brother from his deep sleep he dared not be loud because his apprentice was in the house and would report everything  but jacob was not to be roused  he fought out with his fist at the unknown cause of disturbance turned over and snored again  he must be left to wake as he would  david with a cold perspiration on his brow confessed to himself that jacob could not be got away that day  mr palfrey came over to grimworth before noon with a natural curiosity to see how his future soninlaw got on with the stranger to whom he was so benevolently inclined  he found a crowd round the shop  all grimworth by this time had heard how freely had been fastened on by an idiot who called him brother zavy and the younger population seemed to find the singular stranger an unwearying source of fascination while the householders dropped in one by one to inquire into the incident  why dont you send him to the workhouse said mr prettyman  youll have a row with him and the children presently and hell eat you up  the workhouse is the proper place for him let his kin claim him if hes got any  those may be your feelings mr prettyman said david his mind quite enfeebled by the torture of his position  what is he your brother then said mr prettyman looking at his neighbour freely rather sharply  all men are our brothers and idiots particular so said mr freely who like many other travelled men was not master of the english language  come come if hes your brother tell the truth man said mr prettyman with growing suspicion  dont be ashamed of your own flesh and blood  mr palfrey was present and also had his eye on freely  it is difficult for a man to believe in the advantage of a truth which will disclose him to have been a liar  in this critical moment david shrank from this immediate disgrace in the eyes of his future fatherinlaw  mr prettyman he said i take your observations as an insult  ive no reason to be otherwise than proud of my own flesh and blood  if this poor man was my brother more than all men are i should say so  a tall figure darkened the door and david lifting his eyes in that direction saw his eldest brother jonathan on the doorsill  ill stay wi zavy shouted jacob as he too caught sight of his eldest brother and running behind the counter he clutched david hard  what he is here said jonathan faux coming forward  my mother would have no nay as hed been away so long but i must see after him and it struck me he was very like come after you because wed been talking of you o late and where you lived  david saw there was no escape he smiled a ghastly smile  what is this a relation of yours sir said mr palfrey to jonathan  aye its my innicent of a brother sure enough said honest jonathan a fine trouble and cost he is to us in th eating and other things but we must bear whats laid on us  and your names freely is it said mr prettyman  nay nay my names faux i know nothing o freelys said jonathan curtly  come he added turning to david i must take some news to mother about jacob  shall i take him with me or will you undertake to send him back  take him if you can make him loose his hold of me said david feebly  is this gentleman here in the confectionery line your brother then sir said mr prettyman feeling that it was an occasion on which format language must be used  i dont want to own him said jonathan unable to resist a movement of indignation that had never been allowed to satisfy itself  he ran away from home with good reasons in his pocket years ago he didnt want to be owned again i reckon  mr palfrey left the shop he felt his own pride too severely wounded by the sense that he had let himself be fooled to feel curiosity for further details  the most pressing business was to go home and tell his daughter that freely was a poor sneak probably a rascal and that her engagement was broken off  mr prettyman stayed with some internal selfgratulation that he had never given in to freely and that mr chaloner would see now what sort of fellow it was that he had put over the heads of older parishioners  he considered it due from him mr prettyman that for the interests of the parish he should know all that was to be known about this interloper grimworth would have people coming from botany bay to settle in it if things went on in this way  it soon appeared that jacob could not be made to quit his dear brother david except by force  he understood with a clearness equal to that of the most intelligent mind that jonathan would take him back to skimmed milk appledumpling broad beans and pork  and he had found a paradise in his brothers shop  it was a difficult matter to use force with jacob for he wore heavy nailed boots and if his pitchfork had been mastered he would have resorted without hesitation to kicks  nothing short of using guile to bind him hand and foot would have made all parties safe  let him stay said david with desperate resignation frightened above all things at the idea of further disturbances in his shop which would make his exposure all the more conspicuous  you go away again and to morrow i can perhaps get him to go to gilsbrook with me  hell follow me fast enough i daresay he added with a halfgroan  very well said jonathan gruffly  i dont see why you shouldnt have some trouble and expense with him as well as the rest of us  but mind you bring him back safe and soon else motherll never rest  on this arrangement being concluded mr prettyman begged mr jonathan faux to go and take a snack with him an invitation which was quite acceptable and as honest jonathan had nothing to be ashamed of it is probable that he was very frank in his communications to the civil draper who pursuing the benefit of the parish hastened to make all the information he could gather about freely common parochial property  you may imagine that the meeting of the club at the woolpack that evening was unusually lively  every member was anxious to prove that he had never liked freely as he called himself  faux was his name was it  fox would have been more suitable  the majority expressed a desire to see him hooted out of the town  mr freely did not venture over his doorsill that day for he knew jacob would keep at his side and there was every probability that they would have a train of juvenile followers  he sent to engage the woolpack gig for an early hour the next morning but this order was not kept religiously a secret by the landlord  mr freely was informed that he could not have the gig till seven and the grimworth people were early risers  perhaps they were more alert than usual on this particular morning for when jacob with a bag of sweets in his hand was induced to mount the gig with his brother david the inhabitants of the marketplace were looking out of their doors and windows and at the turning of the street there was even a muster of apprentices and schoolboys who shouted as they passed in what jacob took to be a very merry and friendly way nodding and grinning in return  huzzay david faux hows your uncle was their mornings greeting  like other pointed things it was not altogether impromptu  even this public derision was not so crushing to david as the horrible thought that though he might succeed now in getting jacob home again there would never be any security against his coming back like a wasp to the honeypot  as long as david lived at grimworth jacobs return would be hanging over him  but could he go on living at grimworthan object of ridicule discarded by the palfreys after having revelled in the consciousness that he was an envied and prosperous confectioner  david liked to be envied he minded less about being loved  his doubts on this point were soon settled  the mind of grimworth became obstinately set against him and his viands and the new school being finished the eatingroom was closed  if there had been no other reason sympathy with the palfreys that respectable family who had lived in the parish time out of mind would have determined all welltodo people to decline freelys goods  besides he had absconded with his mothers guineas who knew what else he had done in jamaica or elsewhere before he came to grimworth worming himself into families under false pretences  females shuddered  dreadful suspicions gathered round him his green eyes his bowlegs had a criminal aspect  the rector disliked the sight of a man who had imposed upon him and all boys who could not afford to purchase hooted david faux as they passed his shop certainly no man now would pay anything for the goodwill of mr freelys business and he would be obliged to quit it without a peculium so desirable towards defraying the expense of moving  in a few months the shop in the marketplace was again to let and mr david faux alias mr edward freely had gonenobody at grimworth knew whither  in this way the demoralization of grimworth women was checked young mrs steene renewed her efforts to make light mincepies and having at last made a batch so excellent that mr steene looked at her with complacency as he ate them and said they were the best he had ever eaten in his life she thought less of bulbuls and renegades ever after the secrets of the finer cookery were revived in the breasts of matronly housewives and daughters were again anxious to be initiated in them  you will further i hope be glad to bear that some purchases of drapery made by pretty penny in preparation for her marriage with mr freely came in quite as well for her wedding with young towers as if they had been made expressly for the latter occasion  for pennys complexion had not altered and blue always became it best  here ends the story of mr david faux confectioner and his brother jacob  and we see in it i think an admirable instance of the unexpected forms in which the great nemesis hides herself  1860
