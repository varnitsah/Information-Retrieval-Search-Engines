1088572	afloat and ashore  a sea tale  by  james fenimore cooper        homekeeping youth have ever homely wits two gentlemen of verona    preface  the writer has published so much truth which the world has insisted was fiction and so much fiction which has been received as truth that in the present instance he is resolved to say nothing on the subject each of his readers is at liberty to believe just as much or as little of the matter here laid before him or her as may suit his or her notions prejudices knowledge of the world or ignorance if anybody is disposed to swear he knows precisely where clawbonny is that he was well acquainted with old mr hardinge nay has often heard him preachlet him make his affidavit in welcome should he get a little wide of the mark it will not be the first document of that nature which has possessed the same weakness  it is possible that certain captious persons may be disposed to inquire into the cui bono of such a book the answer is this everything which can convey to the human mind distinct and accurate impressions of events social facts professional peculiarities or past history whether of the higher or more familiar character is of use all that is necessary is that the pictures should be true to nature if not absolutely drawn from living sitters the knowledge we gain by our looser reading often becomes serviceable in modes and manners little anticipated in the moments when it is acquired  perhaps the greater portion of all our peculiar opinions have their foundation in prejudices these prejudices are produced in consequence of its being out of the power of any one man to see or know every thing the most favoured mortal must receive far more than half of all that he learns on his faith in others and it may aid those who can never be placed in positions to judge for themselves of certain phases of men and things to get pictures of the same drawn in a way to give them nearer views than they might otherwise obtain this is the greatest benefit of all light literature in general it being possible to render that which is purely fictitious even more useful than that which is strictly true by avoiding extravagancies by pourtraying with fidelity and as our friend marble might say by generalizing with discretion  this country has undergone many important changes since the commencement of the present century some of these changes have been for the better others we think out of all question for the worse the last is a fact that can be known to the generation which is coming into life by report only and these pages may possibly throw some little light on both points in representing things as they were the population of the republic is probably something more than eighteen millions and a half today in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred it was but a little more than five millions in 1800 the population of newyork was somewhat less than six hundred thousand souls today it is probably a little less than two millions seven hundred thousand souls in 1800 the town of newyork had sixty thousand inhabitants whereas including brooklyn and williamsburg which then virtually had no existence it must have at this moment quite four hundred thousand these are prodigious numerical changes that have produced changes of another sort although an increase of numbers does not necessarily infer an increase of high civilization it reasonably leads to the expectation of great melioration in the commoner comforts  such has been the result and to those familiar with facts as they now exist the difference will probably be apparent in these pages  although the moral changes in american society have not kept even pace with those that are purely physical many that are essential have nevertheless occurred of all the british possessions on this continent newyork after its conquest from the dutch received most of the social organization of the mother country under the dutch even it had some of these characteristic peculiarities in its patroons the lords of the manor of the new netherlands some of the southern colonies it is true had their caciques and other semifeudal and semisavage noblesse but the system was of short continuance the peculiarities of that section of the country arising principally from the existence of domestic slavery on an extended scale with newyork it was different a conquered colony the mother country left the impression of its own institutions more deeply engraved than on any of the settlements that were commenced by grants to proprietors or under charters from the crown it was strictly a royal colony and so continued to be down to the hour of separation the social consequences of this state of things were to be traced in her habits unlit the current of immigration became so strong as to bring with it those that were conflicting if not absolutely antagonist the influence of these two sources of thought is still obvious to the reflecting giving rise to a double set of social opinions one of which bears all the characteristics of its new england and puritanical origin while the other may be said to come of the usages and notions of the middle states proper  this is said in anticipation of certain strictures that will be likely to follow some of the incidents of our story it not being always deemed an essential in an american critic that he should understand his subject too many of them indeed justify the retort of the man who derided the claims to knowledge of life set up by a neighbour that had been to meetin and had been to mill we can all obtain some notions of the portion of a subject that is placed immediately before our eyes the difficulty is to understand that which we have no means of studying  on the subject of the nautical incidents of this book we have endeavoured to be as exact as our authorities will allow we are fully aware of the importance of writing what the world thinks rather than what is true and are not conscious of any very palpable errors of this nature  it is no more than fair to apprize the reader that our tale is not completed in the first part or the volumes that are now published this the plan of the book would not permit but we can promise those who may feel any interest in the subject that the season shall not pass away so far as it may depend on ourselves without bringing the narrative to a close poor captain wallingford is now in his sixtyfifth year and is naturally desirous of not being hung up long on the tenterhooks of expectation so near the close of life  the old gentleman having seen much and suffered much is entitled to end his days in peace in this mutual frame of mind between the principal and his editors the public shall have no cause to complain of unnecessary delay whatever may be its rights of the same nature on other subjects  the authorperhaps editor would be the better worddoes not feel himself responsible for all the notions advanced by the hero of this tale and it may be as well to say as much that one born in the revolution should think differently from the men of the present day in a hundred things is to be expected it is in just this difference of opinion that the lessons of the book are to be found     afloat and ashore    chapter i    and imy joy of life is fled   my spirits power my bosoms glow   the raven locks that gracd my head   wave in a wreath of snow   and where the star of youth arose   i deemd lifes lingering ray should close   and those lovd trees my tomb oershade   beneath whose arching bowers my childhood playd   mrs hemans   i was born in a valley not very remote from the sea  my father had been a sailor in youth and some of my earliest recollections are connected with the history of his adventures and the recollections they excited he had been a boy in the war of the revolution and had seen some service in the shipping of that period among other scenes he witnessed he had been on board the trumbull in her action with the wattthe hardestfought naval combat of that warand he particularly delighted in relating its incidents  he had been wounded in the battle and bore the marks of the injury in a scar that slightly disfigured a face that without this blemish would have been singularly handsome  my mother after my poor fathers death always spoke of even this scar as a beauty spot agreeably to my own recollections the mark scarcely deserved that commendation as it gave one side of the face a grim and fierce appearance particularly when its owner was displeased  my father died on the farm on which he was born and which descended to him from his greatgrandfather an english emigrant that had purchased it of the dutch colonist who had originally cleared it from the woods the place was called clawbonny which some said was good dutch others bad dutch and now and then a person ventured a conjecture that it might be indian bonny it was in one sense at least for a lovelier farm there is not on the whole of the wide surface of the empire state what does not always happen in this wicked world it was as good as it was handsome it consisted of three hundred and seventytwo acres of firstrate land either arable or of rich river bottom in meadows and of more than a hundred of rocky mountain side that was very tolerably covered with wood the first of our family who owned the place had built a substantial onestory stone house that bears the date of 1707 on one of its gables and to which each of his successors had added a little until the whole structure got to resemble a cluster of cottages thrown together without the least attention to order or regularity there were a porch a front door and a lawn however the latter containing half a dozen acres of a soil as black as ones hat and nourishing eight or ten elms that were scattered about as if their seeds had been sown broadcast in addition to the trees and a suitable garniture of shrubbery this lawn was coated with a sward that in the proper seasons rivalled all i have read or imagined of the emerald and shorn slopes of the swiss valleys  clawbonny while it had all the appearance of being the residence of an affluent agriculturist had none of the pretension of these later times the house had an air of substantial comfort without an appearance that its interior in no manner contradicted the ceilings were low it is true nor were the rooms particularly large but the latter were warm in winter cool in summer and tidy neat and respectable all the year round both the parlours had carpets as had the passages and all the better bedrooms and there were an oldfashioned chintz settee well stuffed and cushioned and curtains in the big parlour as we called the best apartmentthe pretending name of drawingroom not having reached our valley as far back as the year 1796 or that in which my recollections of the place as it then existed are the most vivid and distinct  we had orchards meadows and ploughed fields all around us while the barns granaries styes and other buildings of the farm were of solid stone like the dwelling and all in capital condition in addition to the place which he inherited from my grandfather quite without any encumbrance well stocked and supplied with utensils of all sorts my father had managed to bring with him from sea some fourteen or fifteen thousand dollars which he carefully invested in mortgages in the county he got twentyseven hundred pounds currency with my mother similarly bestowed and two or three great landed proprietors and as many retired merchants from york excepted captain wallingford was generally supposed to be one of the stiffest men in ulster county i do not know exactly how true was this report though i never saw anything but the abundance of a better sort of american farm under the paternal roof and i know that the poor were never sent away emptyhanded  it as true that our wine was made of currants but it was delicious and there was always a sufficient stock in the cellar to enable us to drink it three or four years old my father however had a small private collection of his own out of which he would occasionally produce a bottle and i remember to have heard governor george clinton afterwards vice president who was an ulster county man and who sometimes stopped at clawbonny in passing say that it was excellent east india madeira as for clarets burgundy hock and champagne they were wines then unknown in america except on the tables of some of the principal merchants and here and there on that of some travelled gentleman of an estate larger than common when i say that governor george clinton used to stop occasionally and taste my fathers madeira i do not wish to boast of being classed with those who then composed the gentry of the state to this in that day we could hardly aspire though the substantial hereditary property of my family gave us a local consideration that placed us a good deal above the station of ordinary yeomen had we lived in one of the large towns our association would unquestionably have been with those who are usually considered to be one or two degrees beneath the highest class these distinctions were much more marked immediately after the war of the revolution than they are today and they are more marked today even than all but the most lucky or the most meritorious whichever fortune dignifies are willing to allow  the courtship between my parents occurred while my father was at home to be cured of the wounds he had received in the engagement between the trumbull and the watt i have always supposed this was the moving cause why my mother fancied that the grimlooking scar on the left side of my fathers face was so particularly becoming  the battle was fought in june 1780 and my parents were married in the autumn of the same year my father did not go to sea again until after my birth which took place the very day that cornwallis capitulated at yorktown these combined events set the young sailor in motion for he felt he had a family to provide for and he wished to make one more mark on the enemy in return for the beautyspot his wife so gloried in he accordingly got a commission in a privateer made two or three fortunate cruises and was able at the peace to purchase a prizebrig which he sailed as master and owner until the year 1790 when he was recalled to the paternal roof by the death of my grandfather  being an only son the captain as my father was uniformly called inherited the land stock utensils and crops as already mentioned while the six thousand pounds currency that were at use went to my two aunts who were thought to be well married to men in their own class of life in adjacent counties  my father never went to sea after he inherited clawbonny  from that time down to the day of his death he remained on his farm with the exception of a single winter passed in albany as one of the representatives of the county  in his day it was a credit to a man to represent a county and to hold office under the state though the abuse of the elective principle not to say of the appointing power has since brought about so great a change then a member of congress was somebody now he is onlya member of congress  we were but two surviving children three of the family dying infants leaving only my sister grace and myself to console our mother in her widowhood the dire accident which placed her in this the saddest of all conditions for a woman who had been a happy wife occurred in the year 1794 when i was in my thirteenth year and grace was turned of eleven it may be well to relate the particulars  there was a mill just where the stream that runs through our valley tumbles down to a level below that on which the farm lies and empties itself into a small tributary of the hudson this mill was on our property and was a source of great convenience and of some profit to my father there he ground all the grain that was consumed for domestic purposes for several miles around and the tolls enabled him to fatten his porkers and beeves in a way to give both a sort of established character in a word the mill was the concentrating point for all the products of the farm there being a little landing on the margin of the creek that put up from the hudson whence a sloop sailed weekly for town my father passed half his time about the mill and landing superintending his workmen and particularly giving directions about the fitting of the sloop which was his property also and about the gear of the mill he was clever certainly and had made several useful suggestions to the millwright who occasionally came to examine and repair the works but he was by no means so accurate a mechanic as he fancied himself to be he had invented some new mode of arresting the movement and of setting the machinery in motion when necessary what it was i never knew for it was not named at clawbonny after the fatal accident occurred  one day however in order to convince the millwright of the excellence of this improvement my father caused the machinery to be stopped and then placed his own weight upon the large wheel in order to manifest the sense he felt in the security of his invention he was in the very act of laughing exultingly at the manner in which the millwright shook his head at the risk he ran when the arresting power lost its control of the machinery the heavy head of water burst into the buckets and the wheel whirled round carrying my unfortunate father with it i was an eyewitness of the whole and saw the face of my parent as the wheel turned it from me still expanded in mirth there was but one revolution made when the wright succeeded in stopping the works this brought the great wheel back nearly to its original position and i fairly shouted with hysterical delight when i saw my father standing in his tracks as it might be seemingly unhurt unhurt he would have been though he must have passed a fearful keelhauling but for one circumstance he had held on to the wheel with the tenacity of a seaman since letting go his hold would have thrown him down a cliff of near a hundred feet in depth and he actually passed between the wheel and the planking beneath it unharmed although there was only an inch or two to spare but in rising from this fearful strait his head had been driven between a projecting beam and one of the buckets in a way to crush one temple in upon the brain so swift and sudden had been the whole thing that on turning the wheel his lifeless body was still inclining on its periphery retained erect i believe in consequence of some part of his coat getting attached to the head of a nail this was the first serious sorrow of my life i had always regarded my father as one of the fixtures of the world as a part of the great system of the universe and had never contemplated his death as a possible thing that another revolution might occur and carry the country back under the dominion of the british crown would have seemed to me far more possible than that my father could die bitter truth now convinced me of the fallacy of such notions  it was months and months before i ceased to dream of this frightful scene at my age all the feelings were fresh and plastic and grief took strong hold of my heart grace and i used to look at each other without speaking long after the event the tears starting to my eyes and rolling down her cheeks our emotions being the only communications between us but communications that no uttered words could have made so plain even now i allude to my mothers anguish with trembling she was sent for to the house of the miller where the body lay and arrived unapprised of the extent of the evil never can inever shall i forget the outbreakings of her sorrow when she learned the whole of the dreadful truth she was in fainting fits for hours one succeeding another and then her grief found tongue there was no term of endearment that the heart of woman could dictate to her speech that was not lavished on the lifeless clay she called the dead her miles her beloved miles her husband her own darling husband and by such other endearing epithets once she seemed as if resolute to arouse the sleeper from his endless trance and she said solemnly fatherdear dearest father appealing as it might be to the parent of her children the tenderest and most comprehensive of all womans terms of endearmentfatherdear dearest father open your eyes and look upon your babesyour precious girl and noble boy do not thus shut out their sight for ever  but it was in vain there lay the lifeless corpse as insensible as if the spirit of god had never had a dwelling within it the principal injury had been received on that muchprized scar and again and again did my poor mother kiss both as if her caresses might yet restore her husband to life all would not do the same evening the body was carried to the dwelling and three days later it was laid in the churchyard by the side of three generations of forefathers at a distance of only a mile from clawbonny  that funeral service too made a deep impression on my memory we had some church of england people in the valley and old miles wallingford the first of the name a substantial english franklin had been influenced in his choice of a purchase by the fact that one of queen annes churches stood so near the farm to that little church a tiny edifice of stone with a high pointed roof without steeple bell or vestryroom had three generations of us been taken to be christened and three including my father had been taken to be buried excellent kindhearted justminded mr hardinge read the funeral service over the man whom his own father had in the same humble edifice christened  our neighbourhood has much altered of late years but then few higher than mere labourers dwelt among us who had not some sort of hereditary claim to be beloved  so it was with our clergyman whose father had been his predecessor having actually married my grandparents  the son had united my father and mother and now he was called on to officiate at the funeral obsequies of the first  grace and i sobbed as if our hearts would break the whole time we were in the church and my poor sensitive nervous little sister actually shrieked as she heard the sound of the first clod that fell upon the coffin our mother was spared that trying scene finding it impossible to support it she remained at home on her knees most of the day on which the funeral occurred  time soothed our sorrows though my mother a woman of more than common sensibility or it were better to say of uncommon affections never entirely recovered from the effects of her irreparable loss she had loved too well too devotedly too engrossingly ever to think of a second marriage and lived only to care for the interests of miles wallingfords children i firmly believe we were more beloved because we stood in this relation to the deceased than because we were her own natural offspring her health became gradually undermined and three years after the accident of the mill mr hardinge laid her at my fathers side i was now sixteen and can better describe what passed during the last days of her existence than what took place at the death of her husband grace and i were apprised of what was so likely to occur quite a month before the fatal moment arrived and we were not so much overwhelmed with sudden grief as we had been on the first great occasion of family sorrow though we both felt our loss keenly and my sister i think i may almost say inextinguishably mr hardinge had us both brought to the bedside to listen to the parting advice of our dying parent and to be impressed with a scene that is always healthful if rightly improved you baptized these two dear children good mr hardinge she said in a voice that was already enfeebled by physical decay and you signed them with the sign of the cross in token of christs death for them and i now ask of your friendship and pastoral care to see that they are not neglected at the most critical period of their livesthat when impressions are the deepest and yet the most easily made god will reward all your kindness to the orphan children of your friends the excellent divine a man who lived more for others than for himself made the required promises and the soul of my mother took its flight in peace  neither my sister nor myself grieved as deeply for the loss of this last of our parents as we did for that of the first  we had both seen so many instances of her devout goodness had been witnesses of so great a triumph of her faith as to feel an intimate though silent persuasion that her death was merely a passage to a better state of existencethat it seemed selfish to regret still we wept and mourned even while in one sense i think we rejoiced she was relieved from much bodily suffering and i remember when i went to take a last look at her beloved face that i gazed on its calm serenity with a feeling akin to exultation as i recollected that pain could no longer exercise dominion over her frame and that her spirit was then dwelling in bliss  bitter regrets came later it is true and these were fully sharednay more than sharedby grace  after the death of my father i had never bethought me of the manner in which he had disposed of his property i heard something said of his will and gleaned a little accidentally of the forms that had been gone through in proving the instrument and of obtaining its probate shortly after my mothers death however mr hardinge had a free conversation with both me and grace on the subject when we learned for the first time the disposition that had been made my father had bequeathed to me the farm mill landing sloop stock utensils crops c c in full property subject however to my mothers use of the whole until i attained my majority after which i was to give her complete possession of a comfortable wing of the house which had every convenience for a small family within itself certain privileges in the fields dairy styes orchards meadows granaries c and to pay her three hundred pounds currency per annum in money grace had four thousand pounds that were at use and i had all the remainder of the personal property which yielded about five hundred dollars ayear as the farm sloop mill landing c produced a net annual income of rather more than a thousand dollars besides all that was consumed in housekeeping i was very well off in the way of temporal things for one who had been trained in habits as simple as those which reigned at clawbonny  my father had left mr hardinge the executor and my mother an executrix of his will with survivorship he had also made the same provision as respected the guardians  thus grace and i became the wards of the clergyman alone on the death of our last remaining parent this was grateful to us both for we both truly loved this good man and what was more we loved his children of these there were two of ages corresponding very nearly with our own rupert hardinge being not quite a year older than i was myself and lucy his sister about six months younger than grace  we were all four strongly attached to each other and had been so from infancy mr hardinge having had charge of my education as soon as i was taken from a womans school  i cannot say however that rupert hardinge was ever a boy to give his father the delight that a studious wellconducted considerate and industrious child has it so much in his power to yield to his parent of the two i was much the best scholar and had been pronounced by mr hardinge fit to enter college a twelvemonth before my mother died though she declined sending me to yale the institution selected by my father until my schoolfellow was similarly prepared it having been her intention to give the clergymans son a thorough education in furtherance of his fathers views of bringing him up to the church this delay so well and kindly meant had the effect of changing the whole course of my subsequent life  my father it seems wished to make a lawyer of me with the natural desire of seeing me advanced to some honourable position in the state but i was averse to anything like serious mental labour and was greatly delighted when my mother determined to keep me out of college a twelvemonth in order that my friend rupert might be my classmate it is true i learned quick and was fond of reading but the first i could not very well help while the reading i liked was that which amused rather than that which instructed me as for rupert though not absolutely dull but on the other hand absolutely clever in certain things he disliked mental labour even more than myself while he liked selfrestraint of any sort far less his father was sincerely pious and regarded his sacred office with too much reverence to think of bringing up a cossetpriest though he prayed and hoped that his sons inclinations under the guidance of providence would take that direction he seldom spoke on the subject himself but i ascertained his wishes through my confidential dialogues with his children lucy seemed delighted with the idea looking forward to the time when her brother would officiate in the same desk where her father and grandfather had now conducted the worship of god for more than half a century a period of time that to us young people seemed to lead us back to the dark ages of the country and all this the dear girl wished for her brother in connection with his spiritual rather than his temporal interests inasmuch as the living was worth only a badlypaid salary of one hundred and fifty pounds currency per annum together with a small but comfortable rectory and a glebe of fiveandtwenty acres of very tolerable land which it was thought no sin in that day for the clergyman to work by means of two male slaves whom with as many females he had inherited as part of the chattels of his mother  i had a dozen slaves also negroes who as a race had been in the family almost as long as clawbonny about half of these blacks were singularly laborious and useful viz four males and three of the females but several of the remainder were enjoying otium and not altogether without dignitate as heirlooms to be fed clothed and lodged for the good or evil they had done there were some smallfry in our kitchens too that used to roll about on the grass and munch fruit in the summer ad libitum and stand so close in the chimneycorners in cold weather that i have often fancied they must have been as a legal wit of new york once pronounced certain eastern coalmines to be incombustible these negroes all went by the patronymic of clawbonny there being among them hector clawbonny venus clawbonny caesar clawbonny rose clawbonnywho was as black as a crowromeo clawbonny and julietta commonly called julee clawbonny who were with pharaoh potiphar sampson and nebuchadnezzar all clawbonnys in the last resort neb as the namesake of the herbiferous king of babylon was called was about my own age and had been a sort of humble playfellow from infancy and even now when it was thought proper to set him about the more serious toil which was to mark his humble career i often interfered to call him away to be my companion with the rod the fowlingpiece or in the boat of which we had one that frequently descended the creek and navigated the hudson for miles at a time under my command the lad by such means and through an offhand friendliness of manner that i rather think was characteristic of my habits at that day got to love me as a brother or comrade it is not easy to describe the affection of an attached slave which has blended with it the pride of a partisan the solicitude of a parent and the blindness of a lover  i do think neb had more gratification in believing himself particularly belonging to master miles than i ever had in any quality or thing i could call my own neb moreover liked a vagrant life and greatly encouraged rupert and myself in idleness and a desultory manner of misspending hours that could never be recalled the first time i ever played truant was under the patronage of neb who decoyed me away from my books to go nutting on the mountain stoutly maintaining that chestnuts were just as good as the spellingbook or any primer that could be bought in york  i have forgotten to mention that the death of my mother which occurred in the autumn brought about an immediate change in the condition of our domestic economy grace was too young being only fourteen to preside over such a household and i could be of little use either in the way of directing or advising mr hardinge who had received a letter to that effect from the dying saint that was only put into his hand the day after the funeral with a view to give her request the greater weight rented the rectory and came to clawbonny to live bringing with him both his children  my mother knew that his presence would be of the greatest service to the orphans she left behind her while the money saved from his own household expenses might enable this singleminded minister of the altar to lay by a hundred or two for lucy who at his demise might otherwise be left without a penny as it was then said cents not having yet come much into fashion  this removal gave grace and me much pleasure for she was as fond of lucy as i was of rupert and to tell the truth so was i too four happier young people were not to be found in the state than we thus became each and all of us finding in the arrangement exactly the association which was most agreeable to our feelings previously we only saw each other every day now we saw each other all day at night we separated at an early hour it is true each having his or her room but it was to meet at a still earlier hour the next morning and to resume our amusements in company from study all of us were relieved for a month or two and we wandered through the fields nutted gathered fruit or saw others gather it as well as the crops taking as much exercise as possible in the open air equally for the good of our bodies and the lightening of our spirits  i do not think vanity or any feeling connected with selflove misleads me when i say it would have been difficult to find four young people more likely to attract the attention of a passerby than we four were in the fall of 1797 as for rupert hardinge he resembled his mother and was singularly handsome in face as well as graceful in movements  he had a native gentility of air of which he knew how to make the most and a readiness of tongue and a flow of spirits that rendered him an agreeable if not a very instructive companion i was not illlooking myself though far from possessing the striking countenance of my young associate  in manliness strength and activity however i had essentially the advantage over him few youths of my age surpassing me in masculine qualities of this nature after i had passed my twelfth year my hair was a dark auburn and it was the only thing about my face perhaps that would cause a stranger to notice it but this hung about my temples and down my neck in rich ringlets until frequent applications of the scissors brought it into something like subjection  it never lost its beauty entirely and though now white as snow it is still admired but grace was the one of the party whose personal appearance would be most likely to attract attention her face beamed with sensibility and feeling being one of those countenances on which nature sometimes delights to impress the mingled radiance sweetness truth and sentiment that men ascribe to angels her hair was lighter than mine her eyes of a heavenly blue all softness and tenderness her cheeks just of the tint of the palest of the coloured roses and her smile so full of gentleness and feeling that again and again it has controlled my ruder and more violent emotions when they were fast getting the mastery in form some persons might have thought grace in a slight degree too fragile though her limbs would have been delicate models for the study of a sculptor  lucy too had certainly great perfection particularly in figure though in the crowd of beauty that has been so profusely lavished on the youthful in this country she would not have been at all remarked in a large assembly of young american girls her face was pleasing nevertheless and there was a piquant contrast between the raven blackness of her hair the deep blue of her eyes and the dazzling whiteness of her skin her colour too was high and changeful with her emotions as for teeth she had a set that one might have travelled weeks to meet with their equals and though she seemed totally unconscious of the advantage she had a natural manner of showing them that would have made a far less interesting face altogether agreeable  her voice and laugh too when happy and free from care were joyousness itself  it would be saying too much perhaps to assert that any human being was ever totally indifferent to his or her personal appearance still i do not think either of our party rupert alone excepted ever thought on the subject unless as it related to others down to the period of which i am now writing i knew and saw and felt that my sister was far more beautiful than any of the young girls of her age and condition that i had seen in her society and i had pleasure and pride in the fact i knew that i resembled her in some respects but i was never coxcomb enough to imagine i had half her goodlooks even allowing for difference of sex my own conceit so far as i then had anyplenty of it came a year or two laterbut my own conceit in 1797 rather ran in the direction of my athletic properties physical force which was unusually great for sixteen and stature as for rupert i would not have exchanged these manly qualities for twenty times his good looks and a thought of envy never crossed my mind on the subject i fancied it might be well enough for a parson to be a little delicate and a good deal handsome but for one who intended to knock about the world as i had it already in contemplation to do strength health vigour courage and activity were much more to be desired than beauty  lucy i never thought of as handsome at all i saw she was pleasing fancied she was even more so to me than to any one else and i never looked upon her sunny cheerful and yet perfectly feminine face without a feeling of security and happiness as for her honest eyes they invariably met my own with an open frankness that said as plainly as eyes could say anything there was nothing to be concealed    chapter ii    cease to persuade my loving proteus   homekeeping youth have ever homely wits   i rather would entreat thy company   to see the wonders of the world abroad   two gentlemen ofclawbonny   during the year that succeeded after i was prepared for yale mr hardinge had pursued a very judicious course with my education instead of pushing me into books that were to be read in the regular course of that institution with the idea of lightening my future labours which would only have been providing excuses for future idleness we went back to the elementary works until even he was satisfied that nothing more remained to be done in that direction i had my two grammars literally by heart notes and all then we revised as thoroughly as possible reading everything anew and leaving no passage unexplained i learned to scan too a fact that was sufficient to make a reputation for a scholar in america half a century since  after this we turned our attention to mathematics a science mr hardinge rightly enough thought there was no danger of my acquiring too thoroughly we mastered arithmetic of which i had a good deal of previous knowledge in a few weeks and then i went through trigonometry with some of the more useful problems in geometry this was the point at which i had arrived when my mothers death occurred  footnote  the writers master taught him to scan virgil in 1801 this gentleman was a graduate of oxford in 1803 the class to which the writer then belonged in yale was the first that ever attempted to scan in that institution the quantities were in sad discredit in this country years after this though columbia and harvard were a little in advance of yale all that was ever done in the last college during the writers time was to scan the ordinary hexameter of homer and virgil  as for myself i frankly admit a strong disinclination to be learned the law i might be forced to study but practising it was a thing my mind had long been made up never to do there was a small vein of obstinacy in my disposition that would have been very likely to carry me through in such a determination even had my mother lived though deference to her wishes would certainly have carried me as far as the license even now she was no more i was anxious to ascertain whether she had left any directions or requests on the subject either of which would have been laws to me i talked with rupert on this matter and was a little shocked with the levity with which he treated it  what difference can it make to your parents now he said with an emphasis that grated on my nerves whether you become a lawyer or a merchant or a doctor or stay here on your farm and be a farmer like your father  my father had been a sailor i answered quick as lightning  true and a noble manly gentlemanlike calling it is  i never see a sailor that i do not envy him his advantages  why miles neither of us has ever been in town even while your mothers boatmen or your own as they are now go there regularly once aweek i would give the world to be a sailor  you rupert why you know that your father in tends or rather wishes that you should become a clergyman  a pretty appearance a young man of my figure would make in the pulpit miles or wearing a surplice no no there have been two hardinges in the church in this century and i have a fancy also to the sea i suppose you know that my greatgrandfather was a captain in the navy and he brought his son up a parson now turn about is fair play and the parson ought to give a son back to a manofwar  ive been reading the lives of naval men and its surprising how many clergymens sons in england go into the navy and how many sailors sons get to be priests  but there is no navy in this country nownot even a single shipofwar i believe  that is the worst of it congress did pass a law two or three years since to build some frigates but they have never been launched now washington has gone out of office i suppose we shall never have anything good in the country  i revered the name of washington in common with the whole country but i did not see the sequitur rupert however cared little for logical inferences usually asserting such things as he wished and wishing such as he asserted after a short pause he continued the discourse  you are now substantially your own master he said and can do as you please should you go to sea and not like it you have only to come back to this place where you will be just as much the master as if you had remained here superintending cattle cutting hay and fattening pork the whole time  i am not my own master rupert any more than you are yourself i am your fathers ward and must so remain for more than five years to come i am just as much under his control as you yourself  rupert laughed at this and tried to persuade me it would be a good thing to relieve his worthy fether of all responsibility in the affair if i had seriously determined never to go to yale or to be a lawyer by going off to sea clandestinely and returning when i was ready if i ever was to make a sailor no time was to be lost for all with whom he had conversed assured him the period of life when such things were best learned was between sixteen and twenty this i thought probable enough and i parted from my friend with a promise of conversing further with him on the subject at an early opportunity  i am almost ashamed to confess that ruperts artful sophism nearly blinded my eyes to the true distinction between right and wrong if mr hardinge really felt himself bound by my fathers wishes to educate me for the bar and my own repugnance to the profession was unconquerable why should i not relieve him from the responsibility at once by assuming the right to judge for myself and act accordingly so far as mr hardinge was concerned i had little difficulty in coming to a conclusion though the profound deference i still felt for my fathers wishes and more especially for those of my sainted mother had a hold on my heart and an influence on my conduct that was not so easily disposed of i determined to have a frank conversation with mr hardinge therefore in order to ascertain how far either of my parents had expressed anything that might be considered obligatory on me my plan went as far as to reveal my own desire to be a sailor and to see the world but not to let it be known that i might go off without his knowledge as this would not be so absolutely relieving the excellent divine from all responsibility in the premises as was contemplated in the scheme of his own son  an opportunity soon occurred when i broached the subject by asking mr hardinge whether my father in his will had ordered that i should be sent to yale and there be educated for the bar he had done nothing of the sort had he left any particular request writing or message on the subject at all not that mr hardinge knew it is true the last had heard his friend once or twice make some general remark which would lead one to suppose that captain wallingford had some vague expectations i might go to the bar but nothing further my mind felt vastly relieved by these admissions for i knew my mothers tenderness too well to anticipate that she would dream of absolutely dictating in a matter that was so clearly connected with my own happiness and tastes when questioned on this last point mr hardinge did not hesitate to say that my mother had conversed with him several times concerning her views as related to my career in life she wished me to go to yale and then to read law even though i did not practise  as soon as this much was said the conscientious servant of god paused to note the effect on me reading disappointment in my countenance i presume he immediately added but your mother miles laid no restraint on you for she knew it was you who was to follow the career and not herself i should as soon think of commanding whom he was to marry as to think of forcing a profession on him she added he is the one who is to decide this and he only we may try to guide and influence him but not go beyond this i leave you dear sir to do all you think best in this matter certain that your own wisdom will be aided by the providence of a kind master  i now plainly told mr hardinge my desire to see the world and to be a sailor the divine was astounded at this declaration and i saw that he was grieved i believe some religious objections were connected with his reluctance to consent to my following the sea as a calling at any rate it was easy to discover that these objections were lasting and profound in that day few americans travelled by way of an accomplishment at all and those few belonged to a class in society so much superior to mine as to render it absurd to think of sending me abroad with similar views  nor would my fortune justify such an expenditure i was well enough off to be a comfortable and free housekeeper and as independent as a king on my own farm living in abundance nay in superfluity so far as all the ordinary wants were concerned but men hesitated a little about setting up for gentlemen at large in the year 1797 the country was fast getting rich it is true under the advantages of its neutral position but it had not yet been long enough emancipated from its embarrassments to think of playing the nabob on eight hundred pounds currency ayear the interview terminated with a strong exhortation from my guardian not to think of abandoning my books for any project as visionary and useless as the hope of seeing the world in the character of a common sailor  i related all this to rupert who i now perceived for the first time did not hesitate to laugh at some of his fathers notions as puritanical and exaggerated he maintained that every one was the best judge of what he liked and that the sea had produced quite as fair a proportion of saints as the land he was not certain considering the great difference there was in numbers that more good men might not be traced in connection with the ocean than in connection with any other pursuit  take the lawyers now for instance miles he said and what can you make out of them in the way of religion i should like to know they hire their consciences out at so much per diem and talk and reason just as zealously for the wrong as they do for the right  by george that is true enough rupert there is old david dockett i remember to have heard mr hardinge say always did double duty for his fee usually acting as witness as well as advocate they tell me he will talk by the hour of facts that he and his clients get up between them and look the whole time as if he believed all he said to be true  rupert laughed at this sally and pushed the advantage it gave him by giving several other examples to prove how much his father was mistaken by supposing that a man was to save his soul from perdition simply by getting admitted to the bar after discussing the matter a little longer to my astonishment rupert came out with a plain proposal that he and i should elope go to new york and ship as foremastlads in some indiaman of which there were then many sailing at the proper season from that port i did not dislike the idea so far as i was myself concerned but the thought of accompanying rupert in such an adventure startled me i knew i was sufficiently secure of the future to be able to risk a little at the present moment but such was not the case with my friend if i made a false step at so early an age i had only to return to clawbonny where i was certain to find competence and a home but with rupert it was very different of the moral hazards i ran i then knew nothing and of course they gave me no concern  like all inexperienced persons i supposed myself too strong in virtue to be in any danger of contamination and this portion of the adventure was regarded with the selfcomplacency with which the untried are apt to regard their own powers of endurance i thought myself morally invulnerable  but rupert might find it difficult to retrace any serious error made at his time of life this consideration would have put an end to the scheme so far as my companion was concerned had not the thought suggested itself that i should always have it in my own power to aid my friend letting something of this sort escape me rupert was not slow in enlarging on it though this was done with great tact and discretion he proved that by the time we both came of age he would be qualified to command a ship and that doubtless i would naturally desire to invest some of my spare cash in a vessel the accumulations of my estate alone would do this much within the next five years and then a career of wealth and prosperity would lie open before us both  it is a good thing miles no doubt continued this tempting sophist to have money at use and a large farm and a mill and such things but many a ship nets more money in a single voyage than your whole estate would sell for those that begin with nothing too they tell me are the most apt to succeed and if we go off with our clothes only we shall begin with nothing too success may be said to be certain i like the notion of beginning with nothing it is so american  it is in truth rather a besetting weakness of america to suppose that men who have never had any means for qualifying themselves for particular pursuits are the most likely to succeed in them and especially to fancy that those who begin poor are in a much better way for acquiring wealth than they who commence with some means and i was disposed to lean to this latter doctrine myself though i confess i cannot recall an instance in which any person of my acquaintance has given away his capital however large and embarrassing it may have been in order to start fair with his poorer competitors nevertheless there was something taking to my imagination in the notion of being the fabricator of my own fortune in that day it was easy to enumerate every dwelling on the banks of the hudson that aspired to be called a seat and i had often heard them named by those who were familiar with the river i liked the thought of erecting a house on the clawbonny property that might aspire to equal claims and to be the owner of a seat though only after i had acquired the means myself to carry out such a project at present i owned only a house my ambition was to own a seat  in a word rupert and i canvassed this matter in every possible way for a month now leaning to one scheme and now to another until i determined to lay the whole affair before the two girls under a solemn pledge of secrecy as we passed hours in company daily opportunities were not wanting to effect this purpose i thought my friend was a little shy on this project but i had so much affection for grace and so much confidence in lucys sound judgment that i was not to be turned aside from the completion of my purpose it is now more than forty years since the interview took place in which this confidence was bestowed but every minute occurrence connected with it is as fresh in my mind as if the whole had taken place only yesterday  we were all four of us seated on a rude bench that my mother had caused to be placed under the shade of an enormous oak that stood on the most picturesque spot perhaps on the whole farm and which commanded a distant view of one of the loveliest reaches of the hudson our side of the river in general does not possess as fine views as the eastern for the reason that all our own broken and in some instances magnificent background of mountains fills up the landscape for our neighbours while we are obliged to receive the picture as it is set in a humbler frame but there are exquisite bits to be found on the western bank and this was one of the very best of them the water was as placid as molten silver and the sails of every vessel in sight were hanging in listless idleness from their several spars representing commerce asleep grace had a deep feeling for natural scenery and she had a better mode of expressing her thoughts on such occasions than is usual with girls of fourteen she first drew our attention to the view by one of her strong eloquent bursts of eulogium and lucy met the remark with a truthful simple answer that showed abundant sympathy with the sentiment though with less of exaggeration of manner and feeling perhaps i seized the moment as favourable for my purpose and spoke out  if you admire a vessel so much grace i said you will probably be glad to hear that i think of becoming a sailor  a silence of near two minutes succeeded during which time i affected to be gazing at the distant sloops and then i ventured to steal a glance at my companions i found graces mild eyes earnestly riveted on my face and turning from their anxious expression with a little uneasiness i encountered those of lucy looking at me as intently as if she doubted whether her ears had not deceived her  a sailor milesmy sister now slowly repeatedi thought it settled you were to study law  as far from that as we are from england ive fully made up my mind to see the world if i can and rupert here  what of rupert here grace asked a sudden change again coming over her sweet countenance though i was altogether too inexperienced to understand its meaning he is certainly to be a clergymanhis dear fathers assistant and a long long very long time hence his successor  i could see that rupert was whistling on a low key and affecting to look cool but my sisters solemn earnest astonished manner had more effect on us both i believe than either would have been willing to own  come girls i said at length putting the best face on the matter there is no use in keeping secrets from youbut remember that what i am about to tell you is a secret and on no account is to be betrayed  to no one but mr hardinge answered grace if you intend to be a sailor he ought to know it  that comes from looking at our duties superficially i had caught this phrase from my friend and not distinguishing properly between their shadows and their substance  duties superficially i do not understand you miles  certainly mr hardinge ought to be told what profession you mean to follow remember brother he now fills the place of a parent to you  he is not more my parent than rupertsi fancy you will admit that much  rupert again what has rupert to do with your going to sea  promise me then to keep my secret and you shall know all both you and lucy must give me your words  i know you will not break them when once given  promise him grace said lucy in a low tone and a voice that even at that age i could perceive was tremulous  if we promise we shall learn everything and then may have some effect on these headstrong boys by our advice  boys you cannot mean lucy that rupert is not to be a clergymanyour fathers assistant that rupert means to be a sailor too  one never knows what boys will do let us promise them dear then we can better judge  i do promise you miles said my sister in a voice so solemn as almost to frighten me  and i miles added lucy but it was so low i had to lean forward to catch the syllables  this is honest and rightit was honest perhaps but very wrongand it convinces me that you are both reasonable and will be of use to us rupert and i have both made up our minds and intend to be sailors  exclamations followed from both girls and another long silence succeeded  as for the law hang all law i continued hemming and determined to speak like a man i never heard of a wallingford who was a lawyer  but you have both heard of hardinges who were clergymen said grace endeavouring to smile though the expression of her countenance was so painful that even now i dislike to recall it  and sailors too put in rupert a little more stoutly than i thought possible my fathers grandfather was an officer in the navy  and my father was a sailor himselfin the navy too  but there is no navy in this country now miles returned lucy in an expostulating tone  what of that there are plenty of ships the ocean is just as big and the world just as wide as if we had a navy to cover the first i see no great objection on that accountdo you ru  certainly not what we want is to go to sea and that can be done in an indiaman as well as in a manofwar  yes said i stretching myself with a little importance  i fancy an indiaman a vessel that goes all the way to calcutta round the cape of good hope in the track of vasquez de gama isnt exactly an albany sloop  who is vasquez de gama demanded lucy with so much quickness as to surprise me  why a noble portuguese who discovered the cape of good hope and first sailed round it and then went to the indies you see girls even nobles are sailors and why should not rupert and i be sailors  it is not that miles my sister answered every honest calling is respectable have you and rupert spoken to mr hardinge on this subject  not exactlynot spokenhinted onlythat is blindlynot so as to be understood perhaps  he will never consent boys and this was uttered with something very like an air of triumph  we have no intention of asking it of him grace rupert and i intend to be off next week without saying a word to mr hardinge on the subject  another long eloquent silence succeeded during which i saw lucy bury her face in her apron while the tears openly ran down my sisters cheek  you do notcannot mean to do anything so cruel miles grace at length said  it is exactly because it will not be cruel that we intend to do ithere i nudged rupert with my elbow as a hint that i wanted assistance but he made no other reply than an answering nudge which i interpreted into as much as if he had said in terms youve got into the scrape in your own way and you may get out of it in the same manner  yes i continued finding succour hopeless yes thats just it  what is just it miles you speak in a way to show that you are not satisfied with yourselfneither you nor rupert is satisfied with himself if the truth were known  i not satisfied with myself rupert not satisfied with himself you never were more mistaken in your life grace if there ever were two boys in new york state that were well satisfied with themselves they are just rupert and i  here lucy raised her face from the apron and burst into a laugh the tears filling her eyes all the while  believe them dear grace she said they are precisely two selfsatisfied silly fellows that have got some ridiculous notions in their heads and then begin to talk about superficial views of duties and all such nonsense  my father will set it all right and the boys will have had their talk  not so last miss lucy if you please your father will not know a syllable of the matter until you tell him all about it after we are gone we intend to relieve him from all responsibility in the premises  this last sounded very profound and a little magnificent to my imagination and i looked at the girls to note the effect grace was weeping and weeping only but lucy looked saucy and mocking even while the tears bedewed her smiling face as rain sometimes falls while the sun is shining  yes i repeated with emphasis of all responsibility in the premises i hope that is plain english and good english although i know that mr hardinge has been trying to make you both so simple in your language that you turn up your noses at a profound sentiment whenever you hear one  in 1797 the grandiose had by no means made the deep invasion into the everyday language of the country that it has since done anything of the sublime or of the recondite school was a good deal more apt to provoke a smile than it is todaythe improvement proceeding as i have understood through better judges than myself from the great melioration of mind and manners that is to be traced to the speeches in congress and to the profundities of the newspapers  rupert however frequently ornamented his ideas and i may truly say everything ambitious that adorned my discourse was derived from his example i almost thought lucy impertinent for presuming to laugh at sentiments which came from such a source and by way of settling my own correctness of thought and terms i made no bones of falling back on my great authority by fairly pointing him out  i thought so exclaimed lucy now laughing with all her heart though a little hysterically i thought so for this is just like rupert who is always talking to me about assuming the responsibility and conclusions in the premises and all such nonsense leave the boys to my father grace and he will assume the responsibility of concluding the premises and the whole of the foolish scheme along with it  this would have provoked me had not grace manifested so much sisterly interest in my welfare that i was soon persuaded to tell herthat minx lucy overhearing every syllable though i had half a mind to tell her to go awayall about our project  you see i continued if mr hardinge knows anything about our plan people will say he ought to have stopped us he a clergyman and not able to keep two lads of sixteen or seventeen from running away and going to sea they will say as if it were so easy to prevent two spirited youths from seeing the world whereas if he knew nothing about it nobody can blame him that is what i call relieving him from the responsibility now we intend to be off next week or as soon as the jackets and trowsers that are making for us under the pretence of being boatdresses are finished we mean to go down the river in the sailboat taking neb with us to bring the boat back now you know the whole story there will be no occasion to leave a letter for mr hardinge for three hours after we have sailed you can tell him everything we shall be gone a year at the end of that time you may look for us both and glad enough shall we all be to see each other rupert and i will be young men then though you call us boys now  this last picture a good deal consoled the girls rupert too who had unaccountably kept back throwing the labouringoar altogether on me came to the rescue and with his subtle manner and oily tongue began to make the wrong appear the right i do not think he blinded his own sister in the least but i fear he had too much influence over mine lucy though all heart was as much matteroffact as her brother was a sophist he was ingenious in glozing over truths she nearly unerring in detecting them i never knew a greater contrast between two human beings than there was between these two children of the same parents in this particular i have heard that the son took after the mother in this respect and that the daughter took after the father though mrs hardinge died too early to have had any moral influence on the character of her children  we came again and again to the discussion of our subject during the next two or three days the girls endeavoured earnestly to persuade us to ask mr hardinges permission for the step we were about to undertake but all in vain  we lads were so thoroughly determined to relieve the divine from all responsibility in the premises that they might as well have talked to stones we knew these justminded sincere upright girls would not betray us and continued obdurate to the last as we expected as soon as convinced their importunities were useless they seriously set about doing all they could to render us comfortable  they made us duck bags to hold our clothes two each and mended our linen stockings c and even helped to procure us some clothes more suited to the contemplated expedition than most of those we already possessed our long togs indeed we determined to leave behind us retaining just one suit each and that of the plainest quality in the course of a week everything was ready our bags well lined being concealed in the storehouse at the landing of this building i could at any moment procure the key my authority as heirapparent being very considerable already on the farm  as for neb he was directed to have the boat all ready for the succeeding tuesday evening it being the plan to sail the day after the wallingford of clawbonny this was the name of the sloop had gone on one of her regular trips in order to escape a pursuit i had made all the calculations about the tide and knew that the wallingford would go out about nine in the morning leaving us to follow before midnight it was necessary to depart at night and when the wharf was clear in order to avoid observation  tuesday was an uneasy nervous and sad day for us all mr hardinge excepted as the last had not the smallest distrust he continued calm quiet and cheerful as was his wont rupert had a consciencestricken and furtive air about him while the eyes of the two dear girls were scarcely a moment without tears grace seemed now the most composed of the two and i have since suspected that she had had a private conversation with my ingenious friend whose convincing powers were of a very extraordinary quality when he set about their use in downright earnest as for lucy she seemed to me to have been weeping the entire day  at nine oclock it was customary for the whole family to separate after prayers most of us went to bed at that early hour though mr hardinge himself seldom sought his pillow until midnight this habit compelled us to use a good deal of caution in getting out of the house in which rupert and myself succeeded however without discovery just as the clock struck eleven we had taken leave of the girls in a hasty manner in a passage shaking hands and each of us kissing his own sister as he affected to retire for the night  to own the truth we were much gratified in finding how reasonably grace and lucy behaved on the occasion and not a little surprised for we had expected a scene particularly with the former  we walked away from the house with heavy hearts few leaving the paternal roof for the first time to enter upon the chances of the world without a deep sense of the dependence in which they had hitherto lived we walked fast and silently and reached the wharf in less than half an hour a distance of near two miles i was just on the point of speaking to neb whose figure i could see in the boat when i caught a glimpse of two female forms within six feet of me there were grace and lucy in tears both waiting our arrival with a view to see us depart i confess i was shocked and concerned at seeing these two delicate girls so far from their home at such an hour and my first impulse was to see them both safely back before i would enter the boat but to this neither would consent all my entreaties were thrown away and i was obliged to submit  i know not exactly how it happened but of the fact i am certain odd as it may seem at a moment like that when about to separate instead of each youths getting his own sister aside to make his last speeches and say his last say to each of us got his friends sister aside i do not mean that we were making love or anything of the sort we were a little too young perhaps for that but we obeyed an impulse which as rupert would have said produced that result  what passed between grace and her companion i do not know as for lucy and myself it was all plainsailing and fair dealing the excellent creature forced on me six gold pieces which i knew had come to her as an heirloom from her mother and which i had often heard her declare she never meant to use unless in the last extremity she knew i had but five dollars on earth and that rupert had not one and she offered me this gold i told her rupert had better take it no i had better take it i should use it more prudently than rupert and would use it for the good of both  besides you are rich she said smiling through her tears and can repay mei lend them to you to rupert i should have to give them i could not refuse the generous girl and took the money all halfjoes with a determination to repay them with interest then i folded her to my heart and kissed her six or eight times with fervour the first time i had done such a thing in two years and tore myself away  i do not think rupert embraced grace but i confess i do not know although we were standing within three or four yards of each other the whole time  write mileswrite rupert said the sobbing girls leaning forward from the wharf as we shoved off it was not so dark but we could see their dear forms for several minutes or until a bend in the creek put a dark mass of earth between us and them  such was the manner of my departure from clawbonny in the month of september 1797 i wanted a few days of being seventeen rupert was six months older and neb was his senior again by near a twelvemonth everything was in the boat but our hearts mine i can truly say remained with the two beloved creatures we left on the wharf while ruperts was betwixt and between i fancyseldom absolutely deserting the dear tenement in which it was encased by nature    chapter iii    theres a youth in this city it were a great pity   that he from our lasses should wander awa   for hes bonny and braw weelfavoured witha   and his hair has a natural buckle and a   his coat is the hue of his bonnet so blue   his pocket is white as the newdriven snaw   his hose they are blue and his shoon like the slae   and his clean siller buckles they dazzle us a   burns   we had selected our time well as respects the hour of departure it was young ebb and the boat floated swiftly down the creek though the high banks of the latter would have prevented our feeling any wind even if there were a breeze on the river our boat was of some size slooprigged and halfdecked but nebs vigorous arms made her move through the water with some rapidity and to own the truth the lad sprang to his work like a true runaway negro i was a skilful oarsman myself having received many lessons from my father in early boyhood and being in almost daily practice for seven mouths in the year the excitement of the adventure its romance or what for a short time seemed to me to be romance and the secret apprehension of being detected which i believe accompanies every clandestine undertaking soon set me in motion also i took one of the oars and in less than twenty minutes the grace  lucy for so the boat was called emerged from between two high steep banks and entered on the broader bosom of the hudson  neb gave a halfsuppressed negrolike cry of exultation as we shot out from our cover and ascertained that there was a pleasant and fair breeze blowing  in three minutes we had the jib and mainsail on the boat the helm was up the sheet was eased off and we were gliding downstream at the rate of something like five miles an hour i took the helm almost as a matter of course rupert being much too indolent to do anything unnecessarily while neb was far too humble to aspire to such an office while master miles was there willing and ready in that day indeed it was so much a matter of course for the skipper of a hudson river craft to steer that most of the people who lived on the banks of the stream imagined that sir john jervis lord anson and the other great english admirals of whom they had read and heard usually amused themselves with that employment out on the ocean i remember the hearty laugh in which my unfortunate father indulged when mr hardinge once asked him how he could manage to get any sleep on account of this very duty but we were very green up at clawbonny in most things that related to the world  the hour that succeeded was one of the most painful i ever passed in my life i recalled my father his manly frankness his liberal bequests in my favour and his precepts of respect and obedience all of which it now seemed to me i had openly dishonoured then came the image of my mother with her love and sufferings her prayers and her mild but earnest exhortations to be good i thought i could see both these parents regarding me with sorrowful though not with reproachful countenances they appeared to be soliciting my return with a species of silent but not the less eloquent warnings of the consequences grace and lucy and their sobs and admonitions and entreaties to abandon my scheme and to write and not to remain away long and all that tender interest had induced two warmhearted girls to utter at our parting came fresh and vividly to my mind the recollection proved nearly too much for me nor did i forget mr hardinge and the distress he would certainly feel when he discovered that he had not only lost his ward but his only son then clawbonny itself the house the orchards the meadows the garden the mill and all that belonged to the farm began to have a double value in my eyes and to serve as so many cords attached to my heartstrings and to remind me that the rover  drags at each remove a lengthening chain  i marvelled at ruperts tranquility i did not then understand his character as thoroughly as i subsequently got to know it all that he most prized was with him in the boat in fact and this lessened his grief at parting from less beloved objects where rupert was there was his paradise  as for neb i do believe his head was over his shoulder for he affected to sit with his face downstream so long as the hills that lay in the rear of clawbonny could be at all distinguished this must have proceeded from tradition or instinct or some latent negro quality for i do not think the fellow fancied he was running away he knew that his two young masters were but he was fully aware he was my property and no doubt thought as long as he staid in my company he was in the line of his legitimate duty then it was my plan that he should return with the boat and perhaps these backward glances were no more than the shadows of coming events cast in his case behind  rupert was indisposed to converse for to tell the truth he had eaten a hearty supper and began to feel drowsy and i was too much wrapped up in my own busy thoughts to solicit any communications i found a sort of saddened pleasure in setting a watch for the night therefore which had an air of seamanlike duty about it that in a slight degree revived my old taste for the profession it was midnight and i took the first watch myself bidding my two companions to crawl under the halfdeck and go to sleep this they both did without any parley rupert occupying an inner place while neb lay with his legs exposed to the night air  the breeze freshened and for some time i thought it might be necessary to reef though we were running dead before the wind i succeeded in holding on however and i found the grace  lucy was doing wonders in my watch  when i gave rupert his call at four oclock the boat was just approaching two frowning mountains where the river was narrowed to a third or fourth of its former width and by the appearance of the shores and the dim glimpses i had caught of a village of no great size on the right bank i knew we were in what is called newburgh bay this was the extent of our former journeyings south all three of us having once before and only once been as low as fishkill landing which lies opposite to the place that gives this part of the river its name  rupert now took the helm and i went to sleep the wind still continued fresh and fair and i felt no uneasiness on account of the boat it is true there were two parts of the navigation before us of which i had thought a little seriously but not sufficiently so to keep me awake these were the race a passage in the highlands and tappan sea both points on the hudson of which the navigators of that classical stream were fond of relating the marvels the first i knew was formidable only later in the autumn and as for the last i hoped to enjoy some of its wonders in the morning in this very justifiable expectation i fell asleep  neb did not call me until ten oclock i afterwards discovered that rupert kept the helm for only an hour and then calculating that from five until nine were four hours he thought it a pity the negro should not have his share of the glory of that night when i was awakened it was merely to let me know that it was time to eat somethingneb would have starved before he would precede his young master in that necessary occupationand i found rupert in a deep and pleasant sleep at my side  we were in the centre of tappan and the highlands had been passed in safety neb expatiated a little on the difficulties of the navigation the river having many windings besides being bounded by high mountains but after all he admitted that there was water enough wind enough and a road that was plain enough from this moment excitement kept us wide awake everything was new and everything seemed delightful the day was pleasant the wind continued fair and nothing occurred to mar our joy i had a little map one neither particularly accurate nor very well engraved and i remember the importance with which after having ascertained the fact myself i pointed out to my two companions the rocky precipices on the western bank as new jersey evenrupert was struck with this important circumstance as for neb he was actually in ecstasies rolling his large black eyes and showing his white teeth until he suddenly closed his truly coral and plump lips to demand what new jersey meant of course i gratified this laudable desire to obtain knowledge and neb seemed still more pleased than ever now he had ascertained that new jersey was a state travelling was not as much of an everyday occupation at that time as it is now and it was in truth something for three american lads all under nineteen to be able to say that they had seen a state other than their own  notwithstanding the rapid progress we had made for the first few hours of our undertaking the voyage was far from being ended about noon the wind came out light from the southward and having a floodtide we were compelled to anchor this made us all uneasy for while we were stationary we did not seem to be running away the ebb came again at length however and then we made sail and began to turn down with the tide it was near sunset before we got a view of the two or three spires that then piloted strangers to the town new york was not the commercial emporium in 1796 so highsounding a title indeed scarce belonging to the simple english of the period it requiring a very great collection of halfeducated men to venture on so ambitious an appellationthe only emporium that existed in america during the last century being a slopshop in water street and on the island of manhattan commercial emporium was a flight of fancy indeed that must have required a whole board of aldermen and an extra supply of turtle to sanction what is meant by a literary emporium i leave those editors who are native and to the manor born to explain  we first saw the state prison which was then new and a most imposing edifice according to our notions as we drew near the town like the gallows first seen by a traveller in entering a strange country it was a pledge of civilization  neb shook his head as he gazed at it with a moralizing air and said it had a wicked look for myself i own i did not regard it altogether without dread on rupert it made less impression than on any of the three  he was always somewhat obtuse on the subject of morals  footnote  it may be well to tell the european who shall happen to read this book that in america a states prison is not for prisoners of state but for common rogues the term coming from the name borne by the local governments  new york in that day and on the hudson side of the town commenced a short distance above duane street  between greenwich as the little hamlet around the state prison was called and the town proper was an interval of a mile and a half of open fields dotted here and there with countryhouses much of this space was in broken hills and a few piles of lumber lay along the shores st johns church had no existence and most of the ground in its vicinity was in low swamp as we glided along the wharves we caught sight of the first market i had then ever seensuch proofs of an advanced civilization not having yet made their way into the villages of the interior it was called the bear from the circumstance that the first meat ever exposed for sale in it was of that animal but the appellation has disappeared before the intellectual refinement of these later timesthe name of the soldier and statesman washington having fairly supplanted that of the bear whether this great moral improvement was brought about by the philosophical society or the historical society or the merchants or the aldermen of new york i have never ascertained if the latter one cannot but admire their disinterested modesty in conferring this notable honour on the father of his country inasmuch as all can see that there never has been a period when their own board has not possessed distinguished members every way qualified to act as godfathers to the most illustrious markets of the republic  but manhattan in the way of taste has never had justice done it so profound is its admiration for all the higher qualities that franklin and fulton have each a market to himself in addition to this bestowed on washington doubtless there would have been newton market and socrates market and solomon market but for the patriotism of the town which has forbidden it from going out of the hemisphere in quest of names to illustrate bacon market would doubtless have been too equivocal to be tolerated under any circumstances then bacon was a rogue though a philosopher and markets are always appropriated to honest people  at all events i am rejoiced the reproach of having a market called the bear has been taken away as it was tacitly admitting our living near if not absolutely in the woods  we passed the albany basin a large receptacle for north river craft that is now in the bosom of the town and built on and recognized in it the masthead of the wallingford  neb was shown the place for he was to bring the boat round to it and join the sloop in readiness to return in her we rounded the battery then a circular stripe of grass with an earthen and wooden breastwork running along the margin of the water leaving a narrow promenade on the exterior  this brought us to whitehall since so celebrated for its oarsmen where we put in for a haven i had obtained the address of a better sort of sailortavern in that vicinity and securing the boat we shouldered the bags got a boy to guide us and were soon housed as it was near night rupert and i ordered supper and neb was directed to pull the boat round to the sloop and to return to us in the morning taking care however not to let our lodgings be known  the next day i own i thought but little of the girls clawbonny or mr hardinge neb was at my bedside before i was up and reported the grace  lucy safe alongside of the wallingford and expressed himself ready to wait on me in my progress in quest of a ship as this was the moment of action little was said but we all breakfasted and sallied forth in good earnest on the important business before us  neb was permitted to follow but at such a distance as to prevent his being suspected of belonging to our partya gentleman with a servingman at his heels not being the candidate most likely to succeed in his application for a berth in the forecastle  so eager was i to belong to some seagoing craft that i would not stop even to look at the wonders of the town before we took the direction of the wharves rupert was for pursuing a different policy having an inherent love of the genteeler gaieties of a town but i turned a deaf ear to his hints and this time i was master he followed me with some reluctance but follow he did after some remonstrances that bordered on warmth any inexperienced eye that had seen us passing would have mistaken us for two welllooking smart young sailorboys who had just returned from a profitable voyage and who wellclad tidy and semigenteel were strolling along the wharves as admirateurs not to say critics of the craft admirateurs we were certainly or i was at least though knowledge was a point on which we were sadly deficient  the trade of america was surprisingly active in 1797  it had been preyed upon by the two great belligerents of the period england and france it is true and certain proceedings of the latter nation were about to bring the relations of the two countries into a very embarrassed state but still the shipping interest was wonderfully active and as a whole singularly successful almost every tide brought in or took out ships for foreign ports and scarce a week passed that vessels did not arrive from or sail for all the different quarters of the world an indiaman however was our object the voyage being longer the ships better and the achievement greater than merely to cross the atlantic and return  we accordingly proceeded towards the fly market in the vicinity of which we had been given to understand some three or four vessels of that description were fitting out  this market has since used its wings to disappear altogether  i kept my eyes on every ship we passed until the previous day i had never seen a squarerigged vessel and no enthusiast in the arts ever gloated on a fine picture or statue with greater avidity than my soul drank in the wonder and beauty of every ship i passed i had a large fullrigged model at clawbonny and this i had studied under my father so thoroughly as to know the name of every rope in it and to have some pretty distinct notions of their uses  this early schooling was now of great use to me though i found it a little difficult at first to trace my old acquaintances on the large scale in which they now presented themselves and amid the intricate mazes that were drawn against the skies the braces shrouds stays and halyards were all plain enough and i could point to either at a moments notice but when it came to the rest of the running rigging i found it necessary to look a little before i could speak with certainty  eager as i was to ship the indulgence of gazing at all i saw was so attractive that it was noon before we reached an indiaman this was a pretty little ship of about four hundred tons that was called the john little i say for such she would now be thought though a vessel of her size was then termed large the manhattan much the largest ship out of the port measured but about seven hundred tons while few even of the indiamen went much beyond five hundred  i can see the john at this moment near fifty years after i first laid eyes on her as she then appeared she was not brightsided but had a narrow creamcoloured streak broken into ports she was a straight blacklooking craft with a handsome billet low thin bulwarks and waistcloths secured to ridgeropes her larger spars were painted the same colour as her streak and her stern had a few ornaments of a similar tint  we went on board the john where we found the officers just topping off with the riggers and stevedores having stowed all the provisions and water and the mere trifle of cargo she carried the mate whose name was marble and a wellveined bit of marble he was his face resembling a map that had more rivers drawn on it than the land could feed winked at the captain and nodded his head towards us as soon as we met his eye the latter smiled but did not speak  walk this way gentlemenwalk this way if you please said mr marble encouragingly passing a ball of spunyarn all the while to help a rigger serve a rope  when did you leave the country  this produced a general laugh even the yellow rascal of a mulatto who was passing into the cabin with some crockery grinning in our faces at this salutation i saw it was now or never and determined not to be browbeaten while i was too truthful to attempt to pass for that i was not  we left home last night thinking to be in time to find berths in one of the indiamen that is to sail this week  not this week my sonnot till next said mr marble jocularly sunday is the day we run from sunday to sundaythe better day the better deed you know how did you leave father and mother  i have neither i answered almost choked my mother died a few months since and my father captain wallingford has now been dead some years  the master of the john was a man of about fifty redfaced hardlooking pockmarked squarerigged and of an exterior that promised anything but sentiment feeling however he did manifest the moment i mentioned my fathers name he ceased his employment came close to me gazed earnestly in my face and even looked kind  are you a son of captain miles wallingford he asked in a low voiceof miles wallingford from up the river  i am sir his only son he left but two of us a son and a daughter and though under no necessity to work at all i wish to make this miles wallingford as good a seaman as the last and i hope as honest a man  this was said manfully and with a spirit that must have pleased for i was shaken cordially by the hand welcomed on board invited into the cabin and asked to take a seat at a table on which the dinner had just been placed rupert of course shared in all these favours then followed the explanations captain robbins of the john had first gone to sea with my father for whom i believe he entertained a profound respect he had even served with him once as mate and talked as if he felt that he had been under obligations to him he did not question me very closely seeming to think it natural enough that miles wallingfords only son should wish to be a seaman  as we sat at the table even it was agreed that rupert and i should join the ship as green hands the very next morning signing the articles as soon as we went on shore  this was done accordingly and i had the felicity of writing miles wallingford to the roll dequipage to the tune of eighteen dollars per monthseamen then actually receiving thirty and thirtyfive dollars per monthwages rupert was taken also though captain robbins cut him down to thirteen dollars saying in a jesting way that a parsons son could hardly be worth as much as the son of one of the best old shipmasters who ever sailed out of america he was a shrewd observer of men and things this new friend of mine and i believe understood by the cut of his jib that rupert was not likely to make a weatherearing man the money however was not of much account in our calculations and lucky enough did i think myself in finding so good a berth almost as soon as looked for we returned to the tavern and staid that night taking a formal leave of neb who was to carry the good news home as soon as the sloop should sail  in the morning a cart was loaded with our effects the bill was discharged and we left the tavern i had the precaution not to go directly alongside the ship on the contrary we proceeded to an opposite part of the town placing the bags on a wharf resorted to by craft from new jersey as if we intended to go on board one of them the cartman took his quarter and drove off troubling himself very little about the future movements of two young sailors waiting half an hour another cart was called when we went to the john and were immediately installed in her forecastle  captain robbins had provided us both with chests paid for out of the three months advance and in them we found the slops necessary for so long a voyage rupert and i immediately put on suits of these new clothes with regular little round tarpaulins which so much altered us in appearance even from those produced by our ulster county fittings that we scarce knew each other  rupert now went on deck to lounge and smoke a segar while i went aloft visiting every yard and touching all three of the trucks before i returned from this my exploring expedition the captain and mates and riggers smiled at my movements and i overheard the former telling his mate that i was old miles over again in a word all parties seemed pleased with the arrangement that had been made i had told the officers aft of my knowledge of the names and uses of most of the ropes and never did i feel so proud as when mr marble called out in a loud tone  dye hear there milesaway aloft and unreeve them foretopgallant halyards and send an end down to haul up this new rope to reeve a fresh set  away i went my head buzzing with the complicated order and yet i had a very tolerable notion of what was to be done the unreeving might have been achieved by any one and i got through with that without difficulty and the mate himself helping me and directing me from the deck the new rope was rove with distinguished success this was the first duty i ever did in a ship and i was prouder of it than of any that was subsequently performed by the same individual the whole time i was thus occupied rupert stood lounging against the foot of the mainstay smoking his segar like a burgomaster his turn came next however the captain sending for him to the cabin where he set him at work to copy some papers rupert wrote a beautiful hand and he wrote rapidly that evening i heard the chiefmate tell the dickey that the parsons son was likely to turn out a regular barbers clerk to the captain the old man he added makes so many traverses himself on a bit of paper that he hardly knows at which end to begin to read it and i shouldnt wonder if he just stationed this chap with a quill behind his ear for the vyge  for the next two or three days i was delightfully busy passing half the time aloft all the sails were to be bent and i had my full share in the performance of this duty i actually furled the mizenroyal with my own handsthe ship carrying standing royalsand it was said to be very respectably done a little ragbaggish in the bunt perhaps but secured in a way that took the next fellow who touched the gasket five minutes to cast the sail loose then it rained and sails were to be loosened to dry i let everything fall forward with my own hands and when we came to roll up the canvass again i actually managed all three of the royals alone one at a time of course my father had taught me to make a flatknot a bowline a clovehitch two halfhitches and such sort of things and i got through with both a long and a short splice tolerably well i found all this and the knowledge i had gained from my modelship at home of great use to me so much so indeed as to induce even that indurated bit of mortality marble to say i was the ripest piece of green stuff he had ever fallen in with  all this time rupert was kept at quilldriving once he got leave to quit the shipit was the day before we sailedand i observed he went ashore in his longtogs of which each of us had one suit i stole away the same afternoon to find the postoffice and worked upstream as far as broadway not knowing exactly which way to shape my course in that day everybody who was anybody and unmarried promenaded the west side of this street from the battery to st pauls church between the hours of twelve and halfpast two wind and weather permitting there i saw rupert in his country guise nothing remarkable of a certainty strutting about with the best of them and looking handsome in spite of his rusticity it was getting late and he left the street just as i saw him i followed waiting until we got to a private place before i would speak to him however as i knew he would be mortified to be taken for the friend of a jacktar in such a scene  rupert entered a door and then reappeared with a letter in his hand he too had gone to the postoffice and i no longer hesitated about joining him  is it from clawbonny i asked eagerly if so from lucy doubtless  from clawbonnybut from grace he answered with a slight change of colour i desired the poor girl to let me know how things passed off after we left them and as for lucy her pothooks are so much out of the way i never want to see them  i felt hurt offended that my sister should write to any youngster but myself it is true the letter was to a bosom friend a coadventurer one almost a child of the same family and i had come to the office expecting to get a letter from ruperts sister who had promised while weeping on the wharf to do exactly the same thing for me but there is a difference between ones sister writing to another young man and another young mans sister writing to oneself i cannot even now explain it but that there is a difference i am sure without asking to see a line that grace had written i went into the office and returned in a minute or two with an air of injured dignity holding lucys epistle in my hand  after all there was nothing in either letter to excite much sensibility each was written with the simplicity truth and feeling of a generousminded warmhearted female friend of an age not to distrust her own motives to a lad who bad no right to view the favour other than it was as an evidence of early and intimate friendship both epistles are now before me and i copy them as the shortest way of letting the reader know the effect our disappearance had produced at clawbonny that of grace was couched in the following terms   dear rupert  clawbonny was in commotion at nine oclock this morning and well it might be when your fathers anxiety got to be painful i told him the whole and gave him the letters i am sorry to say he wept i wish never to see such a sight again the tears of two such silly girls as lucy and i are of little accountbut rupert to behold an aged man we love and respect like him a minister of the gospel too in tears it was a hard sight to bear he did not reproach us for our silence saying he did not see after our promises how we could well do otherwise i gave your reasons about responsibility in the premises but i dont think he understood them is it too late to return the boat that carried you down can bring you back and oh  how much rejoiced shall we all be to see you wherever you go and whatever you do boys for i write as much to one as to the other and only address to rupert because he so earnestly desired it but wherever you go and whatever you do remember the instructions you have both received in youth and how much all of us are interested in your conduct and happiness  affectionately yours  grace wallingford  to mr rupert hardinge   lucy had been less guarded and possibly a little more honest she wrote as follows   dear miles  i believe i cried for one whole hour after you and rupert left us and now it is all over i am vexed at having cried so much about two such foolish fellows grace has told you all about my dear dear father who cried too i declare i dont know when i was so frightened i thought it must bring you back as soon as you hear of it what will be done i do not know but something i am certain whenever father is in earnest he says but little i know he is in earnest now i believe grace and i do nothing but think of you that is she of you and i of rupert and a little the other way tooso now you have the whole truth  do not fail on any account to write before you go to sea if you do go to sea as i hope and trust you will not  goodbye   lucy hardinge  to mr miles wallingford  ps nebs mother protests if the boy is not home by saturday night she will go after him no such disgrace as a runaway ever befel her or hers and she says she will not submit to it but i suppose we shall see him soon and with him letters   now neb had taken his leave but no letter had been trusted to his care as often happens i regretted the mistake when it was too late and all that day i thought how disappointed lucy would be when she came to see the negro emptyhanded rupert and i parted in the street as he did not wish to walk with a sailor while in his own longtogs he did not say as much but i knew him well enough to ascertain it without his speaking i was walking very fast in the direction of the ship and had actually reached the wharves when in turning a corner i came plump upon mr  hardinge my guardian was walking slowly his face sorrowful and dejected and his eyes fastened on every ship he passed as if looking for his boys he saw me casting a vacant glance over my person but i was so much changed by dress and particularly by the little tarpaulin that he did not know me anxiety immediately drew his look towards the vessels and i passed him unobserved mr hardinge was walking from and i towards the john and of course all my risk terminated as soon as out of sight  that evening i had the happiness of being underway in a real fullrigged ship it is true it was under very short canvass and merely to go into the stream taking advantage of a favourable wind and tide the john left the wharf under her jib maintopmast staysail and spanker and dropped down as low as the battery when she sheered into the other channel and anchored here i was then fairly at anchor in the stream half a mile from any land but the bottom and burning to see the ocean that afternoon the crew came on board a motley collection of lately drunken seamen of whom about half were americans and the rest natives of as many different countries as there were men  mr marble scanned them with a knowing look and to my surprise he told the captain there was good stuff among them  it seems he was a better judge than i was myself for a more unpromising set of wretches as to looks i never saw grouped together a few it is true appeared well enough but most of them had the air of having been dragged througha place i will not name though it is that which sailors usually quote when describing themselves on such occasions but jack after he has been a week at sea and jack coming on board to duty after a month of excesses on shore are very different creatures morally and physically  i now began to regret that i had not seen a little of the town in 1797 new york could not have had more than fifty thousand inhabitants though it was just as much of a paragon then in the eyes of all good americans as it is today  it is a sound patriotic rule to maintain that our best is always the best for it never puts us in the wrong i have seen enough of the world since to understand that we get a great many things wrongend foremost in this country of ours undervaluing those advantages and excellencies of which we have great reason to be proud and boasting of others that to say the least are exceedingly equivocal but it takes time to learn all this and i have no intention of getting ahead of my story or of my country the last being a most suicidal act  we received the crew of a saturday afternoon and half of them turned in immediately rupert and i had a good berth intending to turn in and out together during the voyage and this made us rather indifferent to the movements of the rest of our extraordinary associates the kid at supper annoyed us both a little the notion of seeing ones food in a round trough to be tumbled over and cut from by all hands being particularly disagreeable to those who have been accustomed to plates knives and forks and such other superfluities i confess i thought of graces and lucys little white hands and of silver sugrartoogs and of clean plates and glasses and tableclothsnapkins and silver forks were then unknown in america except on the very best tables and not always on them unless on high days and holidaysas we were going through the unsophisticated manipulations of this first supper fortyseven years have elapsed and the whole scene is as vivid to my mind at this moment as if it occurred last night i wished myself one of the longsnouted tribe several times in order to be in what is called keeping  i had the honour of keeping an anchorwatch in company with a grum old swede as we lay in the hudson the wind was light and the ship had a good berth so my associate chose a soft plank told me to give him a call should anything happen and lay down to sleep away his two hours in comfort not so with me i strutted the deck with as much importance as if the weight of the state lay on my shoulderspaid a visit every five minutes to the bows to see that the cable had not parted and that the anchor did not come homeand then looked aloft to ascertain that everything was in its place those were a happy two hours  about ten next morning being sunday and as mr marble expressed it the better day the better deed the pilot came off and all hands were called to up anchor the cook cabinboy rupert and i were entrusted with the duty of fleeting jig and breaking down the coils of the cable the handspikes requiring heavier hands than ours the anchor was got in without any difficulty however when rupert and i were sent aloft to loose the foretopsail rupert got into the top via the lubbers hole i am sorry to say and the loosing of the sail on both yardarms fell to my duty  a hand was on the foreyard and i was next ordered up to loose the topgallantsail canvass began to fall and open all over the ship the topsails were mastheaded and as i looked down from the foretopmast crosstrees where i remained to overhaul the clewlines i saw that the ship was falling off and that her sails were filling with a stiff northwest breeze just as my whole being was entranced with the rapture of being underway for canton which was then called the indies rupert called out to me from the top ha was pointing at some object on the water and turning i saw a boat within a hundred feet of the ship in her was mr hardinge who at that moment caught sight of us but the ships sails were now all full and no one on deck saw or at least heeded the boat the john glided past it and the last i saw of my venerated guardian he was standing erect bareheaded holding both arms extended as if entreating us not to desert him presently the ship fell off so much that the aftersails hid him from my view  i descended into the top where i found rupert had shrunk down out of sight looking frightened and guilty as for myself i got behind the head of the mast and fairly sobbed  this lasted a few minutes when an order from the mate called us both below when i reached the deck the boat was already a long distance astern and had evidently given up the idea of boarding us i do not know whether i felt the most relieved or pained by the certainty of this fact    chapter iv    there is a tide in the affairs of men   which taken at the flood leads on to fortune   omitted all the voyage of their life   is bound in shallows and in miseries   on such a full sea are we now afloat   and we must take the current when it serves   or lose our ventures   brutusjulius caesar   in four hours from the time when rupert and i last saw mr hardinge the ship was at sea she crossed the bar and started on her long journey with a fresh northwester and with everything packed on that she would bear we took a diagonal course out of the bight formed by the coasts of long island and new jersey and sunk the land entirely by the middle of the afternoon i watched the highlands of navesink as they vanished like watery clouds in the west and then i felt i was at last fairly out of sight of land but a foremast hand has little opportunity for indulging in sentimen as he quits his native shore and few i fancy have the disposition as regards the opportunity anchors are to be got in off the bows and stowed cables are to be unbent and coiled down studdinggear is to be hauled out and got ready frequently boomirons are to be placed upon the yards and the hundred preparations made that render the work of a ship as ceaseless a round of activity as that of a house this kept us all busy until night when the watches were told off and set i was in the larboard or chiefmates watch having actually been chosen by that hardfeatured old seaman the fourth man he named an honour for which i was indebted to the activity i had already manifested aloft  rupert was less distinguished being taken by the captain for the secondmates watch the very last person chosen  that night mr marble dropped a few hints on the subject which let me into the secret of these two selections you and i will get along well together i see that plainly miles he said for theres quicksilver in your body as for your friend in tother watch its all as it should be the captain has got one hand the most and such as he is he is welcome to him hell blacken more writing paper this vyge i reckon than hell tar down riggin i thought it odd however that rupert who had been so forward in all the preliminaries of our adventure should fall so far astern in its first practical results  it is not my intention to dwell on all the minute incidents of this my first voyage to sea else would it spin out the narrative unnecessarily and render my task as fatiguing to the reader as it might prove to myself one occurrence however which took place three days out must be mentioned as it will prove to be connected with important circumstances in the end the ship was now in order and was at least two hundred leagues from the land having had a famous run off the coast when the voice of the cook who had gone below for water was heard down among the casks in such a clamour as none but a black can raise with all his loquacity awakened  theres two niggers at that work exclaimed mr  marble after listening an instant glancing his eye round to make certain the mulatto steward was not in the discussion  no one darkey ever could make all that outcry bear a hand below miles and see if africa has come aboard us in the night  i was in the act of obeying when cato the cook was seen rising through the steeragehatch dragging after him the dark poll of another black whom he had gripped by the wool in an instant both were on deck when to my astonishment i discovered the agitated countenance of nebuchadnezzar clawbonny of course the secret was out the instant the lads glistening features were recognised  neb in a word had managed to get on board the ship before she hauled out into the stream and lay concealed among the watercasks his pockets crammed with gingerbread and apples until discovered by the cook in one of his journeys in quest of water the food of the lad had been gone twentyfour hours and it is not probable the fellow could have remained concealed much longer had not this discovery taken place the instant he was on deck neb looked eagerly around to ascertain how far the ship had got from the land and seeing nothing but water on every side of him he fairly grinned with delight this exasperated mr marble who thought it was adding insult to injury and he gave the lad a cuff on the ear that would have set a white reeling on neb however this sharp blow produced no effect falling as it did on the impregnable part of his system  oh youre a nigger be you exclaimed the mate waxing warmer and warmer as he fancied himself baffled by the others powers of endurance take that and let us see if youre fullblooded  a smart rap on the shin accompanying these words neb gave in on the instant he begged for mercy and professed a readiness to tell all protesting he was not a runaway niggera term the mate used while applying the kicks  i now interfered by telling mr marble with all the respect due from a green hand to a chiefmate who neb really was and what i supposed to be his motives for following me to the ship this revelation cost me a good deal in the end the idea of jacks having a waitingman on board giving rise to a great many jokes at my expense during the rest of the voyage had i not been so active and so willing a great source of favour on board a ship it is probable these jokes would have been much broader and more frequent  as it was they annoyed me a good deal and it required a strong exercise of all the boyish regard i really entertained for neb to refrain from turningto and giving him a sound threshing for his exploit at the first good occasion and yet what was his delinquency compared to my own he had followed his master out of deep affection blended somewhat it is true with a love of adventure while in one sense i had violated all the ties of the heart merely to indulge the latter passion  the captain coming on deck nebs story was told and finding that no wages would be asked in behalf of this athletic healthy young negro he had no difficulty in receiving him into favour to nebs great delight he was sent forward to take his share on the yards and in the rigging there being no vacancy for him to fill about the camboose or in the cabin in an hour the negro was fed and he was regularly placed in the starboardwatch i was rejoiced at this last arrangement as it put the fellow in a watch different from my own and prevented his officious efforts to do my work rupert i discovered however profited often by his zeal employing the willing black on every possible occasion  on questioning neb i ascertained that he had taken the boat round to the wallingford and had made use of a dollar or two i had given him at parting to board in a house suitable to his colour until the ship was ready for sea when he got on board and stowed himself among the watercasks as mentioned  nebs apparition soon ceased to be a subject of discourse and his zeal quickly made him a general favourite hardy strong resolute and accustomed to labour he was early of great use in all the heavy drags and aloft even though less quick than a white would have been he got to be serviceable and reasonably expert my own progressand i say it without vanity but simply because it was truewas the subject of general remark one week made me familiar with the running gear and by that time i could tell a rope by its size the manner in which it led and the place where it was belayed in the darkest night as well as the oldest seaman on board it is true my modelship had prepared the way for much of this expertness but free from all seasickness of which i never had a moment in my life i set about learning these things in good earnest and was fully rewarded for my pains i passed the weatherearing of the mizentopsail when we had been out a fortnight and went to those of the fore and main before we crossed the line  the mate put me forward on all occasions giving me much instruction in private and the captain neglected no opportunity of giving me useful hints or practical ideas i asked and was allowed to take my regular trick at the wheel before we got into the latitude of st helena and from that time did my full share of seamans duly on board the nicer work of knotting splicing c excepted these last required a little more time but i am satisfied that in all things but judgment a clever lad who has a taste for the business can make himself a very useful and respectable mariner in six months of active service  china voyages seldom produce much incident if the moment of sailing has been judiciously timed the ship has fair winds much of the way and generally moderate weather  to be sure there are points on the long road that usually give one a taste of what the seas sometimes are but on the whole a canton voyage though a long one cannot be called a rough one as a matter of course we had gales and squalls and the usual vicissitudes of the ocean to contend with though our voyage to canton might have been called quiet rather than the reverse we were four months under our canvass and when we anchored in the river the clewing up of our sails and getting from beneath their shadows resembled the rising of a curtain on some novel scenic representation john chinaman however has been so often described particularly of late that i shall not dwell on his peculiarities sailors as a class are very philosophical so far as the peculiarities and habits of strangers are concerned appearing to think it beneath the dignity of those who visit all lands to betray wonder at the novelties of any it so happened that no man on board the john the officers steward and cook excepted had ever doubled the cape of good hope before this voyage and yet our crew regarded the shorn polls slanting eyes long queues clumsy dresses high cheekbones and lumbering shoes of the people they now saw for the first time with just as much indifference as they would have encountered a new fashion at home most of them indeed had seen or fancied they had seen much stranger sights in the different countries they had visited it being a standing rule with jack to compress everything that is wonderful into the last voyagethat in which he is engaged for the present time being usually set down as commonplace and unworthy of particular comment on this principle my canton excursion ought to be full of marvels as it was the progenitor of all that i subsequently saw and experienced as a sailor truth compels me to confess notwithstanding that it was one of the least wonderful of all the voyages i ever made until near its close  we lay some months in the river getting cargo receiving teas nankins silks and other articles as our supercargo could lay hands on them in all this time we saw just as much of the chinese as it is usual for strangers to see and not a jot more i was much up at the factories with the captain having charge of his boat and as for rupert he passed most of his workinghours either busy with the supercargo ashore or writing in the cabin i got a good insight however into the uses of the servingmallet the fid marlinspike and winch and did something with the needle and palm marble was very good to me in spite of his norwest face and never let slip an occasion to give a useful hint i believe my exertions on the outwardbound passage fully equalled expectations and the officers had a species of pride in helping to make captain wallingfords son worthy of his honourable descent i had taken occasion to let it be known that ruperts greatgrandfather had been a manofwar captain but the suggestion was met by a flat refusal to believe it from mr kite the secondmate though mr marble remarked it might be so as i admitted that both his father and grandfather had been or were in the church my friend seemed fated to achieve nothing but the glory of a barbers clerk  our hatches were got on and battened down and we sailed for home early in the spring of 1798 the ship had a good run across the china sea and reached the indies in rather a short passage we had cleared all the islands and were fairly in the indian ocean when an adventure occurred which was the first really worthy of being related that we met in the whole voyage i shall give it in as few words as possible  we had cleared the straits of sunda early in the morning and had made a pretty fair run in the course of the day though most of the time in thick weather just as the sun set however the horizon became clear and we got a sight of two small sail seemingly heading in towards the coast of sumatra proas by their rig and dimensions they were so distant and were so evidently steering for the land that no one gave them much thought or bestowed on them any particular attention proas in that quarter were usually distrusted by ships it is true but the sea is full of them and far more are innocent than are guilty of any acts of violence  then it became dark soon after these craft were seen and night shut them in an hour after the sun had set the wind fell to a light air that just kept steerageway on the ship fortunately the john was not only fast but she minded her helm as a lightfooted girl turns in a lively dance i never was in a bettersteering ship most especially in moderate weather  mr marble had the middle watch that night and of course i was on deck from midnight until four in the morning it proved misty most of the watch and for quite an hour we had a light drizzling rain the ship the whole time was closehauled carrying royals as everybody seemed to have made up his mind to a quiet night one without any reefing or furling most of the watch were sleeping about the decks or wherever they could get good quarters and be least in the way i do not know what kept me awake for lads of my age are apt to get all the sleep they can but i believe i was thinking of clawbonny and grace and lucy for the latter excellent girl as she was often crossed my mind in those days of youth and comparative innocence awake i was and walking in the weathergangway in a sailors trot mr marble he i do believe was fairly snoozing on the hencoops being like the sails as one might say barely asleep at that moment i heard a noise one familiar to seamen that of an oar falling in a boat so completely was my mind bent on other and distant scenes that at first i felt no surprise as if we were in a harbour surrounded by craft of various sizes coming and going at all hours but a second thought destroyed this illusion and i looked eagerly about me directly on our weatherbow distant perhaps a cables length i saw a small sail and i could distinguish it sufficiently well to perceive it was a proa i sang out sail ho and close aboard  mr marble was on his feet in an instant he afterwards told me that when he opened his eyes for he admitted this much to me in confidence they fell directly on the stranger  he was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to ascertain what was to be done keep the ship awaykeep her broad off he called out to the man at the wheel lay the yards squarecall all hands one of you captain robbins mr kite bear a hand up the bloody proas are aboard us the last part of this call was uttered in a loud voice with the speakers head down the companionway  it was heard plainly enough below but scarcely at all on deck  in the mean time everybody was in motion it is amazing how soon sailors are wide awake when there is really anything to do it appeared to me that all our people mustered on deck in less than a minute most of them with nothing on but their shirts and trowsers the ship was nearly before the wind by the time i heard the captains voice and then mr kite came bustling in among us forward ordering most of the men to lay aft to the braces remaining himself on the forecastle and keeping me with him to let go the sheets on the forecastle the strange sail was no longer visible being now abaft the beam but i could hear mr marble swearing there were two of them and that they must be the very chaps we had seen to leeward and standing in for the land at sunset i also heard the captain calling out to the steward to bring him a powderhorn  immediately after orders were given to let fly all our sheets forward and then i perceived that they were waring ship nothing saved us but the prompt order of mr marble to keep the ship away by which means instead of moving towards the proas we instantly began to move from them although they went three feet to our two this gave us a moment of breathing time  as our sheets were all flying forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me leisure to look about i soon saw both proas and glad enough was i to perceive that they had not approached materially nearer mr kite observed this also and remarked that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascals aback he meant they did not exactly know what we were at and had not kept away with us  at this instant the captain and five or six of the oldest seamen began to cast loose all our starboard or weather guns four in all and sixes we had loaded these guns in the straits of banca with grape and canister in readiness for just such pirates as were now coming down upon us and nothing was wanting but the priming and a hot loggerhead  it seems two of the last had been ordered in the fire when we saw the proas at sunset and they were now in excellent condition for service live coals being kept around them all night by command i saw a cluster of men busy with the second gun from forward and could distinguish the captain pointing it  there cannot well be any mistake mr marble the captain observed hesitating whether to fire or not  mistake sir lord captain robbins you might cannonade any of the islands astarn for a week and never hurt an honest man let em have it sir ill answer for it you do good  this settled the matter the loggerhead was applied and one of our sixes spoke out in a smart report a breathless stillness succeeded the proas did not alter their course but neared us fast the captain levelled his nightglass and i heard him tell kite in a low voice that they were full of men the word was now passed to clear away all the guns and to open the armchest to come at the muskets and pistols i heard the rattling of the boardingpikes too as they were cut adrift from the spankerboom and fell upon the deck all this sounded very ominous and i began to think we should have a desperate engagement first and then have all our throats cut afterwards  i expected now to hear the guns discharged in quick succession but they were got ready only not fired kite went aft and returned with three or four muskets and as many pikes he gave the latter to those of the people who had nothing to do with the guns by this time the ship was on a wind steering a good full while the two proas were just abeam and closing fast the stillness that reigned on both sides was like that of death the proas however fell a little more astern the result of their own manoeuvring out of all doubt as they moved through the water much faster than the ship seeming desirous of dropping into our wake with a design of closing under our stern and avoiding our broadside  as this would never do and the wind freshened so as to give us four or five knot way a most fortunate circumstance for us the captain determined to tack while he had room the john behaved beautifully and came round like a top the proas saw there was no time to lose and attempted to close before we could fill again and this they would have done with ninetynine ships in a hundred the captain knew his vessel however and did not let her lose her way making everything draw again as it might be by instinct the proas tacked too and laying up much nearer to the wind than we did appeared as if about to close on our leebow the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple if the pirates got on board us we were hopelessly gone and everything depended on coolness and judgment the captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instant commanding a dead silence and the closest attention to his orders  i was too much interested at this moment to feel the concern that i might otherwise have experienced on the forecastle it appeared to us all that we should be boarded in a minute for one of the proas was actually within a hundred feet though losing her advantage a little by getting under the lee of our sails kite had ordered us to muster forward of the rigging to meet the expected leap with a discharge of muskets and then to present our pikes when i felt an arm thrown around my body and was turned inboard while another person assumed my place this was neb who had thus coolly thrust himself before me in order to meet the danger first i felt vexed even while touched with the fellows attachment and selfdevotion but had no time to betray either feeling before the crews of the proas gave a yell and discharged some fifty or sixty matchlocks at us the air was full of bullets but they all went over our heads not a soul on board the john was hurt on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two at the nearest and two at the sternmost proa which was still near a cables length distant as often happens the one seemingly farthest from danger fared the worst our grape and canister had room to scatter and i can at this distant day still hear the shrieks that arose from that craft they were like the yells of fiends in anguish the effect on that proa was instantaneous instead of keeping on after her consort she wore short round on her heel and stood away in our wake on the other tack apparently to get out of the range of our fire  i doubt if we touched a man in the nearest proa at any rate no noise proceeded from her and she came up under our bows fast as every gun was discharged and there was not time to load them all now depended on repelling the boarders part of our people mustered in the waist where it was expected the proa would fall alongside and part on the forecastle just as this distribution was made the pirates cast their grapnel it was admirably thrown but caught only by a ratlin i saw this and was about to jump into the rigging to try what i could do to clear it when neb again went ahead of me and cut the ratlin with his knife  this was just as the pirates had abandoned sails and oars and had risen to haul up alongside so sudden was the release that twenty of them fell over by their own efforts  in this state the ship passed ahead all her canvass being full leaving the proa motionless in her wake in passing however the two vessels were so near that those aft in the john distinctly saw the swarthy faces of their enemies  we were no sooner clear of the proas than the order was given ready about the helm was put down and the ship came into the wind in a minute as we came square with the two proas all our larboard guns were given to them and this ended the affair i think the nearest of the rascals got it this time for away she went after her consort both running off towards the islands we made a little show of chasing but it was only a feint for we were too glad to get away from them to be in earnest in ten minutes after we tacked the last time we ceased firing having thrown some eight or ten roundshot after the proas and were closehauled again heading to the southwest  it is not to be supposed we went to sleep again immediately  neb was the only man on board who did but he never missed an occasion to eat or sleep the captain praised us and as a matter of course in that day he called all hands to splice the mainbrace after this the watch was told to go below as regularly as if nothing had happened as for the captain himself he and mr marble and mr kite went prying about the ship to ascertain if anything material had been cut by what the chiefmate called the bloody indian matchlocks a little runningrigging had suffered and we had to reeve a few new ropes in the morning but this terminated the affair  i need hardly say all hands of us were exceedingly proud of our exploit everybody was praised but neb who being a nigger was in some way or other overlooked  i mentioned his courage and readiness to mr  marble but i could excite in no one else the same respect for the poor fellows conduct that i certainly felt myself i have since lived long enough to know that as the gold of the rich attracts to itself the gold of the poor so do the deeds of the unknown go to swell the fame of the known this is as true of nations and races and families as it is of individuals poor neb belonging to a proscribed colour it was not in reason to suppose he could ever acquire exactly the same credit as a white man  them darkies do sometimes blunder on a lucky idee answered mr marble to one of my earnest representations and ive known chaps among em that were almost as knowing as dullish whites but everything out of the common way with em is pretty much chance as for neb however i will say this for him that for a nigger he takes things quicker than any of his colour i ever sailed with  then he has no sace and that is a good deal with a black  white sace is bad enough but that of a nigger is unbearable  alas neb born in slavery accustomed to consider it arrogance to think of receiving even his food until the meanest white had satisfied his appetite submissive unrepining laborious and obedientthe highest eulogium that all these patient and unobtrusive qualities could obtain was a reluctant acknowledgment that he had no sace his quickness and courage saved the john nevertheless and i have always said it and ever shall  a day after the affair of the proas all hands of us began to brag even the captain was a little seized with this mania and as for marble he was taken so badly that had i not known he behaved well in the emergency i certainly should have set him down as a bobadil rupert manifested this feeling too though i heard he did his duty that night  the result of all the talk was to convert the affair into a very heroic exploit and it subsequently figured in the journals as one of the deeds that illustrate the american name  from the time we were rid of the proas the ship got along famously until we were as far west as about 52° when the wind came light from the southward and westward with thick weather the captain had been two or three times caught in here and he took it into his head that the currents would prove more favourable could he stand in closer to the coast of madagascar than common accordingly we brought the ship on a bowline and headed up well to the northward and westward we were a week on this tack making from fifty to a hundred miles a day expecting hourly to see the land at length we made it enormously high mountains apparently a long distance from us though as we afterwards ascertained a long distance inland and we continued to near it the captain had a theory of his own about the currents of this part of the ocean and having set one of the peaks by compass at the time the land was seen he soon convinced himself and everybody else whom he tried to persuade marble excepted that we were setting to windward with visible speed captain robbins was a wellmeaning but somewhat dull man and when dull men become theorists they usually make sad work with the practice  ail that night we stood on to the northward and westward though mr marble had ventured a remonstrance concerning a certain headland that was just visible a little on our weatherbow the captain snapped his fingers at this however laying down a course of reasoning which if it were worth anything ought to have convinced the mate that the weatherly set of the current would carry us ten leagues to the southward and westward of that cape before morning on this assurance we prepared to pass a quiet and comfortable night  i had the morning watch and when i came on deck at four there was no change in the weather mr marble soon appeared and he walked into the waist where i was leaning on the weatherrail and fell into discourse this he often did sometimes so far forgetting the difference in our stations afloatnot ashore there i had considerably the advantage of himas occasionally to call me sir i always paid for this inadvertency however it usually putting a stop to the communications for the time being in one instance he took such prompt revenge for this implied admission of equality as literally to break off short in the discourse and to order me in his sharpest key to go aloft and send some studdingsails on deck though they all had to be sent aloft again and set in the course of the same watch but offended dignity is seldom considerate and not always consistent  a quiet night master milesthis the mate could call me as it implied superiority on his parta quiet night master miles commenced mr marble and a strong westerly current accordin to captain robbins well to my taste gooseberries are better than currents and id go about thats my manner of generalizing  the captain i suppose sir from that is of a different opinion  why yes somewhatishthough i dont think he knows himself exactly what his own opinion is this is the third vyge ive sailed with the old gentleman and he is half his time in a fog or a current now its his idee the ocean is full of mississippi rivers and if one could only find the head of a stream he might go round the world in it more particularly does he hold that there is no fear of the land when in a current as a stream never sets on shore for my part i never want any better handlead than my nose  nose mr marble  yes nose master miles havent you remarked how far we smelt the injees as we went through the islands  it is true sir the spice islands and all land they say  what the devils that asked the mate evidently startled at something he heard though he appeared to smell nothing unless indeed it might be a rat  it sounds like water washing on rocks sir as much as anything i ever heard in my life  ready about shouted the mate run down and call the captain mileshard aleestart everybody up forward  a scene of confusion followed in the midst of which the captain secondmate and the watch below appeared on deck captain robbins took command of course and was in time to haul the afteryards the ship coming round slowly in so light a wind come round she did however and when her head was fairly to the southward and eastward the captain demanded an explanation mr marble did not feel disposed to trust his nose any longer but he invited the captain to use his ears this all hands did and if sounds could be trusted we had a pretty lot of breakers seemingly all around us  we surely can go out the way we came in mr marble  said the captain anxiously  yes sir if there were no current but one never knows where a bloody current will carry him in the dark  stand by to let go the anchor cried the captain let run and clew up forward and aft let go as soon as youre ready mr kite  luckily we had kept a cable bent as we came through the straits and not knowing but we might touch at the isle of france it was still bent with the anchor fished  we had talked of stowing the latter inboard but having land in sight it was not done in two minutes it was acockbill and in two more let go none knew whether we should find a bottom but kite soon sang out to snub the anchor being down with only six fathoms out the lead corroborated this and we had the comfortable assurance of being not only among breakers but just near the coast  the holdingground however was reported good and we went to work and rolled up all our rags in half an hour the ship was snug riding by the stream with a strong current or tide setting exactly northeast or directly opposite to the captains theory as soon as mr marble had ascertained this fact i overheard him grumbling about something of which i could distinctly understand nothing but the words bloody capebloody current    chapter v    they hurried us aboard a bark   bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared   a rotten carcass of a boat not riggd   nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats   instinctively had girt us   tempest   the hour that succeeded in the calm of expectation was one of the most disquieting of my life as soon as the ship was secured and there no longer remained anything to do the stillness of death reigned among us the faculties of every man and boy appearing to be absorbed in the single sense of hearingthe best and indeed the only means we then possessed of judging of our situation it was now apparent that we were near some place or places where the surf was breaking on land and the hollow nottobemistaken bellowings of the element too plainly indicated that cavities in rocks frequently received and as often rejected the washing waters nor did these portentous sounds come from one quarter only but they seemed to surround us now reaching our ears from the known direction of the land now from the south the northeast and in fact from every direction there were instances when these moanings of the ocean sounded as if close under our stern and then again they came from some point within a fearful proximity to the bows  happily the wind was light and the ship rode with a moderate strain on the cable so as to relieve us from the apprehension of immediate destruction there was a long heavy groundswell rolling in from the southwest but the lead giving us eight fathoms the sea did not break exactly where we lay though the sullen washing that came to our ears from time to time gave unerring notice that it was doing so quite near us independently of the places where it broke upon rocks at one time the captains impatience was so goading that he had determined to pull round the anchorage in a boat in order to anticipate the approach of light but a suggestion from mr marble that he might unconsciously pull into a roller and capsize induced him to wait for day  the dawn appeared at last after two or three of the longest hours i remember ever to have passed never shall i forget the species of furious eagerness with which we gazed about us in the first place we got an outline of the adjacent land then as light diffused itself more and more into the atmosphere we caught glimpses of its details it was soon certain we were within a cables length of perpendicular cliffs of several hundred feet in height into whose caverns the sea poured at times producing those frightful hollow moanings that an experienced ear can never mistake this cliff extended for leagues in both directions rendering drowning nearly inevitable to the shipwrecked mariner on that inhospitable coast ahead astern outside of us and i might almost say all around us became visible one after another detached ledges breakers and ripples so many proofs of the manner in which providence had guided us through the hours of darkness  by the time the sun appeared for happily the day proved bright and clear we had obtained pretty tolerable notions of the critical situation in which we were placed by means of the captains theory of currents the very cape that we were to drift past lay some ten leagues nearly dead to windward as the breeze then was while to leeward far as the eye could reach stretched the same inhospitable barrier of rock as that which lay on our starboard quarter and beam such was my first introduction to the island of madagascar a portion of the world of which considering its position magnitude and productions the mariners of christendom probably know less than of any other at the time of which i am writing far less had been learned of this vast country than is known today though the knowledge of even our own immediate contemporaries is of an exceedingly limited character  now that the day had returned the sun was shining on us cheerfully and the sea looked tranquil and assuring the captain became more pacified he had discretion enough to understand that time and examination were indispensable to moving the ship with safety and he took the wise course of ordering the people to get their breakfasts before he set us at work the hour that was thus employed forward was passed aft in examining the appearance of the water and the positions of the reefs around the ship by the time we were through the captain had swallowed his cup of coffee and eaten his biscuit and calling away four of the most athletic oarsmen he got into the jollyboat and set out on the allimportant duty of discovering a channel seaward  the lead was kept moving and i shall leave the party thus employed for an hour or more while we turn our attention inboard  marble beckoned me aft as soon as captain robbins was in the boat apparently with a desire to say something in private i understood the meaning of his eye and followed him down into the steerage where all that was left of the ships water was now stowed that on deck having been already used the mate had a certain consciousness about him that induced great caution and he would not open his lips until he had rummaged about below some time affecting to look for a set of blocks that might be wanted for some purpose or other on deck when this had lasted a little time he turned short round to me and let out the secret of the whole manoeuvre  ill tell you what master miles he said making a sign with a finger to be cautious i look upon this ships berth as worse than that of a city scavenger weve plenty of water all round us and plenty of rocks too if we knew the way back there is no wind to carry us through it among these bloody currents and theres no harm in getting ready for the worst so do you get neb and the gentlemanrupert was generally thus styled in the shipand clear away the launch first get everything out of it that dont belong there after which do you put these breakers in and wait for further orders make no fuss putting all upon orders and leave the rest to me  i complied of course and in a few minutes the launch was clear while busy however mr kite came past and desired to know what are you at there i told him twas mr marbles orders and the latter gave his own explanation of the matter  the launch may be wanted he said for ive no notion that jollyboat will do to go out as far as we shall find it necessary to sound so i am about to ballast the launch and get her sails ready theres no use in mincing matters in such a berth as this  kite approved of the idea and even went so far as to suggest that it might be well enough to get the launch into the water at once by way of saving time the proposition was too agreeable to be rejected and to own the truth all hands went to work to get up the tackles with a will as it is called  in half an hour the boat was floating alongside the ship  some said she would certainly be wanted to carry out the streamanchor if for nothing else others observed that half a dozen boats would not be enough to find all the channel we wanted while marble kept his eye though always in an underhand way on his main object the breakers we got in and stowed filled with fresh water by way of ballast  the masts were stepped the oars were put on board and a spare compass was passed dawn lest the ship might be lost in the thick weather of which there was so much just in that quarter of the world all this wars said and done so quietly that nobody took the alarm and when the mate called out in a loud voice miles pass a breadbag filled and some cold grub into that launchthe men may be hungry before they get back no one seemed to think more was meant than was thus openly expressed i had my private orders however and managed to get quite a hundredweight of good cabin biscuit into the launch while the cook was directed to fill his coppers with pork i got some of the latter raw into the boat too raw pork being food that sailors in no manner disdain they say it eats like chestnuts  in the mean time the captain was busy in his exploring expedition on the return from which he appeared to think he was better rewarded than has certainly fallen to the lot of others employed on another expedition which bears the same name he was absent near two hours and when he got back it was to renew his theory of what mr marble called his bloody currents  ive got behind the curtain mr marble commenced captain robbins before he was fairly alongside of the ship again whereupon marble muttered ay ay youve got behind the rocks too its all owing to an eddy that is made inshore by the main current and we have stretched a leetle too far in  even i thought to myself what would have become of us had we stretched a leetle further in the captain however seemed satisfied that he could carry the ship out and as this was all we wanted no one was disposed to be very critical a word was said about the launch which the mate had ordered to be dropped astern out of the way and the explanation seemed to mystify the captain in the meanwhile the pork was boiling furiously in the coppers  all hands were now called to get the anchor up rupert and i went aloft to loosen sails and we staid there until the royals were mastheaded in a very few minutes the cable was up and down and then came the critical part of the whole affair the wind was still very light and it was a question whether the ship could be carried past a reef of rocks that now began to show itself above water and on which the long heavy rollers that came undulating from the southwestern atlantic broke with a sullen violence that betrayed how powerful was the ocean even in its moments of slumbering peacefulness the rising and falling of its surface was like that of some monsters chest as he respired heavily in sleep  even the captain hesitated about letting go his hold of the bottom with so strong a set of the water to leeward and in so light a breeze there was a sort of bight on our starboard bow however and mr marble suggested it might be well to sound in that direction as the water appeared smooth and deep to him it looked as if there were really an eddy inshore which might hawse the ship up to windward six or eight times her length and thus more than meet the loss that must infallibly occur in first casting her head to seaward the captain admitted the justice of this suggestion and i was one of those who were told to go in the jollyboat on this occasion we pulled in towards the cliffs and had not gone fifty yards before we struck an eddy sure enough which was quite as strong as the current in which the ship lay this was a great advantage and so much the more because the water was of sufficient depth quite up to the edge of the reef which formed the bight and thus produced the change in the direction of the set there was plenty of room too to handle the ship in and all things considered the discovery was extremely fortunate in the bottom of the bight we should have gone ashore the previous night had not our ears been so much better than our noses  as soon as certain of the facts the captain pulled back to the ship and gladdened the hearts of all on board with the tidings we now manned the handspikes cheerily and began to heave i shall never forget the impression made on me by the rapid drift of the ship as soon as the anchor was off the bottom and her bows were cast inshore in order to fill the sails the land was so near that i noted this drift by the rocks and my heart was fairly in my mouth for a few seconds but the john worked beautifully and soon gathered way her bows did not not strike the eddy however until we got fearful evidence of the strength of the true current which had set us down nearly as low as the reef outside to windward of which it was indispensable for us to pass marble saw all this and he whispered me to tell the cook to pass the pork into the launch at oncehot to mind whether it were particularly well done or not i obeyed and had to tend the foresheet myself for my pains when the order was given to ready about  the eddy proved a true friend but it did not carry us up much higher than the place where we had anchored when it became necessary to tack this was done in season on account of our ignorance of all the soundings and we had soon got the johns head offshore again drawing a short distance ahead the maintopsail was thrown aback and the ship allowed to drift in proper time it was filled and we got round once more looking into the bight the manoeuvre was repeated and this brought us up fairly under the lee of the reef and just in the position we desired to be it was a nervous instant i make no doubt when captain robbins determined to trust the ship in the true current and run the gauntlet of the rocks the passage across which we had to steer before we could possibly weather the nearest reef was about a cables length in width and the wind would barely let us lay high enough to take it at rightangles then the air was so light that i almost despaired of our doing anything  captain robbins put the ship into the current with great judgment she was kept a rapfull until near the edge of the eddy and then her helm was put nearly down all at once but for the currents acting in one direction on her starboard bow and the eddys pressing in the other on the larboard quarter the vessel would have been taken aback but these counteracting forces brought her handsomely on her course again and that in a way to prevent her falling an inch to leeward  now came the trial the ship was kept a rapfull and she went steadily across the passage favoured perhaps by a little more breeze than had blown most of the morning  still our leeward set was fearful and as we approached the reef i gave all up marble screwed his lips together and his eyes never turned from the weatherleeches of the sails  everybody appeared to me to be holding his breath as the ship rose on the long groundswells sending slowly ahead the whole time we passed the nearest point of the rocks on one of the rounded risings of the water just touching lightly as we glided by the visible danger the blow was light and gave little cause for alarm captain robbins now caught mr marble by the hand and was in the very act of heartily shaking it when the ship came down very much in the manner that a man unexpectedly lights on a stone when he has no idea of having anything within two or three yards of his feet the blow was tremendous throwing half the crew down at the same instant all three of the topmasts went to leeward  one has some difficulty in giving a reader accurate notions of the confusion of so awful a scene the motion of the vessel was arrested suddenly as it might be by a wall and the whole fabric seemed to be shaken to dissolution  the very next roller that came in which would have undulated in towards the land but for us meeting with so large a body in its way piled up and broke upon our decks covering everything with water at the same time the hull lifted and aided by wind sea and current it set still further on the reef thumping in a way to break strong iron bolts like so many sticks of sealingwax and cracking the solid liveoak of the floortimbers as if they were made of willow the captain stood aghast for one moment despair was painfully depicted in his countenance then he recovered his selfpossession and seamanship he gave the order to stand by to carry out to windward the streamanchor in the launch and to send a kedge to haul out by in the jollyboat marble answered with the usual ay ay sir but before he sent us into the boats he ventured to suggest that the ship had bilged already he had heard timbers crack about which he thought there could be no mistake the pumps were sounded and the ship had seven feet water in her hold  this had made in about ten minutes still the captain would not give up he ordered us to commence throwing the teas overboard in order to ascertain if possible the extent of the injury a place was broken out in the wake of the mainhatch and a passage was opened down into the lowerhold where we met the water in the mean time a southsea man we had picked up at canton dove down under the lee of the bilge of the ship he soon came back and reported that a piece of sharp rock had gone quite through the planks everything tending to corroborate this the captain called a council of all hands on the quarterdeck to consult as to further measures  a merchantman has no claim on the services of her crew after she is hopelessly wrecked the last have a lien in law on the ship and cargo for their wages and it is justly determined that when this security fails the claim for services ends it followed of course that as soon as the john was given over we were all our own masters and hence the necessity for bringing even neb into the consultation with a vessel of war it would have been different in such a case the united states pays for the service ship or no ship wreck or no wreck and the seaman serves out his term of enlistment be this longer or shorter military discipline continues under all circumstances  captain robbins could hardly speak when we gathered round him on the forecastle the seas breaking over the quarterdeck in a way to render that sanctuary a very uncomfortable berth as soon as he could command himself he told us that the ship was hopelessly lost how it had happened he could not very well explain himself though he ascribed it to the fact that the currents did not run in the direction in which according to all sound reasoning they ought to run this part of the speech was not perfectly lucid though as i understood our unfortunate captain the laws of nature owing to some inexplicable influence had departed in some way or other from their ordinary workings expressly to wreck the john if this were not the meaning of what he said i did not understand this part of the address  the captain was much more explicit after he got out of the current he told us that the island of bourbon was only about four hundred miles from where we then were and he thought it possible to go that distance find some small craft and come back and still save part of the cargo the sails anchors c c we might make such a trip of it as would give us all a lift in the way of salvage that might prove some compensation for our other losses this sounded well and it had at least the effect to give us some present object for our exertions it also made the danger we all ran of losing our lives less apparent to land on the island of madagascar in that day was out of the question the people were then believed to be far less civilized than in truth they were and had a particularly bad character among mariners nothing remained therefore but to rig the boats and make immediate dispositions for our departure  now it was that we found the advantage of the preparations already made little remained to be done and that which was done was much better done than if we had waited until the wreck was half full of water and the seas were combing in upon her the captain took charge of the launch putting mr marble rupert neb myself and the cook into the jollyboat with orders to keep as close as possible to himself both boats had sails and both were so arranged as to row in calms or headwinds we took in rather more than our share of provisions and water having two skillful caterers in the chiefmate and cook and having obtained a compass quadrant and a chart for our portion of the indispensables all hands were ready for a start in about two hours after the ship had struck  it was just noon when we cast off from the wreck and stood directly off the land according to our calculations the wind enabled us to run with a clean full on our true course as the boats drew out into the ocean we had abundant opportunities of discovering how many dangers we had escaped and for my own part i felt deeply grateful even then as i was going out upon the wide atlantic in a mere shell of a boat at the mercy we had experienced no sooner were we fairly in deep water than the captain and mate had a dialogue on the subject of the currents again  notwithstanding all the difficulties his old theory had brought him into the former remained of opinion that the true current set to windward and that we should so find it as soon as we got a little into the offing while the mate was frank enough to say he had been of opinion all along that it ran the other way the latter added that bourbon was rather a small spot to steer for and it might be better to get into its longitude and then find it by meridian observations than to make any more speculations about matters of which we knew nothing  the captain and mr marble saw things differently and we kept away accordingly when we ought to have luffed all we could fortunately the weather continued moderate or our little boat would have had a bad time of it we outsailed the launch with ease and were forced to reef in order not to part company when the sun set we were more than twenty miles from the land seeing no more of the coast though the mountains inland were still looming up grandly in the distance i confess when night shut in upon us and i found myself on the wide ocean in a boat much smaller than that with which i used to navigate the hudson running every minute farther and farther into the watery waste i began to think of clawbonny and its security and quiet nights and wellspread board and comfortable beds in a way i had never thought of either before as for food however we were not stinted mr marble setting us an example of using our teeth on the half boiled pork that did credit to his philosophy to do this man justice he seemed to think a run of four hundred miles in a jollyboat no great matter but took everything as regularly as if still on the deck of the john each of us got as good a nap as our cramped situations would allow  the wind freshened in the morning and the sea began to break this made it necessary to keep still more away to prevent filling at times or to haul close up which might have done equally well but the captain preferred the latter course on account of the current we had ticklish work of it in the jollyboat more than once that day and were compelled to carry a whole sail in order to keep up with the launch which beat us now the wind had increased marble was a terrible fellow to carry on everything ship or boat and we kept our station admirably the two boats never getting a cables length asunder and running most of the time within hail of each other as night approached however a consultation was held on the subject of keeping in company  we had now been out thirty hours and had made near a hundred and fifty miles by our calculation luckily the wind had got to be nearly west and we were running ahead famously though it was as much as we could do to keep the jollyboat from filling one hand was kept bailing most of the time and sometimes all four of us were busy  these matters were talked over and the captain proposed abandoning the jollyboat altogether and to take us into the launch though there was not much vacant space to receive us but the mate resisted this answering that he thought he could take care of our boat a while longer at least  accordingly the old arrangement was maintained the party endeavouring to keep as near together as possible  about midnight it began to blow in squalls and two or three times we found it necessary to take in our sails our oars and pull the boat head to sea in order to prevent her swamping the consequence was that we lost sight of the launch and though we always kept away to our course as soon as the puffs would allow when the sun rose we saw nothing of our late companions i have sometimes thought mr marble parted company on purpose though he seemed much concerned next morning when he had ascertained the launch was nowhere to be seen after looking about for an hour and the wind moderating we made sail close on the wind a direction that would soon have taken us away from the launch had the latter been close alongside when we first took it we made good progress all this day and at evening having now been out fiftyfour hours we supposed ourselves to be rather more than halfway on the road to our haven it fell calm in the night and the next morning we got the wind right aft this gave us a famous shove for we sometimes made six and seven knots in the hour the fair wind lasted thirty hours during which time we must have made more than a hundred and fifty miles it falling nearly calm about an hour before dawn on the morning of the fourth day out everybody was anxious to see the horizon that morning and every eye was turned to the east with intense expectation as the sun rose it was in vain there was not the least sign of land visible marble looked sadly disappointed but he endeavoured to cheer us up with the hope of seeing the island shortly we were then heading due east with a very light breeze from the northwest i happened to stand up in the boat on a thwart and turning my face to the southward i caught a glimpse of something that seemed like a hummock of land in that quarter i saw it but for an instant but whatever it was i saw it plain enough mr marble now got on the thwart and looked in vain to catch the same object he said there was no land in that quartercould be noneand resumed his seat to steer to the eastward a little north i could not be easy however but remained on the thwart until the boat lifted on a swell higher than common and then i saw the brown hazylooking spot on the margin of the ocean again my protestations now became so earnest that marble consented to stand for an hour in the direction i pointed out to him one hour boy i will grant you to shut your mouth the mate said taking out his watch and that you need lay nothing to my door hereafter to make the most of this hour i got my companions at the oars and we all pulled with hearty goodwill  so much importance did i attach to every fathom of distance made that we did not rise from our seats until the mate told us to stop rowing for the hour was up as for himself he had not risen either but kept looking behind him to the eastward still hoping to see land somewhere in that quarter  my heart beat violently as i got upon the thwart but there lay my hazy object now never dipping at all i shouted land ho marble jumped up on a thwart too and no longer disputed my word it was land he admitted and it must be the island of bourbon which we had passed to the northward and must soon have given a hopelessly wide berth we went to the oars again with renewed life and soon made the boat spin all that day we kept rowing until about five in the afternoon when we found ourselves within a few leagues of the island of bourbon where we were met by a fresh breeze from the southward and were compelled to make sail the wind was dead on end and we made stretches under the lee of the island going about as we found the sea getting to be too heavy for us as was invariably the case whenever we got too far east or west  in a word a lee was fast becoming necessary by ten we were within a mile of the shore but saw no place where we thought it safe to attempt a landing in the dark a long heavy sea setting in round both sides of the island though the water did not break much where we remained at length the wind got to be so heavy that we could not carry even our sail doublereefed and we kept two oars pulling lightly in relieving each other every hour by daylight it blew tremendously and glad enough were we to find a little cove where it was possible to get ashore i had then never felt so grateful to providence as i did when i got my feet on terrafirma  we remained on the island a week hoping to see the launch and her crew but neither appeared then we got a passage to the isle of france on arriving at which place we found the late gale was considered to have been very serious there was no american consul in the island at that time and mr marble totally without credit or means found it impossible to obtain a craft of any sort to go to the wreck in we were without money too and a homewardbound calcutta vessel coming in we joined her to work our passages home mr marble as dickey and the rest of us in the forecastle this vessel was called the tigris and belonged to philadelphia she was considered one of the best ships out of america and her master had a high reputation for seamanship and activity he was a little man of the name of digges and was under thirty at the time i first knew him he took us on board purely out of a national feeling for his ship was stronghanded without us having thirtytwo souls all told when he received us five we afterwards learned that letters sent after the ship had induced captain digges to get five additional hands in calcutta in order to be able to meet the picaroons that were then beginning to plunder american vessels even on their own coast under the pretence of their having violated certain regulations made by the two great belligerents of the day in europe this was just the commencement of the quasi war which broke out a few weeks later with france  of all these hostile symptoms however i then knew little and cared less even mr marble had never heard of them and we five joined the tigris merely to get passages home without entertaining second thoughts of running any risk further than the ordinary dangers of the seas  the tigris sailed the day we joined her which was the third after we reached mauritius and just fifteen days after we had left the wreck we went to sea with the wind at the southward and had a good run off the island making more than a hundred miles that afternoon and in the course of the night next morning early i had the watch and an order was given to set topgallant studdingsails rupert and i had got into the same watch on board this vessel and we both went aloft to reeve the gear i had taken up the end of the halyards and had reeved them and had overhauled the end down when in raising my head i saw two small lugsails on the ocean broad on our weatherbow which i recognised in an instant for those of the johns launch  i cannot express the feeling that came over me at that sight i yelled rather than shouted sail ho and then pushing in i caught hold of a royalbackstay and was on deck in an instant i believe i made frantic gestures to windward for mr marble who had the watch had to shake me sharply before i could let the fact be known  as soon as marble comprehended me and got the bearings of the boat he hauled down all the studdingsails braced sharp up on a wind set the mainsail and then sent down a report to captain digges for orders our new commander was a humane man and having been told our whole story he did not hesitate about confirming all that had been done as the people in the launch had made out the ship some time before i saw the boat the latter was running down upon us and in about an hour the tiny sails were descried from the deck in less than an hour after this our mainyard swung round throwing the topsail aback and the wellknown launch of the john roundedto close under our lee a rope was thrown and the boat was hauled alongside  everybody in the tigris was shocked when we came to get a look at the condition of the strangers one man a powerful negro lay dead in the bottom of the boat the body having been kept for a dreadful alternative in the event of his companions falling in with no other relief three more of the men were nearly gone and had to be whipped on board as so many lifeless bales of goods captain robbins and kite both athletic active men resembled spectres their eyes standing out of their heads as if thrust from their sockets by some internal foe and when we spoke to them they all seemed unable to answer it was not fasting or want of food that had reduced them to this state so much as want of water it is true they had no more bread left than would keep body and soul together for a few hours longer but of water they had tasted not a drop for seventy odd hours it appeared that during the gale they had been compelled to empty the breakers to lighten the boat reserving only one for their immediate wants by some mistake the one reserved was nearly halfempty at the time and captain robbins believed himself then so near bourbon as not to go on an allowance until it was too late in this condition had they been searching for the island quite ten days passing it but never hitting it the winds had not favoured them and the last few days the weather had been such as to admit of no observation consequently they had been as much out of their reckoning in their latitude as in their longitude  a gleam of intelligence and i thought of pleasure shot athwart the countenance of captain robbins as i helped him over the tigriss side he saw i was safe he tottered as he walked and leaned heavily on me for support i was about to lead him aft but his eye caught sight of a scuttlebutt and the tinpot on its head thither he went and stretched out a trembling hand to the vessel i gave him the pot as it was with about a wineglass of water in it this he swallowed at a gulp and then tottered forward for more by this time captain digges joined us and gave the proper directions how to proceed all the sufferers had water in small quantities given them and it is wonderful with what expressions of delight they received the grateful beverage as soon as they understood the necessity of keeping it as long as possible in their mouths and on their tongues before swallowing it a little did them a great deal of good after this we gave them some coffee the breakfast being ready and then a little ships biscuit soaked in wine by such means every man was saved though it was near a month before all were themselves again as for captain robbins and kite they were enabled to attend to duty by the end of a week though nothing more was exacted of them than they chose to perform    chapter vi           the yesty waves   confound and swallow navigation up   macbeth   poor captain robbins no sooner did he regain his bodily strength than he began to endure the pain of mind that was inseparable from the loss of his ship marble who now that he had fallen to the humbler condition of a secondmate was more than usually disposed to be communicative with me gave me to understand that our old superior had at first sounded captain digges on the subject of proceeding to the wreck in order to ascertain what could be saved but the latter had soon convinced him that a firstrate philadelphia indiaman had something else to do besides turning wrecker after a pretty broad hint to this effect the john and all that was in her were abandoned to their fate marble however was of opinion that the gale in which the launch came so near being lost must have broken the ship entirely to pieces giving her fragments to the ocean we never heard of her fate or recovered a single article that belonged to her  many were the discussions between captain robbins and his two mates touching the error in reckoning that had led them so far from their course in that day navigation was by no means as simple a thing as it has since become it is true lunars were usually attempted in india and china ships but this was not an everyday affair like the present morning and afternoon observations to obtain the time and by means of the chronometer the longitude then we had so recently got clear of the islands as to have no great need of any extraordinary headwork and the bloody currents had acted their pleasure with us for eight or ten days before the loss of the ship marble was a very good navigator one of the best i ever sailed with in spite of the plainness of his exterior and his rough deportment and all things considered he treated his old commander with great delicacy promising to do all he could when he got home to clear the matter up as for kite he knew but little and had the discretion to say but little this moderation rendered our passage all the more agreeable  the tigris was a very fast ship besides being wellfound  she was a little larger than the john and mounted twelve guns ninepounders in consequence of the additions made to her crew one way and another she now mustered nearer fifty than forty souls on board captain digges had certain martial tastes and long before we were up with the cape he had us all quartered and exercised at the guns he too had had an affair with some proas and he loved to converse of the threshing he had given the rascals i thought he envied us our exploit though this might have been mere imagination on my part for he was liberal enough in his commendations the private intelligence he had received of the relations between france and america quickened his natural impulses and by the time we reached st helena the ship might have been said to be in good fighting order for a merchantman we touched at this lastmentioned island for supplies but obtained no news of any interest  those who supplied the ship could tell us nothing but the names of the indiamen who had gone out and home for the last twelvemonth and the prices of fresh meat and vegetables napoleon civilized them seventeen years later  we had a good run from st helena to the calm latitudes but these last proved calmer than common we worried through them after a while however and then did very well until we got in the latitude of the windward islands marble one day remarked to me that captain digges was standing closer to the french island of guadaloupe than was at all necessary or prudent if he believed in his own reports of the danger there existed to american commerce in this quarter of the ocean  i have lived long enough and have seen too much of men and things to fancy my country and countrymen right in all their transactions merely because newspapers members of congress and fourth of july orators are pleased to affirm the doctrine no one can go much to sea without reading with great distrust many of the accounts in the journals of the day of the grievous wrongs done the commerce of america by the authorities of this or that port the seizure of such a ship or the imprisonment of some particular set of officers and men as a rule it is safer to assume that the afflicted parties deserve all that has happened to them than to believe them immaculate and quite likely much more too the habit of receiving such appeals to their sympathies renders the good people of the republic peculiarly liable to impositions of this nature and the mother who encourages those of her children who fetch and carry will be certain to have her ears filled with complaints and tattle nevertheless it is a fact beyond all dispute that the commerce of the country was terribly depredated on by nearly all the european belligerents between the commencement of the war of the french revolution and its close so enormous were the robberies thus committed on the widely extended trade of this nation under one pretence or another as to give a colouring of retributive justice if not of moral right to the recent failures of certain states among us to pay their debts providence singularly avenges all wrongs by its unerring course and i doubt not if the facts could be sifted to the bottom it would be found the devil was not permitted to do his work in either case without using materials supplied by the sufferers in some direct or indirect manner themselves of all the depredations on american trade just mentioned those of the great sister republic at the close of the last century were among the most grievous and were of a character so atrocious and bold that i confess it militates somewhat against my theory to admit that france owns very little of the suspended debt but i account for this last circumstance by the reparation she in part made by the treaty of 1831 with england it is different she drove us into a war by the effects of her orders in council and paper blockades and compelled us to expend a hundred millions to set matters right i should like to see the books balanced not by the devil who equally instigated the robberies on the high seas and the suspension or repudiation of the state debts but by the great accountant who keeps a record of all our deeds of this nature whether it be to make money by means of cruising ships or cruising scrip  it is true these rovers encountered very differentlylooking victims in the first place but it is a somewhat trite remark that the aggregate of human beings is pretty much the same in all situations there were widows and orphans as much connected with the condemnation of prizes as with the prices of condemned stock and i do not see that fraud is any worse when carried on by scriveners and clerks with quills behind their ears than when carried on by gentlemen wearing cocked hats and carrying swords by their sides on the whole i am far from certain that the accountcurrent of honesty is not slightlyhonesty very slightly leavens either transactionin favour of the nonpaying states as men do sometimes borrow with good intentions and fail from inability to pay whereas in the whole course of my experience i never knew a captor of a ship who intended to give back any of the prizemoney if he could help it but to return to my adventures  we were exactly in the latitude of guadaloupe with the usual breeze when at daylight a rakishlooking brig was seen in chase captain digges took a long survey of the stranger with his best glass one that was never exhibited but on state occasions and then he pronounced him to be a french cruiser most probably a privateer that he was a frenchman marble affirmed was apparent by the height of his topmasts and the shortness of his yards the upper spars in particular being mere apologies for yards everybody who had any right to an opinion was satisfied the brig was a french cruiser either public or private  the tigris was a fast ship and she was under topmast and topgallant studdingsails at the time going about seven knots the brig was on an easy bowline evidently looking up for our wake edging off gradually as we drew ahead  she went about nine knots and bade fair to close with us by noon there was a good deal of doubt aft as to the course we ought to pursue it was decided in the end however to shorten sail and let the brig come up as being less subject to cavils than to seem to avoid her captain digges got out his last letters from home and i saw him showing them to captain robbins the two conning them over with great earnestness i was sent to do some duty near the hencoops where they were sitting and overheard a part of their conversation from the discourse i gathered that the proceedings of these picaroons were often equivocal and that americans were generally left in doubt until a favourable moment occurred for the semipirates to effect their purposes the party assailed did not know when or how to defend himself until it was too late  these chaps come aboard you sometimes before youre aware of what they are about observed captain robbins  ill not be taken by surprise in that fashion returned digges after a moment of reflection here you miles go forward and tell the cook to fill his coppers with water and to set it boiling as fast as he can and tell mr marble i want him aft bear a hand now youngster and give them a lift yourself  of course i obeyed wondering what the captain wanted with so much hot water as to let the people eat their dinners off cold grub rather than dispense with it for this was a consequence of his decree but we had not got the coppers halffilled before i saw mr marble and neb lowering a small ships engine from the launch and placing it near the galley in readiness to be filled the mate told neb to screw on the pipe and then half a dozen of the men as soon as we got through with the coppers were told to fill the engine with seawater captain digges now came forward to superintend the exercise and neb jumped on the engine flourishing the pipe about with the delight of a nigger  the captain was diverted with the blacks zeal and he appointed him captain of the firemen on the spot  now let us see what you can do at that forward dead eye darky said captain digges laughing take it directly on the strap play away boys and let neb try his hand  it happened that neb hit the deadeye at the first jet and he showed great readiness in turning the stream from point to point as ordered nebs conduct on the night of the affair with the proas had been told to captain digges who was so well pleased with the fellows present dexterity as to confirm him in office he was told to stick by the engine at every hazard soon after an order was given to clear for action this had an ominous sound to my young ears and though i have no reason to suppose myself deficient in firmness i confess i began to think again of clawbonny and grace and lucy ay and even of the mill this lasted but for a moment however and as soon as i got at work the feeling gave me no trouble we were an hour getting the ship ready and by that time the brig was within half a mile luffing fairly up on our leequarter as we had shortened sail the privateer manifested no intention of throwing a shot to make us heaveto she seemed disposed to extend courtesy for courtesy  the next order was for all hands to go to quarters i was stationed in the maintop and rupert in the fore our duties were to do light work in the way of repairing damages and the captain understanding that we were both accustomed to firearms gave us a musket apiece with orders to blaze away as soon as they began the work below  as we had both stood fire once we thought ourselves veterans and proceeded to our stations smiling and nodding to each other as we went up the rigging of the two my station was the best since i could see the approach of the brig the mizentopsail offering but little obstruction to vision after she got near whereas the maintopsail was a perfect curtain so far as poor rupert was concerned in the way of danger there was not much difference as to any of the stations on board the bulwarks of the ship being little more than plank that would hardly stop a musketball and then the french had a reputation for firing into the rigging  as soon as all was ready the captain sternly ordered silence by this time the brig was near enough to hail i could see her decks quite plainly and they were filled with men i counted her guns too and ascertained she had but ten all of which seemed to be lighter than our own one circumstance that i observed however was suspicious her forecastle was crowded with men who appeared to be crouching behind the bulwarks as if anxious to conceal their presence from the eyes of those in the tigris i had a mind to jump on a backstay and slip down on deck to let this threatening appearance be known but i had heard some sayings touching the imperative duty of remaining at quarters in face of the enemy and i did not like to desert my station tyroes have always exaggerated notions both of their rights and their duties and i had not escaped the weakness still i think some credit is due for the alternative adopted during the whole voyage i had kept a reckoning and paper and pencil were always in my pocket in readiness to catch a moment to finish a days work i wrote as follows on a piece of paper therefore as fast as possible and dropped the billet on the quarterdeck by enclosing a copper in the scrawl cents then being in their infancy i had merely writtenthe brigs forecastle is filled with armed men hid behind the bulwarks captain digges heard the fall of the copper and looking upnothing takes an officers eyes aloft quicker than to find anything coming out of a tophe saw me pointing to the paper i was rewarded for this liberty by an approving nod captain digges read what i had written and i soon observed neb and the cook filling the engine with boiling water this job was no sooner done than a good place was selected on the quarterdeck for this singular implement of war and then a hail came from the brig  vat zat sheep is demanded some one from the brig  the tigris of philadelphia from calcutta home what brig is that  la foliecorsair français from vair you come  from calcutta and where are you from  guadaloupe vair you go eh  philadelphia do not luff so near me some accident may happen  vat you call accident can nevair hear eh i will come tout près  give us a wider berth i tell you here is your jib boom nearly foul of my mizenrigging  vat mean zat bert vidair eh allons mes enfants cest le moment  luff a little and keep his spar clear cried our captain  squirt away neb and let us see what you can do  the engine made a movement just as the french began to run out on their bowsprit and by the time six or eight were on the heel of the jibboom they were met by the hissing hot stream which took them en echelon as it might be fairly raking the whole line the effect was instantaneous physical nature cannot stand excessive heat unless particularly well supplied with skin and the three leading frenchmen finding retreat impossible dropped incontinently into the sea preferring cold water to hotthe chances of drowning to the certainty of being scalded i believe all three were saved by their companions inboard but i will not vouch for the fact the remainder of the intended boarders having the bowsprit before them scrambled back upon the brigs forecastle as well as they could betraying by the random way in which their hands flew about that they had a perfect consciousness how much they left their rear exposed on the retreat a hearty laugh was heard in all parts of the tigris and the brig putting her helm hard up wore round like a top as if she were scalded herself  footnote  this incident actually occurred in the war of 1798  we all expected a broadside now but of that there was little apprehension as it was pretty certain we carried the heaviest battery and had men enough to work it but the brig did not fire i suppose because we fell off a little ourselves and she perceived it might prove a losing game on the contrary she went quite round on her heel hauling up on the other tack far enough to bring the two vessels exactly dos à dos captain digges ordered two of the quarterdeck nines to be run out of the sternports and it was well he did for it was not in nature for men to be treated as our friends in the brig had been served without manifesting certain signs of illhumour the vessels might have been three cables lengths asunder when we got a gun the first i knew of the shot was to hear it plunge through the mizentopsail then it came whistling through my top between the weatherrigging and the masthead cutting a hole through the maintopsail and proceeding onward i heard it strike something more solid than canvass i thought of rupert and the foretop in an instant and looked anxiously down on deck to ascertain if he were injured  foretop there called out captain digges where did that shot strike  in the masthead answered rupert in a clear firm voice it has done no damage sir  nows your time captain robbinggive em a reminder  both our nines were fired and a few seconds after three cheers arose from the decks of our ship i could not see the brig now for the mizentopsail but i afterwards learned that we had shot away her gaff this terminated the combat in which the glory was acquired principally by neb they told me when i got down among the people again that the blacks face had been dilated with delight the whole time though he stood fairly exposed to musketry his mouth grinning from ear to ear neb was justly elated with the success that attended this exhibition of his skill and described the retreat of our enemies with a humour and relish that raised many a laugh at the discomfited privateersman  it is certain that some of the fellows must have been nearly parboiled  i have always supposed this affair between la folie and the tigris to have been the actual commencement of hostilities in the quasi war of 17989 and 1800 other occurrences soon supplanted it in the public mind but we of the ship never ceased to regard the adventure as one of great national interest it did prove to be a nine days wonder in the newspapers  from this time nothing worthy of being noted occurred until we reached the coast we had got as high as the capes of virginia and were running in for the land with a fair wind when we made a ship inshore of us the stranger hauled up to speak us as soon as we were seen there was a good deal of discussion about this vessel as she drew near between captain digges and his chiefmate the latter said he knew the vessel and that it was an indiaman out of philadelphia called the ganges a sort of sister craft to our own ship while the former maintained if it were the ganges at all she was so altered as scarcely to be recognised  as we got near the stranger threw a shot under our forefoot and showed an american pennant and ensign getting a better look at her we got so many signs of a vesselofwar in our neighbour as to think it wisest to heaveto when the other vessel passed under our stern tacked and lay with her headyards aback a little on our weatherquarter as she drew to windward we saw her stern which had certain national emblems but no name on it this settled the matter she was a manofwar and she carried the american flag such a thing did not exist a few months before when we left home and captain digges was burning with impatience to know more he was soon gratified  is not that the tigris demanded a voice through a trumpet from the stranger  ay ay what ship is that  the united states ship ganges captain dale from the capes of the delaware bound on a cruise youre welcome home captain digges we may want some of your assistance under a cockade  digges gave a long whistle and then the mystery was out this proved to be the ganges as stated an indiaman bought into a new navy and the first shipofwar ever sent to sea under the government of the country as it had existed since the adoption of the constitution nine years before  the privateers of france had driven the republic into an armament and ships were fitting out in considerable numbers some being purchased like the ganges and others built expressly for the new marine captain digges went on board the ganges and pulling an oar in his boat i had a chance of seeing that vessel also captain dale a compact stronglybuilt seamanlike looking man in a blue and white uniform received our skipper with a cordial shake of the hand for they had once sailed together and he laughed heartily when he heard the story of the boardingparty and the hot water this respectable officer had no braggadocia about him but he intimated that it would not be long as he thought before the rovers among the islands would have their hands full congress was in earnest and the whole country was fairly aroused whenever that happens in america it is usually to take a new and better direction than to follow the ordinary blind impulses of popular feelings  in countries where the masses count for nothing in the everyday working of their systems excitement has a tendency to democracy but among ourselves i think the effect of such a condition of things is to bring into action men and qualities that are commonly of little account and to elevate instead of depressing public sentiment  i was extremely pleased with the manly benevolent countenance of captain dale and had half a desire to ask leave to join his ship on the spot if that impulse had been followed it is probable my future life would have been very different from what it subsequently proved i should have been rated a midshipman of course and serving so early with a good deal of experience already in ships a year or two would have made me a lieutenant and could i have survived the pruning of 1801 i should now have been one of the oldest officers in the service providence directed otherwise and how much was lost or how much gained by my continuance in the tigris the reader will learn as we proceed  as soon as captain digges had taken a glass or two of wine with his old acquaintance we returned to our own ship and the two vessels made sail the ganges standing off to the northward and eastward while we ran in for the capes of the delaware we got in under cape may or within five miles of it the same evening when it fell nearly calm a pilot came off from the cape in a rowboat and he reached us just at dark captain robbins now became all impatience to land as it was of importance to him to be the bearer of his own bad news accordingly an arrangement having been made with the two men who belonged to the shoreboat our old commander rupert and myself prepared to leave the ship late as it was we two lads were taken for the purpose of manning two additional oars but were to rejoin the ship in the bay if possible if not up at town one of the inducements of captain robbins to be off was the signs of northerly weather it had begun to blow a little in puffs from the northwest and everybody knew if it came on to blow seriously from that quarter the ship might be a week in getting up the river her news being certain to precede her we hurried off accordingly taking nothing with us but a change of linen and a few necessary papers  we got the first real blast from the northwest in less than five minutes after we had quitted the tigriss side and while the ship was still visible or rather while we could yet see the lights in her cabinwindows as she fell off before the wind presently the lights disappeared owing no doubt to the ships luffing again the symptoms now looked so threatening that the pilots men proposed making an effort before it was too late to find the ship but this was far easier said than done the vessel might be spinning away towards cape henlopen at the rate of six or seven knots and without the means of making any signal in the dark it was impossible to overtake her i do believe that captain robbins would have acceded to the request of the men had he seen any probability of succeeding as it was there remained no alternative but to pull in and endeavour to reach the land we had the light on the cape as our beacon and the boats head was kept directly for it as the wisest course for us to pursue  changes of wind from southeast to northwest are very common on the american coast they are almost always sudden sometimes so much so as to take ships aback and the force of the breeze usually comes so early as to have produced the saying that a norwester comes buttend foremost such proved to be the fact in our case in less than half an hour after it began to blow the wind would have brought the most gallant ship that floated to doublereefed topsails steering by and to reasonably shortcanvass running large we may have pulled a mile in this half hour though it was by means of a quick stroke and great labour the cape may men were vigorous and experienced and they did wonders nor were rupert and i idle but as soon as the sea got up it was as much as all four of us could do to keep steerageway on the boat there were ten minutes during which i really think the boat was kept head to sea by means of the wash of the waves that drove past as we barely held her stationary  of course it was out of the question to continue exertions that were as useless as they were exhausting we tried the expedient however of edging to the northward with the hope of getting more under the lee of the land and consequently into smoother water but it did no good the nearest we ever got to the light must have considerably exceeded a league at length rupert totally exhausted dropped his oar and fell panting on the thwart he was directed to steer captain robbins taking his place i can only liken our situation at that fearful moment to the danger of a man who is clinging to a cliff its summit and safety almost in reach of his hand with the consciousness that his powers are fast failing him and that he must shortly go down it is true death was not so certain by our abandoning the effort to reach the land but the hope of being saved was faint indeed behind us lay the vast and angry atlantic without an inch of visible land between us and the rock of lisbon we were totally without food of any sort though luckily there was a small breaker of fresh water in the boat the cape may men had brought off their suppers with them but they had made the meal whereas the rest of us had left the tigris fasting intending to make comfortable suppers at the light  at length captain robbins consulted the boatmen and asked them what they thought of our situation i sat between these men who had been remarkably silent the whole time pulling like giants both were young though as i afterwards learned both were married each having a wife at that anxious moment waiting on the beach of the cape for the return of the boat as captain robbins put the question i turned my head and saw that the man behind me the oldest of the two was in tears i cannot describe the shock i experienced at this sight here was a man accustomed to hardships and dangers who was making the stoutest and most manly efforts to save himself and all with him at the very moment so strongly impressed with the danger of our situation that his feelings broke forth in a way it is always startling to witness when the grief of man is thus exhibited in tears the imagination of this husband was doubtless picturing to his mind the anguish of his wife at that moment and perhaps the long days of sorrow that were to succeed i have no idea he thought of himself apart from his wife for a finer more manly resolute fellow never existed as he subsequently proved to the fullest extent  it seemed to me that the two cape may men had a sort of desperate reluctance to give up the hope of reaching the land we were a strong boats crew and we had a capital though a light boat yet all would not do about midnight after pulling desperately for three hours my strength was quite gone and i had to give up the oar captain robbins confessed himself in a very little better state and it being impossible for the boatmen to do more than keep the boat stationary and that only for a little time longer there remained no expedient but to keep off before the wind in the hope of still falling in with the ship we knew that the tigris was on the starboard tack when we left her and as she would certainly endeavour to keep as close in with the land as possible there was a remaining chance that she had wore ship to keep off henlopen and might be heading up about northnortheast and laying athwart the mouth of the bay this left us just a chancea ray of hope and it had now become absolutely necessary to endeavour to profit by it  the two cape may men pulled the boat round and kept her just ahead of the seas as far as it was in their power very light touches of the oars sufficing for this where it could be done at all occasionally however one of those chasing waves would come after us at a racers speed invariably breaking at such instants and frequently halffilling the boat this gave us new employment rupert and myself being kept quite half the time bailing no occupation notwithstanding the danger could prevent me from looking about the cauldron of angry waters in quest of the ship fifty times did i fancy i saw her and as often did the delusive idea end in disappointment the waste of dark waters relieved by the gleaming of the combing seas alone met the senses the wind blew directly down the estuary and in crossing its mouth we found too much swell to receive it on our beam and were soon compelled most reluctantly though it was to keep dead away to prevent swamping this painful state of expectation may have lasted half an hour the boat sometimes seeming ready to fly out of the water as it drifted before the gale when rupert unexpectedly called out that he saw the ship  there she was sure enough with her head to the northward and eastward struggling along through the raging waters under her fore and maintopsails closereefed and reefed courses evidently clinging to the land as close as she could both to hold her own and to make good weather it was barely light enough to ascertain these facts though the ship was not a cables length from us when first discovered  unfortunately she was dead to leeward of us and was drawing ahead so fast as to leave the probability she would forereach upon us unless we took to all our oars this was done as soon as possible and away we went at a rapid rate aiming to shoot directly beneath the tigriss leequarter so as to roundto under shelter of her hull there to receive a rope  we pulled like giants three several times the water slapped into us rendering the boat more and more heavy but captain bobbins told us to pull on every moment being precious as i did not look roundcould not well indeedi saw no more of the ship until i got a sudden glimpse of her dark hull within a hundred feet of us surging ahead in the manner in which vessels at sea seem to take sudden starts that carry them forward at twice their former apparent speed captain robbins had begun to hail the instant he thought himself near enough or at the distance of a hundred yards but what was the human voice amid the music of the winds striking the various cords and i may add chords in the mazes of a squarerigged vessels hamper accompanied by the base of the roaring ocean heavens what a feeling of despair was that when the novel thought suggested itself almost simultaneously to our minds that we should not make ourselves heard i say simultaneously for at the same instant the whole five of us set up a common desperate shout to alarm those who were so near us and who might easily save us from the most dreadful of all deathsstarvation at sea i presume the fearful manner in which we struggled at the oars diminished the effect of our voices while the effort to raise a noise lessened our power with the oars we were already to leeward of the ship though nearly in her wake and our only chance now was to over take her the captain called out to us to pull for life or death and pull we did so frantic were our efforts that i really think we should have succeeded had not a sea come on board us and filled us to the thwarts there remained no alternative but to keep dead away and to bail for our lives  i confess i felt scalding tears gush down my cheeks as i gazed at the dark mass of the ship just before it was swallowed up in the gloom this soon occurred and then i make no doubt every man in the boat considered himself as hopelessly lost we continued to bail notwithstanding and using hats gourds pots and pails soon cleared the boat though it was done with no other seeming object than to avert immediate death i heard one of the cape may men pray the name of his wife mingled with his petitions to god as for poor captain robbins who had so recently been in another scene of equal danger in a boat he remained silent seemingly submissive to the decrees of providence  in this state we must have drifted a league dead before the wind the cape may men keeping their eyes on the light which was just sinking below the horizon while the rest of us were gazing seaward in ominous expectation of what awaited us in that direction when the hail of boat ahoy  sounded like the last trumpet in our ears a schooner was passing our track keeping a little off and got so near as to allow us to be seen though owing to a remark about the light which drew all eyes to windward not a soul of us saw her it was too late to avert the blow for the hail had hardly reached us when the schooners cutwater came down upon our little craft and buried it in the sea as if it had been lead at such moments men do not think but act i caught at a bobstay and missed it as i went down into the water my hand fell upon some object to which i clung and the schooner rising at the next instant i was grasped by the hair by one of the vessels men i had hold of one of the cape may mens legs released from my weight this man was soon in the vessels head and he helped to save me when we got inboard and mustered our party it was found that all had been saved but captain robbins  the schooner wore round and actually passed over the wreck of the boat a second time but our old commander was never heard of more    chapter vii    oh forget not the hour when through forest and vale   we returned with our chief to his dear native halls   through the woody sierra there sighd not a gale   and the moonbeam was bright on his battlement walls   and nature lay sleeping in calmness and light   round the house of the truants that rose on our sight   mrs hemans   we had fallen on board an eastern coaster called the martha wallis bound from james river to boston intending to cross the shoals her watch had seen us because the coasters generally keep better lookouts than indiamen the latter accustomed to good offings having a trick of letting their people go to sleep in the nightwatches i made a calculation of the turns on board the tigris and knew it was mr marbles watch when we passed the ship and i make no question he was at that very moment nodding on the hencoopsa sort of trick he had i cannot even now understand however why the man at the wheel did not hear the outcry we made to me it appeared loud enough to reach the land  sailors ordinarily receive wrecked mariners kindly our treatment on board the martha wallis was all i could have desired and the captain promised to put us on board the first coaster she should fall in with bound to new york  he was as good as his word though not until more than a week had elapsed it fell calm as soon as the northwester blew its pipe out and we did not get into the vineyard sound for nine days here we met a craft the skipper knew and being a regular boston and new york coaster we were put on board her with a recommendation to good treatment the people of the lovely lass received us just as we had been received on board the martha wallis all hands of us living aft and eating codfish good beef and pork with duff dough and molasses almost ad libitum from this last vessel we learned all the latest news of the french war and how things were going on in the country the fourth day after we were put on board this craft rupert and i landed near pecks slip new york with nothing on earth in our possession but just in what we stood this however gave us but little concerni had abundance at home and rupert was certain of being free from want both through me and through his father  i had never parted with the gold given me by lucy however  when we got into the boat to land at the cape i had put on the belt in which i kept this little treasure and it was still round my body i had kept it as a sort of memorial of the dear girl who had given it to me but i now saw the means of making it useful without disposing of it altogether  i knew that the wisest course in all difficulties was to go at once to headquarters i asked the address of the firm that owned or rather had owned the john and proceeded to the countinghouse forthwith i told my story but found that kite had been before me it seems that the tigris got a fair wind three days after the blow that carried her up to the very wharves of philadelphia when most of the johns people had come on to new york without delay by communications with the shore at the cape the pilot had learned that his boat had never returned and our loss was supposed to have inevitably occurred the accounts of all this were in the papers and i began to fear that the distressing tidings might have reached clawbonny indeed there were little obituary notices of rupert and myself in the journals inserted by some hand piously employed i should think by mr  kite we were tenderly treated considering our escapade and my fortune and prospects were dwelt on with some touches of eloquence that might have been spared  in that day however a newspaper was a very different thing from what it has since become then journals were created merely to meet the demand and news was given as it actually occurred whereas now the competition has produced a change that any one can appreciate when it is remembered to what a competition in news must infallibly lead in that day our own journals had not taken to imitating the worst features of the english newspaperstalents and education are not yet cheap enough in america to enable them to imitate the bestand the citizen was supposed to have some rights as put in opposition to the press the public sense of right had not become blunted by familiarity with abuses and the miserable and craven apology was never heard for not enforcing the laws that nobody cares for what the newspapers say owing to these causes i escaped a thousand lies about myself my history my disposition character and acts still i was in print and i confess it halffrightened me to see my death announced in such obvious letters although i had physical evidence of being alive and well  the owners questioned me closely about the manner in which the john was lost and expressed themselves satisfied with my answers i then produced my halfjoes and asked to borrow something less than their amount on their security  to the latter part of the proposition however these gentlemen would not listen forcing a check for a hundred dollars on me desiring that the money might be paid at my own convenience knowing i had clawbonny and a very comfortable income under my lee i made no scruples about accepting the sum and took my leave  rupert and i had now the means of equipping ourselves neatly though always in sailor guise after this was done we proceeded to the albany basin in order to ascertain whether the wallingford were down or not at the basin we learned that the sloop had gone out that very forenoon having on board a black with his young masters effects a lad who was said to have been out to canton with young mr wallingford and who was now on his way home to report all the sad occurrences to the family in ulster this then was neb who had got thus far back in charge of our chests and was about to return to slavery  we had been in hopes that we might possibly reach clawbonny before the tidings of our loss this intelligence was likely to defeat the expectation but luckily one of the fastest sloops on the river a hudson packet was on the point of sailing and though the wind held well to the northward her master thought he should be able to turn up with the tides as high as our creek in the course of the next eightandforty hours this was quite as much as the wallingford could do i felt well persuaded and making a bargain to be landed on the western shore rupert and i put our things on board this packet and were under way in half an hours time  so strong was my own anxiety i could not keep off the deck until we had anchored on account of the flood and much did i envy rupert who had coolly turned in as soon as it was dark and went to sleep when the anchor was down i endeavoured to imitate his example on turning out next morning i found the vessel in newburgh bay with a fair wind about twelve oclock i could see the mouth of the creek and the wallingford fairly entering it her sails disappearing behind the trees just as i caught sight of them  as no other craft of her size ever went up to that landing i could not be mistaken in the vessel  by getting ashore half a mile above the creek there was a farmroad that would lead to the house by a cut so short as nearly to bring us there as soon as neb could possibly arrive with his dire but false intelligence the place was pointed out to the captain who had extracted our secret from us and who goodnaturedly consented to do all we asked of him i do think he would have gone into the creek itself had it been required but we were landed with our bag of clothesone answered very well for bothat the place i have mentioned and taking turn about to shoulder the wardrobe away we went as fast as legs could carry us  even rupert seemed to feel on this occasion and i do think he had a good deal of contrition as he must have recollected the pain he had occasioned his excellent father and dear good sister  clawbonny never looked more beautiful than when i first cast eyes on it that afternoon there lay the house in the secure retirement of its smiling vale the orchards just beginning to lose their blossoms the broad rich meadows with the grass waving in the south wind resembling velvet the fields of corn of all sorts and the cattle as they stood ruminating or enjoying their existence in motionless selfindulgence beneath the shade of trees seemed to speak of abundance and considerate treatment everything denoted peace plenty and happiness yet this place with all its blessings and security had i wilfully deserted to encounter pirates in the straits of sunda shipwreck on the shores of madagascar jeopardy in an open boat off the isle of france and a miraculous preservation from a horrible death on my own coast  at no great distance from the house was a dense grove in which rupert and i had with our own hands constructed a rude summerhouse fit to be enjoyed on just such an afternoon as this on which we had returned when distant from it only two hundred yards we saw the girls enter the wood evidently taking the direction of the seat at the same moment i caught a glimpse of neb moving up the road from the landing at a snails pace as if the poor fellow dreaded to encounter the task before him after a moments consultation we determined to proceed at once to the grove and thus anticipate the account of neb who must pass so near the summerhouse as to be seen and recognised we met with more obstacles than we had foreseen or remembered and when we got to a thicket close in the rear of the bench we found that the black was already in the presence of his two young mistresses  the appearance of the three when i first caught a near view of them was such as almost to terrify me even neb whose face was usually as shining as a black bottle was almost of the colour of ashes the poor fellow could not speak and though lucy was actually shaking him to extract an explanation the only answer she could get was tears these flowed from nebs eyes in streams and at length the fellow threw himself on the ground and fairly began to groan  can this be shame at having run away exclaimed lucy or does it foretell evil to the boys  he knows nothing of them not having been with themyet i am terrified  not on my account dearest sister i cried aloud here are rupert and i god be praised both in good health and safe  i took care to remain hid as i uttered this not to alarm more than one sense at a time but both the girls shrieked and held out their arms rupert and i hesitated no longer but sprang forward i know not how it happened though i found on recovering my selfpossession that i was folding lucy to my heart while rupert was doing the same to grace this little mistake however was soon rectified each man embracing his own sister as in duty bound and as was most decorous the girls shed torrents of tears and assured us again and again that this was the only really happy moment they had known since the parting on the wharf nearly a twelvemonth before then followed looks at each other exclamations of surprise and pleasure at the changes that had taken place in the appearance of all parties and kisses and tears again in abundance  as for neb the poor fellow was seen in the road whither he had fled at the sound of my voice looking at us like one in awe and doubt being satisfied in the end of our identity as well as of our being in the flesh the negro again threw himself on the ground rolling over and over and fairly yelling with delight after going through this process of negro excitement he leaped up on his feel and started for the house shouting at the top of his voice as if certain the good intelligence he brought would secure his own pardon master miles come homemaster miles come home  in a few minutes quiet was sufficiently restored among us four who remained at the seat to ask questions and receive intelligible answers glad was i to ascertain that the girls had been spared the news of our loss as for mr  hardinge he was well and busied as usual in discharging the duties of his holy office he had told grace and lucy the name of the vessel in which we had shipped but said nothing of the painful glimpse he had obtained of us just as we lifted our anchor to quit the port grace in a solemn manner then demanded an outline of our adventures as rupert was the spokesman on this occasion the question having been in a manner put to him as oldest i had an opportunity of watching the sweet countenances of the two painfully interested listeners rupert affected modesty in his narration if he did not feel it though i remarked that he dwelt a little particularly on the shot which had lodged so near him in the head of the tigriss foremast he spoke of the whistling it made as it approached and the violence of the blow when it struck he had the impudence too to speak of my goodluck in being on the other side of the top when the shot passed through my station whereas i do believe that the shot passed nearer to me than it did to himself  it barely missed me and by all i could learn rupert was leaning over by the topmast rigging when it lodged  the fellow told his story in his own way however and with so much unction that i observed it made grace look pale  the effect on lucy was different this excellent creature perceived my uneasiness i half suspected for she laughed and interrupting her brother told him therethats enough about the cannonball now let us hear of something else rupert coloured for he had frequently had such frank hints from his sister in the course of his childhood but he had too much address to betray the vexation i knew he felt  to own the truth my attachment for rupert had materially lessened with the falling off of my respect he had manifested so much selfishness during the voyagehad shirked so much duty most of which had fallen on poor neband had been so little of the man in practice whom he used so well to describe with his tonguethat i could no longer shut my eyes to some of his deficiencies of character i still liked him but it was from habit and perhaps because he was my guardians son and lucys brother then i could not conceal from myself that rupert was not in a rigid sense a lad of truth he coloured exaggerated glossed over and embellished if he did not absolutely invent  i was not old enough then to understand that most of the statements that float about the world are nothing but truths distorted and that nothing is more rare than unadulterated fact that truths and lies travel in company as described by pope in his temple of fame until  this or that unmixed no mortal eer shall find  in this very narration of our voyage rupert had left false impressions on the minds of his listeners in fifty things  he had made far more of both our little skirmishes than the truth would warrant and he had neglected to do justice to neb in his account of each of the affairs then he commended captain robbinss conduct in connection with the loss of the john on points that could not be sustained and censured him for measures that deserved praise i knew rupert was no seamanwas pretty well satisfied by this time he never would make onebut i could not explain all his obliquities by referring them to ignorance the manner moreover in which he represented himself as the principal actor on all occasions denoted so much address that while i felt the falsity of the impressions he left i did not exactly see the means necessary to counteract them so ingenious indeed was his manner of stringing facts and inferences together or what seemed to be facts and inferences that i more than once caught myself actually believing that which in sober reality i knew to be false i was still too young not quite eighteen to feel any apprehensions on the subject of grace and was too much accustomed to both rupert and his sister to regard either with any feelings very widely different from those which i entertained for grace herself  as soon as the history of our adventures and exploits was concluded we all had leisure to observe and comment on the alterations that time had made in our several persons rupert being the oldest was the least changed in this particular  he had got his growth early and was only a little spread he had cultivated a pair of whiskers at sea which rendered his face a little more manlyan improvement by the waybut the effects of exposure and of the sun excepted there was no very material change in his exterior  perhaps on the whole he was improved in appearance i think both the girls fancied this though grace did not say it and lucy only half admitted it and that with many reservations as for myself i was also fullgrown standing exactly six feet in my stockings which was pretty well for eighteen but i had also spread a fact that is not common for lads at that age grace said i had lost all delicacy of appearance and as for lucy though she laughed and blushed she protested i began to look like a great bear to confess the truth i was well satisfied with my own appearance did not envy rupert a jot and knew i could toss him over my shoulder whenever i chose i stood the strictures on my appearance therefore very well and though no one was so much derided and laughed at as myself in that critical discussion no one cared less for it all just as i was permitted to escape lucy said in an under tone  you should have staid at home miles and then the changes would have come so gradually no one would have noticed them and you would have escaped being told how much you are altered and that you are a bear  i looked eagerly round at the speaker and eyed her intently a look of regret passed over the dear creatures face her eyes looked as penitent as they did soft and the flush that suffused her countenance rendered this last expression almost bewitching at the same instant she whisperedi did not really mean that  but it was graces turn and my attention was drawn to my sister a year had made great improvements in grace  young as she was she had lost much of the girlish air in the sedateness and propriety of the young woman grace had always something more of these last than is common but they had now completely removed every appearance of childish i might almost say of girlish frivolity in person her improvement was great though an air of exceeding delicacy rather left an impression that such a being was more intended for another world than this there was ever an air of fragility and of pure intellectuality about my poor sister that half disposed one to fancy that she would one day be translated to a better sphere in the body precisely as she stood before human eyes lucy bore the examination well she was all woman there being nothing about her to create any miraculous expectations or fanciful pictures but she was evidently fast getting to be a very lovely woman honest sincere full of heart overflowing with the feelings of her sex gentle yet spirited buoyant though melting with the charities her changeful but natural and yet constant feelings in her kept me incessantly in pursuit of her playful mind and varying humours still a more highprincipled being a firmer or more consistent friend or a more accurate thinker on all subjects that suited her years and became her situation than lucy hardinge never existed even grace was influenced by her judgment though i did not then know how much my sisters mind was guided by her simple and less pretending friends capacity to foresee things and to reason on their consequences  we were more than an hour uninterruptedly together before we thought of repairing to the house lucy then reminded rupert that he had not yet seen his father whom she had just before observed alighting from his horse at the door of his own study that he had been apprised of the return of the runaways if not prodigals was evident she thought by his manner and it was disrespectful to delay seeking his forgiveness and blessing mr hardinge received us both without surprise and totally without any show of resentment it was about the time he expected our return and no surprise was felt at finding this expectation realized as a matter of course while resentment was almost a stranger to his nature we all shed tears the girls sobbing aloud and we were both solemnly blessed nor am i ashamed to say i knelt to receive that blessing in an age when the cant of a pretending irreligionthere is as much cant in selfsufficiency as in hypocrisy and they very often go togetheris disposed to turn into ridicule the humbling of the person while asking for the blessing of the almighty through the ministers of his altars for kneel i did and weep i did and i trust the one in humility and the other in contrition  when we had all become a little calm and a substantial meal was placed before us adventurers mr hardinge demanded an account of all that had passed he applied to me to give it and i was compelled to discharge the office of an historian somewhat against my inclination there was no remedy however and i told the story in my own simple manner and certainly in a way to leave very different impressions from many of those made by the narrative of rupert i thought once or twice as i proceeded that lucy looked sorrowful and grace looked surprised i do not think i coloured in the least as regarded myself and i know i did neb no more than justice my tale was soon told for i felt the whole time as if i were contradicting rupert who by the way appeared perfectly unconcernedperfectly unconscious indeedon the subject of the discrepancies in the two accounts i have since met with men who did not know the truth when it was even placed very fairly before their eyes  mr hardinge expressed his heartfelt happiness at having us back again and soon after he ventured to ask if we were satisfied with what we had seen of the world this was a home question but i thought it best to meet it manfully  so far from being satisfied i told him it was my ardent desire to get on board one of the lettersofmarque of which so many were then fitting out in the country and to make a voyage to europe rupert however confessed he had mistaken his vocation and that he thought he could do no better than to enter a lawyers office i was thunderstruck at this quiet admission of my friend of his incapacity to make a sailor for it was the first intimation i heard of his intention i had remarked a certain want of energy in various situations that required action in rupert but no want of courage and i had ascribed some portion of his lassitude to the change of condition and possibly of food for after all that godlike creature man is nothing but an animal and is just as much influenced by his stomach and digestion as a sheep or a horse  mr hardinge received his sons intimation of a preference of intellectual labours to a more physical state of existence with a gratification my own wishes did not afford him  still he made no particular remark to either at the time permitting us both to enjoy our return to clawbonny without any of the drawbacks of advice or lectures the evening passed delightfully the girls beginning to laugh heartily at our own ludicrous accounts of the mode of living on board ship and of our various scenes in china the isle of bourbon and elsewhere rupert had a great deal of humour and a very dry way of exhibiting it in short he was almost a genius in the mere superficialities of life and even grace rewarded his efforts to entertain us with laughter to tears  neb was introduced after supper and the fellow was both censured and commended censured for having abandoned the household gods and commended for not having deserted their master his droll descriptions of the chinese their dress pigtails shoes and broken english diverted even mr hardinge who i believe felt as much like a boy on this occasion as any of the party a happier evening than that which followed in the little teaparlour as my dear mother used to call it was never passed in the century that the roof had covered the old walls of clawbonny  next day i had a private conversation with my guardian who commenced the discourse by rendering a sort of account of the proceeds of my property during the past year  i listened respectfully and with some interest for i saw the first gave mr hardinge great satisfaction and i confess the last afforded some little pleasure to myself i found that things had gone on very prosperously ready money was accumulating and i saw that by the time i came of age sufficient cash would be on hand to give me a ship of my own should i choose to purchase one from that moment i was secretly determined to qualify myself to command her in the intervening time little was said of the future beyond an expression of the hope by my guardian that i would take time to reflect before i came to a final decision on the subject of my profession to this i said nothing beyond making a respectful inclination of the head  for the next month clawbonny was a scene of uninterrupted merriment and delight we had few families to visit in our immediate neighbourhood it is true and mr hardinge proposed an excursion to the springsthe country was then too new and the roads too bad to think of niagarabut to this i would not listen i cared not for the springsknew little of and cared less for fashionand loved clawbonny to its stocks and stones we remained at home then living principally for each other rupert read a good deal to the girls under the direction of his father while i passed no small portion of my time in athletic exercises  the grace  lucy made one or two tolerably long cruises in the river and at length i conceived the idea of taking the party down to town in the wallingford neither of the girls had ever seen new york or much of the hudson nor had either ever seen a ship the sloops that passed up and down the hudson with an occasional schooner were the extent of their acquaintance with vessels and i began to feel it to be matter of reproach that those in whom i took so deep an interest should be so ignorant as for the girls themselves they both admitted now i was a sailor that their desire to see a regular threemasted fullrigged ship was increased sevenfold  mr hardinge heard my proposition at first as a piece of pleasantry but grace expressing a strong desire to see a large town or what was thought a large town in this country in 1799 and lucy looking wistful though she remained silent under an apprehension her father could not afford the expense of such a journey which her imagination rendered a great deal more formidable than it actually proved to be the excellent divine finally acquiesced the expense was disposed of in a very simple manner the journey both ways would be made in the wallingford and mr  hardinge was not so unnecessarily scrupulous as to refuse passages for himself and children in the sloop which never exacted passagemoney from any who went to or from the farm food was so cheap too as to be a matter of no consideration and being entitled legally to receive that at clawbonny it made no great difference whether it were taken on board the vessel or in the house then there was a mrs bradfort in new york a widow lady of easy fortune who was a cousingerman of mr hardingeshis fathers sisters daughterand with her he always staid in his own annual visits to attend the convention of the churchi beg pardon of the protestant episcopal church as it is now de rigueur to say i wonder some ultra does not introduce the manifest improvement into the apostles creed of saying i believe in the holy protestant episcopal catholic church cbut the excellent divine in his annual attendance on the convention was accustomed to stay with his kinswoman who often pressed him to bring both lucy and grace to see her her house in wall street being abundantly large enough to accommodate a much more numerous party yes said mr hardinge that shall be the arrangement the girls and i will stay with mrs bradfort and the young men can live at a tavern i dare say this new city hotel which seems to be large enough to contain a regiment will hold even them i will write this very evening to my cousin so as not to take her by surprise  in less than a week after this determination an answer was received from mrs bradfort and the very next day the whole party neb included embarked in the wallingford  very different was this passage down the hudson from that which had preceded it then i had the sense of error about me while my heart yearned towards the two dear girls we had left on the wharf but now everything was aboveboard sincere and by permission it is scarcely necessary to say that grace and lucy were enchanted with everything they saw the highlands in particular threw them both into ecstasies though i have since seen so much of the world as to understand with nearly all experienced tourists that this is relatively the worst part of the scenery of this beautiful river when i say relatively i mean as comparing the bolder parts of our stream with those of othersspeaking of them as high landsmany other portions of this good globe having a much superior grandeur while very few have so much lovely river scenery compressed into so small a space as is to be found in the other parts of the hudson  in due time we arrived in new york and i had the supreme happiness of pointing out to the girls the states prison the bear market and the steeples of st pauls and trinityold trinity as it was so lately the fashion to style a church that was built only a few years before and which in my youth was considered as magnificent as it was venerable  that building has already disappeared and another edifice which is now termed splendid vast and i know not what has been reared in its place by the time this is gone and one or two generations of buildings have succeeded each approaching nearer to the high standard of church architecture in the old world the manhattanese will get to understand something of the use of the degrees of comparison on such subjects when that day shall arrive they will cease to be provincial andnot till then  what a different thing was wall street in 1799 from what it is today then where so many grecian temples are now reared to plutus were rows of modest provincial dwellings not a tittle more provincial however than the thousand meretricious houses of bricks and marble that have since started up in their neighbourhood but far less pretending and insomuch the more creditable mrs bradfort lived in one of these respectable abodes and thither mr  hardinge led the way with just as much confidence as one would now walk into bleeker street or the fifth avenue  moneychangers were then unknown or if known were of so little account that they had not sufficient force to form a colony and a league by themselves even the banks did not deem it necessary to be within a stones throw of each otheri believe there were but twoas it might be in selfdefence we have seen all sorts of expedients adopted in this sainted street to protect the moneybags from the little temple that was intended to be so small as only to admit the dollars and those who were to take care of them up to the edifice that might contain so many rogues as to render things safe on the familiar principle of setting a thief to catch a thief all would not do the difficulty has been found to be unconquerable except in those cases in which the homely and almost wornout expedient of employing honest men has been resorted to but to return from the gossipings of old age to an agreeable widow who was still under forty  mrs bradfort received mr hardinge in a way to satisfy us all that she was delighted to see him she had prepared a room for rupert and myself and no apologies or excuses would be received we had to consent to accept of her hospitalities in an hours time all were established and i believe all were at home  i shall not dwell on the happiness that succeeded we were all too young to go to parties and i might almost add new york itself was too young to have any but in the last i should have been mistaken though there were not as many childrens balls in 1799 perhaps after allowing for the difference in population as there are today if too young to be company we were not too young to see sights  i sometimes laugh as i remember what these were at that time there was such a museum as would now be thought lightly of in a western city of fifteen or twenty years growtha circus kept by a man of the name of rickettsthe theatre in john street a very modest thespian edificeand a lion i mean literally the beast that was kept in a cage quite out of town that his roaring might not disturb people somewhere near the spot where the triangle that is called franklin square now is all these we saw even to the theatre good indulgent mr hardinge seeing no harm in letting us go thither under the charge of mrs bradfort i shall never forget the ecstasy of that night the novelty was quite as great to rupert and myself as it was to the girls for though we had been to china we had never been to the play  well was it said vanity vanityall is vanity he that lives as long as i have lived will have seen most of his opinions and i think i may add all his tastes change  nothing short of revelation has a stronger tendency to convince us of the temporary character of our probationary state in this world than to note for how short a period and for what imperfect ends all our hopes and success in life have been buoying us up and occupying our minds after fifty the delusion begins to give way and though we may continue to live and even to be happy blind indeed must be he who does not see the end of his road and foresee some of the great results to which it is to lead but of all this our quartette thought little in the year 1799    chapter viii    thou art the same eternal sea   the earth hath many shapes and forms   of hill and valley flower and tree   fields that the fervid noontide warms   or winters rugged grasp deforms   or bright with autumns golden store   thou coverest up thy face with storms   or smilest serenebut still thy roar   and dashing foam go up to vex the seabeat shore   lunt   i had a free conversation with my guardian shortly after we reached town on the subject of my going to sea again  the whole country was alive with the armament of the new marine and cockedhats blue coats and white lapels began to appear in the streets with a parade that always marks the new officer and the new service now one meets distinguished naval men at every turn and sees nothing about their persons to denote the profession unless in actual employment afloat even the cockade being laid aside whereas in 1799 the harness was put on as soon as the parchment was received and only laid aside to turn in ships were building or equipping in all parts of the country and it is matter of surprise to me that i escaped the fever and did not apply to be made a midshipman had i seen another captain who interested me as much as captain dale i make no doubt my career would have been quite different but as things were i had imbibed the prejudice that southey in his very interesting but in a professional sense very worthless life of nelson has attributed to that heroaft the more honour forward the better man thus far i had not got into the cabinwindows and like all youngsters who fairly begin on the forecastle felt proud of my own manhood and disdain of hazards and toil i determined therefore to pursue the course i had originally pointed out to myself and follow in the footsteps of my father  privateers were out of the question in a war with a country that had no commerce nor do i think i would have gone in a privateer under any circumstances the business of carrying on a warfare merely for gain has ever struck me as discreditable though it must be admitted the american system of privatearmed cruisers has always been more respectable and better conducted than that of most other nations this has been owing to the circumstance that men of a higher class than is usual in europe have embarked in the enterprises to a letterofmarque however there could be no objection her regular business is commerce she arms only in selfdefence or if she capture anything it is merely such enemies as cross her path and who would capture her if they could i announced to mr hardinge therefore my determination not to return to clawbonny but to look for a berth in some letterofmarque while then in town  neb had received private instructions and my sea dunnage as well as his own was on board the wallingfordlow enough the wreck had reduced both to beand money obtained from mr hardinge was used to purchase more  i now began to look about me for a ship determined to please my eye as to the vessel and my judgment as to the voyage neb had orders to follow the wharves on the same errand i would sooner trust neb than rupert on such a duty the latter had no taste for ships felt no interest in them and i have often wondered why he took a fancy to go to sea at all with neb it was very different he was already an expert seaman could hand reef and steer knot and splice and was as useful as nine men in ten on board a vessel it is true he did not know when it became necessary to take in the last reefhad no notion of stowing a cargo so as to favour the vessel or help her sailing but he would break out a cask sooner than most men i ever met with there was too much nigger in him for headwork of that sort though he was ingenious and ready enough in his way a sterling fellow was neb and i got in time to love him very much as i can conceive one would love a brother  one day after i had seen all the sights and had begun to think seriously of finding a ship i was strolling along the wharves on the latter errand when i heard a voice i knew cry put there captain williams theres just your chap hell make as good a thirdmate as can be found in all america i had a sort of presentiment this applied to me though i could not on the instant recall the speakers name  turning to look in the direction of the sounds i saw the hard countenance of marble alongside the weatherbeaten face of a middleaged shipmaster both of whom were examining me over the nettings of a very promisinglooking armed merchantman i bowed to mr marble who beckoned me to come on board where i was regularly introduced to the master  this vessel was called the crisis a very capital name for a craft in a country where crisises of one sort or another occur regularly as often as once in six months she was a tight little ship of about four hundred tons had hooppole bulwarks as i afterwards learned with nettings for hammocks and old junk principally the latter and showed ten ninepounders carriageguns in her batteries i saw she was loaded and was soon given to understand that her shippingarticles were then open and the serious question was of procuring a thirdmate officers were scarce so many young men were pressing into the navy and mr marble ventured to recommend me from near a twelvemonths knowledge of my character i had not anticipated a berth aft quite so soon and yet i had a humble confidence in my own ability to discharge the duty captain williams questioned me for fifteen or twenty minutes had a short conversation with mr marble alone and then frankly offered me the berth the voyage was to be round the world and it took my fancy at the very sound the ship was to take a cargo of flour to england there she was to receive a small assorted cargo for the northwest coast and some of the sandalwood islands after disposing of her toys and manufactures in barter she was to sail for canton exchange her furs wood and other articles for teas c and return home  to engage in this voyage i was offered the berth i have mentioned and thirty dollars amonth the wages were of little moment to me but the promotion and the voyage were of great account the ship too carried out lettersofmarque and reprisal with her and there were the chances of meeting some frenchman in the european waters at least  i examined the vessel the berth i was to occupy made a great many shy glances at the captain to ascertain his character by that profound expedient analyzing his looks and finally determined to ship on condition neb should be taken as an ordinary seaman as soon as marble heard this last proposal he explained the relation in which the black stood to me and earnestly advised his being received as a seaman  the arrangement was made accordingly and i went at once to the notary and signed the articles neb was also found and he was shipped too this time regularly mr hardinge attending and giving his sanction to what was done the worthy divine was in excellent spirits for that very day he had made an arrangement with a friend at the bar to place rupert in his office mrs bradfort insisting on keeping her young kinsman in her house as a regular inmate this left on the father no more charge than to furnish rupert with clothes and a few dollars of pocketmoney but i knew rupert too well to suppose he would or could be content with the little he might expect from the savings of mr  hardinge i was not in want of money my guardian had supplied me so amply that not only had i paid my debt to the owners of the john and fully equipped myself for the voyage but i actually possessed dollars enough to supply all my probable wants during the expected absence many of the officers and men of the crisis left behind them orders with their wives and families to receive their wages in part during their absence as letters from time to time apprised the owners that these people were on board and in discharge of their several duties i determined on giving rupert the benefit of such an arrangement first presenting him with twenty dollars from my own little store i took him with me to the countinghouse and succeeded though not without some difficulty in obtaining for my friend a credit of twenty dollars amonth promising faithfully to repay any balance that might arise against me in consequence of the loss of the ship or of any accident to myself this i was enabled to do on the strength of my credit as the owner of clawbonny for as is usual in these cases i passed for being much richer than i really was though far from being poor  i will acknowledge that while i felt no reluctance at making this arrangement in favour of rupert i felt mortified he should accept it there are certain acts we may all wish to perform and yet which bring regrets when successfully performed i was sorry that my friend lucys brother graces admirerfor i was quick enough in perceiving that rupert began to entertain fancies of that sorthad not pride enough to cause him to decline receiving money which must be earned by the sweat of my brow and this moreover in a mode of life he had not himself sufficient resolution to encounter a second time but he accepted the offer and there was an end of it  as everything was alive in 1798 the crisis was ready to sail in three days after i joined her we hauled into the north river as became the dignity of our voyage and got our crew on board on the whole we mustered a pretty good body of men ten of them being green fellows who had never seen the ocean but who were young healthy and athletic and who promised to be useful before a great while including those aft we counted thirtyeight souls on board  the ship was got ready in hopes of being able to sail of a thursday for captain williams was a thoughtful man and was anxious to get the ship fairly at sea with the first work done previously to the next sabbath some small matters however could not be got through with in time and as for sailing of a friday that was out of the question no one did that in 1798 who could help it this gave us a holiday and i got leave to pass the afternoon and evening ashore  rupert grace lucy and i took a long walk into the country that evening that is we went into the fields and along the lanes for some distance above the present site of canal street lucy and i walked together most of the time and we both felt sad at the idea of so long a separation as was now before us the voyage might last three years and i should be legally a man my own master and lucy a young woman of near nineteen by that time terrible ages in perspective were these and which seemed to us pregnant with as many changes as the life of a man  rupert will be admitted to the bar when i get back i casually remarked as we talked the matter over  he will indeed the dear girl answered now you are to go miles i almost regret my brother is not to be in the ship you have known each other so long love each other so much and have already gone through such frightful trials in company  oh i shall do well enoughtherell be neb and as for rupert i think he will be better satisfied ashore than at sea rupert is a sort of a natural lawyer  by this i merely meant he was good at a subterfuge and could tell his own story  yes but neb is not rupert miles lucy answered quick as thought and i fancied a little reproachfully  very trueno doubt i shall miss your brother and that too very much at times but all i meant in speaking of neb was as you know that he and i like each other too and have been through just the same trials together you understand and have known each other as long as i can remember  lucy was silent and i felt embarrassed and a little at a loss what to say next but a girl approaching sixteen and who is with a youth who possesses her entire confidence is not apt to be long silent something she will say and how often is that something warm with natural feeling instinct with truth and touching from its confiding simplicity  you will sometimes think of us miles was lucys next remark and it was said in a tone that induced me to look her full in the face when i discovered that her eyes were suffused with tears  of that you may be very certain and i hope to be rewarded in kind but now i think of it lucy i have a debt to pay you and at the same time a little interest here are the halfjoes you forced me to take last year when we parted at clawbonny see they are exactly the same pieces for i would as soon have parted with a finger as with one of them  i had hoped they might have been of use to you and had quite forgotten them you have destroyed an agreeable illusion  is it not quite as agreeable to know we had no occasion for them no here they are and now i go with mr  hardinges full approbation you very well know i can be in no want of money so there is your gold and here lucy is some interest for the use of it  i made an effort to put something into the dear girls hand as i spoke but all the strength i could properly apply was not equal to the purpose so tightly did she keep her little fingers compressed that i could not succeed without a downright effort at force  nonomiles she said hurriedlyalmost huskily that will never do i am not rupertyou may prevail with him never with me  rupert what can rupert have to do with such a thing as this locket youngsters dont wear lockets  lucys fingers separated as easily as an infants and i put my little offering into her hand without any more resistance  i was sorry however to discover that by some means unknown to me she had become acquainted with the arrangement i had made as respected the twenty dollars a month i afterwards ascertained that this secret had leaked out through neb who had it from one of the clerks of the countinghouse who had visited the ship and repeated it to mrs bradforts black maid in one of his frequent visits to the house this is a common channel of information though it seldom proves as true as it did in this instance  i could see that lucy was delighted with her locket it was a very pretty ornament in the first place and it had her own hair that of grace rupert and my own very prettily braided together so as to form a wreath made like a rope or a grummet encircling a combination of letters that included all our initials in this there was nothing that was particular while there was much that was affectionate  had i not consulted grace on the subject it is possible i should have been less cautious though i declare i had no thought of making love all this time i fancied i felt for and trusted lucy as another sister i was shrewd enough to detect ruperts manner and feeling towards my own sister and i felt afraid it was or soon would be fully reciprocated but as to imagining myself in love with lucy hardinge or any one else the thought never crossed my mind though the dear girl herself so often did  i saw lucys smile and i could not avoid noticing the manner in which once or twice unconsciously to herself i do believe this simpleminded sincere creature pressed the hand which retained the locket to her heart and yet it made no very lively impression on my imagination at the time  the conversation soon changed and we began to converse of other things i have since fancied that grace had left us alone in order that i might return the halfjoes to lucy and offer the locket for looking round and seeing the latter in its new owners hand while lucy was bestowing on it one of the hundred glances of grateful pleasure it received that afternoon she waited until we came up when she took my arm remarking as this was to be our last evening together she must come in for her share of the conversation  now i solemnly affirm that this was the nearest approach to anything like a lovescene that had ever passed between lucy hardinge and myself  i would gladly pass over the leavetaking and shall say but little about it mr hardinge called me into his room when we got back to the house he spoke earnestly and solemnly to me recalling to my mind many of his early and most useful precepts he then kissed me gave me his blessing and promised to remember me in his prayers as i left him and i believe he went on his knees as soon as my back was turned lucy was waiting for me in the passage  she was in tears and paler than common but her mind seemed made up to sustain a great sacrifice like a woman  she put a small but exceedingly neat copy of the bible into my hand and uttered as well as emotion would permitthere miles that is my keepsake i do not ask you to think of me when you read but think of god she then snatched a kiss and flew into her room and locked the door  grace was below and she wept on my neck like a child kissing me again and again and calling me her brotherher dear her only brother i was obliged actually to tear myself away from grace rupert went with me to the ship and passed an hour or two on board as we crossed the threshold i heard a window open above my head and looking up i saw lucy with streaming eyes leaning forward to say write mileswrite as often as you possibly can  man must be a stern being by nature to be able to tear himself from such friends in order to encounter enemies hardships dangers and toil and all without any visible motive  such was my case however for i wanted not for a competency or for most of those advantages which might tempt one to abandon the voyage of such a measure the possibility never crossed my mind i believed that it was just as necessary for me to remain thirdmate of the crisis and to stick by the ship while she would float as mr adams thinks it necessary for him to present abolition petitions to a congress which will not receive them we both of us doubtless believed ourselves the victims of fate  we sailed at sunrise wind and tide favouring we had anchored off courtlandt street and as the ship swept past the battery i saw rupert who had only gone ashore in the pilots boat at daylight with two females watching our movements the girls did not dare to wave their handkerchiefs but what cared i for thati knew that their good wishes kind wishes tender wishes went with me and this little touch of affection which woman knows so well how to manifest made me both happy and sad for the remainder of the day  the crisis was an unusually fast ship faster even than the tigris coppered to the bends copperfastened and with a liveoak frame no better craft sailed out of the republic  uncle sam had tried to purchase her for one of his new navy but the owners having this voyage in view refused his tempting offers she was no sooner under her canvass than all hands of us perceived we were in a traveller and glad enough were we to be certain of the fact for we had a long road before us this too was with the wind free and in smooth water whereas those who knew the vessel asserted her forte was on a bowline and in a seathat is to say she would sail relatively faster than most other craft under the latter circumstances  there was a strange pleasure to me notwithstanding all i had suffered previously all the risks i had run and all i had left behind me in finding myself once more on the broad ocean as for neb the fellow was fairly enraptured so quickly and intelligently did he obey his orders that he won a reputation before we crossed the bar the smell of the ocean seemed to imbue him with a species of nautical inspiration and even i was astonished with his readiness and activity as for myself i was every way at home very different was this exit from the port from that of the previous year then everything was novel and not a little disgusting now i had little almost nothing to learnliterally nothing i might have said were it not that every shipmaster has certain ways of his own that it behooves all his subordinates to learn as quickly as possible then i lived aft where we not only had plates and tablecloths and tumblers and knives and forks but comparatively clean articles of the sort i say comparatively the two other degrees being usually wanting in northwest traders  the crisis went to sea with a lively breeze at southwest the wind shifting after she had got into the lower bay there were a dozen sail of us altogether and in our little fleet were two of uncle sams men who felt disposed to try their hands with us we crossed the bar all three of us within a cables length of each other and made sail in company with the wind a trifle abaft the beam just as navesink disappeared our two menofwar merchantmen altered hauled up on bowlines and jogged off towards the west indies being at the time about a league astern of us this success put us all in high goodhumour and had such an effect on marble in particular that he began to give it as his opinion that our only superiority over them would not be found confined to sailing on an experiment it is very convenient to think favourably of ones self and it is certainly comfortable to entertain the same notion as respects ones ship  i confess to a little awkwardness at first in acting as an officer i was young and commanded men old enough to be my fatherregular seadogs who were as critical in all that related to the niceties of the calling as the journalist who is unable to appreciate the higher qualities of a book is hypercritical on its minor faults but a few days gave me confidence and i soon found i was obeyed as readily as the firstmate a squall struck the ship in my watch about a fortnight out and i succeeded in getting in sail and saving everything canvass and spars in a way that did me infinite service aft captain williams spoke to me on the subject commending the orders i had given and the coolness with which they had been issued for as i afterwards understood he remained some time in the companionway keeping the other two mates back though all hands had been called in order to see how i could get along by myself in such a strait on this occasion i never saw a human being exert himself like neb he felt that my honour was concerned  i do really think the fellow did two mens duty the whole time the squall lasted until this little incident occurred captain williams was in the habit of coming on deck to examine the heavens and see how things were getting on in my nightwatches but after this he paid no more visits of this sort to me than he paid to mr marble  i had been gratified by his praises but this quiet mode of showing confidence gave me more happiness than i can express  we had a long passage out the wind hanging to the eastward near three weeks at length we got moderate southerly breezes and began to travel on our course twentyfour hours after we had got the fair wind i had the morning watch and made as the day dawned a sail directly abeam of us to windward about three leagues distant or just hull down i went into the maintop and examined her with a glass she was a ship seemingly of about our own size and carrying everything that would draw i did not send word below until it was broad daylight or for near half an hour and in all that time her bearings did not vary any perceptible distance  just as the sun rose the captain and chiefmate made their appearance on deck at first they agreed in supposing the stranger a stray english westindiaman bound home for at that time few merchant vessels were met at sea that were not english or american the former usually sailed in convoys however and the captain accounted for the circumstance that this was not thus protected by the fact of her sailing so fast she might be a letterofmarque like ourselves and vessels of that character did not take convoy  as the two vessels lay exactly abeam of each other with square yards it was not easy to judge of the sparring of the stranger except by means of his masts marble judging by the appearance of his topsails began to think our neighbour might be a frenchman he had so much hoist to the sails after some conversation on the subject the captain ordered me to brace forward the yards as far as our studdingsails would allow and to luff nearer to the stranger  while the ship was thus changing her course the day advanced and our crew got their breakfast  as a matter of course the strange ship which kept on the same line of sailing as before drew ahead of us a little while we neared her sensibly in the course of three hours we were within a league of her but well on her leequarter  marble now unhesitatingly pronounced her to be a frenchman there being no such thing as mistaking the sails to suppose an englishman would go to sea with such triangles of royals he held to be entirely out of the question and then he referred to me to know if i did not remember the brig we had licked in the west indies last vyge which had just such ryals as the chap up there to windward i could see the resemblance certainly and had remarked the same peculiarity in the few french vessels i had seen  under all the circumstances captain williams determined to get on the weatherquarter of our neighbour and take a still nearer look at him that he was armed we could see already and as near as we could make out he carried twelve guns or just two more than we did ourselves all this was encouraging sufficiently so at least to induce us to make a much closer examination than we had yet done  it took two more hours to bring the crisis fast as she sailed on the weatherquarter of her neighbour distant about a mile here our observations were much more to the purpose and even captain williams pronounced the stranger to be a frenchman and no doubt a letterofmarque like ourselves he had just uttered these words when we saw the other vessels studdingsails coming down her royals and topgallantsails clewing up and all the usual signs of her stripping for a fight we had set our ensign early in the day but as yet had got no answering symbol of nationality from the chase as soon as she had taken in all her light canvass however she clewed up her courses fired a gun to windward and hoisted the french tricolor the most graceful flag among the emblems of christendom but one that has been as remarkably unsuccessful in the deeds it has witnessed on the high seas as it has been remarkable for the reverse on land the french have not been wanting in excellent sailorsgallant seamen too but the results of their exploits afloat have ever borne a singular disproportion to the means employeda few occasional exceptions just going to prove that the causes have been of a character as peculiar as these results have in nearly all ages been uniform i have heard the want of success in maritime exploits among the french attributed to a want of sympathy in the nation with maritime things others again have supposed that the narrow system of preferring birth to merit which pervaded the whole economy of the french marine as well as of its army previously to the revolution could not fail to destroy the former inasmuch as a man of family would not consent to undergo the toil and hardships that are unavoidable to the training of the true seaman this last reason however can scarcely be the true one as the young english noble has often made the most successful naval officer and the marine of france in 1798 had surely every opportunity of perfecting itself by downright practice uninjured by favouritism as that of america for myself though i have now reflected on the subject for years i can come to no other conclusion than that national character has some very important agencyor perhaps it might be safer to say has had some very important agencythrough some cause or other in disqualifying france from becoming a great naval power in the sense of skill in that of mere force so great a nation must always be formidable now she sends her princes to sea however we may look for different results  notwithstanding the fact that an englishman or an american rarely went alongside of a frenchman in 1798 without a strong moral assurance of victory he was sometimes disappointed there was no lack of courage in their enemies and it occasionally happened that there was no lack of skill every manifestation that the experience of our captain could detect went to show that we had fallen in with one of these exceptions as we drew nearer to our enemy we perceived that he was acting like a seaman his sails had been furled without haste or confusion an infallible evidence of coolness and discipline when done on the eve of battle and signs that the watchful seaman on such occasions usually notes as unerring indications of the sort of struggle that awaits him it was consequently understood among us on the quarterdeck that we were likely to have a warm days work of it nevertheless we had gone too far to retreat without an effort and we began in our turn to shorten sail in readiness for the combat marble was a prince of a fellow when it came to anything serious i never saw him shorten sail as coolly and readily as he did that very day we had everything ready in ten minutes after we began  it was rare indeed to see two lettersofmarque setto as coolly and as scientifically as were the facts with the crisis and la dame de nantes for so as we afterwards ascertained was our antagonist called neither party aimed at any great advantage by manoeuvring but we came up alongside of the lady as our men subsequently nicknamed the frenchman the two vessels delivering their broadsides nearly at the same instant i was stationed on the forecastle in charge of the headsheets with orders to attend generally to the braces and the rigging using a musket in moments that were not otherwise employed away went both my jibsheet blocks at the beginning giving me a very pretty job from the outset this was but the commencement of trouble for during the two hours and a half that we lay battering la dame de nantes and she lay battering us i had really so much to attend to in the way of reeving knotting splicing and turning in afresh that i had scarcely a minute to look about me in order to ascertain how the day was going i fired my musket but twice the glimpses i did manage to take were far from satisfactory however several of our people being killed or wounded one gun fairly crippled by a shot and our rigging in a sad plight the only thing encouragng was nebs shout the fellow making it a point to roar almost as loud as his gun at each discharge  it was evident from the first that the frenchman had nearly twice as many men as we carried this rendered any attempt at boarding imprudent and in the way of pounding our prospects were by no means flattering at length i heard a rushing sound over my head and looking up i saw that the maintopmast with the yards and sails had come down on the forebraces and might shortly be expected on deck at this point captain williams ordered all hands from the guns to clear the wreck at the same instant our antagonist with a degree of complaisance that i could have hugged him for ceased firing also both sides seemed to think it was very foolish for two merchantmen to lie within a cables length of each other trying which could do the other the most harm and both sides set about the by this time very necessary duty of repairing damages  while this was going on the men at the wheel by a species of instinctive caution did their whole duty the crisis luffed all she was able while la dame de nantes edged away all she very conveniently could placing more than a mile of blue water between the two vessels before we who were at work aloft were aware they were so decidedly running on diverging lines  it was night before we got our wreck clear and then we had to look about us to get out spare spars fit them rig them point them and sway them aloft the last operation however was deferred until morning as it was the days work had been hard and the people really wanted rest  rest was granted them at eight oclock at which hour our late antagonist was visible about a league distant the darkness beginning to envelope her in the morning the horizon was clear owing to the repulsion which existed in so much force between the two vessels it was not our business to trouble ourselves about the fate of our adversary but to take heed of our own that morning we go up our spars crossed the yards and made sail again we had several days work in repairing all our damages but happening to be found for a long voyage and well found too by the end of a week the crisis was in as good order as if we had not fought a battle as for the combat it was one of those in which either side might claim the victory or not as it suited tastes we had very ingenious excuses for our failure however and i make no doubt the french were just as ready in this way as we were ourselves  our loss in this engagement amounted to two men killed outright and to seven wounded two of whom died within a few days the remaining wounded all recovered though the secondmate who was one of them i believe never got to be again the man he had been a canistershot lodged near his hip and the creature we had on board as a surgeon was not the hero to extract it in that day the country was not so very well provided with medical men on the land as to spare many good ones to the sea in the new navy it was much the fashion to say if you want a leg amputated send for the carpenter he does know how to use a saw while it is questionable whether the doctor knows how to use anything times however are greatly altered in this respect the gentlemen who now compose this branch of the service being not only worthy of commendation for their skill and services but worthy of the graduated rank which i see they are just now asking of the justice of their country and which as that country ordinarily administers justice i am much afraid they will ask in vain    chapter ix                                     if we     cannot defend our own door from the dog     let us be worried and our nation lose     the name of hardiness and policy     henry v   the combat between the crisis and la dame de nantes took place in 423712 north latitude and 341643 west longitude from greenwich this was very near the centre of the northern atlantic and gave us ample time to get our ship in good condition before we drew in with the land  shortly after the affair the wind came out light at northeast forcing us down nearer to the bay of biscay than was at all convenient when bound to london the weather grew foggy too which is not usual on the coast of europe with the wind at east and the nights dark just a fortnight after the action i was awakened early one morning by a rough shake of the shoulder from marble who had the watch but who was calling me at least an hour before the time bear a hand and turn out he said i want you on deck mr  wallingford i obeyed of course and soon stood in the presence of the chiefmate rubbing my eyes diligently as if they had to be opened by friction  it was just six bells or seven oclock and one of the watch was on the point of making the bell proclaim as much when mr marble ordered him not to strike the hour the weather was thick or rather foggy and the wind light with very little sea going all this i had time to notice to listen to the unusual order about the bell and to gape twice before the male turned to me he seized my arm carried me on the lee side of the quarterdeck shook his finger at a vacant spot in the fog and said  miles my boy down yonder within half a mile of this very spot is our friend the frenchman  how is it possible you can know that mr marble i demanded in surprise  because i have seen him with these two goodlooking eyes of mine this fog opens and shuts like a playhousecurtain and i got a peep at the chap about ten minutes since it was a short look but it was a sure one i would swear to the fellow in any admiralty court in christendom  and what do you intend to do mr marble we found him a hard subject in clear weather what can we do with him in thick  that depends on the old man his very natur is overlaid by what has happened already and i rather think he will be for a fresh skrimmagemarble was an uneducated kennebunk man and by no means particular about his english therell be good picking in that french gentleman master miles for those who come in at the beginning of the plunder  the chiefmate then told me to go below and turn up all hands making as little rumpus about it as possible this i did and when i returned to the deck i found the fingers of marble going again with captain williams for his auditor just as they had gone to me a few minutes earlier  being an officer i made no scruples about joining the party  marble was giving his account of the manner in which he had momentarily seen the enemy the canvass he was under the course he was steering and the air of security that prevailed about him so much he insisted he had noted though he saw the ship for about twenty seconds only all this however might be true for a seamans eye is quick and he has modes of his own for seeing a great deal in a brief space of time marble now proposed that we should go to quarters run alongside of the frenchman pour in a broadside and board him in the smoke our success would be certain could we close with him without being seen and it would be almost as certain could we engage him with our guns by surprise the chiefmate was of opinion we had dosed him in the other affair in a way to sicken him this time we should bring him to with a round turn  the old man was pleased with the notion i saw at a glance and i confess it took my fancy also we all felt very sore at the result of the other attempt and here it seemed as if fortune gave us a good occasion for repairing the evil  there can be no harm in getting ready mr marble the captain observed and when we are ready ourselves we shall know better what to think of the matter  this was no sooner said than away we went to clear ship  our task was soon done the tompions were got out the guns cast loose ammunition was brought up and a stand of grape was put in over the shot in every piece in both batteries as the men were told the motive they worked like drayhorses and i do not think we were ten minutes before the ship was ready to go into action at a moments notice  all this time captain williams refused to keep the ship away i believe he wanted to get a look at our neighbour himself for he could not but foresee what might be the consequences should he run down in the fog and engage a heavier vessel than his own without the ceremony of a hail  the sea was covered with englishmen and one of their cruisers might not very easily pardon such a mistake however honestly made but preparation seems to infer a necessity for performance when everything was ready all eyes were turned aft in a way that human nature could hardly endure and the captain was obliged to yield as marble of all on board had alone seen the other vessel he was directed to conn the crisis in the delicate operation she was about to undertake  as before my station was on the forecastle i had been directed to keep a bright lookout as the enemy would doubtless be first seen from forward the order was unnecessary however for never did human beings gaze into a fog more anxiously than did all on board our ship on this occasion calculating by the distance and the courses steered we supposed ten or fifteen minutes would bring us square alongside of mr marbles ship though some among us doubted his having seen any vessel at all there was about a fiveknot breeze and we had all our square sails set knowing it was necessary to go a little faster than our adversary to catch up with him the intense expectation not to say anxiety of such a scene is not easily described  the surrounding fog at times seemed filled with ships but all vanished into thick air one after another leaving nothing but vapour severe orders had been given for no one to call out but the moment the ship was seen for the discoverer to go aft and report at least a dozen men left their quarters on this errand all returning in the next instant satisfied they had been deceived each moment too increased the expectation for each moment must we be getting nearer and nearer to her if any vessel were really there quite twenty minutes however passed in this manner and no ship was seen marble continued cool and confident but the captain and secondmate smiled while the people began to shake their heads and roll the tobacco into their cheeks as we advanced our own ship luffed by degrees until we had got fairly on our old course again or were sailing close upon the wind this change was made easily the braces not having been touched a precaution that was taken expressly to give us this advantage when we found ourselves once more close upon the wind we gave the matter up forward supposing the mate had been deceived  i saw by the expression of the captains face that he was about to give the order to secure the guns when casting my eyes forward there was a ship sure enough within a hundred yards of us i held up both arms as i looked aft and luckily caught the captains eye in an instant he was on the forecastle  it was easy enough to see the stranger now there he was in the fog looking mystical and hazy but there he was under his maintop gallantsail closehauled and moving ahead in all the confidence of the solitude of the ocean  we could not see his hull or so faintly as only to distinguish its mass but from his tops up there was no mistaking the objects we had shot away the frenchmans mizenroyalmast it was a pole and there the stump stood just as it was when we had last seen him on the evening of the day of the combat this left no doubt of the character of our neighbour and it at once determined our course as it was we were greatly outsailing him but an order was immediately given to set the light staysails as captain williams passed aft he gave his orders to the men in the batteries  in the mean time the secondmate who spoke very good new york french came upon the forecastle in readiness to answer the expected hail as the crisis was kept a little free in order to close and as she sailed so fast it was apparent we were coming up with the chase hand over hand  the two ships were not more than a hundred feet asunder when the frenchmen first saw us this blindness was owing to several circumstances in the first place ten men look forward in a ship where one looks aft those who looked aloft too were generally on the quarterdeck and this prevented them from looking astern then the frenchmans crew had just gone to their breakfasts most of them eating below she was so stronghanded moreover as to give a forenoons watch below and this still left many of the sluggards in their hammocks in that day even a french shipoftheline was no model of discipline or order and a letterofmarque was consequently worse as it afterwards appeared we were first seen by the mate of the watch who ran to the taffrail and instead of giving an order to call all hands he hailed us mr forbank our secondmate answered mumbling his words so that if they were bad french they did not sound like good english he got out the name le hasard de bordeaux pretty plainly however and this served to mystify the mate for a few seconds  by the end of that time our bows were doubling on the frenchmans quarter and we were sheering into him so fast as quite to distract the nantes man the hail had been heard below however and the frenchmen came tumbling up by the dozen forward and aft  captain williams was a prime seaman and one of the coolest men that ever lived everything that day was done at precisely the proper moment the frenchman attempted to keep off but our wheel was so touched as to keep us lapping in nearly a parallel line with them the whole time and our forward sails soon becalmed even their mainsail of course we went two feet to their one marble came on the forecastle just as our cathead was abreast of the ladys forwardrigging less than a minute was required to take us so far forward and that minute was one of great confusion among the french as soon as marble got on the forecastle he made a signal the ensign was run up and the order was given to fire we let fly all five of our ninepounders loaded with two round and a stand of grape at the same moment at the next instant the crash of the ships coming foul of each other was heard marble shouted come on boys and away he and i and neb and all hands of us went on board of the frenchman like a hurricane  i anticipated a furious hand to hand conflict but we found the deck deserted and had no difficulty whatever in getting possession the surprise the rush and the effect of the broadside gave us an easy victory the french captain had been nearly cut in two by a ninepound shot moreover and both of the mates were severely wounded  these accidents contributed largely to our success causing the enemy to abandon the defence as hopeless we had not a soul hurt  the prize proved to be the ship i have mentioned a letterofmarque from guadaloupe bound to nantes she was a trifle larger than the crisis mounted twelve french nines and had eightythree souls on board when she sailed of these however no less than twentythree had been killed and wounded in our previous affair with her and several were absent in a prize of the wounded nearly all were still in their hammocks among the remainder some sixteen or eighteen suffered by our close and destructive broadside on the present occasion reducing the efficient part of her crew to about our own numbers the vessel was new and valuable and her cargo was invoiced at something like sixty thousand dollars having some cochineal among it  as soon as assured of our victory the crisiss maintopsail was braced aback as well as it could be and her helm put down at the same time the dame was kept away and the two ships went clear of each other little injury had been done by the collision or the grinding and in consequence of our guns having been so much shotted no damage whatever was done the lower masts of the prize  the shot had just force enough to pass through the bulwarks make splinters and to lodge this left both vessels in good condition for going into port  at first it was determined to leave me in la dame de nantes as prizemaster with directions to follow the crisis into falmouth whither she was bound for orders but on further examination it was discovered that the crew of an american brig was on board the prize as prisoners la dame de nantes having captured the vessel only two days before we met the former the first time taken out her people manned her and ordered her for nantes these americans including the master and two mates amounted to thirteen souls in all and they enabled us to make a different disposition of the prize the result of an hour or twos deliberations was as follows  our old secondmate whose hurt was likely to require better care than could be had on the northwest coast was put on board the french ship as prizemaster with orders to make the best of his way to new york the master and chiefmate of the american brig agreed to act under him and to assist in carrying la dame across the ocean three or four of our invalids were sent home also and the liberated americans took service for the passage all the french wounded were left in the ship under the charge of their own surgeon who was a man of some little merit though a good deal of a butcher as was too much the fashion of that day  it was dark before all the arrangements were made when la dame de nantes turned short round on her heel and made sail for america of course our captain sent in his official report by her and i seized a moment to write a short letter to grace which was so worded as to be addressed to the whole family i knew how much happiness a line from me would bestow and i had the pleasure to inform them also that i was promoted to be secondmatethe secondmate of the american brig having shipped as my successor in the rank of thirdofficer  the parting on the wide ocean that night was solemn and in some respects sad we knew that several who were in la dame de nantes would probably be left behind as she travelled her long solitary path in the depths of the ocean and there were the chances that she herself might never arrive as respects the last however the odds were in her favour the american coast being effectually cleared of french privateers by that time and i subsequently received eleven hundred and seventythree dollars for my share in that exploit how i was affected by the circumstance and what i did with the money will appear in the sequel  the crisis made sail on a bowline at the same moment her prize filled away for america miles wallingford a much more important personage than he had been a few hours before we put the prisoners below keeping a good watch over them and hauled off to the northward and westward in order to avoid any french cruisers that might be hovering on their own coast captain williams seemed satisfied with the share of glory he had obtained and manifested no further disposition to seek renown in arms as for marble i never knew a man more exalted in his own esteem than he was by the results of that days work it certainly did him great credit but from that hour woe to the man who pretended to dispute with him concerning the character of any sail that happened to cross our path  the day after we parted company with our prize we made a sail to the westward and hauled up to take a look at her the wind having shifted she was soon pronounced to be an american but though we showed our colours the stranger a brig manifested no disposition to speak us this induced captain williams to make sail in chase more especially as the brig endeavoured to elude us by passing ahead and the run was pretty nearly on our course at 4 p m  we got near enough to throw a ninepound shot between the fellows masts when the chase hoveto and permitted us to come up the brig proved to be the prize of la dame de nantes and we took possession of her forthwith as this vessel was loaded with flour pot and pearl ashes c and was bound to london i was put in charge of her with a young man of my own age of the name of roger talcott for my assistant having six men for my crew of course the frenchmen all but one who acted as cook and steward excepted were received on board the crisis neb went with me through his own and my earnest entreaties though spared by marble with great reluctance  this was my first command and proud enough did i feel on the occasion though almost dying with the apprehension of doing something wrong my orders were to make the lizard light and to crawl along upchannel keeping close in with the english coast captain williams anticipating instructions to go to the same port to which the amanda the brig was bound and expecting to overtake us after he had called at falmouth for his orders as the crisis could go four feet to the amandas three before sunset our old ship was hull down ahead of us  when i took charge of the deck the next morning i found myself on the wide ocean with nothing in sight at the age of eighteen and in the enemys seas with a valuable vessel to care for my way to find into narrow waters that i had never entered and a crew on board of whom just onehalf were now on their first voyage our green hands had manifested the aptitude of americans and had done wonders in the way of improvement but a great deal still remained to be learned the crisiss complement had been too large to employ everybody at all sorts of work as is usually done in a merchantvessel with her ordinary number of hands and the landsmen had to take their chances for instruction  notwithstanding the men i got were stout healthy willing and able to pull and haul with the oldest salts  by the arrangement that had been made i was now thrown upon my own resources seamanship navigation address prudence all depended on me i confess i was at first nearly as much depressed by the novelty and responsibility of my command as neb was delighted but it is surprising how soon we get accustomed to changes of this sort the first five or six hours set me quite at my ease though it is true nothing occurred in the least out of the usual way and by the time the sun set i should have been happy could i have got over the uneasiness produced by the darkness the wind had got round to southwest and blew fresh i set a lower and a topmast studdingsail and by the time the light had entirely vanished the brig began to drag after her canvass in a way to keep me wide awake i was at a loss whether to shorten sail or not on the one hand there was the apprehension of carrying away something and on the other the fear of seeming timid in the eyes of the two or three seamen i had with me i watched the countenances of these men in order to glean their private sentiments but usually jack relies so much on his officers that he seldom anticipates evils as for neb the harder it blew the greater was his rapture he appeared to think the wind was master miless as well as the ocean the brig and himself the more there was of each the richer i became as for talcott he was scarcely as good a seaman as myself though he was welleducated had good manners was wellconnected and had been my original competitor for the office of thirdmate i had been preferred only through the earnest recommendations of marble talcott however was as expert a navigator as we had in the ship and had been placed with me on that account captain williams fancying two heads might prove better than one  i took this young man into the cabin with me not only as a companion but to give him consideration with the people forward on shore though less fortunate in the way of state he would have been considered as fully my equal in position  talcott and myself remained on deck together nearly the whole of the first night and the little sleep i did get was caught in a topmast studdingsail that lay on the quarterdeck and which i had determined not to set after rowsing it up for that purpose when daylight returned however with a clear horizon no increase of wind and nothing in sight i was so much relieved as to take a good nap until eight all that day we started neither tack nor sheet nor touched a brace towards evening i went aloft myself to look for land but without success though i knew from our observation at noon it could not be far off fifty years ago the longitude was the great difficulty with navigators both talcott and myself did very well with the lunars it is true but there was no chance to observe and even lunars soon get out of their reckoning among currents and tides glad enough then was i to hear neb sing but light ahead  from the foretopsailyard this was about ten oclock  i knew this light must be the lizard as we were too far to the eastward for scilly the course was changed so as to bring the light a little on the weatherbow and i watched for its appearance to us on deck with an anxiety i have experienced since only in the most trying circumstances  half an hour sufficed for this and then i felt comparatively happy a new beginner even is not badly off with the wind fresh at southwest and the lizard light in plain view on his weatherbow if he happen to be bound upchannel that night consequently proved to be more comfortable than the previous  next morning there was no change except in the brigs position we were well in the channel had the land as close aboard as was prudent and could plainly see by objects ashore that we were travelling ahead at a famous rate we went within a mile of the eddystone so determined was i to keep as far as possible from the french privateers next morning we were up abreast of the isle of wight but the wind had got round to the southward and eastward becoming much lighter and so scant as to bring us on a taut bowline this made england a leeshore and i began to be as glad to get off it as i had lately been to hug it  all this time it will easily be understood that we kept a sharp lookout on board the brig for enemies we saw a great many sail particularly as we approached the straits of dover and kept as much aloof from all as circumstances would allow several were evidently english vesselsofwar and i felt no small concern on the subject of having some of my men impressed for at that period and for many years afterwards ships of all nations that traded with the english lost many of their people by this practice and the american craft more than any other i ascribed to our sticking so close to the coast which we did as long as it was at all safe the manner in which we were permitted to pass unnoticed or at least undetained but as we drew nearer to the narrow waters i had little hope of escaping without being boarded in the mean while we made short stretches off the land and back again all one day and night working slowly to the eastward we still met with no interruption  i was fast getting confidence in myself handling the amanda in my own judgment quite as welt as marble could have done it and getting my green hands into so much method and practice that i should not have hesitated about turning round and shaping our course for new york so far as the mere business of navigating the vessel was concerned  the lights on the english coast were safe guides for our movements and they let me understand how much we made or lost on a tack dungeness was drawing nearer slowly to appearances and i was beginning to look out for a pilot when talcott who had the watch about three in the morning came with breathless haste into the cabin to tell me there was a sail closing with us fast and so far as he could make her out in the darkness she was luggerrigged this was startling news indeed for it was almost tantamount to saying the stranger was a frenchman i did not undress at all and was on deck in a moment the vessel in chase was about half a mile distant on our leequarter but could be plainly enough distinguished and i saw at a glance she was a lugger there were certainly english luggers but all the traditions of the profession had taught me to regard a vessel of that particular rig as a frenchman i had heard of privateers from dunkirk boulogne and various other ports in france running over to the english coast in the night and making prizes just as this fellow seemed disposed to serve us luckily our head was toward the land and we were looking about a point and a half to windward of the light on dungeness being also favoured with a floodtide so far as we could judge by the rapid drift of the vessel to windward  my decision was made in a minute i knew nothing of batteries or where to seek protection but there was the land and i determined to make for it as fast as i could by keeping the brig a good full and making all the sail she could carry i thought we might run ashore before the lugger could get alongside us as for her firing i did not believe she would dare to attempt that as it might bring some english cruiser on her heels and france was some hours sail distant the fore and mizen topgallantsails were set as fast as possible the weatherbraces pulled upon a little the bowlines eased and the brig kept a rapfull the amanda was no flyer certainly but she seemed frightened as much as we were ourselves that night i never knew her to get along so fast considering the wind and really there was a short time when i began to think she held her own the lugger being jammed up as close as she could be but this was all delusion that craft coming after us more like a seaserpent than a machine carried ahead by canvass i was soon certain that escape from such a racer by sailing was altogether out of the question  the land and light were now close aboard us and i expected every moment to hear the brigs keel grinding on the bottom at this instant i caught a faint glimpse of a vessel at anchor to the eastward of the point and apparently distant about a quarter of a mile the thought struck me that she might be an english cruiser for they frequently anchored in such places and i called out as it might be instinctively luff neb was at the helm and i knew by his cheerful answer that the fellow was delighted it was lucky we luffed as we did for in coming to the wind the vessel gave a scrape that was a fearful admonisher of what would have happened in another minute the amanda minded her helm beautifully however and we went past the nearest land without any further hints heading up just high enough to fetch a little to windward of the vessel at anchor at the next moment the lugger then about a cables length from as was shut in by the land i was now in great hopes the frenchman would be obliged to tack but he had measured his distance well and felt certain it would seem that he could lay past he reasoned probably as nelson is said to have reasoned at the nile and as some of his captains unquestionably did reason that is if there was water enough for us there was water enough for him in another minute i saw him jammed nearly into the winds eye luffing past the point and falling as easily into our wake as if drawn by attraction  all this time the night was unbroken by any sound not a hail nor a call our own orders excepted and they had been given in low tones had been audible on board the amanda as regards the vessel at anchor she appeared to give herself no concern there she lay a fine ship and as i thought a vesselofwar like a marine bird asleep on its proper element we were directly between her and the lugger and it is possible her anchorwatch did not see the latter the three vessels were not more than half a cables length asunder that is we were about that distance from the ship and the lugger was a very little farther from us  five minutes must determine the matter i was on the brigs forecastle anxiously examining all i could make out on board the ship as her size and shape and rig became slowly more and more distinct and i hailed  ship ahoy  hilloa what brigs that  an american with a french privateerlugger close on board me directly in my wake you had better be stirring  i heard the quick exclamation of the devil there is  bloody yankees came next then followed the call of all hands it was plain enough my notice had set everything in motion in that quarter talcott now came running forward to say he thought from some movements on board the lugger that her people were now first apprised of the vicinity of the ship i had been sadly disappointed at the call for all hands on board the ship for it was in the manner of a merchantman instead of that of a vesselofwar  but we were getting too near to remain much longer in doubt the amanda was already sweeping up on the englishmans bows not more than forty yards distant  she is an english westindiaman mr wallingford said one of my oldest seamen and a running ship some vessel that has deserted or lost her convoy  do you know anything of the lugger demanded an officer from on board the ship in a voice that was not very amicable  no more than you see she has chased me close aboard for the last twenty minutes  there was no reply to this for a moment and then i was askedto tack and give us a little chance by drawing him away for a few minutes we are armed and will come out to your assistance  had i been ten years older experience in the faith of men and especially of men engaged in the pursuit of gain would have prevented me from complying with this request but at eighteen one views these things differently it did appear to me ungenerous to lead an enemy in upon a man in his sleep and not endeavour to do something to aid the surprised party i answered ay ay therefore and tacked directly alongside of the ship but the manoeuvre was too late the lugger coming in between the ship and the brig just as we began to draw ahead again leaving him room and getting a good look at us both the englishman appeared the most inviting i suppose for she up helm and went on board of him on his quarter neither party used their guns we were so near however as plainly to understand the whole to distinguish the orders and even to hear the blows that were struck by hand it was an awful minute to us in the brig the cries of the hurt reached us in the stillness of that gloomy morning and oaths mingled with the clamour though taken by surprise john bull fought well though we could perceive that he was overpowered however just as the distance and the haze that was beginning to gather thick around the land shut in the two vessels from our view  the disappearance of the two combatants furnished me with a hint how to proceed i stood out three or four minutes longer or a sufficient distance to make certain we should not be seen and tacked again in order to draw as fast as possible out of the line of sight we kept the brig off a little and then ran in towards the english coast which was sufficiently distant to enable us to stand on in that direction some little time longer this expedient succeeded perfectly for when we found it necessary to tack again day began to dawn shortly after we could just discern the westindiaman and the lugger standing off the land making the best of their way towards the french coast in 1799 it is possible that this bold frenchman got his prize into some of his own ports though three or four years later it would have been a nearly hopeless experiment as for the amanda she was safe and nelson did not feel happier after his great achievement at the nile than i felt at the success of my own expedient talcott congratulated me and applauded me and i believe all of us were a little too much disposed to ascribe to our own steadiness and address much that ought fairly to have been imputed to chance  off dover we got a pilot and learned that the ship captured was the dorothea a valuable westindiaman that had stolen away from her convoy and come in alone the previous evening she anchored under dungeness at the first of the ebb and it seems had preferred taking a good nights rest to venturing out in the dark when the flood made her berth was a perfectly snug one and the lugger would probably never have found her had we not led her directly in upon her prey  i was now relieved from all charge of the brig and a relief i found it between shoals enemies and the tides of which i knew nothing that day we got into the downs and cameto here i saw a fleet at anchor and a pretty stir it made among the manofwarsmen when our story was repeated among them i do think twenty of their boats were alongside of us to get the facts from the original source among others who thus appeared to question me was one old gentleman whom i suspected of being an admiral  he was in shoredress and came in a plain way the men in his boat declining to answer any questions but they paid him unusual respect this gentleman asked me a great many particulars and i told him the whole story frankly concealing or colouring nothing he was evidently much interested when he went away he shook me cordially by the hand and saidyoung gentleman you have acted prudently and well never mind the grumbling of some of our lads they think only of themselves it was your right and your duty to save your own vessel if you could without doing anything dishonourable and i see nothing wrong in your conduct but its a sad disgrace to us to let these french rascals be picking up their crumbs in this fashion right under our hawseholes    chapter x    how pleasant and how sad the turning tide   of human life when side by side   the child and youth begin to glide   along the vale of years   the pure twinbeing for a little space   with lightsome heart and yet a graver face   too young for woe though not for tears   allston   with what interest and deference most americans of any education regarded england her history laws and institutions in 1799 there were a few exceptionswarm political partisans and here and there an individual whose feelings had become embittered by some particular incident of the revolutionbut surprisingly few when it is recollected that the country was only fifteen years from the peace i question if there ever existed another instance of as strong provincial admiration for the capital as independent america manifested for the mother country in spite of a thousand just grievances down to the period of the war of 1812 i was no exception to the rule nor was talcott neither of us had ever seen england before we made the lizard on this voyage except through our minds eyes and these had presented quantities of beauties and excellencies that certainly vanished on a nearer approach by this i merely mean that we had painted in too high colours as is apt to be the case when the imagination holds the pencil not that there was any unusual absence of things worthy to be commended  on the contrary even at this late hour i consider england as a model for a thousand advantages even to our own inappreciable selves nevertheless much delusion was blended with our admiration  english history was virtually american history and everything on the land as we made our way towards town which the pilot could point out was a source of amusement and delight we had to tide it up to london and had plenty of leisure to see all there was to be seen the thames is neither a handsome nor a very magnificent river but it was amazing to witness the number of vessels that then ascended or descended it there was scarce a sort of craft known to christendom a few of the mediterranean excepted that was not to be seen there and as for the colliers we drifted through a forest of them that seemed large enough to keep the town a twelvemonth in firewood by simply burning their spars the manner in which the pilot handled our brig too among the thousand ships that lay in tiers on each side of the narrow passage we had to thread was perfectly surprising to me resembling the management of a coachman in a crowded thoroughfare more than the ordinary working of a ship i can safely say i learned more in the thames in the way of keeping a vessel in command and in doing what i pleased with her than in the whole of my voyage to canton and back again as for neb he rolled his dark eyes about in wonder and took an occasion to say to mehell make her talk masser miles afore he have done i make no doubt the navigation from the forelands to the bridges as it was conducted thirty years since had a great influence on the seamanship of the english steamers are doing away with much of this practice though the colliers still have to rely on themselves  coals will scarcely pay for tugging  i had been directed by captain williams to deliver the brig to her original consignee an american merchant established in the modern babylon reserving the usual claim for salvage this i did and that gentleman sent hands on board to take charge of the vessel relieving me entirely from all farther responsibility as the captain in his letter had inadvertently i trust mentioned that he had put mr wallingford his third mate in charge i got no invitation to dinner from the consignee though the affair of the capture under dungeness found its way into the papers viâ deal i have always thought with the usual caption of yankee trick yankee trick this phrase so often carelessly used has probably done a great deal of harm in this country  the young and ambitiousthere are all sorts of ambition and among others that of being a rogue as a proof of which one daily hears people call envy jealousy covetousness avarice and half of the meaner vices ambitionthe young and ambitious then of this country too often think to do a good thing that shall have some of the peculiar merit of a certain other good thing that they have heard laughed at and applauded under this designation i can account in no other manner for the great and increasing number of yankee tricks that are of daily occurrence among us among other improvements in taste not to say in morals that might be introduced into the american press would be the omission of the histories of these rare inventions  as twothirds of the editors of the whole country however are yankees i suppose they must be permitted to go on exulting in the cleverness of their race we are indebted to the puritan stock for most of our instructorseditors and schoolmastersand when one coolly regards the prodigious progress of the people in morals public and private virtue honesty and other estimable qualities he must indeed rejoice in the fact that our masters so early discovered a church without a bishop  i had an opportunity while in london however of ascertaining that the land of our fathers which by the way has archbishops contains something besides an unalloyed virtue in its bosom at gravesend we took on board two customhouse officers they always set a rogue to watch a rogue in the english revenue system and they remained in the brig until she was discharged one of these men had been a gentlemans servant and he owed his place to his former masters interest he was a miracle of customhouse integrity and disinterestedness as i discovered in the first hour of our intercourse perceiving a lad of eighteen in charge of the prize and ignorant that this lad had read a good deal of latin and greek under excellent mr hardinge besides being the heir of clawbonny i suppose he fancied he would have an easy time with him this mans name was sweeney  perceiving in me an eager desire to see everything the brig was no sooner at her moorings than he proposed a cruise ashore it was sweeney who showed me the way to the consignees and that business accomplished he proposed that we should proceed on and take a look at st  pauls the monument and as he gradually found my tastes more intellectual than he had at first supposed the wonders of the west end i was nearly a week under the pilotage of the admirable sweeney after showing me the exteriors of all the things of mark about the town and the interiors of a few that i was disposed to pay for he descended in his tastes and carried me through wapping its purlieus and its scenes of atrocities i have always thought sweeney was sounding me and hoping to ascertain my true character by the course he took and that he betrayed his motives in a proposition which he finally made and which brought our intimacy to a sudden close the result however was to let me into secrets i should probably have never learned in any other manner still i had read and heard too much to be easily duped and i kept myself not only out of the power of my tempter but out of the power of all that could injure me remaining simply a curious observer of what was placed before my eyes good mr hardinges lessons were not wholly forgotten i could run away from him much easier than from his precepts  i shall never forget a visit i made to a house called the black horse in st catherines lane this last was a narrow street that ran across the site of the docks that now bear the same name and it was the resort of all the local infamy of wapping i say local infamy for there were portions of the west end that were even worse than anything which a mere port could produce commerce that parent of so much that is useful to man has its dark side as everything else of earth and among its other evils it drags after it a long train of low vice but this train is neither so long nor so broad as that which is chained to the chariotwheels of the great appearances excepted and they are far less than might be expected i think the west end could beat wapping out and out in every essential vice and if st giles be taken into the account i know of no salvo in favour of the land over the sea  our visit to the black horse was paid of a sunday that being the leisure moment of all classes of labourers and the day when being attired in their best they fancied themselves best prepared to appear in the world i will here remark that i have never been in any portion of christendom that keeps the sabbath precisely as it is kept in america in all other countries even the most rigorously severe in their practices it is kept as a day of recreation and rest as well as of public devotion even in the american towns the old observances are giving way before the longings or weaknesses of human nature and sunday is no longer what it was i have witnessed scenes of brawling blasphemy and rude tumult in the suburbs of new york on sundays within the last few years that i have never seen in any other part of the world on similar occasions and serious doubts of the expediency of the highpressure principle have beset me whatever may be the just constructions of doctrine  with the last i pretend not to meddle but in a worldly point of view it would seem wise if you cannot make men all that they ought to be to aim at such social regulations as shall make them as little vile as possible but to return to the black horse in st catherines lanea place whose very name was associated with vileness  it is unnecessary to speak of the characters of its female visiters most of them were young many of them were still blooming and handsome but all of them were abandoned  i need tell you nothing of these girls said sweeney who was a bit of a philosopher in his way ordering a pot of beer and motioning me to take a seat at a vacant tablebut as for the men you see here half are housebreakers and pickpockets come to pass the day genteelly among you gentlemensailors there are two or three faces here that i have seen at the old bailey myself and how they have remained in the country is more than i can tell you you perceive these fellows are just as much at their ease and the landlord who receives and entertains them is just as much at his ease as if the whole party were merely honest men  how happens it i asked that such known rogues are allowed to go at large or that this innkeeper dares receive them  oh youre a child yet or you would not ask such a question you must know master wallingford that the law protects rogues as well as honest men to convict a pickpocket you must have witnesses and jurors to agree and prosecutors and a sight of things that are not as plenty as pockethandkerchiefs or even wallets and bank of england notes besides these fellows can prove an alibi any day in the week an alibi you must know  i know very well what an alibi means mr sweeney  the deuce you do exclaimed the protector of the kings revenue eyeing me a little distrustfully and pray how should one as young as you and coming from a new country like america know that  oh said i laughing america is just the country for alibiseverybody is everywhere and nobody anywhere  the whole nation is in motion and there is every imaginable opportunity for alibis  i believe i owed the development of sweeneys ulterior views to this careless speech he had no other idea of the word than its legal signification and it must have struck him as a little suspicious that one of my apparent condition in life and especially of my years should be thus early instructed in the meaning of this very useful professional term it was a minute before he spoke again having been all that time studying my countenance  and pray master wallingford he then inquired do you happen to know what nolle prosequi means too  certainly it means to give up the chase the french lugger under dungeness entered a nolle prosequi as respects my brig when she found her hands full of the westindiaman  so so i find i have been keeping company all this time with a knowing one and i such a simpleton as to fancy him green well that i should live to be done by a raw jonathan  poh poh mr sweeney i can tell you a story of two of our naval officers that took place just before we sailed and then you will learn that all hands of us on the other side of the big pond understand latin one of these officers had been engaged in a duel and he found it necessary to lie hid a friend and shipmate who was in his secret came one day in a great hurry to tell him that the authorities of the state in which the parties fought had entered a nolle prosequi against the offenders he had a newspaper with the whole thing in it in print whats a nolle prosequi jack asked tom why its latin to be sure and it means some infernal thing or other we must contrive to find out for its half the battle to know who and what youve got to face well you know lots of lawyers and dare show your face so just step out and ask one ill trust no lawyer i might put the question to some chap who has been feed but we both studied a little latin when boys and between us well undermine the meaning  tom assented and to work they went jack had the most latin but do all he could he was not able to find a nolle in any dictionary after a great deal of conjecture the friends agreed it must be the root of knowledge and that point was settled as for prosequi it was not so difficult as sequor was a familiar word and after some cogitation jack announced his discoveries if this thing were in english now he said a fellow might understand it in that case i should say that the sheriffs men were in pursuit of knowledge that is hunting after you but latin you remember was always an inverted sort of stuff and that pro alters the whole signification the paper says theyve entered a nolle prosequi and the entered explains the whole entered a nolle means have entered on the knowledge got a scent you see it is law english pro means how and sequi to give chase the amount of it all is tom that they are on your heels and i must go to work and send you off at once two or three hundred miles into the interior where you may laugh at them and their nolle prosequis together   footnote  there is said to be foundation for this story  sweeney laughed heartily at this story though he clearly did not take the joke which i presume he fancied lay concealed under an american flash language and he proposed by way of finishing the day to carry me to an entertainment where he gave me to understand american officers were fond of sometimes passing a few minutes i was led to a wapping assemblyroom on entering which i found myself in a party composed of some forty or fifty cooks and stewards of american vessels all as black as their own pots with partners of the usual colour and bloom of english girls i have as few prejudices of colour as any american well can have but i will confess this scene struck me as being painfully out of keeping in england however nothing seemed to be thought of it and i afterwards found that marriages between english women and men of all the colours of the rainbow were very common occurrences  when he had given me this ball as the climax of his compliments sweeney betrayed the real motive of all his attentions  after drinking a pot of beer extra well laced with gin he offered his services in smuggling anything ashore that the amanda might happen to contain and which i as the prizemaster might feel a desire to appropriate to my own particular purposes i met the proposal with a little warmth letting my tempter understand that i considered his offer so near an insult that it must terminate our acquaintance  the man seemed astounded in the first place he evidently thought all goods and chattels were made to be plundered and then he was of opinion that plundering was a very common yankee trick had i been an englishman he might possibly have understood my conduct but with him it was so much a habit to fancy an american a rogue that as i afterwards discovered he was trying to persuade the leader of a pressgang that i was the halfeducated and illegitimate son of some english merchant who wished to pass himself off for an american i pretend not to account for the contradiction though i have often met with the same moral phenomena among his countrymen but here was as regular a rogue as ever cheated who pretended to think roguery indigenous to certain nations among whom his own was not included  at length i was cheered with the sight of the crisis as she came drifting through the tiers turning and twisting and glancing along just as the amanda had done before her the pilot carried her to moorings quite near us and talcott neb and i were on board her before she was fairly secured my reception was very favourable captain williams having seen the account of the yankee trick in the papers and understanding the thing just as it had happened he placed the most advantageous construction on all i had done for myself i confess i never had any misgivings on the subject  all hands of us were glad to be back in the crisis again  captain williams had remained at falmouth longer than he expected to make some repairs that could not be thoroughly completed at sea which alone prevented him from getting into the river as soon as i did myself now the ship was in we no longer felt any apprehension of being impressed sweeneys malignancy having set several of the gang upon the scent after us whether the fellow actually thought i was an english subject or not is more than i ever knew but i felt no disposition myself to let the point be called in question before my lord chief justice of a rendezvous  the kings bench was more governed by safe principles in its decisions than the gentlemen who presided in these marine courts of the british navy  as i was the only officer in the ship who had ever seen anything of london my fortnights experience made me a notable man in the cabin it was actually greater preferment for me than when i was raised from third to be secondmate  marble was all curiosity to see the english capital and he made me promise to be his pilot as soon as duty would allow time for a stroll and to show him everything i had seen myself we soon got out the cargo and then took in ballast for our northwest voyage the articles we intended to traffic with on the coast being too few and too light to fill the ship this kept us busy for a fortnight after which we had to look about us to obtain men to supply the places of those who had been killed or sent away in la dame de nantes of course we preferred americans and this so much the more as englishmen were liable to be pressed at any moment fortunately a party of men that had been taken out of an american ship a twelvemonth before by an english cruiser had obtained their discharges and they all came to london for the double purpose of getting some prizemoney and of obtaining passages home these lads were pleased with the crisis and the voyage and instead of returning to their own country sailorlike they took service to go nearly round the world these were firstrate mendelawareriver seamenand proved a great accession to our force we owed the windfall to the reputation the ship had obtained by her affairs with the letterofmarque an account of which copied from the logbook and a little embellished by some one on shore he consignee had taken care should appear in the journals the history of the surprise in particular read very well and the english were in a remarkably good humour at that time to receive an account of any discomfiture of a frenchman  at no period since the year 1775 had the american character stood so high in england as it did just then the two nations for a novelty fighting on the same side not long after we left london the underwriters at lloyds actually voted a handsome compliment to an american commander for capturing a french frigate stranger things have happened than to have the day arrive when english and american fleets may be acting in concert no one can tell what is in the womb of time and i have lived long enough to know that no man can foresee who will continue to be his friends or a nation what people may become its enemies  the crisis at length began to take in her bales and boxes for the northwest coast and as the articles were received slowly or a few packages at a time it gave us leisure for play our captain was in such good humour with us on account of the success of the outwardbound passage that he proved very indulgent this disposition was probably increased by the circumstance that a ship arrived in a very short passage from new york which spoke our prize all well with a smacking southerly breeze a clear coast and a run of only a few hundred miles to make this left the almost moral certainty that la dame de nantes had arrived safe no frenchman being likely to trust herself on that distant coast which was now alive with our own cruisers going to or returning from the west indies  i had a laughable time in showing marble the sights of london we began with the wild beasts in the tower as in duty bound but of these our mate spoke very disparagingly  he had been too often in the east to be taken in by such animals and to own the truth the cockneys were easily satisfied on the score of their menagerie we next went to the monument but this did not please him  he had seen a shottower in americathere was but one in that daythat beat it out and out as to height and he thought in beauty too there was no reasoning against this st pauls rather confounded him he frankly admitted there was no such church at kennebunk though he did not know but trinity new york might stand up alongside of it stand up along side of it i repeated laughing why mr marble trinity steeple and all could stand up in itunder that domeand then leave more room in this building than all the other churches in new york contain put altogether  it was a long time before marble forgave this speech he said it was unpatriotic a word which was less used in 1799 than it is used today certainly but which nevertheless was used it often meant then as now a thick and thin pertinacity in believing in provincial marvels and in this marble was one of the most patriotic men with whom i ever met i got him out of the church and along fleet street through temple bar and into the strand however in peace and then we emerged into the arena of fashion aristocracy and the court after a time we worked our way into hyde park where we brought up to make our observations  marble was deeply averse to acknowledging all the admiration he really felt at the turnouts of london as they were exhibited in the park of a fine day in their season it is probable the world elsewhere never saw anything approaching the beauty and magnificence that is here daily seen at certain times so far as beauty and magnificence are connected with equipages including carriages horses and servants  unable to find fault with the tout ensemble our mate made a violent attack on the liveries he protested it was indecent to put a hired manthe word help never being applied to the male sex i believe by the most fastidious new england puristin a cocked hat a decoration that ought to be exclusively devoted to the uses of ministers of the gospel governors of states and militia officers i had some notions of the habits of the great world through books and some little learned by observation and listening but marble scouted at most of my explanations he put his own construction on everything he saw and i have often thought since could the publishers of travels have had the benefit of his blunders how many would have profited by them gentlemen were just then beginning to drive their own coaches and i remember in a particular instance an ultra in the new mode had actually put his coachman in the inside while he occupied the dickey in person such a gross violation of the proprieties was unusual even in london but there sat jehu in all the dignity of cottonlace plush and a cocked hat marble took it into his head that this man was the king and no reasoning of mine could persuade him to the contrary in vain i pointed out to him a hundred similar dignitaries in the proper exercise of their vocation on the hammercloths he cared not a strawthis was not showing him one inside and a gentleman inside of a carriage who wore so fine a coat and a cocked hat in the bargain could be nothing less than some dignitary of the empire and why not the king absurd as all this will seem i have known mistakes connected with the workings of our own institutions almost as great made by theorists from europe  while marble and i were wrangling on this very point a little incident occurred which led to important consequences in the end hackneycoaches or any other public conveyance short of postchaises and posthorses are not admitted into the english parks but glasscoaches are meaning by this term which is never used in america hired carriages that do not go on the stands we encountered one of these glasscoaches in a very serious difficulty the horses had got frightened by means of a wheelbarrow aided probably by some bad management of the driver and had actually backed the hindwheels of the vehicle into the water of the canal they would have soon had the whole carriage submerged and have followed it themselves had it not been for the chiefmate and myself i thrust the wheelbarrow under one of the forwardwheels just in time to prevent the final catastrophe while marble grasped the spoke with his iron gripe and together he and the wheelbarrow made a resistance that counterbalanced the backward tendency of the team there was no footman and springing to the door i aided a sicklylooking elderly mana female who might very well have been his wife and another that i took for his daughterto escape by my agency all three were put on the dry land without even wetting their feet though i fared worse myself no sooner were they safe than marble who was up to his shoulders in the water and who had made prodigious efforts to maintain the balance of power released his hold the wheelbarrow gave way at the same moment and the whole affair coach and horses had their will and went stern foremost overboard one of the horses was saved i believe and the other drowned but a crowd soon collecting i paid little attention to what was going on in the carriage as soon as its cargo was discharged  the gentleman we had saved pressed my hand with fervour and marbles too saying that we must not quit himthat we must go home with him to this we consented readily enough thinking we might still be of use as we all walked towards one of the more private entrances of the park i had an opportunity of observing the people we had served they were very respectable in appearance but i knew enough of the world to see that they belonged to what is called the middle class in england i thought the man might be a soldier while the two females had an air of great respectability though not in the least of fashion the girl appeared to be nearly as old as myself and was decidedly pretty here then was an adventure i had saved the life of a damsel of seventeen and had only to fall in love to become the hero of a romance  at the gate the gentleman stopped a hackneycoach put the females in and desired us to follow but to this we would not consent both being wet and marble particularly so after a short parley he gave us an address in norfolk street strand and we promised to stop there on our way back to the ship instead of following the carriage however we made our way on foot into the strand where we found an eatinghouse turned in and eat a hearty dinner each the chiefmate resorting to some brandy in order to prevent his taking cold on what principle this is done i cannot explain though i know it is often practised and in all quarters of the world  as soon as we had dined and dried ourselves we went into norfolk street we had been told to ask for major merton and this we did the house was one of those plain lodginghouses of which most of that part of the town is composed and we found the major and his family in the occupation of the first floor a mark of gentility on which some stress is laid in england it was plain enough however to see that these people were not rolling in that splendour of which we had just seen so much in the park  i can trace the readiness and gallantry of the english tar in your conduct observed the major after he had given us both quite as warm a reception as circumstances required at the same time taking out his pocketbook and turning over some banknotes i wish for your sakes i was better able than i am to reward you for what you have done but twenty pounds is all i can now offer at some other time circumstances may place it in my power to give further and better proofs of my gratitude  as this was said the major held two tenpound notes towards marble doubtless intending that i should receive one of them as a fair division of the spoils now according to all theory and the established opinion of the christian world america is the avaricious country the land of all others in which men are the most greedy of gain in which human beings respect gold more and themselves less than in any other portion of this globe i never dispute anything that is settled by the common consent of my fellowcreatures for the simple reason that i know the decision must be against me so i will concede that money is the great end of american lifethat there is little else to live for in the great model republic politics have fallen into such hands that office will not even give social station the people are omnipotent it is true but though they can make a governor they cannot make gentlemen and ladies even kings are sometimes puzzled to do that literature arms arts and fame of all sorts are unattainable in their rewards among us as in other nations leaving the puissant dollar in its undisturbed ascendency still as a rule twenty europeans can be bought with two tenpound bank of england notes much easier than two americans i leave others to explain the phenomenon i only speak of the fact  marble listened to the majors speech with great attention and respect fumbling in his pocket for his tobaccobox the whole time the box was opened just as the major ended and even i began to be afraid that the wellknown cupidity of kennebunk was about to give way before the temptation and the notes were to be stowed alongside of the tobacco but i was mistaken deliberately helping himself to a quid the chiefmate shut the box again and then he made his reply  quite ginerous in you major he said and all shipshape and right i like to see things done just in that way  put up the money we thank you as much as if we could take it and that squares all accounts i would just mention however to prevent mistakes as the other idee might get us impressed that this young man and i are both born americanshe from up the hudson somewhere and i from york city itself though edicated down east  americans resumed the major drawing himself up a little stiffly then you young man turning to me and holding out the notes of which he now seemed as anxious to be rid as i had previously fancied he was sorry to see goyou will do me the favour to accept of this small token of my gratitude  it is quite impossible sir i answered respectfully  we are not exactly what we seem and you are probably deceived by our roundabouts but we are the first and second officers of a letterofmarque  at the word officers the major drew back his hand and hastily apologised he did not understand us even then i could plainly see but he had sufficient sagacity to understand that his money would not be accepted we were invited to sit down and the conversation continued  master miles there resumed marble has an estate a place called clawbonny somewhere up the hudson and he has no business to be sailing about the world in jacket and trowsers when he ought to be studying law or trying his hand at college but as the old cock crows the young un larns his father was a sailor before him and i suppose thats the reason ont  this announcement of my position ashore did me no harm and i could see a change in the deportment of the whole familynot that it had ever treated me haughtily or even coldly but it now regarded me as more on a level with itself we remained an hour with the mertons and i promised to repeat the call before we sailed this i did a dozen times at least and the major finding i suppose that he had a tolerably welleducated youth to deal with was of great service in putting me in a better way of seeing london  i went to both theatres with the family taking care to appear in a wellmade suit of london clothes in which i made quite as respectable a figure as most of the young men i saw in the streets even emily smiled when she first saw me in my longtogs and i thought she blushed she was a pretty creature gentle and mild in her ordinary deportment but full of fire and spirit at the bottom as i could see by her light blue english eye then she had been welleducated and in my young ignorance of life i fancied she knew more than any girl of seventeen i had ever met with grace and lucy were both clever and had been carefully taught by mr hardinge but the good divine could not give two girls in the provincial retirement of america the cultivation and accomplishments that were within the reach of even moderate means in england to me emily merton seemed a marvel in the way of attainments and i often felt ashamed of myself as i sat at her side listening to the natural and easy manner in which she alluded to things of which i then heard for the first time    chapter xi      boatswain       here master what cheer     good speak to the mariners fall to t     yarely or we run ourselves aground bestir bestir     tempest   as captain williams wished to show me some favour for the manner in which i had taken care of the brig he allowed me as much time ashore as i asked for i might never see london again and understanding i had fallen into good company he threw no obstacle in the way of my profiting by it so careful was he indeed as to get one of the consuls clerks to ascertain who the mertons were lest i should become the dupe of the thousands of specious rogues with which london abounds the report was favourable giving us to understand that the major had been much employed in the west indies where he still held a moderately lucrative semimilitary appointment being then in england to settle certain long and vexatious accounts as well as to take emily his only child from school he was expected to return to the old or some other post in the course of a few months a portion of this i gleaned from emily herself and it was all very fairly corroborated by the account of the consuls clerk there was no doubt that the mertons were persons of respectable position without having any claims however to be placed very high from the major moreover i learned he had some american connexions his father having married in boston  for my part i had quite as much reason to rejoice at the chance which threw me in the way of the mertons as they had if i was instrumental in saving their lives as was undeniably the case they taught me more of the world in the ordinary social sense of the phrase than i had learned in all my previous life i make no pretensions to having seen london society that lay far beyond the reach of major merton himself who was born the son of a merchant when merchants occupied a much lower position in the english social scale than they do today and had to look to a patron for most of his own advancement but he was a gentleman maintained the notions sentiments and habits of the caste and was properly conscious of my having saved his life when it was in great jeopardy as for emily merton she got to converse with me with the freedom of a friend and very pleasant it was to hear pretty thoughts expressed in pretty language and from pretty lips i could perceive that she thought me a little rustic and provincial but i had not been all the way to canton to be browbeaten by a cockney girl however clever and handsome on the wholeand i say it without vanity at this late dayi think the impression left behind me among these good people was favourable perhaps clawbonny was not without its influence but when i paid my last visit even emily looked sorrowful and her mother was pleased to say they should all miss me much the major made me promise to hunt him up should i ever be in jamaica or bombay for one of which places he expected to sail himself with his wife and daughter in the course of a few months i knew he had had one appointment thought he might receive another and hoped everything would turn out for the best  the crisis sailed on her day and she went to sea from the downs a week later with a smacking southerly wind  our philadelphians turned out a noble set of fellows and we had the happiness of beating an english sloopofwar just as we got clear of the channel in a fair trial of speed  to lessen our pride a little a twodecker that was going to the mediterranean treated us exactly in the same manner only three days later what made this last affair more mortifying was the fact that marble had just satisfied himself and all hands that a sloopofwar being the fastest description of vessel and we having got the better of one of them it might be fairly inferred we could outsail the whole british navy i endeavoured to console him by reminding him that the race was not always to the swift he growled out some sort of an answer denouncing all sayings and desiring to know out of what book i had picked up that nonsense  i have no intention of dwelling on every little incident that occurred on the long road we were now travelling we touched at madeira and landed an english family that went there for the benefit of an invalid got some fruit fresh meat and vegetables and sailed again our next stoppingplace was rio whither we went for letters from home the captain being taught to expect them the ships letters were received and they were filled with eulogiums on our good conduct having been written after the arrival of la dame de nantes but great was my disappointment on finding there was not even a scrawl for myself  our stay at rio was short and we left port with a favourable slant of wind running as far north as 50° in a very short time as we drew near to the southern extremity of the american continent however we met with heavy weather and foul winds we were now in the month that corresponds to november in the northern hemisphere and had to double the horn at that unpropitious season of the year going westward there is no part of the world of which navigators have given accounts so conflicting as of this celebrated passage each man appears to have described it as he found it himself while no two seem to have found it exactly alike i do not remember to have ever heard of calms off cape horn but light winds are by no means uncommon though tempests are undoubtedly the predominant characteristic our captain had already been round four times and he held the opinion that the season made no difference and that it was better to keep near the land we shaped our course accordingly for staten land intending to pass through the straits of le maire and hug the horn as close as possible in doubling it we made the falkland islands or west falkland rather just as the sun rose one morning bearing a little on our weatherquarter with the wind blowing heavily at the eastward the weather was thick and what was still worse there was so little day and no moon that it was getting to be ticklish work to be standing for a passage as narrow as that we aimed at marble and i talked the matter over between ourselves and wished the captain could be persuaded to haul up and try to go to the eastward of the island as was still possible with the wind where it was still neither of us dared propose it i on account of my youth and the chiefmate as he said on account of the old fellows obstinacy he likes to be poking about in such places marble added and is never so happy as when he is running round the ocean in places where it is full of unknown islands looking for sandal wood and bêchelamar ill warrant you hell give us a famous time of it if he ever get us up on the northwest coast here the consultation terminated we mates believing it wiser to let things take their course  i confess to having seen the mountains on our weatherquarter disappear with melancholy forebodings there was little hope of getting any observation that day and to render matters worse about noon the wind began to haul more to the southward as it hauled it increased in violence until at midnight it blew a gale the commencement of such a tempest as i had never witnessed in any of my previous passages at sea as a matter of course sail was reduced as fast as it became necessary until we had brought the ship down to a closereefed maintopsail the foretopmast staysail the forecourse and the mizenstaysail this was old fashioned canvass the more recent spencer being then unknown  our situation was now far from pleasant the tides and currents in that high latitude run with great velocity and then at a moment when it was of the greatest importance to know precisely where the ship was we were left to the painful uncertainty of conjecture and theories that might be very wide of the truth the captain had nerve enough notwithstanding to keep on the larboard tack until daylight in the hope of getting in sight of the mountains of terra del fuego no one now expected we should be able to fetch through the straits but it would be a great relief to obtain a sight of the land as it would enable us to get some tolerably accurate notions of our position daylight came at length but it brought no certainty the weather was so thick between a drizzling rain seamist and the spray that it was seldom we could see a league around us and frequently not half a mile fortunately the general direction of the eastern coast of terra del fuego is from northwest to southeast always giving us room to ware off shore provided we did not unexpectedly get embarrassed in some one of the many deep indentations of that wild and inhospitable shore  captain williams showed great steadiness in the trying circumstances in which we were placed the ship was just far enough south to render it probable she could weather falkland islands on the other tack could we rely upon the currents but it would be ticklish work to undertake such a thing in the long intensely dark nights we had and thus run the risk of finding ourselves on a lee shore he determined therefore to hold on as long as possible on the tack we were on expecting to get through another night without coming upon the land every hour now giving us the hope that we were drawing near to the termination of the gale  i presume he felt more emboldened to pursue this course by the circumstance that the wind evidently inclined to haul little by little more to the southward which was not only increasing our chances of laying past the islands but lessened the danger from terra del fuego  marble was exceedingly uneasy during that second night  he remained on deck with me the whole of the morning watch not that he distrusted my discretion in the least but because he distrusted the wind and the land i never saw him in so much concern before for it was his habit to consider himself a timber of the ship that was to sink or swim with the craft  miles said he you and i know something of these bloody currents and we know they take a ship one way while she looks as fiercely the other as a pig that is dragged aft by the tail if we had run down the 50th degree of longitude now we might have had plenty of searoom and been laying past the cape with this very wind but no the old fellow would have had no islands in that case and he never could be happy without halfadozen islands to bother him  had we run down the 50th degree of longitude i answered we should have had twenty degrees to make to get round the horn whereas could we only lay through the straits of le maire six or eight of those very same degrees would carry us clear of everything  only lay through the straits of le maire on the 10th november or what is the same thing in this quarter of the world of may and with less than nine hours of daylight  and such daylight too why our newfoundland fogs such stuff as i used to eat when a youngster and a fisherman are high noon to it soundings are out of the question hereabouts and before one has hauled in the deepsea with all its line out his cutwater may be on a rock this ship is so weatherly and drags ahead so fast that we shall see terra firma before any one has a notion of it the old man fancies because the coast of fuego trends to the northwest that the land will fall away from us as fast as we draw towards it i hope he may live long enough to persuade all hands that he is right  marble and i were conversing on the forecastle at the time our eyes turned to the westward for it was scarcely possible for him to look in any other direction when he interrupted himself by shouting outhard up with the helmspring to the afterbraces my ladsman mizenstaysail downhaul  this set everybody in motion and the captain and thirdmate were on deck in a minute the ship fell off as soon as we got the mizenstaysail in and the maintopsail touching gathering way fast as she got the wind more aft her helm threw her stern up and away she went like a top the foretopmast staysailsheet was tended with care and yet the cloth emitted a sound like the report of a swivel when the sail first filled on the other tack we got the starboard foretack forward and the larboard sheet aft by two tremendously severe drags the blocks and bolts seeming fairly to quiver as they felt the strains everything succeeded however and the crisis began to drag off from the coast of terra del fuego of a certainty but to go whither no one could precisely tell she headed up nearly east the wind playing about between southandbyeast and southeastandbysouth on that course i own i had now great doubt whether she could lay past the falkland islands though i felt persuaded we must be a long distance from them there was plenty of time before us to take the chances of a change  as soon as the ship was round and trimmed by the wind on the other tack captain williams had a grave conversation with the chiefmate on the subject of his reason for what he had done marble maintained he had caught a glimpse of the land aheadjust as you know i did of la dame de nantes captain williams he continued and seeing there was no time to be lost i ordered the helm hard up to ware off shore i distrusted this account even while it was in the very process of coming out of the chief mates mouth and marble afterwards admitted to me quite justly but the captain either was satisfied or thought it prudent to seem so by the best calculations i afterwards made i suppose we must have been from fifteen to twenty leagues from the land when we wore ship but as marble said when he made his private confessions madagascar was quite enough for me miles without breaking our nose on this seagull coast and there may be bloody currents on this side of the cape of good hope as well as on the other weve got just so much of a gale and a foul wind to weather and the ship will do both quite as well with her head to the eastward as with her head to the westward  all that day the crisis stood on the starboard tack dragging through the raging waters as it might be by violence and just as night shut in again she wore round once more with her head to the westward so far from abating the wind increased and towards evening we found it necessary to furl our topsail and forecourse mere rag of a sail as the former had been reduced to with its four reefs in it was a delicate job to roll it up neb and i stood together in the bunt and never did i exert myself more than on that occasion  the foresail too was a serious matter but we got both sails in without losing either just as the sun set or as night came to increase the darkness of that gloomy day the foretopmaststaysail went out of the boltrope with a report that was heard all over the ship disappearing in the mist like a cloud driving in the heavens a few minutes later the mizenstaysail was hauled down in order to prevent it from travelling the same road the jerks even this low canvass occasionally gave the ship made her tremble from her keel to her trucks  for the first time i now witnessed a tempest at sea gales and pretty hard ones i had often seen but the force of the wind on this occasion as much exceeded that in ordinary gales of wind as the force of these had exceeded that of a wholesail breeze the seas seemed crushed the pressure of the swooping atmosphere as the currents of the air went howling over the surface of the ocean fairly preventing them from rising or where a mound of water did appear it was scooped up and borne off in spray as the axe dubs inequalities from the log in less than an hour after it began to blow the hardest there was no very apparent swellthe deep breathing of the ocean is never entirely stilledand the ship was as steady as if hove half out her lower yardarms nearly touching the water an inclination at which they remained as steadily as if kept there by purchases a few of us were compelled to go as high as the futtockshrouds to secure the sails but higher it was impossible to get i observed that when i thrust out a hand to clutch anything it was necessary to make the movement in such a direction as to allow for leeway precisely as a boat quarters the stream in crossing against a current in ascending it was difficult to keep the feet on the ratlins and in descending it required a strong effort to force the body down towards the centre of gravity i make no doubt had i groped my way up to the crosstrees and leaped overboard my body would have struck the water thirty or forty yards from the ship  a marlinspike falling from either top would have endangered no one on deck  when the day returned a species of lurid sombre light was diffused over the watery waste though nothing was visible but the ocean and the ship even the seabirds seemed to have taken refuge in the caverns of the adjacent coast none reappearing with the dawn the air was full of spray and it was with difficulty that the eye could penetrate as far into the humid atmosphere as half a mile all hands mustered on deck as a matter of course no one wishing to sleep at a time like that as for us officers we collected on the forecastle the spot where danger would first make itself apparent did it come from the side of the land it is not easy to make a landsman understand the embarrassments of our situation we had had no observations for several days and had been moving about by dead reckoning in a part of the ocean where the tides run like a milltail with the wind blowing a little hurricane even now when her bows were half submerged and without a stitch of canvass exposed the crisis drove ahead at the rate of three or four knots luffing as close to the wind as if she carried aftersail  it was marbles opinion that in such smooth water do all we could the vessel would drive towards the muchdreaded land again between sun and sun of that short day a distance of from thirty to forty miles nor is this all miles he added to me in an aside i no more like this bloody current than that we had over on the other side of the pond when we broke our back on the rocks of madagascar you never see as smooth water as this unless when the wind and current are travelling in the same direction i made no reply but there all four of us the captain and his three mates stood looking anxiously into the vacant mist on our leebow as if we expected every moment to behold our homes a silence of ten minutes succeeded and i was still gazing in the same direction when by a sort of mystic rising of the curtain i fancied i saw a beach of long extent with a darklooking waste of low bottom extending inland for a considerable distance the beach did not appear to be distant half a knot while the ship seemed to glide along it as compared with visible objects on shore at a rate of six or eight miles the hour it extended almost in a parallel line with our course too as far as could be seen both astern and ahead  what a strange delusion is this i thought to myself and turned to look at my companions when i found all looking one at the other as if to ask a common explanation  there is no mistake here said captain williams quietly that is land gentlemen  as true as the gospel answered marble with the sort of steadiness despair sometimes gives what is to be done sir  what can be done mr marblewe have not room to ware and of the two there seems so far as i can judge more searoom ahead than astern  this was so apparent there was no disputing it we could still see the land looking low chill and of the hue of november and we could also perceive that ahead if anything it fell off a little towards the northward while astern it seemingly stretched in a due line with our course that we passed it with great velocity too was a circumstance that our eyes showed us too plainly to admit of any mistake  as the ship was still without a rag of sail borne down by the wind as she had been for hours and burying to her hawseholes forward it was only to a racing tide or current of some sort that we could be indebted for our speed we tried the lead and got bottom in six fathoms  the captain and marble now held a serious consultation that the ship was entering some sort of an estuary was certain but of what depth how far favoured by a holding ground or how far without any anchorage at all were facts that defied our inquiries we knew that the land called terra del fuego was in truth a cluster of islands intersected by various channels and passages into which ships had occasionally ventured though their navigation had never led to any other results than some immaterial discoveries in geography that we were entering one of these passages and under favourable circumstances though so purely accidental was the common belief and it only remained to look out for the best anchorage while we had daylight  fortunately as we drove into the bay or passage or what ever it was the tempest lifted less spray from the water and owing to this and other causes the atmosphere gradually grew clearer by ten oclock we could see fully a league though i can hardly say that the wind blew less fiercely than before as for sea there was none or next to none the water being as smooth as in a river  the day drew on and we began to feel increased uneasiness at the novelty of our situation our hope and expectation were to find some anchorage but to obtain this it was indispensable also to find a lee as the ship moved forward we still kept the land in view on our starboard hand but that was a lee instead of a weather shore the last alone could give our groundtackle any chance whatever in such a tempest we were drawing gradually away from this shore too which trended more northerly giving us additional searoom the fact that we were in a powerful tides way puzzled us the most there was but one mode of accounting for the circumstance had we entered a bay the current must have been less and it seemed necessary there should be some outlet to such a swift accumulation of water it was not the mere rising of the water swelling in an estuary but an arrowlike glancing of the element as it shot through a pass we had a proof of this last fact about eleven oclock that admitted of no dispute land was seen directly ahead at that hour and great was the panic it created a second look however reassured us the land proving to be merely a rocky islet of some six or eight acres in extent we gave it a berth of course though we examined closely for an anchorage near it as we approached the islet was too low and too small to make any lee nor did we like the looks of the holdingground  the notion of anchoring there was consequently abandoned but we had now some means of noting our progress the ship was kept a little away in order to give this island a berth and the gale drove her through the water at the rate of seven or eight knots this however was far from being our whole speed the tide sweeping us onward at a furious rate in addition even captain williams thought we must be passing that rock at the rate of fifteen knots  it was noon and there was no abatement in the tempest no change in the current no means of returning no chance of stopping away we were driven like events ruled by fate the only change was the gradual clearing up of the atmosphere as we receded from the ocean and got farther removed from its mists and spray perhaps the power of the gale had in a small degree abated by two oclock and it would have been possible to carry some short sail but there being no sea to injure us it was unnecessary and the ship continued to drive ahead under bare poles night was the time to dread  there was now but one opinion among us and that was thiswe thought the ship had entered one of the passages that intersect terra del fuego and that there was the chance of soon finding a lee as these channels were known to be very irregular and winding to run in the night seemed impossible nor was it desirable as it was almost certain we should be compelled to return by the way we had entered to extricate ourselves from the dangers of so intricate a navigation islands began to appear moreover and we had indications that the main passage itself was beginning to diminish in width under the circumstances therefore it was resolved to get everything ready and to let go two anchors as soon as we could find a suitable spot between the hours of two and four the ship passed seventeen islets some of them quite near but they afforded no shelter at last and it was time the sun beginning to fall very low as we could see by the waning light we saw an island of some height and size ahead and we hoped it might afford us a lee the tide had changed too and that was in our favour turning to windward however was out of the question since we could carry no sail and the night was near anchor then we must or continue to drive onward in the darkness sheered about in all directions by a powerful adverse current it is true this current would have been a means of safety by enabling us to haul up from rocks and dangers ahead could we carry any canvass but it still blew too violently for the last to anchor then it was determined  i had never seen so much anxiety in captain williamss countenance as when he was approaching the island mentioned  there was still light enough to observe its outlines and shores the last appearing bold and promising as the island itself may have been a mile in circuit it made a tolerable lee when close to it this was then our object and the helm was put to starboard as we went slowly past the tide checking our speed the ship sheered into a sort of roadsteada very wild one it wasas soon as she had room it was ticklish work for no one could tell how soon we might hit a rock but we went clear luffing quite near to the land where we let go both bowers at the same instant  the ships way had been sufficiently deadened by throwing her up as near the wind as she could be got and there was no difficulty in snubbing her the lead gave us seven fathoms and this within pistolshot of the shore we knew we were temporarily safe the great point was to ascertain how the vessel would tend and with how much strain upon her cables to everybodys delight it was found we were in a moderate eddy that drew the ships stern from the island and allowed her to tend to the wind which still had a fair range from her topsail yards to the trucks  lower down the tempest scuffled about howling and eddying and whirling first to one side and then to the other in a way to prove how much its headlong impetuosity was broken and checked by the land it is not easy to describe the relief we felt at these happy chances it was like giving foothold to some wretch who thought a descent of the precipice was inevitable  the ship was found to ride easily by one cable and the hands were sent to the windlass to heave up the other anchor as our lead told us we had rocks beneath us and the captain was afraid of the chafing the larboardbower anchor was catted immediately and there it was left suspended with a range of cable overhauled in readiness to let go at a moments notice after this the people were told to get their suppers as for us officers we had other things to think of the crisis carried a small quarterboat and this was lowered into the water the thirdmate and myself manned its oars and away we went to carry the captain round the ship in order that he might ascertain the soundings should it be necessary to get under way in the night the examination was satisfactory on all points but one that of the holdingground and we returned to the vessel having taken good care to trust ourselves in neither the wind nor the current an anchorwatch was set with a mate on deck four hours and four hours and all hands turned in  i had the morning watch what occurred from seven oclock the captain keeping the dogwatches himself until a few minutes before four i cannot tell in detail though i understood generally that the wind continued to blow in the same quarter though it gradually diminished in violence getting down to something like a mere gale by midnight the ship rode more easily but when the flood came in there was no longer an eddy the current sucking round each side of the island in a very unusual manner about ten minutes before the hour when it was my regular watch on deck all hands were called i ran on deck and found the ship had struck adrift the cable having parted marble had got the vessels head up to the wind under bare poles as before and we soon began to heave in the cable it was found that the mischief had been done by the rocks the strands being chafed twothirds through as soon as the current took the vessels hull with force the cable parted  we lost our anchor of course for there was no possible way of getting back to the island at present or until the ebb again made  it wanted several hours of day and the captain called a council he told us he made no doubt that the ship had got into one of the terra del fuego passages guided by providence and as he supposed we must be almost as far south as staten land he was of opinion we had made an important discovery get back we could not so long as the wind held where it was and he was disposed to make sail and push the examination of the channel as far as circumstances would allow captain williams had a weakness on this point that was amiable and respectable perhaps but which hardly comported with the objects and prudence of a trading shipmaster we were not surprised therefore at hearing his suggestion and in spite of the danger curiosity added its impulses to our other motives of acquiescing  we could not get back as the wind then was and we were disposed to move forward as for the dangers of the navigation they seemed to be lessening as we advanced fewer islands appearing ahead and the passage itself grew wider our course however was more to the southward bringing the ship close up by the wind once more  the morning promised to be lighter than we had found the weather for several days and we even experienced some benefit from the moon the wind too began to back round to the eastward again as we approached the dawn and we got the three topsails closereefed the forecourse and a new foretopmast staysail on the ship at length day appeared and the sun was actually seen struggling among dark masses of wildlooking driving clouds for the first time since we entered those narrow waters we now got a good look around us the land could be seen in all directions  the passage in which we found the crisis at sunrise on the morning of the second of these adventurous days was of several leagues in width and bounded especially on the north by high precipitous mountains many of which were covered with snow the channel was unobstructed and not an island islet or rock was visible no impediment to our proceeding offered and we were still more encouraged to push on the course we were steering was about southsouthwest and the captain predicted we should come out into the ocean to the westward of the straits of le maire and somewhere near the cape itself we should unquestionably make a great discovery the wind continued to back round and soon got to be abaft the beam we now shook our reefs out one after another and we had whole topsails on the vessel by nine oclock this was carrying hard it must be owned but the skipper was determined to make hay while the sun shone there were a few hours when i think the ship went fifteen knots by the land being so much favoured by the current little did we know the difficulties towards which we were rushing  quite early in the day land appeared ahead and marble began to predict that our rope was nearly run out we were coming to the bottom of a deep bay captain williams thought differently and when he discovered a narrow passage between two promontories he triumphantly predicted our near approach to the cape he had seen some such shape to the mountains inland in doubling the horn and the hilltops looked like old acquaintances unfortunately we could not see the sun at meridian and got no observation  for several hours we ran southwesterly in a passage of no great width when we came to a sudden bend in our course which led us away to the northwest here we still had the tide with us and we then all felt certain that we had reached a point where the ebb must flow in a direction contrary to that in which we had found it in the other parts of the passage it followed that we were now halfway through to the ocean though the course we were steering predicted a sinuous channel we were certainly not going now towards cape horn  notwithstanding the difficulties and doubts which beset us captain williams packed on the ship determined to get ahead as fast as he could while there was light it no longer blew a gale and the wind was hauling more to the southward again it soon got to be right aft and before sunset it had a little westing in it fortunately it moderated and we set our mainsail and topgallantsails we had carried a lower and topmast studdingsails nearly all day the worst feature in our situation now was the vast number of islands or islets we met the shore on each side was mountainous and rude and deep indentations were constantly tempting us to turn aside but rightly judging that the set of the tide was a lair index to the true course the captain stood on  the night that followed was one of the most anxious i ever passed we were tempted to anchor a dozen times in some of the different bays of which we passed twenty but could not make up our minds to risk another cable we met the flood a little after sunset and got rid of it before morning but the wind kept hauling and at last it brought us fairly on a taut bowline under topgallantsails however  we had come too far to recede or now would have been the time to turn round and retrace our steps but we hoped every moment to reach some inclination south again that would carry us into the open sea we ran a vast many chances of shipwreck passing frightfully near several reefs but the same good providence which had so far protected us carried us clear never was i so rejoiced as when i saw day returning  we had the young ebb and a scant wind when the sun rose next day it was a brilliant morning however and everybody predicted an observation at noon the channel was full of islands still and other dangers were not wanting but as we could see our way we got through them all safely at length our course became embarrassed so many large islands with passages between them offering on different sides one headland however lay before us and the ship promising to weather it we held on our way it was just ten oclock as we approached this cape and we found a passage westward that actually led into the ocean  all hands gave three cheers as we became certain of this fact the ship tacking as soon as far enough ahead and setting seaward famously with the tide  captain williams now told us to get our quadrants for the heavens were cloudless and we should have a horizon in time for the sun he was anxious to get the latitude of our discovery sure enough it so fell out and we prepared to observe some predicting one parallel some another as for the skipper himself he said he thought we were still to the eastward of the cape but he felt confident that we had come out to the westward of le maire marble was silent but he had observed and made his calculations before either of the others had commenced the last i saw him scratch his head and go to the chart which lay on the companionway  then i heard him shout  in the pacific by st kennebunkhe always swore by this pious individual when excitedwe have come through the straits of magellan without knowing it    chapter xii    sound trumpets howeigh anchorloosen sail   the seawardflying banners chide delay   as ift were heaven that breathes this kindly gale   our lifelike bark beneath it speeds away   pinkney   the stout ship crisis had like certain persons done a good thing purely by chance had her exploit happened in the year 1519 instead of that of 1800 the renowned passage we had just escaped from would have been called the crisis straits a better name than the mongrel appellation it now bears which is neither english nor portuguese the ship had been lost like a man in the woods and came out nearer home than those in her could have at all expected  the bloody currents had been at the bottom of the mistake though this time they did good instead of harm any one who has been thoroughly lost on a heath or in a forest or even in a town can comprehend how the head gets turned on such occasions and will understand the manner in which we had mystified ourselves  i shall remember the feelings of delight with which i looked around me as the ship passed out into the open ocean to my dying day there lay the vast pacific its long regular waves rolling in towards the coast in mountainlike ridges it is true but under a radiant sun and in a bright atmosphere everybody was cheered by the view and never did orders sound more pleasant in my ears than when the captain called out in a cheerful voice to man the weather braces this command was given the instant it was prudent and the ship went foaming past the last cape with the speed of a courser studdingsails were then set and when the sun was dipping we had a good offing were driving to the northward under everything we could carry and had a fair prospect of an excellent run from the neighbourhood of terra del fuego and its stormy seas  it is not my intention to dwell on our passage along the western coast of south america a voyage to the pacific was a very different thing in the year 1800 however from what it is today the power of spain was then completely in the ascendant intercourse with any nation but the mother country being strictly prohibited it is true a species of commerce that was called the forced trade on the spanish main existed under that code of elastic morals which adapts the maxim of your purse or your life to modern diplomacy as well as to the habits of the highwayman  according to divers masters in the art of ethics now flourishing among ourselves more especially in the atmosphere of the journals of the commercial communities the people that can trade and wont trade must be made to trade at the commencement of the century your mercantile moralists were far less manly in the avowal of their sentiments though their practices were in no degree wanting in the spirit of our more modern theories ships were fitted out armed and navigated on this just principle quite as confidently and successfully as if the tongue had declared all that the head had conceived  guardacostas were the arguments used on the other side of this knotty question by the authorities of spain and a very insufficient argument on the whole did they prove to be it is an old saying that vice is twice as active as virtue the last sleeping while the former is hard at work if this be true of things in general it is thrice true as regards smugglers and customhouse officers owing to this circumstance and sundry other causes it is certain that english and american vessels found the means of plundering the inhabitants of south america at the period of which i am writing without having recourse to the no longer reputable violence of dampier wood rogers or drake as i feel bound to deal honestly with the reader whatever i may have done by the spanish laws i shall own that we made one or two calls as we proceeded north shoving ashore certain articles purchased in london and taking on board dollars in return for our civility i do not know whether i am bound or not to apologize for my own agency in these irregular transactionsregular would be quite as apposite a wordfor had i been disposed to murmur it would have done my morals no good nor the smuggling any harm  captain williams was a silent man and it was not easy to ascertain precisely what he thought on the subject of smuggling but in the way of practice i never saw any reason to doubt that he was a firm believer in the doctrine of free trade  as for marble he put me in mind of a certain renowned editor of a wellknown new york journal who evidently thinks that all things in heaven and earth sun moon and stars the void above and the caverns beneath us the universe in short was created to furnish materials for newspaper paragraphs the worthy mate just as confidently believing that coasts bays inlets roadsteads and havens were all intended by nature as means to run goods ashore wherever the duties or prohibitions rendered it inconvenient to land them in the more legal mode smuggling in his view of the matter was rather more creditable than the regular commerce since it required greater cleverness  i shall not dwell on the movements of the crisis for the five months that succeeded her escape from the straits of magellan suffice it to say that she anchored at as many different points on the coast that all which came up the mainhatch went ashore and all that came over the bulwarks was passed down into the run we were chased by guardacostas seven times escaping from them on each occasion with ease though we had three little running fights i observed that captain williams was desirous of engaging these emissaries of the law as easily as possible ordering us to fire altogether at their spars i have since thought that this moderation proceeded from a species of principle that is common enougha certain halfway code of right and wrongwhich encouraged him to smuggle but which caused him to shrink from taking human life your halfway rogues are the bane of honesty  after quitting the spanish coast altogether we proceeded north with the laudable intention of converting certain quantities of glassbeads inferior jackknives fryingpans and other homely articles of the same nature into valuable furs in a word we shaped our course for that district which bids fair to set the mother and daughter by the ears one of these days unless it shall happen to be disposed of à la texas or what is almost as bad à la maine ere long  at that time the whole northwest coast was unoccupied by white men and i felt no scruples about trading with the natives who presented themselves with their skins as soon as we had anchored believing that they had the best right to the country and its products we passed months in this traffic getting at every point where we stopped something to pay us for our trouble  we went as far north as 53° and that is pretty much all i ever knew of our last position at the time i thought we had anchored in a bay on the main land but i have since been inclined to think it was in one of the many islands that line that broken coast we got a very secure berth having been led to it by a native pilot who boarded us several leagues at sea and who knew enough english to persuade our captain that he could take us to a point where seaotter skins might be had for the asking nor did the man deceive us though a more unpromisinglooking guide never had charge of smuggling christians he carried us into a very small bay where we found plenty of water capital holdingground and a basin as smooth as a dock but one windthat which blew from the northwestcould make any impression on it and the effects of even that were much broken by a small island that lay abreast of the entrance leaving good passages on each side of it out to sea the basin itself was rather small it is true but it did well enough for a single ship its diameter may have been three hundred yards and i never saw a sheet of natural water that was so near a circle into a place like this the reader will imagine we did not venture without taking the proper precautions marble was sent in first to reconnoitre and sound and it was on his report that captain williams ventured to take the ship in  at that time ships on the northwest coast had to use the greatest precautions against the treachery and violence of the natives this rendered the size of our haven the subject of distrust for lying in the middle of it where we moored we were barely an arrows flight from the shore in every direction but that which led to the narrow entrance  it was a most secure anchorage as against the dangers of the sea but a most insecure one as against the dangers of the savages this we all felt as soon as our anchors were down but intending to remain only while we bartered for the skins which we had been told were ready for the first ship that should offer we trusted to vigilance as our safeguard in the interval  i never could master the uncouth sounds of the still more uncouth savages of that distant region the fellow who carried us in had a name of his own doubtless but it was not to be pronounced by a christian tongue and he got the sobriquet of the dipper from us owing to the manner in which he ducked at the report of our muskets which had been discharged by marble merely with the intention to renew the cartridges we had hardly got into the little basin before the dipper left us returning in an hour however with a canoe loaded to the waters edge with beautiful skins and accompanied by three savages as wildlooking seemingly as fierce and certainly as avaricious as he was himself  these auxiliaries through various little circumstances were known among us that same afternoon by the several appellations of smudge tinpot and slitnose these were not heroic names of a certainty but their owners had as little of the heroic in their appearance as usually falls to the lot of man in the savage state i cannot tell the designation of the tribes to which these four worthies belonged nor do i know any more of their history and pursuits than the few facts which came under my own immediate observation i did ask some questions of the captain with a view to obtain a few ideas on this subject but all he knew was that these people put a high value on blankets beads gunpowder fryingpans and old hoops and that they set a remarkably low price on seaotter skins as well as on the external coverings of sundry other animals an application to mr  marble was still less successful being met by the pithy answer that he was no naturalist and knew nothing about these critturs or any wild beasts in general degraded as the men certainly were however we thought them quite good enough to be anxious to trade with them commerce like misery sometimes makes a man acquainted with strange bedfellows  i had often seen our own indians after they had become degraded by their intercourse with the whites and the use of rum but never had i beheld any beings so low in the scale of the human race as the northwestern savages appeared to be they seemed to me to be the hottentots of our own continent still they were not altogether without the means of commanding our respect as physical men they were both active and strong and there were gleams of ferocity about them that all their avarice and art could not conceal  i could not discover in their usages dress or deportment a single trace of that chivalrous honour which forms so great a relief to the wellestablished cruelty of the warrior of our own part of the continent then these seaotter dealers had some knowledge of the use of firearms and were too well acquainted with the ships of us civilized men to have any superstitious dread of our power  the dipper and his companions sold us one hundred and thirtythree seaotter skins the very afternoon we anchored  this of itself was thought to be a sufficient reward for the trouble and risk of coming into this unknown basin  both parties seemed pleased with the results of the trading and we were given to understand that by remaining at anchor we might hope for six or eight times our present number of skins captain williams was greatly gratified with the success with which he had already met and having found that all the dipper had promised came true he determined to remain a day or two in his present berth in order to wait for more bargains this resolution was no sooner communicated to the savages than they expressed their delight sending off tinpot and slitnose with the intelligence while the dipper and smudge remained in the ship apparently on terms of perfect goodfellowship with everybody on board the gentry of the northwest coast being flagrant thieves however all hands had orders to keep a good lookout on our two guests captain williams expressing his intention to flog them soundly should they be detected in any of their usual lightfingered dexterity  marble and myself observed that the canoe in which the messengers left us did not pull out to sea but that it entered a small stream or creek that communicated with the head of the bay as there was no duty on board we asked the captains permission to explore this spot and at the same time to make a more thorough examination of our haven generally the request being granted we got into the yawl with four men all of us armed and set out on our little expedition smudge a withered greyheaded old indian with muscles however that resembled whipcord was alone on deck when this movement took place he watched our proceedings narrowly and when he saw us descend into the boat he very coolly slipped down the ships side and took his place in the sternsheets with as much quiet dignity as if he had been captain marble was a good deal of a ships martinet in such matters and he did not more than half like the familiarity and impudence of the procedure  what say you miles he asked a little sharply shall we take this dried ourangoutang ashore with us or shall we try to moisten him a little by throwing him overboard  let him go by all means mr marble i dare say the man wishes to be of use and he has only a bad manner of showing it  of use he is worth no more than the carcase of a whale that has been stripped of its blubber i say miles there would be no need of the windlass to heave the blanket off of this fish  this professional witticism put marble in good humour with himself and he permitted the fellow to remain i remember the thoughts that passed through my mind as the yawl pulled towards the creek on that occasion as well as if it had all occurred yesterday i sat looking at the semihuman being who was seated opposite wondering at the dispensation of divine providence which could leave one endowed with a portion of the ineffable nature of the deity in a situation so degraded i had seen beasts in cages that appeared to me to be quite as intelligent and members of the diversified family of human caricatures or of the baboons and monkeys that i thought were quite as agreeable objects to the eye smudge seemed to be almost without ideas in his bargains he had trusted entirely to the vigilance of the dipper whom we supposed to be some sort of a relation and the articles he received in exchange for his skins failed to arouse in his grim vacant countenance the smallest signs of pleasure emotion and he if they had been acquainted now appeared to be utter strangers to each other nor was this apathy in the least like the wellknown stoicism of the american indian but had the air of downright insensibility yet this man assuredly had a soul a spark of the neverdying flame that separates man from all the other beings of earth  the basin in which the crisis lay was entirely fringed with forest the trees in most places even overhung the water forming an impenetrable screen to everything inland at the season when they were in leaf not a sign of a habitation of any sort was visible and as we approached the shore marble remarked that the savages could only resort to the place at the moments when they had induced a ship to enter in order to trade with them  nono added the mate turning his head in all directions in order to take a complete survey of the bay there are no wigwams or papooses hereabouts this is only a tradingpost and luckily for us it is altogether without customhouse officers  not without smugglers i fancy mr marble if contriving to get other peoples property without their knowledge can make a smuggler i never saw a more thoroughlooking thief than the chap we have nicknamed the dipper  i believe he would swallow one of our iron spoons rather than not get it   ay theres no mistake about him master mile as neb calls you but this fellow here hasnt brains enough to tell his own property from that of another man i would let him into our breadlockers without any dread of his knowing enough to eat i never saw such a vacancy in a human form a downeast idiot would wind him up in a trade as handily as a pedlar sets his wooden clocks in motion  such was marbles opinion of the sagacity of mr  smudge and to own the truth such in a great measure was my own the men laughed at the remarksseamen are a little apt to laugh at chiefmates witand their looks showed how thoroughly they coincided with us in opinion all this time the boat had been pushing ahead and it soon reached the mouth of the little creek  we found the inlet deep but narrow and winding like the bay itself it was fringed with trees and bushes and this in a way to render it difficult to get a view of anything on the land more especially as the banks were ten or fifteen feet in height under the circumstances marble proposed that we should land on both sides of the creek and follow its windings on foot for a short distance in order to get a better opportunity to reconnoitre our dispositions were soon made marble and one of the boats crew each armed landed on one side of the inlet while neb and myself similarly provided went ashore on the other the two remaining men were ordered to keep abreast of us in the boat in readiness to take us on board again as soon as required  leave that mr smudge in the boat miles marble called out across the creek as i was about to put foot on the ground i made a sign to that effect to the savage but when i reached the level ground on the top of the bank i perceived the fellow was at my elbow it was so difficult to make such a creature understand ones wishes without the aid of speech that after a fruitless effort or two to send him back by means of signs i abandoned the attempt and moved forward so as to keep the whole party in the desired line neb offered to catch the old fellow in his arms and to carry him down to the yawl but i thought it more prudent to avoid anything like violence we proceeded therefore accompanied by this escort  there was nothing however to excite alarm or awaken distrust we found ourselves in a virgin forest with all its wildness dampness gloomy shadows dead and fallen trees and unequal surface on my side of the creek there was not the smallest sign of a footpath and marble soon called out to say he was equally without any evidences of the steps of man i should think we proceeded quite a mile in this manner certain that the inlet would be a true guide on our return at length a call from the boat let us know there was no longer water enough to float it and that it could proceed no farther marble and myself descended the banks at the same moment and were taken in intending to return in the yawl smudge glided back to his old place with his former silence  i told you to leave the ourangoutang behind marble carelessly observed as he took his own seat after assisting in getting the boat round with its head towards the bay  i would rather have a rattlesnake for a pet than such a cub  it is easier said than done sir master smudge stuck to me as close as a leech  the fellow seems all the better for his walki never saw him look half as amiable as he does at this moment  of course this raised a laugh and it induced me to look round for the first time i could detect something like a human expression in the countenance of smudge who seemed to experience some sensation a little akin to satisfaction  i rather think he had taken it into his head we were about to desert the coppers i remarked and fancied he might lose his supper now he must see we are going back he probably fancies he will go to bed on a full stomach  marble assented to the probability of this conjecture and the conversation changed it was matter of surprise to us that we had met no traces of anything like a residence near the creek not the smallest sign of man having been discovered by either it was reasonable to expect that some traces of an encampment at least would have been found  everybody kept a vigilant lookout at the shore as we descended the creek but as on the ascent not even a footprint was detected  on reaching the bay there being still several hours of daylight we made its entire circuit finding nowhere any proof of the former presence of man at length marble proposed pulling to the small wooded island that lay a little without the entrance of the haven suggesting that it was possible the savages might have something like an encampment there the place being more convenient as a lookout into the offing than any point within the bay itself in order to do this it was necessary to pass the ship and we were hailed by the captain who wished to know the result of our examinations as soon as he learned our present object he told us to come alongside intending to accompany us to the island in person on getting into the boat which was small and a little crowded by the presence of smudge captain williams made a sign for that personage to quit the yawl he might as well have intimated as much to one of the thwarts laughing at the savages stupidity or obstinacy we scarce knew which to term it the boat was shoved off and we pulled through the entrance two hundred yards outside perhaps until our keel grated against the low rocks of this islet  there was no difficulty in landing and neb who preceded the party soon gave a shout the proof that he had made some discovery every man among us now looked to his arms expecting to meet an encampment of savages but we were disappointed all that the negro had discovered were the unequivocal traces of a former bivouac and judging from a few of the signs that of no very recent occupation the traces were extensive covering quite half of the interior of the island leaving an extensive curtain of trees and bushes however so as completely to conceal the spot from any eyes without most of the trees had been burnt down as we at first thought in order to obtain fuel but farther examination satisfied us that it had been done as much by accident as by design  at first nothing was discovered in this encampment which had every appearance of not having been extensively used for years though the traces of numerous fires and the signs of footsteps and a spring in the centre indicated the recent occupation of which i have just spoken a little further scrutiny however brought to light certain objects that we did not note without much wonder and concern  marble made the first discovery it was impossible for seamen to mistake the object which was the head of a rudder containing the tillerhole and which might have belonged to a vessel of some two hundred and fifty or three hundred tons this set all hands of us at work and in a few minutes we found scattered about fragments of plank toptimbers floortimbers and other portions of a ship all more or less burnt and stripped of every particle of metal even the nails had been drawn by means of perseverance and labour nothing was left but the wood which proved to be liveoak cedar and locust the proofs that the unfortunate craft had been a vessel of some value we wanted no assurance of this however as none but a northwest trader could well have got as high up the coast and all vessels of that class were of the best description then the locust a wood unknown to the shipbuilders of europe gave us the nearly certain assurance that this doomed craft had been a countryman  at first we were all too much occupied with our interesting discovery to bethink us of smudge at length i turned to observe its effect on the savage he evidently noted our proceedings but his feelings if the creature had any were so deeply buried beneath the mask of dullness as completely to foil my penetration he saw us take up fragment after fragment examine them heard us converse over them though in a language he could not understand and saw us throw them away one after another with seemingly equal indifference at length he brought a halfburned billet to the captain and held it before his eyes as if he began to feel some interest in our proceedings it proved to be merely a bit of ordinary wood a fragment of one of the beeches of the forest that lay near an extinguished pile and the act satisfied us all the fellow did not comprehend the reason of the interest we betrayed he clearly knew nothing of the strange vessel  in walking around this deserted encampment the traces of a pathway to the shore were found they were too obvious to be mistaken and led us to the water in the passage opposite to that by which the crisis had been carried in by the dipper and at a point that was not in view from her present anchorage here we found a sort of landing and many of the heavier pieces of the wreck such as it had not been thought necessary to haul up to the fires having no metal about them among other things of this sort was a portion of the keel quite thirty feet long the keelson bolts keelson and floortimbers all attached this was the only instance in which we discovered any metal and this we found only because the fragment was too strong and heavy to be manageable we looked carefully in all directions in the hope of discovering something that might give us an insight into the nature of the disaster that had evidently occurred but for some time without success at length i strolled to a little distance from the landing and took a seat on a flat stone which had been placed on the living rock that faced most of the island evidently to form a restingplace my seat proved unsteady and in endeavouring to adjust it more to my mind i removed the stone and discovered that it rested on a common logslate this slate was still covered with legible writing and i soon had the whole party around me eager to learn the contents the melancholy record was in these precise words viz  the american brig seaotter john squires master coaxed into this bay june 9th 1797 and seized by savages on the morning of the 11th master secondmate and seven of the people killed on the spot brig gutted first then hauled up here and burnt to the waters edge for the iron  david king firstmate and six others viz george lunt henry webster stephen stimpson and john harris seamen bill flint cook and peter doolittle boy still living but god only knows what is to be our fate i shall put this slate beneath the stone i now sit on in the hope it may one day let our friends learn what has happened  we looked at each other astounded both the captain and marble remembered to have heard that a brig in this trade called the seaotter was missing and here by a communication that was little short of miraculous we were let into the secret of her disappearance  coaxed in repeated the captain running his eye over the writing which had been thus singularly preserved and that in a situation where one would think it might have been discovered a thousand timesyes yesi now begin to understand the whole matter if there were any wind gentlemen i would go to sea this very night  that would be hardly worth our while captain williams the chiefmate answered since we are now on our guard and i feel pretty certain that there are no savages in our neighbourhood so far the dipper and his friends have traded with us fairly enough and it is likely they have more skins to dispose of this chap whom the people have christened smudge takes matters so coolly that i hardly think he knows anything about the seaotter which may have been cut off by another gang altogether  there was good reason in these remarks and they had their effect on the captain the latter however determined to put smudge to the proof by showing him the slate and otherwise bringing him under such a crossexamination as signs alone could effect i dare say an indifferent spectator would have laughed at witnessing our efforts to confound the indian we made grimaces pointed exclaimed hallooed swore and gesticulated in vain smudge was as unmoved at it all as the fragment of keel to which he was confronted the fellow either did not or would not understand us his stupidity defied our tests and marble gave the matter up in despair declaring that the beast knows nothing of anything much less of the seaotter as for the slate he did not seem to have the smallest notion what such a thing meant  we returned to the ship carrying with us the slate and the report of our discoveries all hands were called and the captain made us a speech it was sufficiently to the point though it was not in the least of the godlike character we were told how ships were lost by the carelessness of their crews reminded we were on the northwest coast where a vessel with a few boxes of beads and bales of blankets to say nothing of her gunpowder firearms and metals was as valuable as a vessel laden with gold dust would be in one of our own ports vigilance while on watch and obedience to the orders of the vessel in the event of an alarm were the principal things dwelt on by observing these two great requisites we should all be safe enough whereas by disregarding them we should probably share the fate of the people of the brig of which we had just discovered some of the remains  i will confess i passed an uncomfortable night an unknown enemy is always a formidable enemy and i would rather have fought three guardacostas at once than lie where we did in a bay as smooth as a lookingglass surrounded by forests as silent as a desert and in a wellarmed ship that was prepared at all points to meet her foes even to her boardingnettings  nothing came of it all the dipper and smudge eat their supper with the appetites of injured innocence and slept like tops if guilty we all agreed that they must be utterly destitute of consciences as for ourselves we were on the alert until near morning the very moment when the danger would probably be the greatest provided there were any at all and then weariness overcame all who were not on the lookout and some who were still nothing happened the sun returned to us in due season gilding the treetops with its beams our little bay began to bask in its glory and with the cheerfulness that usually accompanies such a scene vanished most of our apprehensions for the moment a night of reflection had quieted our fears and we all woke up next morning as indifferent to the fate of the seaotter as was at all decent    chapter xiii    the monarch mindthe mystery of commanding   the godlike powerthe art napoleon   of winning fettering moulding wielding banding   the hearts of millions till they move as one   thou hast it   halleckred jacket   smudge and the dipper behaved admirably all next day  beef pork and breadthose great desiderata of life which the european is apt to say form the primum mobile of american existenceseemed to engross their thoughts and when they were not eating they were busy with sleep at length we grew ashamed of watching such mere animals and turned our thoughts to other subjects we had understood the dipper that eightandforty hours must elapse before we might expect to see any more skins and captain williams passing from alarm to extreme security determined to profit by a lovely day and send down or rather strip all three of the topmasts and pay some necessary attention to their rigging at nine oclock accordingly the hands were turnedto and before noon the ship was pretty thoroughly en deshabille we sent as little down as possible keeping even the topsailyards aloft though without their lifts or braces steadying them by guys but the topmasts were lowered as far as was found possible without absolutely placing the lower yards on the hammockcloths in a word we put the ship in the most unmanageable position without absolutely littering our decks the security of the haven and the extreme beauty of the weather emboldened the captain to do this apprehension of every sort appearing to have quite taken leave of him  the work proceeded merrily we had not only a strong crew but we had a good crew and our philadelphians were in their element the moment there was a question of the rigging by sunset the chafes were examined and parcelled and served anew and the topmast rigging was all got up and put over the mastheads again and everything was ready to sway upon in the morning but an uncommonly active day required a good nights rest and the people were all ordered to turn in as soon as they had supped the ship was to be left to the vigilance of the captain and the three mates during the night  the anchorwatch was set at eight and ran from two hours to two hours my turn commenced at midnight and was to last until two marble succeeding me from two until four when all hands were to be called to get our sticks aloft  when i turned out at twelve i found the thirdmate conversing as well as he could with the dipper who with smudge having slept so much of the day appeared disposed to pass the night in smoking  how long have these fellows been on deck i asked of the thirdmate as he was about to go below  all my watch i found them with the captain who passed them over to me for company if that chap the dipper only knew anything of a human language he would be something of society but im as tired of making signs to him as i ever was with a hard days work  i was armed and felt ashamed of manifesting fear of an unarmed man then the two savages gave no additional cause of distrust the dipper having taken a seat on the windlass where he was smoking his pipe with an appearance of philosophy that would have done credit to the gravestlooking baboon as for smudge he did not appear to be sufficiently intellectual to smoke an occupation that has at least the merit of affecting the air of wisdom and reflection i never could discover whether your great smokers were actually wiser than the rest of the race or not but it will be admitted they occasionally seem to be so it was a pity smudge did not have recourse to the practice as it might have given the fellow an appearance of sometimes cogitating as it was while his companion was enjoying his pipe at the windlass he kept strolling about the deck much as a pig would have wandered in the same place and seemingly with the same object  i took charge of the decks with a very lively sense of the peculiarity of our situation the security that prevailed on board struck me as unnatural and yet i could detect no particular reason for immediate alarm i might be thrown overboard or murdered by the two savages on deck it was very true but of what use would it be to destroy me since they could not hope to destroy all the rest on board without being discovered the night was starlit and there was little chance of a canoes approaching the ship without my seeing it a circumstance that of itself in a great measure removed the danger i passed the first quarter of an hour in reflecting on these things and then as use accustomed me to my situation i began to think less of them and to revert to other subjects  clawbonny grace lucy and mr hardinge often rose before my minds eye in those distant seas it was seldom i passed a tranquil watch at night without revisiting the scenes of my boyhood and wandering through my own fields accompanied by my beloved sister and her quite as well beloved friend how many hours of happiness had i thus passed on the trackless wastes of the pacific and the atlantic and with how much fidelity did memory recall the peculiar graces whether of body or mind of each of the dear girls in particular since my recent experience in london emily merton would occasionally adorn the picture with her more cultivated discourse and more finished manner and yet i do not remember to have ever given her more than a third place on the scale of my admiration  on the present occasion i was soon lost in ruminations on the past and in imagining events for the future i was not particularly expert at building castles in the air but what youth of twenty or maiden of sixteen never reared some sort of a fabric of this nature these fanciful structures are the results of inexperience building with the materials of hope in my most imaginative moments i could even fancy rupert an industrious staid lawyer adorning his profession and rendering both lucy and grace happy beyond this it was not easy for the human faculties to conceive  lucy sang sweetly at times her songs fairly haunted me and for hours i could think of nothing but their tender sentiment and their touching melody i was no nightingale myself though i sometimes endeavoured to hum some one of the airs that floated in my recollection like beautiful visions of the past this night in particular my thoughts recurred to one of these songs that told of affection and home and i stood for several minutes leaning over the railing forward humming the tune to myself while i endeavoured to recall not only the words but the sweet voice that was wont to give them so much thrilling pathos i did this sometimes at clawbonny and time and again had lucy placed her soft little hand on my mouth as she would laughingly say miles miles do not spoil so pretty a song  you will never succeed with music so work the harder with your latin sometimes she would steal behind mei fancied i could hear her breathing at my shoulder even as i leaned over the railand would apply her hand slyly to my lips in her many attempts of this nature so vivid did one of these scenes become that i thought i really felt the soft smooth hand on my mouth and i was actually about to kiss it when something that was smooth enough certainly but which was very far from being soft passed between my teeth and i felt it drawn so tight as completely to prevent my calling out at the same moment my arms were seized from behind and held as if grasped by a vice turning as well as i was able i found that rascal smudge had been breathing within an inch of my ear while he passed the gag and the dipper was busy in lashing my arms together behind my back the whole had been done so suddenly and yet with so much skill that i was a helpless prisoner as it might be in a single instant  resistance being as much out of my power as it was to give any alarm i was soon secured hands and feet and placed carefully in the waist a little out of the way for i probably owed my life solely to the wish of smudge to keep me as his slave from that instant every appearance of stupidity vanished from this fellows countenance and manner and he became the moving spirit and i might say the soul of all the proceedings of his companions as for myself there i sat lashed to a spar utterly unable to help myself an unwilling witness of all that followed i felt the imminent danger of our situation but i think i felt the disgrace of having such a surprise occur in my watch more even than the personal risks i ran  in the first place i was disarmed then the dipper took a lantern which stood on the binnacle lighted it and showed it for half a minute above the taffrail his signal must have been instantly answered for he soon extinguished the light and moved about the deck in attentive watchfulness to seize any straggler who might happen to come on deck little fear of that however weariness chaining the men to their berths as closely as if they had been bolted down with iron i now expected to see the fellows fill the yawl with effects and run away with them for as yet i could not believe that two men would have the hardihood to attack such a ships company as ours  i reckoned without my host it might have been ten minutes after i was seized that darklooking figures began to climb the ships sides until more than thirty of them were on her decks this was done so noiselessly too that the most vigilant attention on my part gave no notice of their approach until they stood among us all these men were armed a few with muskets others with clubs and some with bows and arrows so far as i could discover each had some sort of a knife and a few had hatchets or tomahawks  to my great regret i saw that three or four were immediately stationed at the companionway aft and as many more at the boobyhatch forward this was effectually commanding the only two passages by which the officers and men would be likely to ascend in the event of their attempting to come on deck it is true the main hatch as well as that of the steerage was used by day but both had been covered over night and no one would think of using either unless aware of the danger that existed on deck  i suffered a good deal both from the gag and the ropes that bound my limbs and yet i hardly thought of the pain so intense was my curiosity as to what was to follow after the savages were all on board the first quarter of an hour passed in making their dispositions smudge the stupid inanimate senseless smudge acting as leader and manifesting not only authority but readiness and sagacity he placed all his people in ambush so that one appearing from below would not at once be apprized of the change that had taken place on deck and thus give the savages time to act  after this another quarter of an hour passed during which the fall of a pin might almost have been heard so profound was the silence i shut my eyes in this terrific interval and endeavoured to pray  on deck hereforward there said a voice suddenly that at once i knew to be the captains i would have given the world to be able to answer in order to warn him of the danger but this was impossible i did groan and i believe the captain heard me for he moved away from the cabindoor and called out mr wallingfordwhere have you got to mr wallingford he was without his hat having come on deck halfclad simply to ascertain how went the night and it makes me shudder even now to write about the blow that fell on his unprotected skull it would have felled an ox and it crushed him on the spot the caution of his murderers prevented his falling however for they did not wish to alarm the sleepers below though the plash on the water that followed could not fail to reach ears which took in every sound with the avidity of mine  thus perished captain williams a mild wellmeaning man an excellent seaman and one whose principal fault was want of caution i do not think the water was necessary to complete his fate as nothing human could have survived such a blow  smudge had been the principal actor in this frightful scene and as soon as it was over he caused his men to return to their ambushes i now thought the officers and men were to be murdered in this manner as one by one they appeared on deck it would soon be time for marble to turn out though there was the hope he might not unless called and i could not do this office situated as i was but i was mistaken instead of enticing any men on deck the savages pursued a different course having destroyed the captain they closed the doors of the companionway drew over the boobyhatch and adopted the safe expedient of making all below prisoners this was not done altogether without noise and the alarm was evidently given by the means taken to secure the fastenings i heard a rush at the cabindoors which was soon followed by one at the boobyhatch but smudges ingenuity had been sufficient to prevent either from being successful  as soon as certain that their prisoners were safe the savages came and loosened the ropes of my arms sufficiently to put me more at my ease they removed those which bound my feet entirely and at the same instant the gag was taken from my mouth i was then led to the companionway and by a sign given to understand i might communicate with my friends below in the management of all this i found that smudge the semihuman dull animalseeming smudge was at the head i also came to the conclusion my life was to be spared for a time at least and for some purpose that as yet baffled my conjectures i did not call out immediately but waited until i heard a movement on the ladder when i complied with the orders of my captors and masters  mr marble i cried loud enough to be heard below is that you  ay ayand is that you master miles  this is i be cautious how you act mr marble the savages are in possession of the upper deck and i am their prisoner the people are all below with a strong watch at the forescuttle  i heard a long low whistle within the companionway doors which it was easy enough to interpret into an expression of the chiefmates concern and wonder for myself i saw no use in attempting concealment but was resolved to speak out fully even though it might be at the risk of betraying some of my feelings to my captors among whom i thought it probable there might be more than one who understood something of english  we miss captain williams below here marble resumed after a short delay do you know anything of his movements  alas mr marblepoor captain williams can be of no service to any of us now  what of him was demanded in a clear full voice and as quick as lightning let me know at once  he has been killed by a blow from a club and is thrown overboard  a dead silence followed and it lasted near a minute  then it has fallen to my duty to decide what is to be done marble at length exclaimed miles are you at libertydare you say what you think  i am held here by two of the savages whose prisoner i certainly am still mr marble they encourage me to speak but i fear some among them understand what we say  there was another pause during which the mate was doubtless reflecting on the best course to pursue  harkee miles marble continued we know each other and can tell what is meant without blabbing how old are you out there on deck  quite thirty years mr marbleand good stout years they are too  well provided for with sulphur and the pills or only with indian tools such as our boys sometimes play with  a little of the firsthalfadozen perhaps with some of the last and a plenty of carvers  an impatient push from the dipper warned me to speak plainer and satisfied me that the fellow could comprehend what passed so long as we confined ourselves to a straight forward discourse this discovery had the effect to put me still more on my guard  i understand you miles marble answered in a thoughtful manner we must be on our guard do you think they mean to come below  i see no signs at presentbut understanding emphasizing the word is more general than you imagine and no secrets must be told my advice is millions for defence and not a cent for tribute  as this last expression was common in the mouths of the americans of the day having been used on the occasion of the existing war with france i felt confident it would be understood marble made no answer and i was permitted to move from the companionway and to take a seat on the hencoops my situation was sufficiently remarkable it was still dark but enough light fell from the stars to permit me to see all the swarthy and savage forms that were gliding about the decks and even to observe something of the expression of the countenances of those who from time to time came near to stare me in the face the last seemed ferociously disposed but it was evident that a masterspirit held all these wild beings in strict subjection quelling the turbulence of their humours restraining their fierce disposition to violence and giving concert and design to all their proceedings this masterspirit was smudge of the fact i could not doubt his gestures his voice his commands giving movement and method to everything that was done i observed that he spoke with authority and confidence though he spoke calmly he was obeyed without any particular marks of deference but he was obeyed implicitly i could also see that the savages considered themselves as conquerors caring very little for the men under hatches  nothing material occurred until day dawned smudgefor so i must continue to call this revoltinglooking chief for want of his true namewould permit nothing to be attempted until the light became sufficiently strong to enable him to note the proceedings of his followers i subsequently ascertained too that he waited for reinforcements a yell being raised in the ship just as the sun appeared which was answered from the forest the last seemed fairly alive with savages nor was it long before canoes issued from the creek and i counted one hundred and seven of these wretches on board the ship this was their whole force however no more ever appearing  all this time or for three hours i had no more communication with our own people i was certain however that they were all together a junction being easy enough by means of the middledeck which had no other cargo than the light articles intended for the northwest trade and by knocking down the forecastle bulkhead there was a sliding board in the last indeed that would admit of one mans passing at a time without having recourse to this last expedient i entertained no doubt marble had collected all hands below and being in possession of plenty of arms the men having carried their muskets and pistols below with them with all the ammunition he was still extremely formidable what course he would pursue i was obliged to conjecture a sortie would have been very hazardous if practicable at all and it was scarcely practicable after the means taken by smudge and the dipper to secure the passages everything so far as i was concerned was left to conjecture  the manner in which my captors treated me excited my surprise as soon as it was light my limbs were released and i was permitted to walk up and down the quarterdeck to restore the circulation of the blood a clot of blood with some fragments of hair marked the spot where poor captain williams had fallen and i was allowed to dash a bucket of water over the place in order to wash away the revolting signs of the murder for myself a strange recklessness had taken the place of concern and i became momentarily indifferent to my fate i expected to die and i am now ashamed to confess that my feelings took a direction towards revenge rather than towards penitence for my past sins at times i even envied marble and those below who might destroy their enemies at a swoop by throwing a match into the magazine i felt persuaded indeed it would come to that before the mate and men would submit to be the captives of such wretches as were then in possession of the deck smudge and his associates however appeared to be perfectly indifferent to this danger of the character of which they were probably ignorant their scheme had been very cunningly laid and thus far it was perfectly successful  the sun was fairly up and the savages began to think seriously of securing their prize when the two leaders smudge and the dipper approached me in a manner to show they were on the point of commencing operations  the last of these men i now discovered had a trifling knowledge of english which he had obtained from different ships still he was a savage to all intents and purposes the little information thus gleaned serving to render his worst propensities more dangerous rather than in any manner tempering them he now took the lead parading all his men in two lines on the deck making a significant gesture towards his fingers and uttering with emphasis the word count i did count the wretches making this time one hundred and six exclusively of the two leaders  tell him down theregrowled the dipper pointing below  i called for mr marble and when he had reached the companionway the following conversation took place between us  what is it now miles my hearty demanded the chiefmate  i am ordered to tell you sir that the indians number one hundred and eight having just counted them for this purpose  i wish there were a thousand as we are about to lift the deck from the ship and send them all into the air do you think they can understand what i say miles  the dipper does sir when you speak slow and plain  he has only half a notion of what you now mean as i can see by his countenance  does the rascal hear me nowis he anywhere near the companionway  he does and ishe is standing at this moment on the larboard side of the companionway kneeling one knee on the forward end of the hencoop  milessaid marble in a doubting sort of a voice  mr marblei hear what you say  supposeehlead through the companionwayehwhat would happen to you  i should care little for that sir as ive made up my mind to be murdered but it would do no good just now and might do harm i will tell them however of your intention to blow them up if you please perhaps that may make them a little shy  marble assented and i set about the office as well as i could most of my communication had to be made by means of signs but in the end i succeeded in making the dipper understand my meaning by this man the purport was told to smudge in terms the old man listened with grave attention but the idea of being blown up produced no more effect on him than would have been produced by a message from home to tell him that his chimney was on fire supposing him to have possessed such a civilized instrument of comfort that he fully comprehended his friend i could see by the expression of his ourangoutanglooking countenance but fear was a passion that troubled him very little and sooth to say a man whose time was passed in a condition as miserable as that in which he habitually dwelt had no great reason to set a very high value on his life yet these miserable wretches never commit suicide that is a relief reserved rather for those who have become satiated with human enjoyments nine pampered sensualists dying in this mode for one poor wretch whose miseries have driven him to despair  i was astonished at seeing the intelligence that gleamed in the baboonlike face of smudge as he listened to his friends words incredulity was the intellectual meaning in his eye while indifference seemed seated in his whole visage  it was evident the threat had made no impression and i managed to let marble understand as much and that in terms which the dipper could not very well comprehend i got no answer a deathlike stillness reigning below decks in lieu of the bustle that had so lately been heard there  smudge seemed struck with the change and i observed he was giving orders to two or three of the elder savages apparently to direct a greater degree of watchfulness i confess to some uneasiness myself for expectation is an unpleasant guest in a scene like that and more especially when accompanied by uncertainty  smudge now seemed to think it time to commence his operations in earnest under the direction of the dipper a quantity of line was thrown into the yawl studdinghalyards and such other rope of convenient size as could be found in the launch and the boat was towed by two or three canoes to the island here the fellows made what seamen call a guesswarp of their rope fastening one end to a tree and paying out line as the yawl was towed back again to the ship the dippers calculation proved to be sufficiently accurate the rope reaching from the vessel to the tree  as soon as this feat was accomplished and it was done with sufficient readiness though somewhat lubberly twenty or thirty of the savages clapped on the warp until they had tautened it to as great a strain as it would bear after this they ceased pulling and i observed a search around the galley in quest of the cooks axe evidently with a design to cut the cables i thought this a fact worth communicating to marble and i resolved to do so at the risk of my life  the indians have run a line to the island and are about to cut the cables no doubt intending to warp the ship ashore and that too at the very spot where they once had the seaotter  ay aylet them go on well be ready for them in time was the only answer i received  i never knew whether to ascribe the apathy the savages manifested to this communication to a wish that the fact might be known to the people below or to indifference  they certainly proceeded in their movements with just as much coolness as if they had the ship all to themselves  they had six or eight canoes and parties of them began to move round the vessel with precisely the same confidence as men would do it in a friendly port what most surprised me were the quiet and submission to orders they observed  at length the axe was found secreted in the bows of the launch and marble was apprised of the use to which it was immediately applied by the heavy blows that fell upon the cables  miles said the chiefmatethese blows go to my heart are the blackguards really in earnest  the larboard bower is gone sir and the blows you now hear are on the starboard which is already half in twothat finishes it the ship now hangs only by the warp   is there any wind boy  not a breath of it in the bay though i can see a little ripple on the water outside  is it rising or falling water miles  the ebb is nearly donetheyll never be able to get the ship up on the shelving rock where they had the seaotter until the water rises ten or twelve feet  thank god for that i was afraid they might get her on that accursed bed and break her back at once  is it of any importance to us mr marble what hope can we have of doing anything against such odds and in our circumstances  the odds i care nothing for boy my lads are screwed up so tight theyd lick the whole northwest coast if they could only get on deck without having their fashionpieces stove in the circumstances i allow must count for a great deal  the ship is moving fast towards the islandi see no hope for us mr marble  i say miles it is worth some risk to try and save the craftwere it not for fear of you i would have played the rascals a trick half an hour since  never mind me sirit was my fault it has happened and i ought to suffer for itdo what duty and discretion tell you is best  i waited a minute after this in intense expectation not knowing what was to follow when a report made me fancy for an instant some attempt was making to blow up the deck  the wails and cries that succeeded however soon let me into the real state of the case a volley of muskets had been fired from the cabinwindows and every individual in two canoes that were passing at the time to the number of eleven were shot down like bullocks three were killed dead and the remainder received wounds that promised to be mortal my life would have been the instant sacrifice of this act had it not been for the stern authority of smudge who ordered my assailants off with a manner and tone that produced immediate compliance it was clear i was reserved for some peculiar fate  every man who could rushed into the remaining canoes and the ships yawl in order to pick up the killed and wounded as soon as the nature of the calamity was known  i watched them from the taffrail and soon ascertained that marble was doing the same from the windows below me  but the savages did not dare venture in a line with a fire that had proved so fatal and were compelled to wait until the ship had moved sufficiently ahead to enable them to succour their friends without exposing their own lives as this required some distance as well as time the ship was not only left without a canoe or boat of any sort in the water but with only half her assailants on board of her  those who did remain for want of means to attack any other enemy vented their spite on the ship expending all their strength in frantic efforts on the warp the result was that while they gave great way to the vessel they finally broke the line  i was leaning on the wheel with smudge near me when this accident occurred the tide was still running ebb and with some strength and the ship was just entering the narrow passage between the island and the point that formed one termination of the bay heading of course toward the tree to which the warp had been secured it was an impulsive feeling rather than any reason that made me give the vessel a sheer with the helm so as to send her directly through the passage instead of letting her strike the rocks  i had no eventual hope in so doing nor any other motive than the strong reluctance i felt to have the good craft hit the bottom luckily the dipper was in the canoes and it was not an easy matter to follow the ship under the fire from her cabinwindows had he understood the case and been disposed to do so but like all the rest in the canoes he was busy with his wounded friends who were all carried off towards the creek this left me master of the ships movements for five minutes and by that time she had drawn through the passage and was actually shooting out into the open ocean  this was a novel and in some respects an embarrassing situation it left a gleam of hope but it was a hope without a direction and almost without an object i could perceive that none of the savages on board had any knowledge of the cause of our movement unless they might understand the action of the tide they had expected the ship to be run ashore at the tree and here she was gliding into the ocean and was already clear of the passage the effect was to produce a panic and fully onehalf of those who had remained in the ship jumped overboard and began to swim for the island i was momentarily in hope all would take this course but quite fiveandtwenty remained more from necessity than choice as i afterwards discovered for they did not know how to swim of this number was smudge who probably still remained to secure his conquest  it struck me the moment was favourable and i went to the companionway and was about to remove its fastenings thinking the ship might be recovered during the prevalence of the panic but a severe blow and a knife gleaming in the hands of smudge admonished me of the necessity of greater caution the affair was not yet ended nor was my captor a man as easily disconcerted as i had incautiously supposed unpromising as he seemed this fellow had a spirit that fitted him for great achievements and which under other circumstances might have made him a hero he taught me the useful lesson of not judging of men merely by their exteriors    chapter xiv    courtbrother john bates is not that the morning which   breaks yonder   batesi think it be but we have no great cause to desire   the approach of day   willwe see yonder the beginning of the day but i think   we shall never see the end of it   henry v   the ship did not lose her steerageway as soon as past the point of the island a gentle southerly breeze was felt and acting on the spars and hull it enabled me by putting the helm a little up to keep her head off shore and thus increase her distance from the bay the set of the tide did more for her than the wind it is true but the two acting in unison carried her away from the coast at a rate that nearly equalled two knots in the hour this was slow moving certainly for a vessel in such a strait but it would require fifteen or twenty minutes for the canoes to return from the creek and make the circuit of the island by the other channel by that time we should be near half a mile at sea  smudge beyond a question understood that he was in a dilemma though totally ignorant of some of the leading difficulties of his case it was plain to me he could not comprehend why the ship took the direction of the offing for he had no conception of the power of the rudder our tiller worked below and it is possible this circumstance mystified him more small vessels in that day managing their helms without the aid of the wheel than with it at length the movement of the vessel became too palpable to admit of further delay and this savage approached me with a drawn knife and a manner that proved natural affection had not been the motive of his previous moderation after flourishing his weapon fiercely before my eyes and pressing it most significantly once or twice against my breast he made signs for me to cause the ship to turn round and reenter the port i thought my last moment had come but naturally enough pointed to the spars giving my master to understand that the vessel was not in her usual trim i believe i was understood as to this part of my excuses it being too apparent that our masts and yards were not in their usual places for the fact to be overlooked even by a savage smudge however saw that several of the sails were bent and he pointed to those growling out his threats should i refuse to set them the spanker in particular being near him he took hold of it shook it and ordered me to loosen it forthwith  it is scarcely necessary to say i obeyed this order with secret joy casting loose the brails i put the outhauler in the hands of a dozen of the savages and set the example of pulling in a minute we had this sail spread with the sheet a little eased off i then led a party forward and got the fore and main staysails on the ship to these were added the mizen staysail the only other piece of canvass we could show until the topmasts were fidded the effect of these four sails however was to add at least another knot to the way of the ship and to carry her out sooner to a point where she felt the full force of the light breeze that was blowing from the southeast by the time the four sails were set we were fully a quarter of a mile from the island every instant getting more fairly into the true currents of the air  smudge watched me with the eyes of a hawk as i had obeyed his own orders in making sail he could not complain of that but the result evidently disappointed him he saw we were still moving in the wrong direction and as yet not a canoe was visible as for these last now the vessel had way on her i was not without hopes of being able to keep them exposed to the fire from the cabinwindows and finally of getting rid of them by drawing off the land to a distance they would not be likely to follow the dipper however i was aware was a bold fellowknew something of vesselsand i was determined to give a hint to marble to pick him off should he come within range of his muskets  in the meantime the alarm and impatience of smudge and his companions very sensibly increased five minutes were an age in the circumstances in which they were placed and i saw that it would soon be necessary to adopt some new expedient or i might expect to be sacrificed to the resentment of these savages necessity sharpens the wits and i hit upon a scheme which was not entirely without the merit of ingenuity as it was i suppose i owed my life to the consciousness of the savages that they could do nothing without me  smudge with three or four of the fiercest of his companions had begun again to menace me with the knife making signs at the same time for me to turn the ships head towards the land i asked for a little room and then describing a long circle on the deck pointing to the four sails we had set and this in a way to tell them that under the canvass we carried it would be necessary to go a great distance in order to turn round when i had succeeded in communicating this idea i forthwith set about giving them to understand that by getting up the topmasts and making more sail we might return immediately the savages understood me and the explanation appearing reasonable to them they went aside and consulted together as time pressed it was not long before smudge came to me with signs to show him and his party how to get the remainder of the sails set of course i was not backward in giving the desired information  in a few minutes i had a string of the savages hold of the mastrope forward a lufftackle being applied as everything was ready aloft all we had to do was to pull until judging by the eye i thought the spar was high enough when i ran up the rigging and clapped in the fid  having the topmast out of the way without touching any of its rigging i went down on the foreyard and loosened the sail this appeared so much like business that the savages gave sundry exclamations of delight and by the time i got on deck they were all ready to applaud me as a good fellow even smudge was completely mystified and when i set the others at work at the jeerfall to sway up the foreyard he was as active as any of them we soon had the yard in its place and i went aloft to secure it touching the braces first so as to fill the sail  the reader may rest assured i did not hurry myself now i had things in so fair a way i could perceive that my power and importance increased with every foot we went from the land and the ship steering herself under such canvass the wheel being a trifle up there was no occasion for extraordinary exertion on my part i determined now to stay aloft as long as possible the yard was soon secured and then i went up into the top where i began to set up the weatherrigging of course nothing was very thoroughly done though sufficiently so for the weather we had  from the top i had a good view of the offing and of the coast for leagues we were now quite a mile at sea and though the tide was no longer of any use to us we were drawing through the water quite at the rate of two knots  i thought that the flood had made and that it took us a little on our leebow hawsing us up to windward just as i had got the last lanyard fastened the canoes began to appear coming round the island by the farther passage and promising to overtake us in the course of the next twenty minutes the crisis demanded decision and i determined to get the jib on the ship accordingly i was soon on deck  having so much the confidence of the savages who now fancied their return depended on me i soon had them at work and we had the stay set up in two or three minutes  i then ran out and cast off the gaskets when my boys began to hoist at a signal from me i have seldom been so happy as when i saw that large sheet of canvass open to the air the sheet was hauled in and belayed as fast as possible and then it struck me i should not have time to do any more before the canoes would overtake us it was my wish to communicate with marble while passing aft to effect this object i paused a moment to examine the movement of the canoes old smudge the whole time expressing his impatience that the ship did not turn round i make no doubt i should have been murdered a dozen times had i lives enough were it not that the savages felt how dependent they were on me for the government of the vessel i began to see my importance and grew bold in proportion  as for the canoes i took a look at them through a glass they were about halfamile distant had ceased paddling and were lying close together seemingly in consultation i fancied the appearance of the ship under canvass had alarmed them and that they began to think we had regained the vessel and were getting her in sailing condition again and that it might not be prudent to come too near could i confirm this impression a great point would be gained under the pretence of making more sail in order to get the ships head round a difficulty i had to explain to smudge by means of signs some six or eight times i placed the savages at the maintopmast mastrope and told them to drag this was a task likely to keep them occupied and what was more it kept them all looking forward leaving me affecting to be busied aft i had given smudge a segar too to put him in good humour and i had also taken the liberty to light one for myself  our guns had all been primed levelled and had their tompions taken out the night before in readiness to repel any assault that might be made i had only to remove the apron from the aftergun and it was ready to be discharged  going to the wheel i put the helm hard up until our broadside bore on the canoes then glancing along my gun until i saw it had a tolerable range i clapped the segar to the priming springing back to the wheel and putting the helm down the explosion produced a general yell among the savages several of whom actually leaped into the chains ready to go overboard while smudge rushed towards me fiercely brandishing his knife i thought my time had come but perceiving that the ship was luffing fast i motioned eagerly forward to draw the attention of my assailant in that quarter the vessel was comingto and smudge was easily induced to believe it was the commencement of turning round the breathing time allowed me to mystify him with a few more signs after which he rejoined his people showed them exultingly the ship still luffing and i make no doubt he thought himself and induced the rest to think that the gun had a material agency in producing all these apparent changes as for the canoes the grape had whistled so near them that they began to paddle back doubtless under the impression that we were again masters of the ship and had sent them this hint to keep aloof  thus far i had succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectations and i began to entertain lively hopes of not only saving my life but of recovering the command of the vessel  could i manage to get her out of sight of land my services would be so indispensable as almost to insure success  the coast was very low and a run of six or eight hours would do this provided the vessels head could be kept in the right direction the wind moreover was freshening and i judged that the crisis had already four knots way on her less than twenty miles would put all the visible coast under water but it was time to say something to marble with a view to lull distrust i called smudge to the companionway in order that he might hear what passed though i felt satisfied now that the dipper was out of the ship not a soul remained among the savages who could understand a syllable of english or knew anything of vessels the first call brought the mate to the door  well miles what is ithe askedwhat meant the gun and who fired it  all right mr marble i fired the gun to keep off the canoes and it has had the effect i wished  yes my head was out of the cabinwindow at the time for i believed the ship was waring and thought you had given up and were going back into port i saw the roundshot strike within twenty fathoms of the canoes and as for the grape some of it flew beyond them why we are more than half a league from the land boywill smudge stand that much longer  i then told marble precisely how we were situated on deck the sail we were under the number of savages we had on board and the notion the savages entertained on the subject of turning the ship round it is not easy to say which listened with the most attention marble or smudge  the latter made frequent gestures for me to turn the ship towards the coast for by this time she had the wind abeam again and was once more running in a straight line it was necessary on more accounts than one to adopt some immediate remedy for the danger that began to press on me anew not only must smudge and his associates be pacified but as the ship got into the offing she began to feel the groundswell and her spars aloft were anything but secure  the maintopmast was about halfup and it was beginning to surge and move in the cap in a way i did not like it is true there was not much danger yet but the wind was rising and what was to be done ought to be done at once  i was not sorry however to perceive that five or six of the savages smudge among the number began to betray signs of seasickness i would have given clawbonny at the moment to have had all the rascals in rough water  i now endeavoured to make smudge understand the necessity of my having assistance from below both to assist in turning the vessel and in getting the yards and masts into their places the old fellow shook his head and looked grave at this i saw he was not sick enough yet to be indifferent about his life after a time however he pronounced the names of neb and yo the blacks having attracted the attention of the savages the last being the cook i understood him he would suffer these two to come to my assistance provided it could be done without endangering his own ascendency three unarmed men could hardly be dangerous to twentyfive who were armed and then i suspected that he fancied the negroes would prove allies to himself in the event of a struggle rather than foes as for neb he made a fatal mistake nor was he much nearer the truth in regard to joeor yo as he called himthe cook feeling quite as much for the honour of the american flag as the fairestskinned seaman in the country it is generally found that the loyalty of the negroes is of proof  i found means to make smudge understand the manner in which these two blacks could be got on deck without letting up the rest as soon as he fairly comprehended the means to be used he cheerfully acquiesced and i made the necessary communication to marble a rope was sent down over the sternboat to the cabinwindows and neb took a turn round his body when he was hauled up to the gunwale of the boat into which he was dragged by the assistance of the savages the same process was used with joe before the negroes were permitted to go aloft however smudge made them a brief oration in which oracular sentences were blended with significant gestures and indications of what they were to expect in the event of bad behaviour after this i sent the blacks into the maintop and glad enough i thought they were both to get there  thus reinforced we had the maintopmast fidded in a very few minutes neb was then directed to set up the rigging and to clear away the yard so it might be got into its place in a word an hour passed in active exertions at the end of which we had everything rove bent and in its place on the mainmast from the topmasthead to the deck the topgallantmast was lying fore and aft in the waist and could not then be touched nor was it necessary  i ordered the men to loosen both sails and to overhaul down their rigging in the eyes of smudge this looked highly promising and the savages gave a yell of delight when they saw the topsail fairly filled and drawing i added the mainsail to the pressure and then the ship began to walk off the coast at a rate that promised all i hoped for it was now necessary for me to stick by the wheel of the uses of which smudge began to obtain some notions at this time the vessel was more than two leagues from the island and objects began to look dim along the coast as for the canoes they could no longer be seen and chasing us any farther was quite out of the question i felt that the crisis was approaching  smudge and his companions now became more and more earnest on the subject of turning the ship round the indistinctness of the land began seriously to alarm them and seasickness had actually placed four of their number flat on the deck i could see that the old fellow himself was a good deal affected though his spirit and the risks he ran kept him in motion and vigilantly on the watch it was necessary to seem to do something and i sent the negroes up into the foretop to get the top sailyard in its place and the sail set this occupied another hour before we were entirely through when the land was getting nearly awash  as soon as the mizentopsail was set i braced sharp up and brought the ship close upon the wind this caused the indians to wilt down like flowers under a burning sun just as i expected there being by this time a sevenknot breeze and a smart headsea on old smudge felt that his forces were fast deserting him and he now came to me in a manner that would not be denied and i felt the necessity of doing something to appease him i got the savages stationed as well as i could hauled up the mainsail and put the ship in stays we tacked better than i could have believed possible and when my wild captors saw that we were actually moving in the direction of the land again their delight was infinite their leader was ready to hug me but i avoided this pleasure in the best manner i could  as for the consequences i had no apprehensions knowing we were too far off to have any reason to dread the canoes and being certain it was easy enough to avoid them in such a breeze  smudge and his companions were less on the alert as soon as they perceived the ship was going in the proper direction they probably believed the danger in a measure over and they began to yield a little to their physical sufferings i called neb to the wheel and leaning over the taffrail i succeeded in getting marble to a cabinwindow without alarming smudge i then told the mate to get all his forces in the forecastle having observed that the indians avoided that part of the vessel on account of the heavy plunges she occasionally made and possibly because they fancied our people were all aft as soon as the plan was understood i strolled forward looking up at the sails and touching a rope here and there like one bent on his ordinary duty the savage stationed at the forescuttle was as sick as a dog and with streaming eyes he was paying the landsmens tribute to the sea the hatch was very strong and it was secured simply by its hasp and a bit of iron thrust through it i had only to slip my hand down remove the iron throw open the hatch when the ships company streamed up on deck marble leading  it was not a moment for explanations i saw at a glance that the mate and his followers regarded the situation of the ship very differently from what i did myself i had now been hours with the savages had attained a little of their confidence and knew how dependent they were on myself for their final safety all of which in a small degree disposed me to treat them with some of the lenity i fancied i had received from them in my own person but marble and the crew had been chafing below like caged lions the whole time and as i afterwards learned had actually taken an unanimous vote to blow themselves up before they would permit the indians to retain the control of the vessel  then poor captain williams was much beloved forward and his death remained to be avenged i would have said a word in favour of my captors but the first glance i got at the flushed face of the mate told me it would be useless  i turned therefore to the sick savage who had been left as a sentinel over the forescuttle to prevent his interference  this man was armed with the pistols that had been taken from me and he showed a disposition to use them i was too quick in my motions however falling upon him so soon as to prevent one who was not expert with the weapons from using them we clenched and fell on the deck together the indian letting the pistols fall to meet my grasp  as this occurred i heard the cheers of the seamen and marble shouting out to revenge captain williams gave the order to charge i soon had my own fellow perfectly at my mercy and got him so near the end of the jib downhaul as to secure him with a turn or two of that rope the man made little resistance after the first onset and catching up the pistols i left him to join in what was doing aft as i lay on the deck i heard several plunges into the water and then halfadozen of most cruelly crushing blows succeeded  not a shot was fired by either party though some of our people who had carried all their arms below the night the ship was seized used their pikes with savage freedom  by the time i got as far aft as the mainmast the vessel was our own nearly half the indians had thrown themselves into the sea the remaining dozen had either been knocked in the head like beeves or were stuck like so many porkers the dead bodies followed the living into the sea old smudge alone remained at the moment of which i have spoken  the leader of the savages was examining the movements of neb at the moment the shout was raised and the black abandoning the wheel threw his arms round those of the old man holding him like a vice in this situation he was found by marble and myself who approached at the same instant one on each side of the quarterdeck  overboard with the blackguard called out the excited mate overboard with him neb like a troopers horse  hold i interrupted spare the old wretch mr  marblehe spared me  a request from me would at any moment outweigh an order from the captain himself so far as the black was concerned else smudge would certainly have gone into the ocean like a bundle of straw marble had in him a good deal of the indifference to bodily suffering that is generated by habit and aroused he was a dangerous and sometimes a hard man but in the main he was not cruel and then he was always manly in the short struggle which he had passed he had actually dropped his pike to knock an indian down with his fist bundling the fellow through a port without ceremony ere he had time to help himself  but he disdained striking smudge with such odds against him and he went to the helm himself bidding neb secure the prisoner glad of this little relief to a scene so horrible i ran forward intending to bring my own prisoner aft and to have the two confined together below but i was too late  one of the philadelphians had just got the poor wretchs head and shoulders through the bowport and i was barely in time to see his feet disappear  not a cheer was given for our success when all was over the men stood gazing at each other stern frowning and yet with the aspects of those who felt they had been in a manner disgraced by the circumstances which led them to the necessity of thus regaining the command of their own vessel as for myself i ran and sprang upon the taffrail to look into the ships wake a painful sight met me there during the minute or two passed in the brief struggle the crisis had gone steadily ahead like the earth moving in its orbit indifferent to the struggles of the nations that are contending on its bosom i could see heads and arms tossing in our track for a hundred fathoms those who could not swim struggling to the last to preserve their existence  marble smudge and neb were all looking in the same direction at that instant under an impulse i could not control i ventured to suggest that we might yet tack and save several of the wretches  let them drown and be dd was the chiefmates sententious answer  nonomasser mile neb ventured to add with a remonstrating shake of the headdat will nebber dono good ebber come of injin if you dont drown him he sartain drown you  i saw it was idle to remonstrate and by this time one dark spot after another began to disappear as the victims sank in the ocean as for smudge his eye was riveted on the struggling forms of his followers in a manner to show that traces of human feeling are to be found in some aspect or other in every condition of life i thought i could detect workings of the countenance of this being indurated as his heart had become by a long life of savage ferocity which denoted how keenly he felt the sudden destruction that had alighted on his tribe he might have had sons and grandsons among those struggling wretches on whom he was now gazing for the last time if so his selfcommand was almost miraculous for while i could see that he felt and felt intensely not a sign of weakness escaped him as the last head sunk from view i could see him shudder a suppressed groan escaped him then he turned his face towards the bulwarks and stood immovable as one of the pines of his own forests for a long time i asked marbles permission to release the old mans arms and the mate granted it though not without growling a few curses on him and on all who had been concerned in the late occurrences on board the ship  there was too much duty to be done to render all secure to suffer us to waste much time in mere sympathy all the topmast rigging backstays c had to be set up afresh and gangs were sent about this duty forward and aft the blood was washed from the decks and a portion of the crew got along the topgallantmasts and pointed them the topsails were all closereefed the courses hauled up the spanker and jib taken in and the ship hoveto it wanted but two hours of sunset when mr marble had got things to his mind we had crossed royalyards and had everything set that would draw from the trucks down the launch was in the water towing astern the ship was then about a mile from the southern passage into the bay towards which she was steering with the wind very much as it had been since an hour after sunrise though slightly falling our guns were loose and the crew was at quarters even i did not know what the new captain intended to do for he had given his orders in the manner of one whose mind was too immovably made up to admit of consultation the larboard battery was manned and orders had been given to see the guns on that side levelled and ready for firing as the ship brushed past the island in entering the bay the whole of this broadside was delivered in among its bushes and trees we heard a few yells in reply that satisfied us the grape had told and that marble had not miscalculated the position of some of his enemies at least  when the ship entered the little bay it was with a moderate and steady movement the breeze being greatly broken by the forests the mainyard was thrown aback and i was ordered into the launch with its crew armed a swivel was in the bows of the boat and i pulled into the creek in order to ascertain if there were any signs of the savages in entering the creek the swivel was discharged according to orders and we soon detected proofs that we disturbed a bivouac i now kept loading and firing this little piece into the bushes supporting it with occasional volleys of musketry until pretty well satisfied that we had swept the shore effectually  at the bivouac i found the canoes and our own yawl and what was some little revenge for what had happened i also found a pile of no less than six hundred skins which had doubtless been brought to trade with us if necessary in order to blindour eyes until the favourable moment for the execution of the conspiracy should offer i made no scruple about confiscating these skins which were taken on board the ship  i next went to the island on which i found one man dying with a grapeshot wound and evidence that a considerable party had left it as soon as they felt our fire this party had probably gone outside the island but it was getting too late to follow on my return i met the ship coming out captain marble being determined not to trust her inside another night the wind was getting light and the tides running fiercely in that high latitude we were glad to make an offing again while there was still day the success with the skins greatly mollified the new captain who declared to me that after he had hanged smudge in sight of his own shores he should feel something like himself again  we passed the night under our topsails standing off and on with the wind steady but light at the southward next morning the duty of the ship went on as usual until the men had breakfasted when we stood again into the bay  this time we hoveto so as to get one of the buoys when we dropped the stream leaving the topsails set we then hove up the anchor securing the range of cable that was bent to it both of the anchors and their ranges of cable were thus recovered the ends of the last being entered at the hawseholes and the pieces spliced this work may have occupied us four hours after which the streamanchor was hove up catted and fished marble then ordered a whip rove at the foreyardarm  i was on the quarterdeck when this command was suddenly given i wished to remonstrate for i had some tolerably accurate notions of legality and the rights of persons  still i did not like to say anything for captain marbles eye and manner were not the least in the trifling mood at that instant the whip was soon rove and the men stood looking aft in silent expectation  take that murdering blackguard forward fasten his arms behind his back place him on the third gun and wait for orders added our new captain sternly  no one dared hesitate about obeying these orders though i could see that one or two of the lads disliked the business  surely i ventured to say in a low voice you are not in earnest mr marble  captain marble if you please mr wallingford i am now master of this vessel and you are her chiefmate i intend to hang your friend smudge as an example to the rest of the coast these woods are full of eyes at this moment and the sight theyll presently see will do more good than forty missionaries and threescore and ten years of preaching set the fellow up on the gun men as i ordered this is the way to generalize with an indian  in a moment there stood the hapless wretch looking about him with an expression that denoted the consciousness of danger though it was not possible he could comprehend the precise mode of his execution i went to him and pressed his hand pointing upward as much as to say his whole trust was now in the great spirit the indian understood me for from that instant he assumed an air of dignified composure like one every way prepared to meet his fate it is not probable with his habits that he saw any peculiar hardship in his own case for he had doubtless sacrificed many a prisoner under circumstances of less exasperation than that which his own conduct had provoked  let two of the niggers take a turn with the end of the whip round the chaps neck said marble too dignified to turn jack ketch in person and unwilling to set any of the white seamen at so ungracious an office the cook joe and another black soon performed this revolting duty from the odium of which a sailor seldom altogether escapes  i now perceived smudge looking upward seeming to comprehend the nature of the fate that awaited him the deeplyseated principle within him caused a dark shadow to pass over a countenance already so gloomy and wrinkled by suffering and exposure and he turned his look wistfully towards marble at whose command each order in succession had been obeyed our new captain caught that gaze and i was for a single moment in hope he would relent and let the wretch go but marble had persuaded himself he was performing a great act of nautical justice nor was he aware himself how much he was influenced by a feeling allied to vengeance  sway away he called out and smudge was dangling at the yardarm in a few seconds  a block of wood could not have been more motionless than the body of this savage after one quivering shudder of suffering had escaped it there it hung like a jewelblock and every sign of life was soon taken away in a quarter of an hour a man was sent up and cutting the rope the body fell with a sharp plunge into the water and disappeared  at a later day the account of this affair found its way into the newspapers at home a few moralists endeavoured to throw some doubts over the legality and necessity of the proceedings pretending that more evil than good was done to the cause of sacred justice by such disregard of law and principles but the feeling of trade and the security of ships when far from home were motives too powerful to be put down by the still quiet remonstrances of reason and right  the abuses to which such practices would be likely to lead in cases in which one of the parties constituted himself the law the judge and the executioner were urged in vain against the active and everstimulating incentive of a love of gold still i knew that marble wished the thing undone when it was too late it being idle to think of quieting the suggestions of that monitor god has implanted within us by the meretricious and selfish approbation of those who judge of right and wrong by their own narrow standard of interest    chapter xv    1st lordthroca movonsas cargo cargo

life for want of language   alls well that ends well   the crisis was tacked as soon as the body of smudge was cut down and she moved slowly her crew maintaining a melancholy silence out of the little haven i never witnessed stronger evidence of sadness in the evolutions of a vessel the slow and stately departure resembling that of mourners leaving the grave on which they had just heard the fall of the clod marble told me afterwards he had been disposed to anchor and remain until the body of poor captain williams should rise as it probably would within the next fortyeight hours but the dread of a necessity of sacrificing more of the natives induced him to quit the fatal spot without paying the last duties to our worthy old commander  i always regretted we did not remain for i think no indian would have come near us had we continued in the harbour a month  it was highnoon when the ship once more issued into the broad bosom of the pacific the wind was at southeast and as we drew off from the land it came fresh and steady about two having an offing of ten or twelve miles orders were issued to set all the larboard studdingsails and we stood to the southward and westward under a press of canvass every one saw in this change a determination to quit the coast nor did we regret the measure for our trade had been quite successful down to the moment of the seizure but could hardly be prosperous after what had passed  i had not been consulted in the affair at all but the secondmate having the watch i was now summoned to the cabin and let into the secret of our future movements i found marble seated at the cabin table with captain williamss writingdesk open before him and sundry papers under examination  take a seat mr wallingford said the new master with a dignity and manner suited to the occasion i have just been overhauling the old mans instructions from the owners and find i have done right in leaving these hanggallows rascals to themselves and shaping our course to the next point of destination as it is the ship has done surprisingly well there are 67370 good spaniards down in the run and that for goods which i see are invoiced at just 26240 and when you consider that no duties portcharges or commissions are to be deducted but that the dollars under our feet are all our own without any drawbacks i call the operation a good one then that blundering through the straits though it must never be talked of in any other light than a bold push for a quick passage did us a wonderful deal of good shoving us ahead near a month in time it has put us so much ahead of our calculations indeed that i would cruise for frenchmen for five or six weeks were there the least probability that one of the chaps was to the westward of the horn such not being the fact however and there still being a very long road before us i have thought it best to push for the next point of destination  read that page of the owners idees mr wallingford and you will get their advice for just such a situation as that in which we find ourselves  the passage pointed out by captain marble was somewhat parenthetical and was simply intended to aid captain williams in the event of his not being able to accomplish the other objects of his voyage it had a place in the instructions indeed solely on account of a suggestion of marbles himself the project being one of those favourite schemes of the mate that men sometimes maintain through thick or thin until they get to be ruling thoughts on captain williams it had not weighed a feather his intention having been to proceed to the sandwich islands for sandalwood which was the course then usually pursued by northwest traders after quitting the coast the parenthetical project however was to touch at the last island procure a few divers and proceed in quest of certain islands where it was supposed the pearl fishery would succeed our ship was altogether too large and every way too expensive to be risked in such an adventure and so i told the exmate without any scruple but this fishery was a fixed idea a quick road to wealth in the new captains mind and finding it in the instructions though simply as a contingent course he was inclined to regard it as the great object of the voyage such it was in his eyes and such it ought to be as he imagined in those of the owners  marble had excellent qualities in his way but he was not fit to command a ship no man could stow her better fit her better sail her better take better care of her in heavy weather or navigate her better and yet he wanted the judgment necessary to manage the property that must be committed to his care and he had no more ideas of commercial thrift than if he had never been employed in any of the concerns of commerce this was in truth the reason he had never risen any higher in his profession the mercantile instinctone of the liveliest and most acute to be found in natural historyforewarning his different owners that he was already in the berth nature and art had best qualified him to fill it is wonderful how acute even dull men get to be on the subject of money  i own my judgment such as it was at nineteen was opposed to the opinion of the captain i could see that the contingency contemplated by the instructions had not arisen and that we should be acting more in conformity with the wishes of the owners by proceeding to the sandwich islands in quest of sandalwood and thence to china after a cargo of teas marble was not to be convinced however though i think my arguments shook him a little what might have been the result it is difficult to say had not chance befriended the views of each of us respectively it is proper to add that marble availed himself of this opportunity to promote talcott who was brought into the cabin as thirdmate  i rejoiced greatly in this addition to our little circle on the quarterdeck talcott being a man of education much nearer my own age than the two others and united to me by unusual ties since our common adventure in the prize  i was not only rejoiced to be able to associate with him but to hear him called mr talcott  we had a long but mild passage to the sandwich islands  this group occupied a very different place in the opinions of the world in the year 1800 from that it fills today still it had made some small advances in civilization since the time of cook i am told there are churches taverns billiardtables and stone dwellings in these islands now which are fast turning to the christian religion and obtaining the medley of convenience security vice roguery law and comfort that is known as civilization it was far different then our reception being by men who were but a small degree removed from savages among those who first came on board us however was the master of an american brig belonging to boston whose vessel had got on a reef and bilged he intended to remain by the wreck but wished to dispose of a considerable amount of sandalwood that was still in his vessel and for the safety of which he was under great concern as the first gale of wind might scatter it to the winds of the ocean if he could obtain a fresh stock of goods to trade on he proposed remaining on the islands until another vessel belonging to the same owners which was expected in a few months should arrive on board which vessel he intended to embark with everything he could save from the wreck and such wood as he could purchase in the interim  captain marble rubbed his hands with delight when he returned from a visit to the wreck his arrangements all completed  luck is with us master miles he said and well be off for them pearl fisheries next week i have bought all the sandalwood in the wreck paying in trumpery and at prices only about double indian trade and we will heave up and carry the ship round to the wreck and begin to take in this afternoon there is capital holdingground inside the reef and the ship can be safely carried within a hundred fathoms of her cargo  all turned out as marble had hoped and predicted and the crisis was back at her anchorage in front of the village which is now the city of honolulu within the week named  we got our supply of hogs and having procured four of the best divers going we sailed in quest of captain marbles eldorado of pearls i was less opposed to the scheme than i had been for we were now so much in advance of our time that we could afford to pass a few weeks among the islands previously to sailing for china our course was to the southwest crossing the line in about 170° west longitude  there was a clear sea for more than a fortnight while we were near the equator the ship making but little progress glad enough was i to hear the order given to turn more to the northward again for the heat was oppressive and this was inclining towards our route to china  we had been out from owyhee as it was then usual to call the island where cook was killedhawaii as it is called todaywe had been out from this island about a month when marble came up to me one fine moonlight evening in my watch rubbing his hands as was his custom when in good humour and broke out as follows  ill tell you what miles he said you and i have been salted down by providence for something more than common just look back at all our adventures in the last three years and see what they come to firstly there was shipwreck over here on the coast of madagascar jerking his thumb over a shoulder in a manner that was intended to indicate about two hundred degrees of longitude that being somewhat near our present distance from the place he mentioned in an air line then followed the boat business under the isle of bourbon and the affair with the privateer off guadaloupe well as if that wernt enough we ship together again in this vessel and a time we had of it with the french letterofmarque after that a devil of a passage we made of it through the straits of magellan then came the melancholy loss of captain williams and all that business after which we got the sandalwood out of the wreck which i consider the luckiest transaction of all  i hope you dont set down the loss of captain williams among our luck sir  not i but the stuff is all logged together you know and in overhauling for one idee in such a mess a fellow is apt to get hold of another as i was saying we have been amazingly lucky and i expect nothing else but we shall discover an island yet  can that be of any great service to us there are so many owners ready to start up and claim such discoveries that i question if it would do us any great benefit  let them start upwho cares for them well have the christening and thats half the battle marble land wallingford bay talcott hills and cape crisis would look well on a chartha miles  i have no objection to see it sir  land ho cried the lookout on the forecastle  there it is now by george cried marble springing forwardi overhauled the chart half an hour since and there ought to be nothing within six hundred miles of us  there it was sure enough and much nearer to us than was at all desirable so near indeed that the wash of the breakers on the reef that so generally lies off from the low coral islands of the pacific was distinctly audible from the ship the moon gave a strong light it is true and the night was soft and balmy but the air which was very light blew directly towards this reef and then there were always currents to apprehend we sounded but got no bottom  ay this is one of your coral reefs where a man goes on the rocks from off soundings at a single jump muttered marble ordering the ship brought by the wind on the best tack to haul off shore no notice and a wreck as for anchoring in such a place a fellow might as well run a line out to japan and could an anchor find the bottom the cable would have some such berth as a man who slept in a hammock filled with open razors  all this was true enough and we watched the effect of our change of course with the greatest anxiety all hands were called and the men were stationed in readiness to work the ship but a few minutes satisfied us the hope of clawing off in so light an air was to the last degree vain  the vessel set in fast towards the reef the breakers on which now became apparent even by the light of the moon the certain sign they were fearfully near  this was one of those moments in which marble could show himself to be a true man he was perfectly calm and selfpossessed and stood on the taffrail giving his orders with a distinctness and precision i had never seen surpassed i was kept in the chains myself to watch the casts of the lead no bottom however was the neverfailing report nor was any bottom expected it being known that these reefs were quite perpendicular on their seaward side the captain called out to me from time to time to be active and vigilant as our set inshore was uncontrollable and the boats if in the water as the launch could not be for twenty minutes would be altogether useless i proposed to lower the yawl and to pull to leeward to try the soundings in order to ascertain if it were not possible to find bottom at some point short of the reef on which we should hopelessly be set unless checked by some such means in the course of the next fifteen or twenty minutes  do it at once sir cried marble the thought is a good one and does you credit mr wallingford  i left the ship in less than five minutes and pulled off under the ships leebow knowing that tacking or waring would be out of the question under the circumstances i stood up in the sternsheets and made constant casts with the handlead with a short line however as the boat went foaming through the water the reef was now plainly in sight and i could see as well as hear the long formidable groundswells of the pacific while fetching up against these solid barriers they rolled over broke and went beyond the rocks in angry froth at this perilous instant when i would not have given the poorest acre of clawbonny to have been the owner of the crisis i saw a spot to leeward that was comparatively still or in which the water did not break it was not fifty fathoms from me when first discovered and towards it i steered animating the men to redoubled exertions we were in this narrow belt of smooth water as it might be in an instant and the current sucked the boat through it so fast as to allow time to make but a single cast of the lead i got bottom but it was in six fathoms  the boat was turned and headed out again as if life and death depended on the result the ship was fortunately within sound of the voice steering still by the wind though setting three feet towards the reef for one made in the desired direction and i hailed  what now mr wallingford demanded marble as calmly as if anchored near a wharf at home  do you see the boat sir  quite plainlygod knows you are near enough to be seen  has the ship steerageway on her captain marble  just that and nothing more to boast of  then ask no questions but try to follow the boat it is the only hope and it may succeed  i got no answer but i heard the deep authoritative voice of marble ordering the helm up and the men to man the weatherbraces i could scarcely breathe while i stood looking at the ships bows as they fell off and noted her slow progress ahead her speed increased sensibly however and i kept the boat far enough to windward to give the vessel room fairly to enter the pass at the proper moment we moved towards the inlet the crisis keeping more and more away in order to follow i was soon in the pass itself the water breaking within ten fathoms on each side of me sending portions of its foam to the very blades of our oars but the lead still gave me six fathoms  at the next cast i got ten and then the shin was at the point where i had just before found six two breakers were roaring behind me and i pulled round and waited for the ship steering to the southward sounding as i went i could see that the ship hauled up and that i was already behind the reef straining my voice i now called out  anchor sirbear a hand and anchor as soon as possible  not a word came back but up went the courses followed by the topgallantsails after which down went the jib  i heard the fore and maintopsailhalyards overhauling themselves spite of the roar of the breakers and then the ship luffed into the wind glad enough was i to hear the heavy plunge of one of the bowers as it fell from the cathead into the water even then i remained stationary to note the result the ship took her scope of cable freely after which i observed that she was brought up the next moment i was on board her  a close shave mr wallingford said marble giving me a squeeze of the hand that said more for his feelings than any words such a being could utter and many thanks for your piloting is not that land i see away here to leewardmore to the westward boy  it is sir beyond a doubt it must be one of the coral islands and this is the reef that usually lies to seaward from them there is the appearance of trees ashore  its a discovery youngster and will make us all great names remember this passage i call miless inlet and to the reef i give the name of yawl reef  i could not smile at this touch of marbles vanity for concern left me no thoughts but for the ship the weather was now mild and the bay smooth the night was fine and it might be of the last importance to us to know something more of our situation the cable might chafe off probably would so near a coral reef and i offered to pull in towards the land sounding as i went and otherwise gaining the knowledge that might be necessary to our security after a little reflection the captain consented ordering me to take provisions and water in the boat as the duty might detain me until morning  i found the bay between the reef and the island about a league in breadth and across its entire width the soundings did not vary much from ten fathoms the outer barrier of rock on which the sea broke appeared to be an advanced wall that the indefatigable little insects had erected as it might be in defence of their island which had probably been raised from the depths of the ocean a century or two ago by some of their own ancestors the gigantic works completed by these little aquatic animals are well known to navigators and give us some tolerably accurate notions of the manner in which the face of the globe has been made to undergo some of its alterations i found the land easy of access low wooded and without any sign of habitation the night was so fine that i ventured inland and after walking more than a mile most of the distance in a grove of cocoa and bananas i came to the basin of water that is usually found in the islands of this particular formation  the inlet from the sea was at no great distance and i sent one of the men back to the yawl with orders for the boat to proceed thither i next sounded the inlet and the bay and found everywhere a sandy bottom and about ten fathoms of water as i expected the shoalest spot was the inlet but in this which i sounded thoroughly there was nowhere less than five it was now midnight and i should have remained on the island until morning to make further surveys by daylight had we not seen the ship under her canvass and so much nearer to us than we had supposed possible as to satisfy me she was drifting in fast towards the land of course i did not hesitate but pulled on board   it was as i suspected the rocks so near the reef had chafed off the cable the ship struck adrift and marble was under his canvass waiting my return in order to ascertain where he might anchor anew i told him of the lagoon in the centre of the island and gave him every assurance of there being water enough to carry in any craft that floats  my reputation was up in consequence of the manner the ship had been taken through the first inlet and i was ordered to conn her into this new haven   the task was not difficult the lightness of the wind and uncertainty about the currents proving the only source of embarrassment i succeeded in finding the passage after a short trial and sending the boat ahead under talcott as an additional precaution soon had the crisis floating in the very centre of this natural dock sail was shortened as we came in and the ship made a flying moor after which we lay as securely at if actually in some basin wrought by art it is my opinion the vessel would have ridden out the hardest gale or anything short of a hurricane at single anchor in that place the sense of security was now so strong upon us that we rolled up our canvass set an anchor watch of only one man and turned in  i never laid my head down on board ship with greater satisfaction than i did that night let the truth be frankly stated i was perfectly satisfied with myself it was owing to my decision and vigilance that the ship was saved when outside the reef out of all question and i think she would have been lost after she struck adrift had i not discovered her present berth there she was however with land virtually all round her a good bottom plenty of water and well moored as i have said already she could not be better secured in an artificial dock in the midst of the pacific away from all customhouse officers in a recently discovered and uninhabited island there was nothing to fear  men sleep soundly in such circumstances and i should have been in a deep slumber in a minute after i was in my berth had not marbles conversation kept me awake quite unwillingly on my part for five minutes his stateroom door was open and through it the following discourse was held  i think on the whole commenced the captain it will be better to generalize a little morethis was a favourite expression of the exmates and one he often used without exactly knowing its application himselfyes to generalize a little more it shall be marble land wallingford bay yawl reef talcott inlet miless anchorageand a dd bad anchorage it was miles but never mind we must take the good with the bad in this wicked world  very true sir but as for taking that anchorage you must excuse me as i shall never take it again  perhaps not well this is what i call comfortha  talcottis talcott asleep miles  he and the secondmate are hard at it sirfull and by and going ten knots i muttered wishing my tormentor in japan at the moment  ay they are rackers at a sleep i say miles such a discovery as this will make a mans fortune the world generalizes in discoveries altogether making no great matter of distinction between your columbuses cooks or marbles  an island is an island and he who first discovers it has the credit poor captain williams he would have sailed this ship for a whole generation and never found anything in the way of novelty  except the straits i muttered very indistinctly breathing deep and hard  ay that was an affair hadnt you and i been aboard the ship never would have done that we are the very offspring of luck there was the affair of the wreck off madagascarthere are bloody currents in the pacific too i find miles  yes sirhardaweather  the fellows dreaming one word boy before you cut loose from all reason and reflection dont you think it would be a capital idea to poke in a little patriotism among the names patriotism goes so far in our part of the world  congress rocks would be a good title for the highest part of the reef and washington sands would do for the landing you told me of washington should have a finger in the pie  crust isnt down sir  the fellows off and i may as well follow though it is not easy to sleep on the honour of a discovery like this  good night miles  ay ay sir  such was the account marble afterwards gave me of the termination of the dialogue sleep sleep sleep never did men enjoy their rest more than we did for the next five hours the ship being as silent as a church on a weekday during the whole time for myself i can safely say i heard nothing or knew nothing until i was awakened by a violent shake of the shoulder supposing myself to have been aroused for an ordinary watch at sea i was erect in an instant and found the suns rays streaming into my face through the cabinwindows this prevented me for a moment from seeing that i had been disturbed by captain marble himself the latter waited until he perceived i could understand him and then he said in a grave meaning manner  miles there is a mutiny in the ship do you understand me mr wallingforda bloody mutiny  a mutiny captain marble you confound me siri had thought our people perfectly satisfied  umph one never knows whether the copper will come up head or tail i thought when i turned in last night it was to take the surest nap i ever tasted afloat and here i awake and find a mutiny  i was on my feet and dressing in an instant as a matter of course having first gone to the berths of the two other mates and given each a call  but how do you know this captain marble i resumed as soon as there was a chance i hear no disturbance and the ship is just where we left her glancing through the cabinwindows i think you must be mistaken sir  not i i turned out ten minutes since and was about to go on deck to get a look at your basin and breathe the fresh air when i found the companiondoors fastened precisely smudgefashion i suppose you will allow that no regular ships company would dare to fasten the officers below unless they intended to seize the craft  this is very extraordinary perhaps some accident has befallen the doors did you call out sir  i thumped like an admiral but got no answer when on the point of trying the virtue of a few kicks i overheard a low laugh on deck and that let me into the secret of the state of the nation at once i suppose you will all admit gentlemen when sailors laugh at their officers as well as batten them down that they must be somewhat near a state of mutiny  it does look so indeed sir we had better arm the moment we are dressed captain marble  i have done that already and you will each find loaded pistols in my stateroom  in two minutes from that moment all four of us were in a state for action each man armed with a brace of ships pistols wellloaded and freshly primed marble was for making a rush at the cabindoors at once but i suggested the improbability of the steward or nebs being engaged in any plot against the officers and thought it might be well to ascertain what had become of the two blacks before we commenced operations talcott proceeded instantly to the steerage where the steward slept and returned in a moment to report that he had found him sound asleep in his berth  reinforced by this man captain marble determined to make his first demonstration by way of the forecastle where by acting with caution a surprise on the mutineers might be effected it will be remembered that a door communicated with the forecastle the fastenings of which were on the side of twixt decks most of the cargo being in the lower hold there was no difficulty in making our way to this door where we stopped and listened in order to learn the state of things on the other side of the bulkhead marble had whispered to me as we groped our way along in the sort of twilight which pervaded the place the hatches being on and secured that them bloody philadelphians must be at the bottom of the mischief as our old crew were a set of as peaceable welldisposed chaps as ever eat duff dough out of a kid  the result of the listening was to produce a general surprise  out of all question snoring and that on no small scale of the gamut of morpheus was unequivocally heard  marble instantly opened the door and we entered the forecastle pistols in hand every berth had its tenant and all hands were asleep fatigue and the habit of waiting for calls had evidently kept each of the seamen in his berth until that instant contrary to usage in so warm a climate the scuttle was on and a trial soon told us it was fast  to generalize on this idee miles exclaimed the captain i should say we are again battened down by savages  it does indeed look so sir and yet i saw no sign of the islands being inhabited it may be well captain marble to muster the crew that we may learn whos who  quite rightdo you turn em up and send em all aft into the cabin where we have more daylight  i set about awaking the people which was not difficult and in a few minutes everybody was sent aft following the crew it was soon found that only one man was missing and he was the very individual whom we had left on deck when we had all gone below on securing the ship every soul belonging to the vessel was present in the cabin or steerage but this solitary manphiladelphians and all  it can never be that harris has dared to trifle with us said talcott and yet it does look surprisingly like it  quite sure miles that marble land is an uninhabited island said the captain interrogatively  i can only say sir that it is as much like all the other uninhabited coral islands we have passed as one pea is like another and that there were no signs of a living being visible last night it is true we saw but little of the island though to all appearances there was not much to see  unluckily all the mens arms are on deck in the armchest or strapped to the boom or masts there is no use however in dillydallying against one man so i will make a rumpus that will soon bring the chap to his bearings  hereupon marble made what he called a rumpus in good earnest i thought for a minute he would kick the cabindoors down  andzomeleeandzomelee said some one on deck  vat for you make so much kick  who the devil are you demanded marble kicking harder than ever open the cabindoors or ill kick them down and yourself overboard  monsieursair rejoined another voice tenezyou air prisonnier comprenezvousprisonair eh  these are frenchmen captain marble i exclaimed and we are in the hands of the enemy  this was astounding intelligence so much so that all had difficulty in believing it a further parley however destroyed our hopes little by little until we entered into an arrangement with those on deck to the following effect i was to be permitted to go out in order to ascertain the real facts of our situation while marble and the remainder of the crew were to remain below passive until the result should be reported under this arrangement one of the cabindoors was opened and i sallied forth  astonishment almost deprived me of the power of vision when i looked around me quite fifty armed white men sailors and natives of france by their air and language crowded round me as curious to see me as i could possibly be to see them in their midst was harris who approached me with an embarrassed and sorrowful air  i know i deserve death mr wallingford this man commenced but i fell asleep after so much work and everything looking so safe and outofharmsway like and when i woke up i found these people on hoard and in possession of the ship  in the name of wonder whence come they harris is there a french ship at the island  by all i can learn and see sir they are the crew of a wrecked letterofmarquean indiaman of some sort or other and finding a good occasion to get off the island and make a rich prize they have helped themselves to the poor crisisgod bless her say i though she is now under the french flag i suppose  i looked up at the gaff and sure enough there was flying the tricolor    chapter xvi    the morning air blows fresh on him   the waves dance gladly in his sight   the seabirds call and wheel and skim   o blessed morning light   he doth not hear their joyous call he sees    no beauty in the wave nor feels the breeze   dana   truth is truly often stranger than fiction the history of the circumstances that brought us into the hands of our enemies will fully show this la pauline was a ship of six hundred tons that carried lettersofmarque from the french government she sailed from france a few weeks after we had left london bound on a voyage somewhat similar to our own though neither seaotter skins sandalwood nor pearls formed any part of her contemplated bargains her first destination was the french islands off madagascar where she left part of her cargo and took in a few valuables in return thence she proceeded to the philippine islands passing in the track of english and american traders capturing two of the former and sinking them after taking out such portions of cargo as suited her own views from manilla la pauline shaped her course for the coast of south america intending to leave certain articles brought from france others purchased at bourbon the isle of france and the philippines and divers bales and boxes found in the holds of her prizes in that quarter of the world in exchange for the precious metals in effecting all this monsieur le compte her commander relied firstly on the uncommon sailing of his ship secondly on his own uncommon boldness and dexterity and thirdly on the wellknown disposition of the south americans to smuggle doubloons and dollars taking up but little room he reserved most of the interior of his vessel after his traffic on the main for such property as might be found in the six or eight prizes he calculated with certainty on making after getting to the eastward of the horn all these wellgrounded anticipations had been signally realized down to a period of just three months to a day prior to our own arrival at this unhappy island  on the night of the day just mentioned la pauline without the smallest notice of the vicinity of any danger running in an easy bowline and without much sea had brought up on another part of the very reef from which we had made so narrow an escape the rocks being coral there was little hope for her and in fact they appeared through her bottom within two hours after she struck the sugars taken in at the isle of france as a ground tier of ballast were soon rendered of doubtful value as a matter of course but the weather remaining pleasant captain le compte succeeded by means of his boats in getting everything else of value on the island and forthwith set about breaking up the wreck in order to construct a craft that might carry himself and his people to some civilized land having plenty of tools and something like sixty men great progress had been made in the work a schooner of about ninety tons being then so far completed as to be nearly ready to be put in the water  such was the state of things when one fine night we arrived in the manner already related the french kept constant lookouts and it seems we were seen a distant speck on the ocean just as the sun set while the low trees of the island eluded our vigilance by the aid of a good nightglass our movements were watched and a boat was about to be sent out to warn us of our danger when we passed within the reef captain le compte knew the chances were twenty to one that we were an enemy and he chose to lie concealed to watch the result as soon as we had anchored within the basin and silence prevailed in the ship he manned his own gig and pulled with muffled oars up under our bows to reconnoitre finding everything quiet he ventured into the forechains and thence on deck accompanied by three of his men he found harris snoring with his back supported against a guncarriage and immediately secured him then it only remained to close the forescuttle and the cabindoors and to fasten them to have us all prisoners below the boat was sent for more men and hours before any of us in the berths were awake the ship had effectually changed masters harris told our story and the captors knew our whole history from the day of sailing down to the present time  much of this i learned in subsequent conversations with the french but enough of it was related to me then to let me understand the outlines of the truth my eyes also let me into many secrets i found the island by daylight substantially as i had supposed it to be it was not so large however as it had seemed to me by the aid of the moon though its general character was the same the basin in which the ship lay might have covered a hundred and fifty acres in extent the belt of land which encircled it varying in breadth from a quarter of a mile to three miles  most of the island was an open grove lying at an elevation of from ten to thirty feet above the ocean and we ascertained there were several springs of the sweetest water on it nature by one of its secret processes had covered the earth with a beautiful short grass and the french with their usual attention to the table and their commendable activity had already several materials for salads c in full growth stringbeans might be had for asking and petits pois were literally a drug i saw the tents of the french extending in a line beneath the shades of the trees and there was la petite pauline the schooner on her ways actually undergoing the process of receiving her first coat of paint as for la pauline herself i could just discover her lower mastheads inclining at an angle of fortyfive degrees from the perpendicular through a vista in the trees  there was a goodhumoured common sense in all the proceedings of mons le compte that showed he was a philosopher in the best sense of the word he took things without repining himself and wished to make others as happy as circumstances would allow at his suggestion i invited marble on deck and after making my own commander acquainted with the state of the facts we both listened to the propositions of our captor mons le compte all his officers and not a few of his men had been prisoners some time or other in england and there was no difficulty in carrying on the negotiations in our mother tongue  votre bâtimentyour sheep shall become frenchbien entenducommenced our captorvid her cargaisonrig and tout cela bien cest convenu i shall not exact rigueur in mes conditions if you shall have possible to take your sheep from nous autres françaisdaccord every man for himself et sa nation zere is the pavillion françaisand zere it shall fly so long as we shall not helpmaisparole dhonneur ze prize come cheep and shall be sell very dearentendez vous  bien now sair i shall put you and all your peepl on ze island vere you shall take our place while we take your place  ze arm shall be in our hand while ze sheep stay but we leave you fusils poudre et tout cela behind  this was nearly verbatim the programme of capitulation as laid down by captain le compte as for marble it was not in his nature to acquiesce in such an arrangement without much cavilling and contention but cui bono we were in mons le comptes hands and though disposed to deal very handsomely by us it was easy enough to see he was determined to make his own conditions i succeeded at last in making marble understand that resistance was useless and he submitted though with some such grace as a man who has not been mesmerized submits to an amputationthose who have are said rather to delight in the amusement  the terms of the capitulationand they differed but little from surrendering at discretionwere no sooner agreed to than our people were ordered into the forecastle whence they were transferred to the boats in readiness to be sent ashore all the chests and private effects were moved out in the most honourable manner and sent into la paulines boats which lay prepared to receive them as for us officers we were put in the gig neb and the cabin steward being charged with the duty of looking after our private property when everybody the blacks excepted was in a boat we shoved off and proceeded towards the landing as chopfallen and melancholy a party as ever took possession of a newlydiscovered country marble affected to whistle for he was secretly furious at the nonchalance manifested by captain le compte but i detected him in getting parts of monny musk and the irish washerwoman into the same strain to own the truth the exmate was morally much disturbed as for myself i considered the affair as an incident of war and cared much less  voila messieurs exclaimed monsieur le compte flourishing his arm with an air of unsurpassed generosity you shall be master here so soon after we shall go away and take our leetl property wid us  hes dd generous miles growled marble in my ear hell leave us the island and the reef and the cocoanuts when he has gone off with our ship and her cargo ill bet all im worth he tows off his bloody schooner in the bargain  there is no use in complaining sir and by keeping on good terms with the french we may fare the better  the truth of this was soon apparent captain le compte invited us all to share his breakfast and we repaired to the tent of the french officers with that purpose in the mean time the french sailors were transferring the few articles they intended to carry away to the ship with the generous object of leaving their own tents to the immediate occupation of us prisoners as monsieur le comptes plan was to proceed to the spanish main in order to complete his contemplated traffic in that quarter no sooner were the tents prepared than the french began also to ship such articles of their own as it had originally been proposed to exchange for spanish dollars in the mean time we sat down to breakfast  cest la fortune de guerrevat you call fortune of war messieurs observed captain le compte whirling the stick in a vessel of chocolate in a very artistical manner all the while boncest excellenteantoin  antoin appeared in the shape of a wellsmoked coppercoloured cabinboy he was told to take a small pitcher of the chocolate with captain le comptes compliments to mademoiselle and to tell her there was now every prospect of their quitting the island in a very few days and of seeing la belle france in the course of the next four or five months this was said in french and rapidly with the vehemence of one who felt all he uttered and more too but i knew enough of the language to understand its drift  i suppose the fellow is generalizing on our misfortunes in his dd lingo growled marble but let him look outhes not home yet by many a thousand miles  i endeavoured to explain it all to marble but it was useless he insisted the frenchman was sending chocolate from his own table to his crew in order to play the magnifico on the score of his own good luck there was no use in kicking against the pricks and i let marble enjoy the pleasure of believing the worst of his captor a sort of anglosaxon propensity that has garnished many a page in english and american historyto say nothing of the propensities and histories of others among the great family of nations  when breakfast was over monsieur le compte led me aside in a walk under the trees to explain his views and intentions he gave me to understand i had been selected for this communication on account of his observing the state of mind of my captain i also comprehended a little french which was quite convenient in a conversation with one who interlarded his english so much with phrases taken from his mother tongue i was given to understand that the french would put the schooner into the water that very evening and that we should find her masts rigging and sails all fitted for her with activity she could be ready to quit the island in a fortnight at the farthest a portion of our own provisions would be landed as better suited to our habits than those which had been taken from la pauline while a portion of the last would be transferred to the crisis for the same reason as applied to the french as for watercasks c they were all arranged everything of the sort having been taken from the wreck with little or no difficulty immediately after the loss of the ship in a word we should have little more to do than to step the masts rig our craft stow her hold and proceed at once to the nearest friendly port  i zink you shall go to canton added monsieur le compte ze distance shall not be much more than to sout america and zere you shall find plenty of your compatriotes of course you can sleep and go chez vousvat you call home with toute la facilité ouicet arrangement est admirable so the arrangement might appear to him though i confess to a decided preference to remaining in the blind crisis as our men had got to call her after her blundering through the straits of magellan allons exclaimed the french captain suddenly we are near ze tent of mademoisellewe shall go and demand how she carry herself ce beau matin on looking up i saw two small tents within fifty yards of us they were beautifully placed in the midst of a thicker portion of the grove than usual and near a spring of the most exquisitely limpid water i ever beheld these tents were made of new canvass and had been fashioned with care and skill i could see that the one we first approached was carpeted over and that it had many of the appliances of a comfortable abode mons le compte who was really a goodlooking fellow under forty put on his most amiable appearance as he got near the canvassdoor and he hemmed once or twice as respectfully as he could by way of letting his presence be known in an instant a maidservant came out to receive him the moment i laid eyes on this woman it struck me her face was familiar though i could not recall the place or time where or when we had before met the occurrence was so singular that i was still ruminating on it when i unexpectedly found myself standing in the tent face to face with emily merton and her father  we recognised each other at a glance and to mons le comptes amazement hearty greetings passed between us as old acquaintances old acquaintances however we could scarce be called but on an uninhabited island in the south seas one is glad to meet any face that he has ever met before  emily looked less blooming than when we had parted near a twelvemonth before in london but she was still pretty and pleasing both she and her father were in mourning and the mother not appearing i at once guessed the truth mrs merton was an invalid when i knew her though i had not anticipated for her so speedy a death  i thought captain le compte appeared vexed at my reception  still he did not forget his good manners and he rose saying he would leave me with my friends to make mutual explanations while he proceeded to overlook the duty of the day on taking his leave i was not pleased to see him approach and kiss emilys hand the act was done respectfully and not entirely without grace but there were a feeling and manner in it that could not well be mistaken  emily blushed as she wished him good morning and turning to look at me in spite of a kind of doginthemanger sensation i could not forbear smiling  never mr wallingford never emily said with emphasis the instant her admirer was out of hearing we are at his mercy and must keep terms with him but i can never marry a foreigner  that is poor encouragement for wallingford my dear said her father laughing should he happen to take a fancy to you himself  emily looked confused but what for the circumstances was better still she looked concerned  i am sure dear sir she answered with a quickness i thought charming i am sure mr wallingford will not suppose i meant anything so rude then he is no importunate suitor of mine like this disagreeable frenchman who always seems to me more like a turkish master than like one who really respects a woman besides  besides what miss merton i ventured to ask perceiving that she hesitated  besides americans are hardly foreigners to us added emily smiling for we have even american relatives you know father  quite true my dear and came near being americans ourselves had my father established himself where he married as had been his first intention such would have been our national character but mons le compte has given us a moment to tell our stories to each other and i think it will not be a very long moment let one of us commence if we wish the offices done without unpleasant listeners  emily urged me to begin and i did not hesitate my story was soon told major merton and his daughter understood all about the capture of the ship in the basin though they were ignorant of the vessels name i had only to relate our voyage on the main and the death of captain williams therefore to have my whole story told i made it all the shorter from an impatience to hear the circumstances which had thrown my friends into their present extraordinary position  it seems extraordinary enough beyond doubt major merton began the moment i left him an opening by my closing remark but it is all very simple when you commence at the right end of the sad story and follow events in the order in which they occurred  when you left us in london wallingford i supposed we were on the point of sailing for the west indies but a better appointment soon after offering in the east my destination was changed to bombay it was important that i should reach my port at as early a day as possible and no regular indiaman being ready i took passage in a licensed running vessel a ship of no size or force nothing occurred until we had got within three or four days sail of our port when we fell in with la pauline and were captured  at first i think captain le compte would have been willing to let me go on parole but no opportunity offered and we went with the ship to manilla while there the melancholy loss happened which no doubt you have comprehended from our mourning and i was strongly in hopes of making some arrangements that would still enable me to save my situation but by this time monsieur le compte had become an open admirer of emily and i suppose it is hopeless to expect any liberation so long as he can invent excuses to frustrate it  i trust he does not abuse his power in any way and annoy miss merton with importunities that are unpleasant to her  emily rewarded me for the warmth with which i spoke with a sweet smile and a slight blush  of that i cannot accuse him in one sense at least resumed major merton mons le compte does all for us that his sense of delicacy can suggest and it was not possible for passengers to be more comfortable or retired on board ship than we were in the pauline that vessel had a poop and its cabin was given up entirely to our use at manilla i was permitted to go at large on a mere verbal assurance of returning and in all other particulars we have been treated as well as circumstances would very well allow nevertheless emily is too young to admire a suitor of forty too english to admire a foreigner and too wellborn to accept one who is merely a merchant sailori mean one who is nothing and has nothing but what his ship makes him or can give him  i understood major mertons distinction he saw a difference between the heir of clawbonny pursuing his adventures for the love of the sea and a man who pursued the sea as an adventurer it was not very delicately made but it was pretty well as coming from an european to an american the latter being assumed ex gratia to be a being of an inferior order morally politically physically socially and in every other sense but the pecuniary thank heaven the american dollar is admitted pennyweight for pennyweight to a precedency immediately next to that of the metal dollar of europe it even goes before the paper thaler of prussia  i can readily imagine miss merton would look higher than captain le compte for various reasons i answered making a sort of acknowledgment for the distinction in my favour by bowing involuntarily and i should hope that gentleman would cease to be importunate as soon as convinced he cannot succeed  you do not know a frenchman mr wallingford rejoined emily he is the hardest creature on earth to persuade into the notion that he is not adorable  i can hardly believe that this weakness extends as far as the sailors said i laughing at all events you will be released the instant you reach france  sooner too i trust wallingford resumed the father  these frenchmen can have it their own way out here in the solitude of the pacific but once in the atlantic i shall expect some british cruiser to pick us up long ere we can reach france  this was a reasonable expectation and we conversed about it for some time i shall not repeat all that passed but the reader can have no difficulty in understanding that major merton and myself communicated to each other every fact that was likely to be of interest to men in our situation  when i thought it prudent to take my leave he walked some distance with me holding his way to a point on the outer side of the island where i could get a view of the wreck  here he left me for the moment while i proceeded along the beach ruminating on all that had passed  the process by which nature uses her materials to found islands in the midst of oceans like the pacific is a curious study the insect that forms the coral rock must be an industrious little creature as there is reason to think that some of the reefs that have become known to navigators within the last sixty or seventy years have since been converted into islands bearing trees by their labours should the work go on a part of this vast sea will yet be converted into a continent and who knows but a railroad may yet run across that portion of our globe connecting america with the old world i see that captain beechy in his voyage speaks of a wreck that occurred in 1792 on a reef where in 1826 he found an island near three leagues long bearing tall trees it would be a curious calculation to ascertain if one family of insects can make an island three leagues long in thirtyfour years how many families it would take to make the grading of the railroad i have mentioned ten years since i would not have ventured a hint of this nature for it might have set speculation in motion and been the instrument of robbing more widows and orphans of their straitened means but heaven be praised  we have at length reached a period in the history of the country when a man may venture on a speculation in the theory of geography without incurring the risk of giving birth to some wildif not unprincipledspeculation in dollars and cents  as i drew near the outer shore of the island opposite to the wreck i came unexpectedly on marble the poor fellow was seated on a raised projection of coral rock with his arms folded and was in so thorough a brown study that he did not even hear my footsteps in approaching though i purposely trod heavily in order to catch his ear unwilling to disturb him i stood gazing at the wreck myself for some little time the place affording a much better view of it than any other point from which it had met my eye the french had made far greater inroads upon their vessel than the elements she had struck to leeward of the island and lay in a spot where indeed it might take years to break her entirely up in that placid sea most of her upper works however were gone and i subsequently discovered that her own carpenters had managed to get out even a portion of her floortimbers leaving the fabric bound together by those they left her lower masts were standing but even her lower yards had been worked up in order to make something useful for the schooner the beach at no great distance was still strewed with objects brought from the reef and which it had not yet been found necessary to use  at length a movement of mine attracted marbles attention and he turned his head towards me he seemed glad i had joined him and expressed himself happy also that he saw me alone  i have been generalizing a little on our condition miles he said and look at it which end forward i may i find it bad enough almost enough to overcome me i loved that ship mr wallingford as much as some folks love their parentsof wife or children i never had any and the thought that she has fallen into the hands of a frenchman is too much for my natur had it been smudge i could have borne up against it but to haul down ones colours to a wrack and a bloody french wrack too it is superhuman  you must remember all the circumstances captain marble and you will find consolation the ship was surprised as we surprised the lady of nantes  thats just itput that on a general principle now and where are you surprisers mustnt be surprised had we set a quarterwatch sir it never could have happened and nothing less than a quarterwatch should have been set in a strange haven what mattered it that it was an uninhabited island and that the ship was landlocked and wellmoored and the holdingground was capital it is all of no account when you come to look at the affair in the way of duty why old robbins with his rivers in the ocean would never have been caught in this miserable manner  then marble fairly gave in placed his two hard hands on his face and i could see tears trickling from beneath them as if water were squeezed from a stone  the chances of the sea captain marble i said greatly shocked at such an exhibition coming from such a quarterthe chances of the sea are sometimes too much for the best sailors we should look at this loss as we look at the losses occasioned by a galethen there is some hope left after all  i should like to know whatto me there is no land ahead  surprisers may not only be surprised but they may carry on their old trade again and surprise once more in their turn  what do you mean by that miles said marble looking up eagerly and speaking as quick as lightning are you generalizing or have you any particular project in view  both sir generalizing so far as taking the chances of war are concerned and particularizing as to a certain notion that has come into my head  out with the last milesout with it boy the lord made you for something uncommon  first let me know captain marble whether you have had any further conversation with monsieur le compte  whether he has said any more on the subject of our future proceedings  i just left the grinning rascalthese amiable smiles of his miles are only so many grins thrown into our faces to let us feel his good luck but dn him if i ever get home ill fit out a privateer and be after him if theres a fastgoing schooner to be had in all america for love or money i think id turn pirate to catch the villain  alas poor marble little would he who never got higher than a mate unless by accident be likely to persuade your cautious shipowners to intrust him with a vessel of any sort to go tilting against windmills afloat in that fashion  but why go to america for a schooner captain marble when the french are polite enough to give us one here exactly where we are  i begin to understand you boy there is a little consolation in the idee but this frenchman has already got my commission and without the document we should be no better than so many pirates  i doubt that sir even were a ship to act generally provided she actually sailed with a commission and lost it by accident commissions are all registered and proof of our character could be found at home  ay for the crisis but not for this pretty pollyfor so marble translated petite paulinethe commission is only good for the vessel that is named in it  i dont know that captain marble suppose our ship had been sunk in an action in which we took our enemy could we not continue our voyage in the prize and fight anything that came in our way afterwards  by george that does look reasonable here was i just threatening to go out as a pirate yet hesitating about taking my own  do not the crews of captured vessels often rise upon their captors and recapture their own vessels and were any of them ever called pirates besides nations at war authorise almost every sort of hostile act against their enemies  miles i have been mistakenyou are a good seaman but natur meant you for a lawyer give me your hand boy i see a gleam of hope ahead and a man can live on less hope than food  marble then told me the substance of the conversation he had held with captain le compte the latter had expressed a sudden and violent impatience to be offi understood the cause in a moment he wished to separate emily from her old acquaintance as soon as possibleintending to put the schooner into the water for us that very afternoon and to sail himself in the morning this was a sudden resolution and the french were moving heaven and earth to carry it into effect i confess to some little regret at hearing it for it was pleasant to meet the mertons in that unexpected manner and the influence of woman in such a solitude is unusually great i now told marble of my discovery and when he had got through with his expressions of wonder i carried him to the tents and led him into the presence of his old acquaintances in consequence of this visit i enjoyed another half hours tête à tête with emily marble soon taking the major to walk with him beneath the trees  we were both recalled to a sense of our real situation by the reappearance of monsieur le compte i cannot say that our conqueror behaved in the least unhandsomely towards us notwithstanding his evident jealousy he had the tact to conceal most of his feelings and owing either to liberality or to art he assumed an air of generous confidence that would be much more likely to touch the feelings of the maid he sought than any acts of severity first asking permission of miss merton he even invited us and himself to dine with the major and on the whole we had an agreeable entertainment  we had turtle and champaigne and both of a quality that was then out of the reach of all the aldermen of london or new york begging pardon of the sir peters and sir johns of guildhall for putting them in any sense on a level with the gentleman from the fourth ward or the gentleman from the eleventh ward though if the truth must be told the last very often eat the best dinners and drink out of all comparison the best wines who pays is a fact buried in the arcana of aldermanic legerdemain  it was late before we left the table though monsieur le compte quitted us early   at five oclock precisely we were summoned to witness the launch champaigne and claret had brought marble into good humour nor was i at all out of spirits myself  emily put on her hat and took her parasol just as she would have done at home and accepting my arm she walked to the shipyard like all the rest of us getting her a good place for the sight i accompanied marble to take a look at the pretty poll which had not as yet attracted as much of our attention as she ought i had suggested to him the probability of an occasion offering to rise upon the frenchman while their attention was taken up with the schooner but monsieur le compte warily kept quite half his men in the ship and this put the attempt out of the question since the guns of the crisis would have swept any part of the island  the french mechanics deserved great credit for the skill they had manifested in the construction of la petite pauline she was not only a safe and commodious craft for her size but what was of great importance to us her lines promised that she would turn out to be a fast sailer i afterwards ascertained that captain le compte had been her draftsman possessing not only much taste for but a good deal of practice in the art the ship in which the mertons had taken passage to bombay had the copper for a teakbuilt frigate and sloop of war in her and this had been transferred among other articles to la pauline before the prize was burned availing himself of this circumstance monsieur le compte had actually coppered his schooner and otherwise he had made her as neat and commodious as possible i make no doubt he intended to surprise his friends at marseilles by showing what clever mariners wrecked on an island of the pacific could do on an emergency then doubtless he found it pleasant to linger on this island eating fresh cocoanuts with delicious turtle and making love to emily merton some of the charms of pretty poll were fairly to be attributed to the charms of the young lady  the men began to wedge up the moment we were all present and this portion of the labour was soon completed  monsieur le compte then took his station in the head of the schooner making a profound bow to emily as if to ask her permission the signal was given the spurshores were knocked away and the little craft slid off into the water so easily making so little ripple as she shot a hundred fathoms into the bay as to give the assurance she would prove a fast vessel just as she was waterborne le compte dashed a bottle against the tiller and shouted at the top of his voice succés à la belle emelie  i turned to emily and saw by the blush that she understood french while the manner in which she pouted her pretty plump lip betrayed the humour in which the compliment had been received  in a few minutes captain le compte landed and in a set speech he gave up the schooner to our possession we were told not to consider ourselves as prisoners our captain handsomely admitting that he had gained no laurels by his victory  we shall go away good friend he concluded mais suppose we shall meet and nos dux republique shall not be at peace then each must fight for son pavillion  this was a good concluding sentiment for such a scene  immediately after the mertons and their domestics of whom there were a man and a woman embarked i took leave of them on the beach and either my observation or my vanity induced me to think emily got into the boat with reluctance  many good wishes were exchanged and the major called out to us we shall meet again gentlementhere has been a providence in our previous intercourse adieu until then  the french were now in a great bustle most of the articles they intended to carry away were already on board the ship and by the time it was dusk they had closed their communication with the land when captain le compte took his leave of us i could not but thank him for his many civilities he had certainly dealt generously by us though i still think his sudden departure which made us fall heirs to many things we otherwise might not have so done was owing to his wish to remove emily merton as quickly as possible from my sight  at daylight next morning neb came to the officers tents to say the ship was getting her anchors i was up and dressed in a moment the distance to the inlet was about a mile and i reached it just as the crisis was cast in a few minutes she came sweeping into the narrow pass under her topsails and i saw emily and her father leaning over the hammockcloths of the quarterdeck the beautiful girl was so near that i could read the expression of her soft eyes and i fancied they were filled with gentle concern  the major called out god bless you dear wallingfordthen the ship swept past and was soon in the outer bay  half an hour later or before i left the spot she was at sea under everything that would draw from her trunks down    chapter xvii    i better brook the loss of brittle life   than those proud titles thou hast won of me   they wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh   shakespeare   halfway between this inlet and the shipyard i found marble standing with his arms folded gazing after the receding ship his countenance was no longer saddened but it was fierce he shook his hand menacingly at the french ensign which was flying at our old gaff and said  ay dn you flutter away you quiver and shake now like one of your coxcombs pigeonwinging but where will you be this day two months miles no man but a bloody frenchman would cast away a ship there where this mister count has left the bones of his vessel though here where we came so nigh going its a miracle any man could escape hadnt we brought the crisis through that opening first he never would have dared to go out by it  i confess i saw little about monsieur le comptes management but skill and good seamanship but nothing is more painful to most men than to admit the merit of those who have obtained an advantage over them marble could not forget his own defeat and the recollection jaundiced his eyes and biassed his judgment  i see our people are busy already sir i remarked by way of drawing the captains attention to some other subject  they have hauled the schooner up to the yard and seem to be getting along spars for shores  ay aytalcott has his orders and i expect you will bestir yourself i shall step the masts myself and you will get all the rigging ready to be put into its place the moment it is possible that frenchman calculated he told me to my face that we might get to sea in a fortnight i will let him see that a set of yankees can rig and stow his bloody schooner in three days and then leave themselves time to play  marble was not a man of idle vaunts he soon had everybody at work with a system order silence and activity that proved he was master of his profession nor was the language which might sound so boastful to foreign ears altogether without its justification forty americans were a formidable force and well directed i make no doubt they would accomplish far more than the ordinary run of french seamen as they were governed and managed in the year 1800 and counting them man for man would have accomplished in double the time our crew had now long acted together and frequently under the most trying circumstances and they showed their training if men ever did on the present occasion everybody was busy and we had the shears up and both masts stepped in the course of a few hours by the time the mainmast was in i had the foremast rigged the jibboom in its place the spritsail yard crossedeverything carried a spar under its bowsprit thenand the lower yard up it is true the french had got everything ready for us and when we turned the hands to after dinner we actually began to strike in cargo water provisions and such other things as it was intended to carry away at dusk when we knocked off work the emily looked like a seagoing craft and there was every prospect of our having her ready for sea by the following evening but the duty had been carried on in silence  napoleon said there had been more noise made in the little schooner which carried him from lorient to basque roads than was made on board the lineofbattle ship that conveyed him to st helena during the whole passage since that memorable day the french have learned to be silent on board ship and the fruits remain to be seen  that night marble and myself consulted together on the aspect of thingsor as he expressed it we generalized over our prospects monsieur le compte had done one thing which duty required of him he did not leave us a kernel of the gunpowder belonging to either ship nor could we find a boardingpike cutlass or weapon of any sort except the officers pistols we had a canister of powder and a sufficiency of bullets for the last which had been left as out of an esprit de corps or the feeling of an officer which told him we might possibly need these means to keep our own crew in order such was not the fact however with the particular people we happened to have a more orderly and reasonable set of men never sailing together but monsieur le compte knew it was his duty to put it out of their power to trouble us so far as it lay in his but at the same time while he left us the means of safety he provided against our doing any further injury to his own countrymen  in this he had pretty effectually succeeded so far as armament was concerned  the next morning i was up with the appearance of the dawn and having suffered much from the heat the preceding day i walked to a suitable spot threw off my clothes and plunged into the basin the water was transparent almost as air and i happened to select a place where the coral grew within a few yards of the surface as i dove my eye fell on a considerable cluster of large oysters that were collected on the rock and reaching them i succeeded in bringing up half a dozen that clung to each other these dives i repeated during the next quarter of an hour until i had all the oysters sixty or eighty in number safe on the shore that they were the pearl oysters i knew immediately and beckoning to neb the fellow soon had them snug in a basket and put away in a place of security the circumstance was mentioned to marble who finding no more heavy drags to be made ordered the sandwich islanders to take a boat and pass a few hours in their regular occupation on account of the ownersif indeed the last had any further claim on our services these men met with tolerable success though relatively nothing equal to mine  what just then was of far more importance they made a discovery of an armchest lying on the bottom of the basin at the anchorage of the crisis and which had doubtless been sunk there by the french we had all la paulines boats but the captains gig i went in one of them with a gang of hands and the divers securing a rope to the handles of the chest we soon got it in it turned out to be one of the armchests of the crisis which the french had found in their way and thrown overboard evidently preferring to use weapons to which they were accustomed they had done better by carrying the chest out to sea and disposing of it in fifty or a hundred fathom water  the prize was turned over to the gunner who reported that it was the chest in which we kept our cutlasses and pistols of both of which there was a sufficient supply to give every man one of each there were also several horns of powder and a bag of bullets but the first was ruined by the water as for the arms they were rubbed dry oiled and put away again in the chest after the last had stood a whole day in the hot sun open thus through the agency of men brought for a very different purpose we were put in possession of the means of achieving the exploit which might now be said to form the great object of our lives  that day we got everything on board the schooner that it was thought desirable to take with us we left much behind that was valuable it is true especially the copper but marble wisely determined that it was inexpedient to put the vessel deeper than good ballasttrim lest it should hurt her sailing we had got her fairly to her bearings and this was believed to be as low as was expedient it is true a great deal remained to be stowed the deck being littered and the hold the groundtier excepted in great confusion  but our bread water beef pork and other eatables were all there and in abundance and though not to be had for the asking they were still to be had the sails were bent and the only anchor la paulines stream with her two largest kedges was on our bows while in this condition marble gave the unexpected order for all hands to come on board and for the shorefasts to be cast off  of course there was no dissenting to so positive a command  we had signed new shippingarticles for the schooner extending the engagements made when we entered on board the crisis to this new vessel or any other she might capture the wind was a steady trade and when we showed our mainsail and jib to it the little craft glided athwart the basin like a duck shooting through the pass marble tacked her twice as soon as he had an offing and everybody was delighted with the quickness with which she was worked there was barely light enough to enable us to find our way through the opening in the reef and just thirtyeight hours after the crisis sailed we were on her track we had only conjecture to guide us as to the ships course with the exception of the main fact of her having sailed for the west coast of south america but we had not failed to notice that she disappeared in the northeast trades on a bowline we put the schooner as near as possible on the same course making a proper allowance for the difference in the rig of the two vessels  the distance run that night satisfied us all that mons  le compte was a good draftsman the schooner ran 106 miles in twelve hours against a very respectable sea which was at least ten or fifteen more than the crisis could have done under the same circumstances it is true that what was closehauled for her was not closehauled for us and in this respect we had the advantage of her marble was so well pleased with our nights work that when he came on deck next morning the first thing he did was to order a bottle of rum to be brought him and then all hands to be called as soon as the people were up he went forward got into the head and commanded every body to muster on the forecastle marble now made a speech  we have some good and some bad luck this vyge men he said and when we generalize on the subject it will be found that good luck has usually followed the bad luck now the savages with that blackguard smudge knocked poor captain williams in the head and threw him overboard and got the ship from us then came the good luck of getting her back again after this the french did us that unhandsome thing now here comes the good luck of their leaving us a craft that will overhaul the ship when i neednt tell you what will come of it here all hands as in duty bound gave three cheers now i neither sail nor fight in a craft that carries a french name captain count christened the schooner themr wallingford will tell you her exact name  la belle emélie said i or the beautiful emily  none of your belles for me nor your beautiful emilys either cried marble smashing the bottle over the schooners nose so here goes three cheers again for the pretty poll which was the name the craft was born to and the name she shall bear as long as moses marble sails her  from that moment the schooner was known by the name of the pretty poll i met with portions of our crew years afterwards and they always spoke of her by this appellation sometimes familiarly terming her the poll or the polly  all the first day out we were busy in making ourselves comfortable and in getting the pollys trim we succeeded so well in this last that according to our calculations we made a knot an hour more than the crisis could have done under the same circumstances fast as the ship was known to be as the crisis had about thirtyeight hours the start of us and ran on an average about seven knots the hour for all that time it would require about ten days to overtake her of course this could only happen according to our own calculations when we were from eighteen hundred to two thousand miles from the island for my own part i sincerely hoped it would not occur at all at sea feeling satisfied our only chances of success depended on surprise  by following the vessel into some port it might be possible to succeed but for an unarmed schooner to attack a ship like the crisis with even a large crew on board it seemed rashness to think of it marble however would not listen to my remonstrances he insisted we had more than powder enough to load all our pistols halfadozen times each and laying the ship plump aboard the pistols would do the rest i was silenced quite as a matter of course if not convinced  the fifth day out neb came to me sayingmaster miles someting must be done wid em ere ysters dey smell onaccountable and de people swear dey will trow em overboard if i dont eat em i not hungry enough for dat sir  these were the pearl oysters already mentioned which had been hastening to dissolution and decomposition by the heat of the hold as the captain was as much concerned in this portion of the cargo as i was myself i communicated the state of things to him and he ordered the bags and barrels on deck forthwith it was well something was done or i doubt not a disease would have been the consequence  as decomposition was the usual process by which to come at the treasures of these animals however everything was exactly in the state we wished  an uninterested observer would have laughed at seeing the employment of the quarterdeck for the next four hours  marble and the two mates attacked a barrel belonging to the captain while neb and i had my own share to ourselves  it was a trying occupation the odour far exceeding in strength that of the spice islands we stood it howeverfor what will not man endure for the sake of riches  marble foresaw the difficulties and had once announced to the mates that they then would open on shares this had a solacing influence and amid much mirth and sundry grimaces the work went on with tolerable rapidity i observed however that talcott threw one or two subjects that doubtless were tougher than common overboard after very superficial examinations  the first seven oysters i examined contained nothing but seed pearl and not many of these neb opened and i examined and the latter occupation was so little to my taste that i was just on the point of ordering the whole lot thrown overboard when neb handed me another this oyster contained nine beautiful pearls of very uniform dimensions and each about as large as a goodsized pea i dropped them into a bowl of fresh water whence they came out sweet pearly and lustrous they were of the sort known as the white water which is the kind most prized among christian nations doubtless on account of their harmonizing so well with the skins of their women no sooner was my luck known than it brought all the other pearl fishermen around me marble with his nostrils plugged with oakum and a quid of tobacco in his mouth that was as large as a small potatoe  by george miles that looks like business the captain exclaimed going back to his work with renovated zeal though it is a calling fit only for hogs and scavengers  did i embark in it largely i would keep as many clerks as a bank what do you suppose now these nine chaps may be worth  some fifty dollars or thereaboutsyou see sir they are quite largemuch larger than it is usual to see our women wear  the ninth of my oysters produced eleven pearls and all about the size and quality of the first in a few minutes i had seventythree just such pearls besides a quantity of seed pearl then followed a succession of barren shells a dozen not giving a pearl the three that succeeded them gave thirtyone more and another yielded four pearls each of which was as large as a small cherry after that i got one that was almost as large as a common hickorynut and six more of the size of the cherrysized pearls in addition to these i got in all one hundred and eightyseven of the size of peas besides a large handful of the seed pearl i afterwards ascertained that the pearls i had thus obtained were worth in the market about eighteen hundred dollars as they were far more remarkable for their beauty than for their size  notwithstanding the oakum plugs and the tobacco and the great quantity of shells his divers had found for they had brought up something like two hundred and fifty oysters in the course of the day the party of the captain found in all but thirtysix pearls the seed excepted though they obtained some beautiful specimens among the shells from that moment marble discontinued the trade and i never heard him say anything more on the subject of pursuing it  my own beauties were put carefully away in reserve for the time when i might delight the eyes of certain of my female friends with them i never intended to sell one but they were very precious to me on other accounts as for the crew glad enough were they to be rid of such uncomfortable shipmates as i gazed on the spotless and lustrous pearls and compared them with the revolting tenements from which they had just been redeemed i likened them to the souls of the just escaping from their tenements of clay to enjoy hereafter an endless existence of purity  in the meantime the pretty poll continued to find her way along miles and miles of the deserted track across the pacific marble had once belonged to a baltimore clipper and he sailed our craft probably much better than she would have been sailed by mons le compte though that officer as i afterwards learned had distinguished himself in command of a luggerprivateer in the british channel our progress was generally from a hundred and fifty to two hundred and twenty miles in twentyfour hours and so it continued to be for the first ten days or the period when according to our own calculations we ought to be near the crisis had that vessel steered a course resembling our own for my own part i neither wished nor expected to see the ship until we reached the coast of south america when we might ascertain her position by communicating with the shore as for the guardacostas i knew we could easily elude them and there might be a small chance of regaining the vessel something like the way in which we had lost her but marbles impatience and the keenness with which he felt our disgrace would not make terms even with the elements and i do believe he would have run alongside of the crisis in a gale of wind could he have come up with her the chance of our having sailed so far however on a line so nearly resembling that of the chase as to bring us together was so very small that few of us thought it worth our consideration  on the morning of the eleventh day the lookout we had kept on the foretopsailyard sang out sailho marble and myself were soon on the yard there being nothing visible from the deck the upper sails topgallantsails and royals of a ship were visible on our weatherquarter distant from fifteen to twenty miles as we were now in the track of whalers of which there were a good many in that part of the pacific i thought it was probable this was one but marble laughed at the notion asking if i had ever heard of a whalers carrying royals on her cruising ground  he affirmed it was the crisis heading the same way we were ourselves and which had only got to windward of us by keeping a better luff we had calculated too much on the schooners weatherly qualities and had allowed her to fall off more than was necessary in the nightwatches  the pretty poll was now jammed up on a wind in the hope of closing with the chase in the course of the night  but the wind had been growing lighter and lighter for some hours and by noon though we had neared the chase so much as to be able to see her from deck there was every prospect of its falling calm after which in the trades it would be surprising if we did not get a blow to make the most of our time marble determined to tack when we had just got the chase a point off our weatherbow an hour after tacking an object was seen adrift on the ocean and keeping away a little to close with it it was ascertained to be a whaleboat adrift the boat was american built had a breaker of water the oars and all the usual fittings in it and the painter being loose it had probably been lost when towing in the night in consequence of having been fastened by three halfhitches  the moment marble ascertained the condition of this boat he conceived his plan of operations the four sandwich islanders had been in whalers and he ordered them into the boat put in some rum and some food gave me his orders got in himself and pulled ahead going off at five knots the hour leaving the schooner to follow at the rate of two this was about an hour before sunset and by the time it was dark the boat had become a mere speck on the water nearly halfway between us and the ship which was now some fifteen miles distant heading always in the same direction  my orders had been very simple they were to stand on the same course until i saw a light from the boat and then tack so as to run on a parallel line with the ship the signal was made by marble about nine oclock it was immediately answered from the schooner the light in the boat was concealed from the ship and our own was shown only for a few seconds the disappearance of mr marbles telling us in that brief space that our answer was noted i tacked immediately and taking in the foresail stood on the directed course we had all foreseen a change in the weather and probably a thundersquall so far from its giving marble any uneasiness he anticipated the blow with pleasure as he intended to lay the crisis aboard in its height he fancied that success would then be the most certain his whole concern was at not being able to find the ship in the darkness and it was to obviate this difficulty that he undertook to pilot us up to her in the manner i have just mentioned  after getting round a sharp lookout was kept for the light we caught another view of it directly on our weatherbeam  from this we inferred that the ship had more wind than we felt inasmuch as she had materially altered her position while we had not moved a mile since we tacked this was on the supposition that marble would endeavour to follow the movements of the ship at ten the tempest broke upon us with tropical violence and with a suddenness that took everybody by surprise a squall had been expected but no one anticipated its approach for several hours and we had all looked for the return of the whaleboat ere that moment should come but come it did when least expected the first puff throwing our little schooner down in a way to convince us the elements were in earnest in fifteen minutes after the first blast was felt i had the schooner under a reefed foresail and with that short canvass there were instants as she struggled up to the summit of the waves that it seemed as if she were about to fly out of the water my great concern however was for the boat of which nothing could now be seen the orders left by marble anticipated no such occurrence as this tempest and the concert between us was interrupted it was naturally inferred among us in the schooner that the boat would endeavour to close as soon as the danger was foreseen and as this would probably be done by running on a converging line all our efforts were directed to keeping the schooner astern of the other party in order that they might first reach the point of junction in this manner there was a chance of marbles finding the schooner while there was little of our finding the boat it is true we carried several lights but as soon as it began to rain even a bonfire would not have been seen at a hundred yards the water poured down upon us as if it fell from spouts occasionally ceasing and then returning in streams  i had then never passed so miserable a night even that in which smudge and his fellows murdered captain williams and seized the ship being happiness in comparison i loved marble hardy loose in some respects and unnurtured as he was in others the man had been steadily my friend he was a capital seaman a sort of an instinctive navigator true as the needle to the flag and as brave as a lion then i knew he was in his present strait on account of mortified feeling and the rigid notions he entertained of his duty to his owners i think i do myself no more than justice when i say that i would gladly have exchanged places with him any time that night  we held a consultation on the quarterdeck and it was determined that our only chance of picking up the boat was by remaining as nearly as possible at the place where her crew must have last seen the schooner marble had a right to expect this and we did all that lay in our power to effect the object waring often and gaining on our tacks what we lost in coming round in this manner we passed a painful and most uncomfortable night the winds howling about us a sort of requiem for the dead while we hardly knew when we were wallowing in the seas or not there being so much water that came down from the clouds as nearly to drown us on deck  at last the light returned and soon after the tempest broke appearing to have expended its fury an hour after the sun had risen we got the tradewind again the sea became regular once more and the schooner was under all her canvass of course every one of us officers was aloft some forward some aft to look out for the boat but we did not see her again what was still more extraordinary nothing could be seen of the ship we kept all that day cruising around the place expecting to find at least the boat but without success  my situation was now altogether novel to me i had left home rather more than a twelvemonth before the third officer of the crisis from this station i had risen regularly to be her first officer and now by a dire catastrophe i found myself in the pacific solely charged with the fortunes of my owners and those of some forty human beings and this too before i was quite twenty years old  marbles scheme of attacking the ship had always seemed to me to be wild and impracticable this was while it was his project not my own i still entertained the same opinion as regards the assault at sea but i had from the first regarded an attempt on the coast as a thing much more likely to succeed then emily and her father and the honour of the flag and the credit i might personally gain had their influence and at sunset all hope of finding the boat being gone i ordered sail made on our course  the loss of the whaleboat occurred when we were about two thousand miles from the western coast of south america  we had a long road before us consequently and as i had doubted whether the ship we had seen was the crisis it was necessary to be in motion if anything was to be effected with our old enemies the reader may feel some desire to know in what manner my succession to the command was received by the people no man could have been more implicitly obeyed i was now six feet and an inch in height of a powerful and active frame a good seaman and had the habit of command through a twelvemonths experience the crew knew me having seen me tried from the weatherearings down and it is very likely i possessed more of their confidence than i deserved at all events i was as implicitly obeyed as if i had sailed from new york at their head everybody regretted marble more i think than we regretted poor captain williams though it must have been on account of the manner we saw him disappear as it might be from before our eyes since of the two i think the last was the most estimable man nevertheless marble had his strong points and they were points likely to take with seamen and they had particularly taken with us as for the four sandwich islanders i do not know that they occupied any of our minds at all we had been accustomed to regard them as strange beings who came from that ocean to which they had thus suddenly returned  fifteen days after the loss of the whaleboat we made the peaks of the andes a very few degrees to the southward of the equator from some casual remarks made by the french and which i had overheard i had been led to believe they intended to run for guayaquil or its vicinity and i aimed at reaching the coast near the same point we had been in ourselves at several bays and roadsteads moreover on this part of the shore on our way north and i felt at home among them we had acquaintances too who could not fail to be of use to us and everything conspired to render this an advantageous landfall  on the evening of the twentyninth day after quitting the island we took the schooner into an open roadstead where we had carried on some extensive traffic in the ship about eight months before and where i fancied we should still be recognised as was expected we had scarcely anchored before a don pedro something a fellow with a surprising string of names came off to us in a boat in order to ascertain who we were and what we wanted perhaps it would be better to say what we had that he wanted i knew the man at a glance having delivered to him myself three boatloads of goods and received a small bag of doubloons in exchange a very few words halfenglish halfspanish served to renew our acquaintance and i gave our old friend to understand that i was in search of the ship from which i had been separated on some extra duty after beating the bush to discover all he could the don pedro gave me to understand that a ship had gone in behind an island that was only ten miles to the southward of us that very afternoon that he had seen her himself and had supposed she might be his old friend the crisis until he saw the french ensign at her gaff this was sufficient and i made inquiries for a pilot a man qualified to carry us to the place was found in one of the boatmen as i feared the news of the arrival of a schooner might be carried to the ship much as we had got our intelligence no time was lost but we were underway by ten oclock at midnight we entered the pass between the main and the island there i got into a boat and pulled ahead in order to reconnoitre i found the ship lying close under a high bluff which made a capital lee and with every sign about her of tranquillity  still i knew a vessel that was always in danger from the guardacostas and which relied on the celerity of its movements for its safety would have a vigilant lookout accordingly i took a cool and careful examination of the ships position landing and ascending the bluff in order to do this at my ease about two oclock in the morning i returned to the schooner  when i put my foot on the pollys deck again she was quite near the point or bluff having set down towards it during my absence all hands were on deck armed and in readiness expectation had got to be so keen that we had a little difficulty in keeping the men from cheering but silence was preserved and i communicated the result of my observations in as few words as possible the orders were then given and the schooner was brought under short sail for the attack we were so near our side of the bluff while the ship lay so near the other that my principal apprehension was of falling to leeward which might give the french time to muster and recollect themselves the canvass accordingly was reduced to the foresail though the jib mainsail and topsail were all loose in readiness to be set if wanted  the plan was to run the ship aboard on her starboardbow or offside as respected the island and to do this with as little of a shock as possible  when everything was ready i went aft stood by the man at the helm and ordered him to bear up neb placed himself just behind me i knew it was useless to interfere and let the fellow do as he pleased the pilot had told me the water was deep up to the rocks of the bluff and we hugged the land as close as possible in rounding the point at the next moment the ship was in sight distant less than a hundred fathoms i saw we had good way and three minutes later i ordered the foresail brailed at the same instant i walked forward so near were we that the flapping of the canvass was heard in the ship and we got a hail a mystified answer followed and then crash came our bows along those of the crisis hurrah for the old craft shouted our men and aboard we tumbled in a body our charge was like the plunge of a pack of hounds as they leap through a hedge  the scene that followed was one of wild tumult some twenty pistols were fired and a good many hard blows were struck but the surprise secured us the victory in less than three minutes talcott came to report to me that our lads had complete possession of the deck and that the french asked for quarter at first the enemy supposed they had been seized by a guardacosta for the impression had been general among them that we intended to quit the island for canton great was the astonishment among them when the truth came to be known i heard a great many sacrrres and certain other maledictions in low french that it is scarcely worth while to repeat  harris one of thephiladelphians and the man who had got us into the difficulty by falling asleep on his watch was killed and no less than nine of our men myself among the number were hurt in this brisk business all the wounds however were slight only three of the injuries taking the parties off duty as for the poor fellow who fell he owed his death to risking too much in order to recover the ground he had lost  the french fared much worse than ourselves of those killed outright and those who died before morning there were no less than sixteen our fellows having fired a volley into a group that was rushing on deck besides using their cutlasses with great severity for the first minute or two  this was on the principle that the first blow was half the battle there were few wounded most of those who fell being cut or thrust at by several at the same timea species of attack that left little chance for escape poor mons le compte was found stonedead at the cabindoors having been shot in the forehead just as he put his foot on the deck  i heard his voice once in the fray and feared it boded no good but the silence which succeeded was probably caused by his just then receiving the fatal bullet he was in his shirt    chapter xviii    1st witch hail   2d witch  hail   3d witch  hail   1st witch lesser than macbeth and greater   2d witch  not so happy yet much happier   macbeth   i hope i shall be believed in saying if marble had been with us when we retook the ship i should have been perfectly happy he was not however and regret was left to mingle in our triumph i had a hasty interview with major merton that night and communicated all that was necessary to quiet the apprehensions of his daughter emily was in her stateroom and had been alarmed as a matter of course but when she learned that all was over and had terminated successfully her fears yielded to reason of course both she and her father felt it to be a great relief that they were no longer prisoners  we were no sooner fairly in command of our old ship again than i had all hands called to get the anchor we hove up and passed out to sea without delay it being necessary to cover our movements with as much mystery as possible in order to prevent certain awkward demands from the spanish government on the subject of the violation of neutral territory a hint from major merton put me on my guard as respected this point and i determined to disappear as suddenly as we had arrived in order to throw obstacles in the way of being traced by daylight therefore both the ship and schooner were four leagues from the land and on the great highway of nations a road it may be said in passing that was then greatly infested by footpads and other robbers  just as the sun rose we buried the dead this was done decently and with the usual ceremony the triumph of victory giving place to the sad reflections that are so apt to succeed to the excited feelings of most of our struggles i saw poor le compte disappear from sight with regret and remembered his recent hopes his generous treatment his admiration of emily and all that he had so lately thought and felt as a warning of the fragile nature of life and that which life can bestow thus terminated an acquaintance of a month but a month that had been pregnant with incidents of great importance to myself  it now became necessary to decide on our future course  i had the ship just as the french got her from us with the addition of those portions of their own cargo with which they had intended to trade on the coast of south america  these consisted of silks and various fancy articles with a little wine and would be nearly as valuable at home as they were in spanish america i was strongly averse to smuggling and the ship having already followed out her original instructions on this point i saw no necessity for pursuing the ungrateful trade any further could i return to the island and get the articles of value left on it by the french such as the copper they had not used and divers pales received from the bombay ship which had been abandoned by us all under a tent more profit would accrue to my owners than by any illicit commerce we could now possibly carry into effect on the coast  while talcott and the new chiefmate and myself were discussing these points the cry of sail ho was heard  a large ship had suddenly hove up out of the mornings mist within a mile of us and i thought at first we had got under the guns of a spanish manofwar a second look at her however satisfied us all that though heavy and armed she was merely one of those clumsy traders that sailed periodically from the colonies to spain we went to quarters and cleared ship but made no effort to avoid the stranger the spaniards of the two were the most uneasy i believe their country being then at war with england but we spoke each other without coming to blows as soon as the strangers saw the american ensign they expressed a wish to communicate with us and unwilling to let them come on board us i volunteered a visit to the spanish captain  he received me with formal politeness and after some preliminary discourse he put into my hands some american newspapers which contained a copy of the treaty of peace between the united states and france on looking over the articles of this new compact i found that had our recapture of the crisis been delayed to that very day at noon it would have been illegal the two nations in fact were at peace when the french seized the ship but the customary provisions as to captures in distant seas just brought us within the saving clauses such is war and its concomitants  in the course of half an hours conversation i discovered that the spaniard intended to touch at valparaiso and called in order to get men his own having suffered up the coast with the smallpox his ship was large carried a considerable armament and he should not deem her safe from the smaller english cruisers unless he doubled the cape much stronger handed than he then was i caught at the idea and inquired what he thought of frenchmen they would answer his purpose for france and spain had a common enemy and nothing would be easier than to send the french from cadiz to marseilles a bargain was consequently struck on the spot  when i got back on board the crisis i had all the prisoners mustered on deck they were made acquainted with the offers of the spanish captain with the fact that peace now existed between our respective countries and with the chance that presented itself so opportunely for them to return home the proposition was cheerfully accepted anything being better than captivity before parting i endeavoured to impress on the french the necessity of prudence on the subject of our recapturing the crisis in spanish waters inasmuch as the circumstance might induce an inquiry as to what took the ship there it being well understood that the mines were the punishment of those who were taken in the contraband trade in that quarter of the world the french promised fairly whether they kept their words i never knew but if they did not no consequences ever followed from their revelations in such a case indeed the spanish government would be very apt to consider the question one that touched the interests of smugglers alike and to feel great indifference between the parties at all events no complaints were ever made to the american government or if made they never reached my ears or those of my owners it is most probable nothing was ever said on the subject  about noon we had got rid of our prisoners they were allowed to take away with them all their own effects and as usually happens in such cases i make little doubt some that belonged to other persons the ships then made sail each on her own course the spaniard running down the coast while we spread our studdingsails for the island as soon as this was done i felt relieved from a great burthen and had leisure to think of other matters i ought to mention however that i put the secondmate or him who had become chiefmate by my own advancement in command of the pretty poll giving him two experienced seamen as his own mates and six men to sail her this made talcott the crisis first officer and glad was i to see him in a station a little suited to his attainments  that evening just as the sun was setting i saw emily again for the first time since she had stood leaning over the rail as the crisis shot through the inlet of the lagoon the poor girl was pale and it was evident while she could not but rejoice at her liberation and her release from the solicitations of the unfortunate le compte that his death had cast a shade of sadness over her pretty features it could not well be otherwise the female breast ever entertaining its sympathies for those who submit to the influence of its owners charms then poor le compte had some excellent qualities and he treated emily as she admitted to me herself with the profoundest respect and delicacy his admiration could scarce be an offence in her eyes however disagreeable it proved in certain points of view  our meeting partook of the character of our situation being a mixture of melancholy and happiness i rejoiced in our success while i regretted marble and even our late enemies while the major and his daughter could not but remember all the gloomy particulars of their late and indeed of their present position  we seem to be kept like mahomets coffin sir emily observed as she looked affectionately at her father suspended between heaven and earththe indies and americanot knowing on which we are to alight the pacific is our air and we are likely to breathe it to our hearts content  true loveyour comparison is not an unhappy one  but wallingford what has become of captain marble in these stirring times you have not left him sancho panza like to govern barritaria while you have come to recover his ship  i told my passengers of the manner in which our old friend had disappeared and inquired if anything had been seen of the whaleboat or the schooner on the night of the tropical tempest  nothinganswered the major so far from expecting to lay eyes on the beautiful emily again we supposed you would be off for canton by the end of the fortnight that succeeded our own departure at least that was poor le comptes version of the matter i am certain however that no sail was seen from this ship during the whole passage nor had we any storm like that you have described more beautiful weather i never met at sea  upon this i sent for the logbook and ascertained by day and date that the crisis was not within fifty leagues of the spot where we encountered the thundersquall of course the ship we saw was a stranger most probably a whaler this destroyed any little hope that was left concerning marbles fate  but it is time i should mention a galanterie of poor le comptes he was well provided with shipwrightsbetter indeed than with seamenas was apparent by the readiness with which he had constructed the schooner during the passage from marble land he had set these workmen about building a poop on the crisis quarterdeck and i found the work completed there was a very pretty airy cabin with two staterooms communicating with light quartergalleries and everything that is customary with such accommodations  furniture had been made with french dexterity and taste and the paint was just dry to receive it emily and her father were to take possession of these new accommodations the very day succeeding that in which the ship fell again into our hands this alteration was not such as i would have made as a seaman and i wonder mons le compte who had the gauntlet to run through the most formidable navy in the world should have ventured on it since it sensibly affected the ships sailing on a wind but now it was peace i cared little about it and determined to let it remain so long at least as miss merton continued on board  that very night therefore the major occupied one of the staterooms and his daughter the other imitating poor le comptes gallantry i gave them a separate table though i took quite half my meals with them by invitation emily did not absolutely dress my wound a flesh injury in the shoulder that office falling to her fathers share who had seen a good deal of service and was familiar with the general treatment of hurts of this nature but she could and did show many of those gentle and seductive attentions that the tenderness of her sex can alone bestow with full effect on man in a fortnight my hurt was cured though emily had specifics to recommend and advice to bestow until we were both ashamed to allude to the subject any longer  as for the passage it was just such a one as might be expected to occur in the trades of the pacific the ship was under studdingsails nearly the whole time making day in and day out from a hundred and twenty to two hundred miles in the twentyfour hours the mates kept the watches and i had little to do but to sit and chat with the major and his daughter in the cool airy cabin that le compte had provided for us listen to emilys piano which had been transferred from the prize and subsequently saved from the wreck or read aloud out of some of the two or three hundred beautifully bound and sweetlyscented volumes that composed her library in that day people read pope and young and milton and shakspeare and that sort of writers a little relieved by mrs radcliffe and miss burney and monk lewis perhaps as for fielding and smollet they were well enough in their place which was not a young ladys library however there were still more useful books and i believe i read everything in the ship before the voyage ended the leisure of a sealife in a tranquil wellordered vessel admits of much study and books ought to be a leading object in the fitting out that portion of a vessels equipment which relates chiefly to the welfare of her officers and crew  time passed pleasantly enough with a young fellow who had certainly some reason to be satisfied with his own success thus far in life and who could relieve the tedium of ships duty in such society i cannot say i was in love though i often thought of emily when she was not before my eyes and actually dreamt of her three times in the first fortnight after the recapture of the ship what was a little remarkable as i conceive i often found myself drawing comparisons between her and lucy though i hardly knew why myself the result was very much after this sortemily had vastly the advantage in all that related to art instruction trainingi am wrong mr harding had given his daughter a store of precise useful knowledge that emily did not possess and then i could not but see that lucys tact in moral feeling was much of the highest order of the two but in purely conventional attainments in most that relates to the world its usages its finesse of feeling and manner i could see that emily was the superior had i known more myself i could have seen that both were provincialfor england in 1801 was but a province as to mere manners though on a larger scale than america is even nowand that either would have been remarked for peculiarities in the more sophisticated circles of the continent of europe i dare say half my own countrymen would have preferred lucys nature to the more artificial manner of emily but it will not do to say that even female deportment however delicate and feminine nature may have made it cannot be improved by certain general rules for the government of that which is even purely conventional on the whole i wished that lucy had a little of emilys art and emily a good deal more of lucys nature  i suppose the perfection in this sort of thing is to possess an art so admirable that it shall appear to be nature in all things immaterial while it leaves the latter strictly in the ascendant in all that is material  in person i sometimes fancied emily was the superior and sometimes when memory carried me back to certain scenes that had occurred during my last visit to clawbonny that it was lucy in complexion and perhaps in eyes the english girl beat her rival possibly also in the teeth though lucys were very even and white but in the smile in the outline of the face most especially in the mouth and in the hands feet and person generally i think nine judges in ten would have preferred the american one peculiar charm was common to both and it is a charm though the strongest instance i ever saw of it in my life was in italy that may be said to belong almost exclusively to the anglosaxon race i mean that expression of the countenance which so eminently betokens feminine purity and feminine tenderness united the look which artists love to impart to the faces of angels each of the girls had much of this and i suppose it was principally owing to their heavenly blue eyes i doubt if any woman with black or hazel eyes notwithstanding all the brilliancy of their beauty ever possessed this charm in the higher degree it belonged to grace even more than to lucy or emily though of the two last i think the english girl possessed it in a slight degree the most so far as it was connected with mere shading and colour while the american exhibited the most of it in moments of feeling and emotion perhaps this last advantage was owing to lucys submitting most to nature and to her impulses it must be remembered however that i had not seen lucy now for near two years and two of the most important years of a young females life as respected her personal appearance  as relates to character i will not now speak as plainly as i shall be called on to do hereafter a youth of twenty is not the best judge of such things and i shall leave events to tell their own story in this particular  we had been at sea a fortnight when happening to allude to the pearl fishery i bethought me of my own prizes a ship that carries a numerous crew is a sort of omnium gatherum of human employments for ordinarily manned craft seamen are necessary but ships of war privateers and lettersofmarque can afford as poor marble would express it to generalize we had several tradesmen in the crisismechanics who found the restraints of a ship necessary for their own goodand among others we happened to have a goldsmith this man had offered to perforate my pearls and to string them an operation to which i consented  the fellow had performed his task as well as could be desired and supplying from his own stores a pair of suitable clasps had formed the whole into a simple but as beautiful a necklace as i ever laid eyes on he had put the largest pearl of all directly in the centre and then arranged the remainder by placing several of the smaller together separated by one of the second size until the whole formed a row that would much more than encircle my own neck and which of course would drop gracefully round that of a female  when i produced this beautiful ornament one that a woman of rank might have coveted emily did not endeavour to conceal her admiration unaccustomed herself to the higher associations of her own country she had never seen a necklace of the same value and she even fancied it fit for a queen doubtless queens usually possess much more precious pearls than those of mine and yet it was to be supposed they would not disdain to wear even such as they major merton examined the necklace carefully and i could see by his countenance he was surprised and pleased  on the whole i think it may be questioned if any other man enjoys as many physical advantages with the same means as the americans i speak more of his habits than of his opportunities but i am of opinion after seeing a good deal of various parts of the world that the american of moderate fortune has more physical indulgences than any other man while this is true however as a whole there are certain points on which he signally fails he fails often when it comes to the mere outward exhibition and it is probable there is not a single wellordered householdmeaning for the purposes of comfort and representation unitedin the whole country the particular deficiency if deficiency it be applies in an almost exclusive degree to the use of precious stones jewelry and those of the more valuable metals in general the ignorance of the value of precious stones is so great that half the men meaning those who possess more or less of fortune do not even know the names of those of the commoner sorts i doubt if one educated american in twenty could even at this moment tell a sapphire from an amethyst or a turquoise from a garnet though the women are rather more expert as lapidaries  now i was a true american in this respect and while i knew i possessed a very beautiful ornament i had not the smallest idea of its value as an article of commerce with the major it was different he had studied such things and he had a taste for them the reader will judge of my surprise therefore when i heard him say  that necklace in the hands of rundle and bridges would bring a thousand pounds in london  father exclaimed emily  i do think it it is not so much the size of the pearls though these largest are not common even in that particular but it is their extreme beauty their colour and transparencytheir water as it is called  i thought that a term applied only to diamondsobserved emily with an interest i wished she had not manifested  it is also applied to pearlsthere are pearls of what is called the white water and they are of the sort most prized in europe the yellow water are more esteemed among nations of darker skins i suppose that is the secret  yes i think if you send this necklace to london wallingford you will get six or eight hundred pounds for it  i shall never sell it sirat least not as long as i can avoid it  i saw that emily looked at me with an earnestness for which i could not account  not sell it repealed her fatherwhy what in the name of neptune can you do with such an ornament  keep it it is strictly my own i brought it up from the bottom of the sea with my own hands removed the pearls from what the editors would call their native homes myself and i feel an interest in them that i never could feel in any ornament that was purchased  still this will prove rather an expensive taste pray what interest do you obtain for money in your part of the world wallingford  six per cent in new york sir perhaps on the better sort of permanent securities  and how much is sixty pounds sterling when turned into dollars  we usually say five for one though it is not quite that from two hundred and eighty to two hundred and ninety all things consideredthough two hundred and sixtysix nominally or thereabouts  well even two hundred and sixtysix dollars a year is a good deal for a young man like you to pay for the pleasure of saying he owns a pearl necklace that he cannot use  but it cost me nothing sir and of course i can lose nothing by it  i rather think you will lose what i tell you if the ornament can be sold for that sum when a man has property from which he might derive an income and does not he is in one sense and that the most important a loser  i have a sister major merton i may possibly give it to heror should i marry i would certainly give it to my wife  i could see a smile struggling about the mouth of the major which i was then too young and i may add too american to understand the incongruity of the wife of a man of two thousand or five and twenty hundred dollars ayear wearing two years income round her neck or of being magnificent in only one item of her dress household or manner of living never occurred to my mind we can all laugh when we read of indian chiefs wearing uniformcoats and cockedhats without any other articles of attire but we cannot imagine inconsistencies in our own cases that are almost as absurd in the eyes of highly sophisticated and conventional usages to me at that age there was nothing in the least out of the way in mrs miles wallingfords wearing the necklace her husband being unequivocally its owner as for emily she did not smile but continued to hold the necklace in her own very white plump hand the pearls making the hand look all the prettier while the hand assisted to increase the lustre of the pearls  i ventured to ask her to put the necklace on her neck she blushed slightly but she complied  upon my word emily exclaimed the gratified father you become each other so well that i am losing a prejudice and begin to believe even a poor mans daughter may be justified in using such an ornament  the sight was certainly sufficient to justify anything of the sort the dazzling whiteness of miss merlons skin the admirable outlines of her throat and bust and the flush which pleasure gave her cheeks contributed largely to the beauty of the picture it would have been difficult to say whether the charms of the woman ornamented the pearls or those of the pearls ornamented the woman i remember i thought at the time my eyes had never dwelt on any object more pleasing than was miss merton during the novelty of that spectacle nor did the pleasure cease on the instant for i begged her to continue to wear the necklace during the remainder of the day a request with which she had the good nature to comply which was most gratified by this exhibition the young lady or myself it might be difficult to say for there is a mutual satisfaction in admiring and in being admired  when i went into the cabin to say goodnight i found emily merton with the necklace in her hand gazing at it by the light of a powerful lamp with eyes as liquid and soft as the pearls themselves i stood still to admire her for never before had i seen her so bewitchingly beautiful her countenance was usually a little wanting in intellectual expression though it possessed so much of that which i have described as angelic but on this occasion it seemed to me to be full of ideas can it be possible whispered conceitand what very young man is entirely free from itcan it be possible she is now thinking how happy a woman mrs miles wallingford will one day beam i in any manner connected with that meditating brow that reflecting air that fixed look that pleased and yet doubting expression  i was about to send for you captain wallingford said emily the instant she saw me and confirming my conceited conjectures by blushing deeper than i had seen her before in the whole of that blushing sensitive and enjoyable day about to send for you to take charge of your treasure  and could you not assume that much responsibility for a single night  t would be too greatit is an honour reserved for mrs wallingford you know  this was smilingly said i fancied sweetly and kindly and yet it was said not altogether without something that approached to an équivoque a sort of manner that the deep natural feeling of grace and needlelike truth of lucy had rendered unpleasant to me i took the necklace shook the young ladys hand for goodnightwe always did that on meeting and parting for the daypaid my compliments to the father and withdrew  i was dressing next morning when neb came bolting into my stateroom with his clawbonny freedom of manner his eyes looking lobsters and his necklace of pearl glittering between a pair of lips that might have furnished a cannibal two famous steaks as soon as fairly established in command i had brought the fellow aft berthing him in the steerage in order to have the benefit of more of his personal service than i could obtain while he was exclusively a foremast jack still he kept his watch for it would have been cruel to deprive him of that pleasure  oh masser mile exclaimed the black as soon as he could speak e boate boat   what of the boatis any one overboard  e whaleboat sirpoor captain marblee whaleboat sir  i understand you nebgo on deck and desire the officer of the watch to heaveto the ship as soon as it is proper i will come up the instant i can  here then i thought providence has brought us on the track of the unfortunate whaleboat and we shall doubtless see the mutilated remains of some of our old companionspoor marble doubtless from what neb saidwell the will of god be done i was soon dressed and as i went up the cabinladder the movement on deck denoted the nature of the excitement that now prevailed generally in the ship  just as i reached the quarterdeck the mainyard swung round and the sails were brought aback the whole crew was in commotion and it was some little time before i could learn the cause  the morning was misty and the view round the ship until within a few minutes had been confined to a circle of less than a mile in diameter as the sun rose however the mist broke away gradually and then the watch caught a view of the whaleboat mentioned by neb instead of being floating about on the ocean with the remains of its unfortunate crew lying in its bottom as i had expected to see it when i caught the first glimpse of the unlookedfor object it was not a mile distant pulling briskly for us and containing not only a full but a strong and an animated crew  just at that instant some one cried out sailho and sure enough a ship was seen some four or five miles to leeward a whaler evidently turning to windward under easy canvass in order to rejoin her boat from which she had lately been separated by the night and the fog this then was no more than a whaler and her boat and on sweeping the horizon with a glass talcott soon discovered a mile to windward of the boat a dead whale with another boat lying by it in waiting for the approach of the ship which promised to fetch as far to windward on its next tack  they desire to speak us i suppose mr talcott i remarked  the ship is probably an american it is likely the captain is in the boat and he wishes to send letters or messages home  a shout came from talcott at the next instantthen he cried out  three cheers my lads i see captain marble in that boat as plainly as i see the boat itself  the cheers that followed were a spontaneous burst of joy they reached the approaching boat and gave its inmate an earnest of his reception in three more minutes  marble was on the deck of his old ship for myself i was unable to speak nor was poor marble much better off though more prepared for the interview  i knew you miles i knew you and the bloody pretty poll he at last got out the tears running down his cheeks like water the moment the fog lifted and gave me a fair glimpse theyve got heryesdn hergod bless her i meantheyve got her and the bloody frenchmen will not go home with that feather in their caps  well it couldnt have happened to a cleverer fellow and im just as happy as if i had done it myself  there he stood sound safe and sturdy as ever and the four sandwich islanders were all in the boat just as well as if they had never quitted the ship every man of the crew had to shake hands with marble congratulations were to be exchanged and a turbulent quarter of an hour passed before it was possible to get a coherent account from the man of what had befallen him as soon as practicable however he motioned for silence and told his own story aloud for the benefit of all hands  you know how i left you men marble commenced swabbing his eyes and cheeks and struggling to speak with something like an appearance of composure and the errand on which i went the last i saw of you was about half an hour before the gust broke at that time i was so near the ship as to make out she was a whaler and nothing doubting of being in sight of you in the morning i thought it safer to pull alongside of her than to try to hunt for the schooner in the dark i found an old shipmate in the whalers captain who was looking for a boat that had struck adrift the night before and both parties were pleased there was not much time for compliments however as you all know  the ship bore up to speak you and then she bore up again and again on account of the squalls while mr wallingford was probably hugging the wind in order to find me we were running off to save our spars and next morning we could see nothing of you how else we missed each other is more than i can say for ive no idee you went off and left me out here in the middle of the ocean  we cruised for you within five miles of the spot for a whole day i exclaimed eagerly  no nocaptain marble the men put in in a body we did all that men could do to find you  i know it i could swear to it without a word from one of you well thats the whole story we could not find you and i stuck by the ship as a matter of course as there was no choice between that and jumping overboard and here has the lord brought us together again though we are every inch of five hundred miles from the place where we parted  i then took marble below and related to him all that had occurred since the separation he listened with the deepest interest manifesting the strongest sympathy in our success  nothing but expressions of gratification escaped him until i remarked as i concluded my account  and here is the old ship for you sir just as we lost her and glad am i to see her once more in so good hands  who put that bloody poop on her you or the frenchman miles  the frenchman now it is peace however it is no great matter and the cabin is very convenient for the major and his daughter  its just like em spoiling the neatest quarterdeck on the ocean with a bloody supernumerary cabin  well sir as you are master now you can have it all cut away again if you think proper  i i cut away anything i take the command of this ship from the man who has so fairly won it if i do may i be dd  captain marble you astonish me by this language sir but it is nothing more than a momentary feeling of which your own good sensenay even your duty to the ownerswill cause you to get rid  you never were more mistaken in your life master miles wallingford answered marble solemnly i thought of all this the moment i recognised the ship and that was as soon as i saw her and my mind was made up from that instant i cannot be so mean as to come in at the seventh hour and profit by your courage and skill besides i have no legal right to command here the ship was more than twentyfour hours in the enemys hands and she comes under the usual laws of recapture and salvage  but the owners captain marbleremember there is a cargo to be taken in at canton and there are heavy interests at stake  by george that would make me so much the more firm  from the first i have thought matters would be better in your hands than mine you have an education and thats a wonderful thing miles as to sailing a ship or stowing her or taking care of her in heavy weather or finding my way across an ocean ill turn my back on no man but its a different thing when it comes to figures and calculations  you disappoint me greatly in all this sir we have gone through so much together  we did not go through the recapture of this vessel together boy  but it was your thought and but for an accident would have been your deed  i dont know that i have reflected coolly in the matter after i got over my mortification and i think we should have been flogged had we attacked the french at sea your own plan was better and capitally carried out harkee miles this much will i do and not a jot more you are bound to the island i take it for granted to pick up odds and ends and then you sail for canton  preciselyi am glad you approve of it as you must by seeing into it so readily  well at the island fill up the schooner with such articles as will be of no use at canton let her take in the copper the english goods and the like of that and i will carry her home while you can pursue the vyge in the ship as you alone have a right to do  no arguments of mine could turn marble from his resolution  i fought him all day on the subject and at night he was put in command of the pretty poll with our old secondmate for his first officer    chapter xix    thou shalt seek the beach of sand   where the water bounds the elfin land   thou shalt watch the oozy brine   till the sturgeon leaps in the light moonshine   drake   there is but a word to say of the whaler we spoke her of course and parted leaving her her boat she passed half an hour close to us and then went after her whale when we lost sight of her she was cutting in the fish as coolly as if nothing had happened as for ourselves we made the best of our way for the island  nothing worth relating occurred during the remainder of the passage we reached our place of destination ten days after we found marble and carried both the ship and schooner into the lagoon without any hesitation or difficulty  everything was found precisely as we had left it two months having passed as quietly as an hour the tents were standing the different objects lay where they had been hastily dropped at our hurried departure and everything denoted the unchangeable character of an unbroken solitude  time and the seasons could alone have produced any sensible alteration even the wreck had neither shifted her bed nor suffered injury there she lay seemingly an immovable fixture on the rocks and as likely to last as any other of the durable things around her  it is always a relief to escape from the confinement of a ship even if it be only to stroll along the vacant sands of some naked beach as soon as the vessels were secured we poured ashore in a body and the people were given a holiday there was no longer an enemy to apprehend and we all enjoyed the liberty of movement and the freedom from care that accompanied our peculiar situation  some prepared lines and commenced fishing others hauled the seine while the less industriously disposed lounged about selected the fruit of the cocoanut tree or hunted for shells of which there were many and those extremely beautiful scattered along the inner and outer beaches or lying visible just within the wash of the water i ordered two or three of the hands to make a collection for clawbonny paying them as a matter of course for their extra services their success was great and i still possess the fruits of their search as memorials of my youthful adventures  emily and her maid took possession of their old tents neither of which had been disturbed and i directed that the necessary articles of furniture should be landed for their use as we intended to remain eight or ten days at marble land there was a general disposition to make ourselves comfortable and the crew were permitted to bring such things ashore as they desired care being had for the necessary duties of the ships since quitting london we had been prisoners with the short interval of our former visit to this place and it was now deemed wisest to give the people a little relaxation to all this i was advised by marble who though a severe and so often seemingly an obdurate man was in the main disposed to grant as much indulgence at suitable moments as any officer i ever sailed with there was an ironical severity at times about the man which misled superficial observers i have heard of a waggish boatswain in the navy who when disposed to menace the crew with some of his official visitations used to cry out fellowcitizens im coming among you and the anecdote never recurs to my mind without bringing marble back to my recollection when in spirits he had much of this bitter irony in his manner and his own early experience had rendered him somewhat insensible to professional suffering but on the whole i always thought him a humane man  we went into the lagoon before the sun had risen and before the breakfast hour of those who lived aft we had everything landed that was necessary and were in possession of our tents i had ordered neb to attend particularly to the wants of the mertons and precisely as the bell of the ship struck eight which at that time of day meant eight oclock the black came with the majors compliments inviting captain wallingford and captain marble to breakfast  so it goes miles added my companion after promising to join the party in a few moments this arrangement about the schooner leaves us both captains and prevents anything like your downhill work which is always unpleasant business captain marble and captain wallingford sound well and i hope they may long sail in company but natur or art never meant me for a captain  well admitting this where there are two captains one must outrank the other and the senior commands you should be called commodore marble  none of your pleasantry miles returned marble with a severe look and a shake of the head it is by your favour and i hope by your good opinion that i am master of even that little halfblooded part french part yankee schooner it is my second and i think it will be my last command i have generalized over my life upon a large scale within the last ten days and have come to the conclusion that the lord created me to be your mate and not you to be mine when natur means a man for anything particlar she doesnt set him adrift among human beings as i was set adrift  i do not understand you sirperhaps you will give me an outline of your history and then all will be plain  miles oblige me in one particularit will cost you no great struggle and will considerably relieve my mind  you have only to name it sir to be certain it will be done  drop that bloody sir then its unbecoming now as between you and me call me marble or moses as i call you miles  well be it so now for this history of yours which you have promised to give me by the way any time these two years  it can be told in a few words and i hope it may be of service a human life properly generalized on is at any time as good as most sermons it is full of what i call the morality of idees i suppose you know to what i owe my names  not ito your sponsors in baptism like all the rest of us i suppose  youre nearer the truth than you may imagine this time boy i was found a child of a week old they tell me lying in a basket one pleasant morning in a stonecutters yard on the north river side of the town placed upon a bit of stone that was hewing out for the head of a grave in order as i suppose that the workmen would be sure to find me when they mustered at their work although i have passed for a downeaster having sailed in their craft in the early part of my life im in truth york born  and is this all you know of your origin my dear marble  all i want to know after such a hint a man is never anxious to make the acquaintance of parents who are afraid to own him i dare say now miles that you knew and loved and respected your mother  love and respect her i worshipped her marble and she deserved it all if ever human being did  yes yes i can understand that returned marble making a hole in the sand with his heel and looking both thoughtful and melancholy it must be a great comfort to love and respect a mother ive seen them particularly young women that i thought set quite as much store by their mothers as they did by themselves well no matter i got into one of poor captain robbinss bloody currents at the first start and have been drifting about ever since just like the whaleboat with which we fell in pretty much as the wind blew they hadnt the decency to pin even a namethey might have got one out of a novel or a storybook you know to start a poor fellow in life withto my shirt nothey just set me afloat on that bit of a tombstone and cast off the standing part of what fastened me to anything human there they left me to generalize on the arth and its ways to my hearts content  and you were found next morning by the stonecutter when he came again to use his chisel  prophecy couldnt have better foretold what happened  there i was found sure enough and there i made my first escape from destruction seeing the basket which it seems was one in which he had brought his own dinner the day before and forgotten to carry away with him he gave it a jerk to cast away the leavings before he handed it to the child who had come to take it home in order that it might be filled again when out i rolled on the cold stone  there i lay as near the grave as a tombstone when i was just a week old  poor fellowyou could only know this by report however  and what was done with you  i suppose if the truth were known my father was somewhere about that yard and little do i envy the old gentleman his feelings if he reflected much over matters and things i was sent to the almshouse however stonecutters being natrally hardhearted i suppose the fact that i was left among such people makes me think so much the more that my own father must have been one of them or it never could have happened at all events i was soon rated on the almshouse books and the first thing they did was to give me some name i was no 19 for about a week at the age of fourteen days i became moses marble  it was an odd selection that your sponsors in baptism made  somewhatmoses came from the scripturs they tell me there being a person of that name as i understand who was turned adrift pretty much as i was myself  why yesso far as the basket and the abandonment were concerned but he was put afloat fairly and not clapped on a tombstone as if to threaten him with the grave at the very outset  well tombstone came very near being my name at first they thought of giving me the name of the man for whom the stone was intended but that being zollickoffer they thought i never should be able to spell it then came tombstone which they thought melancholy and so they called me marble consaiting i suppose it would make me tough  how long did you remain in the almshouse and at what age did you first go to sea  i staid among them the public feeds until i was eight years old and then i took a hazy day to cut adrift from charity at that time miles our country belonged to the britishor they treated it as if it did though ive heard wiser men than myself say it was always our own the king of england only happening to be our kingbut i was born a british subject and being now just forty you can understand i went to sea several years before the revolution  trueyou must have seen service in that war on one side or the other  if you say both sides youll not be out of the way in 1775 i was a foretopman in the romeny 50 where i remained until i was transferred to the connecticut 74  the what said i in surprise had the english a lineofbattle ship called the connecticut  as near as i could make it out i always thought it a big compliment for john bull to pay the yankees  perhaps the name of your ship was the carnatic the sounds are not unlike  blast me if i dont think youve hit it miles well im glad of it for i run from the ship and i shouldnt half like the thought of serving a countryman such a trick yes i then got on board of one of our sloops and tried my hand at settling the account with my old masters i was taken prisoner for my pains but worried through the war without getting my neck stretched they wanted to make it out on board the old jarsey that i was an englishman but i told em just to prove it let em only prove where i was born i said and i would give it up i was ready to be hanged if they could only prove where i was born d but i sometimes thought i never was born at all  you are surely an american marble a manhattanese born and educated  why as it is not likely any person would import a child a week old to plant it on a tombstone i conclude i am yes i must be that and i have sometimes thought of laying claim to the property of trinity church on the strength of my birthright well as soon as the war was over and i got out of prison and that was shortly after you were born captain wallingford i went to work regularly and have been ever since sarving as dickey or chiefmate on board of some craft or other if i had no family bosom to go into as a restingplace i had my bosom to fill with solid beef and pork and that is not to be done by idleness  and all this time my good friend you have been living as it might be alone in the world without a relative of any sort  as sure as you are there often and often have i walked through the streets of new york and said to myself among all these people there is not one that i can call a relation my blood is in no mans veins but my own  this was said with a bitter sadness that surprised me  obdurate and insensible to suffering as marble had ever appeared to me i was not prepared to find him giving such evidence of feeling i was then young but now am old and one of the lessons learned in the years that have intervened is not to judge of men by appearances so much sensibility is hidden beneath assumed indifference so much suffering really exists behind smiling countenances and so little does the exterior tell the true story of all that is to be found within that i am now slow to yield credence to the lying surfaces of things most of all had i learned to condemn that heartless injustice of the world that renders it so prompt to decide on rumour and conjectures constituting itself a judge from which there shall be no appeal in cases in which it has not taken the trouble to examine and which it had not even the power to examine evidence  we are all of the same family my friend i answered with a good design at least though a little separated by time and accidents  familyyes i belong to my own family im a more important man in my family than bonaparte is in his for i am all in all ancestors present time and posterity  it is at least your own fault you are the last why not marry and have children  because my parents did not set me the example answered marble almost fiercely then clapping his hand on my shoulder in a friendly way as if to soothe me after so sharp a rejoinder he added in a gentler tonecome miles the major and his daughter will want their breakfasts and we had better join them talking of matrimony theres the girl for you my boy thrown into your arms almost natrally as one might say  i am far from being so sure of that marble i answered as both began to walk slowly towards the tent major merton might hot think it an honour in the first place to let his daughter marry a yankee sailor  not such a one as myself perhaps but why not one like you how many generations have there been of you now at the place you call clawbonny  four from father to son and all of us miles wallingfords  well the old spanish proverb says it takes three generations to make a gentleman and here you have four to start upon in my family all the generations have been on the same level and i count myself old in my sphere  it is odd that a man like you should know anything of old spanish proverbs  what of such a proverb think you miles a man without even a father or motherwho never had either as one may sayand he not remember such a proverb boy boy i never forget anything that so plainly recalls the tombstone and the basket and the almshouse and moses and the names  but miss merton might object to the present generation i resumed willing to draw my companion from his bitter thoughts however favourably disposed her father might prove to the last  that will be your own fault then here you have her but on the pacific ocean all to yourself and if you cannot tell your own story and that in a way to make her believe it you are not the lad i take you for  i made an evasive and laughing answer but being quite near the tent by this time it was necessary to change the discourse the reader may think it odd but that was the very first time the possibility of my marrying emily merton ever crossed my mind in london i had regarded her as an agreeable acquaintance with just as much of the colouring of romance and of the sentimental about our intercourse as is common with youths of nineteen and girls a little younger but as nothing more when we met on the island emily appeared to me like a frienda female friendand of course one to be viewed with peculiarly softened feelings still as only a friend during the month we had just passed in the same ship this tie had gradually strengthened and i confess to a perfect consciousness of there being on board a pretty girl in her nineteenth year of agreeable manners delicate sentiments and one whose presence gave the crisis a charm she certainly never enjoyed during poor captain williamss time notwithstanding all this there was somethingthough what that something was i did not then know myselfwhich prevented me from absolutely falling in love with my fair guest nevertheless marbles suggestion was not unpleasant to me but on the other hand it rather conduced to the satisfaction of my present visit  we were kindly received by our hosts who always seemed to remember the commencement of our acquaintance when marble and myself visited them together the breakfast had a little of the land about it for mons le comptes garden still produced a few vegetables such as lettuce peppergrass radishes c most of which however had sown themselves three or four fowls too that he had left on the island in the hurry of his departure had begun to lay and neb having found a nest we had the very unusual treat of fresh eggs i presume no one will deny that they were sufficiently countrylaid  emily and myself consider ourselves as old residents here the major observed as he gazed around him the table being set in the open air under some trees and i could almost find it in my heart to remain on this beautiful island for the remainder of my daysquite i think were it not for my poor girl who might find the society of her old father rather dull work at her time of life  well major said marble you have only to let your taste be known to have the chice among all our youngsters to be her companion there is mr talcott a welledicated and mannerly lad enough and of good connexions they tell me and as for captain wallingford here i will answer for him my life on it he would give up clawbonny and the property on which he is the fourth of his name to be king or prince of wales of this island with such company  now it was marble and not i who made this speech and yet i heartily wished it unsaid it made me feel foolish and i dare say it made me look foolish and i know it caused emily to blush poor girl she who blushed so easily and was so sensitive and so delicately situatedshe was entitled to have more respect paid to her feelings the major and marble however took it all very coolly continuing the discourse as if nothing out of the way had been said  no doubtno doubt answered the first romance always finds votaries among young people and this place may well excite romantic feelings in those who are older than these young men do you know gentlemen that ever since i have known this island i have had a strong desire to pass the remainder of my days on it the idea i have just mentioned to you therefore is by no means one of a moments existence  i am glad at least dear sir observed emily laughing that the desire has not been so strong as to induce you to make formal proposals on the subject  you indeed are the great obstacle for what could i do with a discontented girl whose mind would be running on balls theatres and other amusements we should not have even a church  and major merton i put in what could you or any other man do with himself in a place like this without companions books or occupation   if a conscientious man miles he might think over the past if a wise one he would certainly reflect on the future i should have books since emily and i could muster several hundred volumes between us and with books i should have companions  what could i do i should have everything to create as it might be and the pleasure of seeing everything rising up under my own hand there would be a house to constructthe materials of that wreck to collectropes canvass timber tar sugar and divers other valuables that are still out on the reef or which lie scattered about on the beach to gather together and save against a rainy day  then i would have a thought for my poultry and possibly you might be persuaded to leave me one or two of these pigs of which i see the french forgot half a dozen in their haste to cheat the spaniards oh i should live like a prince and be a prince regnant in the bargain  yes sir you would be captain and all hands if that would be any gratification but i think you would soon weary of your government and be ready to abdicate  perhaps so miles yet the thought is pleasant to me but for this dear girl it would be particularly so i have very few relatives the nearest i have being oddly enough your own countrypeople gentlemen my mother was a native of boston where my father a merchant married her and i came very near being a yankee myself having been born but a week after my parents landed in england on my fathers side i have not five recognised relatives and they are rather distant while those on my mothers are virtually all strangers then i never owned a foot of this earth on which we live in my life  nor i interrupted marble with emphasis  my father was a younger son and younger sons in england are generally lacklands my life has been such and i may add my means such that i have never been in the way of purchasing even enough earth to bury me in and here you see is an estate that can be had for asking  how much land do you fancy there is in this island gentlemen  i mean apart from the beach the sands and rocks but such as has grass and bears treesground that might be tilled and rendered productive without much labour  a hundred thousand acres exclaimed marble whose calculation was received with a general laugh  it seems rather larger to me sir i answered than the farm at clawbonny perhaps there may be six or eight hundred acres of the sort of land you mention though the whole island must contain several thousandspossibly four or five  well four or five thousand acres of land make a good estatebut as i see emily is getting frightened and is nervous under the apprehension of falling heir to such extensive possessions i will say no more about them  no more was said and we finished our breakfasts conversing of the past rather than of the future the major and marble went to stroll along the groves in the direction of the wreck while i persuaded emily to put on her hat and strollthe other way  this is a singular notion of my fathers my fair companion remarked after a moment of musing nor is it the first time i do assure you on which he has mentioned it  while we were here before he spoke of it daily  the scheme might do well enough for two ardent lovers said i laughing but would scarcely be wise for an elderly gentleman and his daughter i can imagine that two young people warmly attached to each other might get along in such a place for a year or two without hanging themselves but i fancy even love would tire out after a while and they would set about building a boat in which to be off  you are not very romantic i perceive mr wallingford emily answered and i thought a little reproachfully  now i own that to my taste i could be happy anywherehere as well as in london surrounded by my nearest and dearest friends  surrounded ay that would be a very different matter  let me have your father yourself honest marble good mr hardinge rupert dear dear grace and lucy with neb and some others of my own blacks and i should ask no better home the island is only in twenty has plenty of shade some delicious fruits and would be easily tilledone might do here i acknowledge and it would be pleasant to found a colony  and who are all these people you love so well mr  wallingford that their presence would make a desert island pleasant  in the first place major merton is a halfpay officer in the british service who has been appointed to some civil station in indiai answered gallantly he is a respectable agreeable wellinformed gentleman a little turned of fifty who might act as judge and chancellor then he has a daughter  i know more of her and her bad qualities than you do yourself sirebut who are rupert and grace and lucydear dear grace especially  dear dearest grace madam is my sistermy only sisterall the sister i ever can have either by marriage or any other means and sisters are usually dear to young men i believe  welli knew you had a sister and a dear sister but i also knew you had but one now as to rupert  he is not another sister you may be well assured i have mentioned to you a friend from childhood who went to sea with me at first but disliking the business has since commenced the study of the law  that then is rupert i remember some such touches of his character but did not know the name now proceed on to the next  what nebyou know him almost as well as i do myself he is yonder feeding the chickens and will save his passage money  but you spoke of anotherthat iswas there not a mr hardinge was the name i think  oh truei forgot mr hardinge and lucy though they would be two of the most important of the colonists  mr hardinge is my guardian and will continue to be so a few months longer and lucy is his daughterruperts sisterthe old gentleman is a clergyman and would help us to keep sundays as one should and might perform the marriage ceremony should it ever be required  not much danger of that i fancy on your desert islandyour barratariaobserved miss merton quickly  i cannot explain the sensitiveness of certain young ladies on such points unless it be through their consciousness  now had i been holding this idle talk with lucy the dear honest creature would have laughed blushed ever so little possibly and nodded her head in frank assent or perhaps she would have said oh certainly in a way to show that she had no desire to affect so silly a thing as to wish one to suppose she thought young people would not get married at marble land as well as clawbonny or new york miss merton however saw fit to change the discourse which soon turned on her fathers health on this subject she was natural and full of strong affection she was anxious to get the major out of the warm latitudes his liver had been touched in the west indies but he had hoped that he was cured or he never would have accepted the bombay appointment experience however was giving reason to suspect the contrary and emily wished him in a cold climate as soon as possible and that with an earnestness that showed she regarded all that had been said about the island as sheer pleasantry we continued the conversation for an hour when returning to the tent i left my fair companion with a promise to be as active as possible in order to carry the ship into a higher latitude still i did not deem the island a particularly dangerous place notwithstanding its position the trades and sea breezes with its ample shades rendering the spot one of the most delightful tropical abodes i had ever been in  after quitting emily i went to join marble who was alone pacing a spot beneath the trees that poor le compte had worn into a path and which he had himself called his quarterdeck   this major merton is a sensible man miles the exmate began as soon as i dropped in alongside of him and joined in his semitrot a downright sensible sort of a philosopherlike man accordin to my notion  what has he been telling you now that has seized your fancy so much stronger than common  why i was thinking of this idee of his to remain on the island and pass the remainder of the vyge here without slaving day and night to get up two or three rounds of the ladder of promotion only to fall down again  and did the major speak of such things i know of no disappointments of his to sour him with the world  i was not speaking for major merton but for myself miles to tell you the truth boy this idee seems just suited to me and i have almost made up my mind to remain behind here when you sail  i looked at marble with astonishment the subject on which the major had spoken in pleasantry rather than with any real design of carrying his project into execution was one that my old messmate regarded seriously i had noted the attention with which he listened to our discourse during breakfast and the strong feeling with which he spoke at the time but had no notion of the cause of either i knew the man too well not to understand at once that he was in sober earnest and had too much experience of his nature not to foresee the greatest difficulty in turning him from his purpose i understood the true motive to be professional mortification at all that occurred since he had succeeded captain williams in command for marble was much too honest and too manly to think for a moment of concealing his own misfortunes behind the mantle offered by my success  you have not thought of this matter sufficiently my friend i answered evasively knowing the folly of attempting to laugh the matter offwhen you have slept on it a night you will see things differently  i fancy not miles here is all i want and just what i want after you have taken away everything that can be required for the vessels or desirable to the owners there will be enough left to keep me a dozen lives  it is not on account of food that i speakthe island alone in its fruits fish and birds to say nothing as to the seeds and fowls and pigs we could leave you would be sufficient to keep fifty men but think of the solitude the living without object the chances of sicknessthe horrible death that would follow to one unable to rise and assist himself and all the other miseries of being alone depend on it man was not created to live alone society is indispensable to him and  i have thought of it all and find it entirely to my taste  i tell you miles i should be exactly in my sphere in this island and that as a hermit i do not say i should not like some company if it could be yourself or talcott or the major or even neb but no company is better than bad and as for asking or allowing any one to stay with me it is out of the question i did at first think of keeping the sandwich islanders but it would be bad faith and they would not be likely to remain quiet after the ship had sailed  no i will remain alone you will probably report the island when you get home and that will induce some vessel which may be passing near to look for me so i shall hear of you all every four or five years  gracious heaven marble you cannot be serious in so mad a design  just look at my situation miles and decide for yourself  i am without a friend on earthi mean natral friendi know what sort of friend you are and parting with you will be the toughest of allbut i have not a relation on the wide earthno property no home no one to wish to see me return not even a cellar to lay my head in to me all places are alike with the exception of this which having discovered i look upon as my own  you have a country marble and that is the next thing to family and homeovershadows all  ay and ill have a country here this will be america having been discovered by americans and in their possession you will leave me the buntin and ill show the stars and stripes of a 4th of july just as you will show em in some other part of the world i was born yankee at least and ill die yankee ive sailed under that flag boy ever since the year 77 and will not sail under another you may depend on it  i never could justify myself to the laws for leaving a man behind me in such a place  then ill run and that will make all right but you know well enough boy that leaving a captain is one thing and leaving a man another  and what shall i tell all your acquaintances those who have sailed with you so often and so long has become of their old shipmate  tell em that the man who was once found is now lost answered marble bitterly but i am not such a fool as to think myself of so much importance as you seem to imagine the only persons who will consider the transaction of any interest will be the newspaper gentry and they will receive it only as news and thank you about half as much as they would for a murder or a robbery or the poisoning of a mother and six little children  i think after all you would scarcely find the means of supporting yourself i added looking round in affected doubt for i felt at each instant how likely my companion was to adhere to his notion and this from knowing him so well i doubt if the cocoa is healthy all the year round and there must be seasons when the trees do not bear  have no fear of that sort i have my own fowlingpiece and you will leave me a musket or two with some ammunition transient vessels now the island is known will keep up the supply there are two hens setting at this moment and a third has actually hatched then one of the men tells me there is a litter of pigs near the mouth of the bay as for the hogs and the poultry the shellfish and berries will keep them but there are fifteen hogsheads of sugar on the beach besides thirty or forty more in the wreck and all above water there are casks of beans and peas the seastores of the french besides lots of other things i can plant and fish and shoot and make a fence from the ropes of the wreck and have a large garden and all that a man can want our own poultry you know has long been out but there is still a bushel of indiancorn left that was intended for their feed one quart of that will make me a rich man in such a climate as this and with soil like that on the flat between the two groves i own a chest of tools and am shipfashion both a tolerable carpenter and blacksmith and i do not see that i shall want for anything you must leave half the things that are scattered about and so far from being a man to be pitied i shall be a man to be envied thousands of wretches in the greatest thoroughfares of london would gladly exchange their crowded streets and poverty for my solitude and abundance  i began to think marble was not in a state of mind to reason with and changed the subject the day passed in recreation as had been intended and next morning we set about filling up the schooner we struck in all the copper all the english goods and such portions of the frenchmans cargo as would be most valuable in america marble however had announced to others his determination to remain behind to abandon the seas and to turn hermit  as his first step he gave up the command of the pretty poll and i was obliged to restore her again to our old thirdmate who was every way competent to take care of her at the end of the week the schooner was ready and despairing of getting marble off in her i ordered her to sail for home viâ cape horn giving especial instructions not to attempt magellan i wrote to the owners furnishing an outline of all that had occurred and of my future plans simply remarking that mr marble had declined acting out of motives of delicacy since the recapture of the ship and that in future their interests must remain in my care  with these despatches the schooner sailed marble and i watched her until her sails became a white speck on the ocean after which she suddenly disappeared  as for the ship she was all ready and my only concern now was in relation to marble i tried the influence of major merton but unfortunately that gentleman had already said too much in favour of our friends scheme in ignorance of its effect to gain much credit when he turned round and espoused the other side the arguments of emily failed also in fact it was not reason but feeling that governed marble and in a bitter hour he had determined to pass the remainder of his days where he was  finding all persuasion useless and the season approaching when the winds rendered it necessary to sail i was compelled to yield or resort to force the last i was reluctant to think of nor was i certain the men would have obeyed me had i ordered them to use it marble had been their commander so long that he might at any moment have reassumed the charge of the ship and it was not probable his orders would have been braved under any circumstances that did not involve illegality or guilt after a consultation with the major i found it necessary to yield to this whim though i did so with greater reluctance than i ever experienced on any other occasion    chapter xx    pass on relentless world i grieve     no more for all that thou hast riven   pass on in gods nameonly leave     the things thou never yet hast given   lunt   after every means had been uselessly exhausted to persuade marble from his design it only remained to do all we could to make him comfortable and secure of enemies there was no danger and care was not necessary for defence  we got together however some of the timber planks and other materials that were remaining at the shipyard and built him a cabin that offered much better shelter against the tropical storms that sometimes prevailed than any tent could yield we made this cabin as wide as a plank is long or twelve feet and some five or six feet longer  it was well sided and tightly roofed having three windows and a door the lights of the wreck supplied the first and her cabindoor the last we had hinges and everything that was necessary to keep things in their place there was no chimney required fire being unnecessary for warmth in that climate but the french had brought their camboose from the wreck and this we placed under a proper covering at a short distance from the hut the strength of one man being insufficient to move it we also enclosed by means of ropes and posts made of the ribs of the wreck a plot of ground of two acres in extent where the land was the richest and unshaded so as to prevent the pigs from injuring the vegetables and poor marble knowing little of gardening i had a melancholy pleasure in seeing the whole piece dug or rather hoed up and sown and planted myself before we sailed we put in corn potatoes peas beans lettuce radishes and several other things of which we found the seeds in the french garden we took pains moreover to transport from the wreck many articles that it was thought might prove of use though they were too heavy for marble to handle as there were near forty of us all busy in this way for three or four days we effected a great deal and may be said to have got the island in order i felt the same interest in the duty that i should in bestowing a child for life  marble himself was not much among us all this time  he rather complained that i should leave him nothing to do though i could see he was touched by the interest we manifested in his welfare the french launch had been used as the means of conveyance between the wreck and the beach and we found it where it had been left by its original owners anchored toleeward of the island and abreast of the ship it was the last thing i meddled with and it was my care to put it in such a state that at need it might be navigated across that tranquil sea to some other island should marble feel a desire to abandon his solitude  the disposition i made of the boat was as follows  the launch was large and coppered and it carried two lugsails i had both masts stepped with the yards sails sheets c prepared and put in their places a stout rope was next carried round the entire boat outside and a few inches below the gunwale where it was securely nailed  from this rope led a number of lanyards with eyes turned into their ends through these eyes i rove a sort of ridgerope leading it also through the eyes of several stancheons that were firmly stepped on the thwarts the effect when the ridgerope was set up was to give the boat the protection of this waistcloth which inclined inboard however sufficiently to leave an open passage between the two sides of only about half the beam of the boat to the ridgerope and lanyards i had tarpaulins firmly attached tacking their lower edges strongly to the outer sides of the boat by this arrangement when all was in its place and properly secured a sea might break or a wave slap against the boat without her taking in much water it doubled her security in this particular more than answering the purposes of a halfdeck and washboard it is true a very heavy wave might carry all away but very heavy waves would probably fill the boat under any circumstances such a craft could only find safety in her buoyancy and we made her as safe as an undecked vessel very well could be  marble watched me while i was superintending these changes in the boat with a good deal of interest and one eveningi had announced an intention to sail next morning the major and emily having actually gone on boardthat evening he got my arm and led me away from the spot like a man who has urgent business i could see that he was much affected and had strong hopes he intended to announce a change of purpose his hand actually trembled the whole time it grasped my arm  god bless you milesgod bless you dear boy he said speaking with difficulty as soon as we were out of earshot from the others if any being could make me pine for the world it would be such a friend as you i could live on without father or mother brother or sister ship or confidence of my owners good name even were i sure of meeting such a lad as yourself in only every thousandth man i fell in with but young as you are you know how it is with mankind and no more need be said about it all i ask now is that you will knock off with this making him comfortable as you call it or youll leave me nothing to do for myself i can fit out that boat as well as eer a man in the crisis id have you to know  i am well aware of that my friend but i am not so certain that you would in that boat i am in hopes you will follow us out to sea and come on board again and take your old place as master  marble shook his head and i believe he saw by my manner that i had no serious expectations of the sort i named we walked some distance farther in silence before he again spoke then he said suddenly and in a way to show how much his mind was troubled  miles my dear fellow you must let me hear from you  hear from me by what means pray you cannot expect the postmastergeneral will make a mailroute between new york and this island  poh im getting old and losing my memory i was generalizing on friendship and the like of that and the idee ran away with me i know of course when you are out of sight that i shall be cut off from the rest of the worldprobably shall never see a human face again but what of that my time cannot be long now and i shall have the fish fowls and pigs to talk to to tell you the truth miles miss merton gave me her own bible yesterday and at my request she pointed out that part which gives the account about moses in the bulrushes and ive just been looking it over it is easy enough now to understand why i was called moses  but moses did not think it necessary to go and live in a desert or on an uninhabited island merely because he was found in those bulrushes  that moses had no occasion to be ashamed of his parents  it was fear not shame that sent him adrift nor did moses ever let a set of lubberly frenchmen seize a fine stout ship like the crisis with a good ablebodied crew of forty men on board her  come marble you have too much sense to talk in this manner it is fortunately not too late to change your mind and i will let it be understood that you did so at my persuasion  this was the commencement of a final effort on my part to induce my friend to abandon his mad project we conversed quite an hour until i had exhausted my breath as well as my arguments indeed and all without the least success i pointed out to him the miserable plight he must be in in the event of illness but it was an argument that had no effect on a man who had never had even a headach in his life as for society he cared not a straw for it when ashore he often boasted and he could not yet appreciate the effects of total solitude once or twice remarks escaped him as if he thought it possible i might one day return but they were ventured in pleasantry rather than with any appearance of seriousness i could see that the selfdevoted hermit had his misgivings but i could obtain no verbal concession from him to that effect he was reminded that the ship must positively sail next day since it would not do to trifle with the interests of the owners any longer  i know it miles marble answered and no more need be said on the subject your people are through with their work and here comes neb to report the boat ready to go off i shall try my hand ashore tonight alone in the morning i suppose you would like to take an old shipmate by the hand for the last time and you will natrally look for me at the waterside goodnight before we part however i may as well thank you for the supply of clothes i see you have put in my hut it was scarcely wanted as i have enough needles and thread to supply a slopshop and the old duck left by the french will keep me in jackets and trowsers for the remainder of my days goodnight my dear boy god bless yougod bless you  it was nearly dark but i could see that marbles eyes looked moist and feel that his hand again trembled i left him not without the hope that the solitude of this night the first in which he had been left by himself would have the effect to lessen his desire to be a hermit when i turned in it was understood that all hands were to be called at daylight and the ship unmoored  talcott came to call me at the indicated moment i had made him chiefmate and taken one of the philadelphians for second officer a young man who had every requisite for the station and one more than was necessary or a love of liquor but drunkards do tolerably well on board a ship in which reasonable discipline is maintained for that matter neptune ought to be a profound moralist as youths are very generally sent to sea to cure most of the ethical flings talcott was directed to unmoor and heave short  as for myself i got into a boat and pulled ashore with an intention of making a last and strong appeal to marble  no one was visible on the island when we reached it  the pigs and fowls were already in motion however and were gathering near the door of the hut where marble was accustomed to feed them about that hour the fowls on sugar principally i proceeded to the door opened it entered the place and found it empty its late inmate was then up and abroad he had probably passed a sleepless night and sought relief in the fresh air of the morning i looked for him in the adjacent grove on the outer beach and in most of his usual haunts he was nowhere visible  a little vexed at having so long a walk before me at a moment when we were so much pressed for time i was about to follow the grove to a distant part of the island to a spot that i knew marble frequented a good deal when moody but my steps were arrested by an accidental glance at the lagoon i missed the frenchmans launch or the boat i had myself caused to be rigged with so much care the previous day for the intended hermits especial advantage  this was a large boat one that had been constructed to weigh a heavy anchor and i had left her moored between a grapnel and the shore so securely as to forbid the idea she could have been moved in so quiet a time without the aid of hands rushing to the water i got into my own boat and pulled directly on board  on reaching the ship a muster of all hands was ordered  the result proved that everybody was present and at duty  it followed that marble alone had carried the boat out of the lagoon the men who had had the anchorwatches during the past night were questioned on the subject but no one had seen or heard anything of a movement in the launch mr talcott was told to continue his duty while i went aloft myself to look at the offing i was soon in the maintopmast crosstrees where a view was commanded of the whole island a few covers excepted of all the water within the reef and of a wide range without nowhere was the boat or marble to be seen it was barely possible that he had concealed himself behind the wreck though i did not see how even this could be done unless he had taken the precaution to strike the launchs masts  by this time our last anchor was aweigh and the ship was clear of the bottom the topsails had been hoisted before i went aloft and everything was now ready for filling away too anxious to go on deck under such circumstances and a lofty position being the best for ascertaining the presence of rocks i determined to remain where i was and conn the ship through the passes in my own person  an order was accordingly given to set the jib and to swing the headyards and get the spanker on the ship in a minute the crisis was again in motion moving steadily towards the inlet as the lagoon was not entirely free from danger coral rocks rising in places quite near the surface of the water i was obliged to be attentive to the pilots duty until we got into the outer bay when this particular danger in a great measure disappeared i could then look about me with more freedom though we so far changed our position as respected the wreck as to open new views of it no launch was to be seen behind it by the time the ship reached the passage through the reef i had little hope of finding it there  we had got to be too familiar with the channels to have any difficulty in taking the ship through them and we were soon fairly to windward of the reef our course however lay to leeward and we passed round the southern side of the rocks under the same easy canvass until we got abreast and within half a cables length of the wreck to aid my own eyes i had called up talcott and neb but neither of us could obtain the least glimpse of the launch  nothing was to be seen about the wreck though i took the precaution to send a boat to it all was useless marble had gone out to sea quite alone in the frenchmans launch and though twenty pairs of eyes were now aloft no one could even fancy that he saw anything in the offing that resembled a boat  talcott and myself had a private interview on the subject of marbles probable course my mate was of opinion that our friend had made the best of his way for some of the inhabited islands unwilling to remain here when it came to the pinch and yet ashamed to rejoin us i could hardly believe this in such a case i thought he would have waited until we had sailed when he might have left the island also and nobody been the wiser to this talcott answered that marble probably feared our importunities possibly compulsion  it seemed singular to me that a man who regretted his hasty decision should adopt such a course and yet i was at a loss to explain the matter much more to my own satisfaction nevertheless there was no remedy we were as much in the dark as it was possible to be with a knowledge of the circumstance that the bird had flown  we hovered around the reef for several hours most of which time i passed in the crosstrees and some of it on the royalyard once i thought i saw a small speck on the ocean dead to windward that resembled a boats sail but there were so many birds flying about and glancing beneath the suns rays that i was reluctantly compelled to admit it was probably one of them at meridian therefore i gave the order to square away and to make sail on our course  this was done with the greatest reluctance however and not without a good deal of vaciliation of purpose the ship moved away from the land rapidly and by two oclock the line of cocoanut trees that fringed the horizon astern sunk entirely beneath the rolling margin of our view from that moment i abandoned the expectation of ever seeing moses marble again though the occurrence left all of us sad for several days  major merton and his daughter were on the poop nearly the whole of this morning neither interfered in the least for the old soldier was too familiar with discipline to venture an opinion concerning the management of the ship when we met at dinner however the conversation naturally turned on the disappearance of our old friend  it is a thousand pities that pride should have prevented marble from acknowledging his mistake observed the major and thus kept him from getting a safe passage to canton where he might have left you and joined another ship had he thought it necessary  where we shall do the same thing i suppose dear sir added emily with a manner that i thought marked and thus relieve captain wallingford from the encumbrance of our presence  mecall your delightful society anything but an enumbrance i beg of you miss merton i rejoined in haste  now that mr le compte has furnished this comfortable cabin and you are no longer at any inconvenience to yourselves i would not be deprived of the advantage and pleasure of this association for more than i dare mention  emily looked gratified while her father appeared to me to be thoughtful after a brief pause however the major resumed the discourse  i should certainly feel myself bound to make many apologies for the trouble we are giving he said especially since i understand from wallingford he will not accept either for himself or his owners anything like compensation even for the food we consume were it not that we are here by constraint and not by any agency of our own  as soon as we reach canton however i shall feel it a duty to get on board the first english ship that will receive us  i stole a glance at emily but could not understand the expression of her countenance as she heard this announcement  of course i made an earnest protest against the majors doing anything of the sort and yet i could not well find any sufficient reason for urging him to remain where he was beyond my own gratification i could not go to either england or bombay and i took it for granted major merton wished to proceed at once to one if not to both of these places we conversed a little generally perhaps on the subject for some time longer and when i left the cabin it struck me emilys melancholy had in no degree lessened  it is a long road to traverse over half of the pacific  weeks and weeks were thus occupied talcott and myself profiting by every suitable occasion to enjoy the advantages of the association chance had thus thrown in our way i make no doubt i was greatly benefited by my constant communications with the mertons the major being a cultivated though not a particularly brilliant man while i conceive it to be utterly impossible for two young men of our time of life and profession to be daily almost hourly in the company of a young woman like emily merton without losing some of the peculiar roughness of the sea and getting in its place some small portion of the gentler qualities of the saloon i date a certain a plomb an absence of shyness in the company of females from this habitual intercourse with one of the sex who had herself been carefully educated in the conventionalities of respectable if not of very elegant or sophisticated society  at length we reached the china seas and falling in to windward we made a quick run to canton it now became necessary for me to attend to the ship and the interests of my owners suffering my passengers to land at whampoa with the understanding we were to meet before either party sailed i soon disposed of the sandalwood and skins and found no difficulty in procuring teas nankins chinaware and the other articles pointed out in the instructions to poor captain williams i profited by the occasion also to make certain purchases on my own account that i had a presentiment would be particularly agreeable to the future mistress of clawbonny let that lady turn out to be whomsoever she might the dollars obtained on the west coast of south america enabled me to do this my instructions giving the necessary authority to use a few of them on private account  my privilege as master rendered all proper  in a word the residence of six or eight weeks at canton proved a very advantageous affair for those whose money was embarked in the crisis sandalwood and seaotter skins brought particularly high prices while teas and the manufactures of the country happened to be low i had no merit in this not a particle and yet i reaped the advantage so far as advantage was connected with the mere reputation of the voyage success being of nearly as great account in commerce as in war it is true i worked like a dog for i worked under an entirely novel sense of responsibility and with a feeling i am certain that could never have oppressed me in the care of my own property and i deserved some portion of the credit subsequently obtained  at all events i was heartily rejoiced when the hatches were on and the ship was once more ready for sea  it now became a duty as well as a pleasure to seek major merton whom i had seen but once or twice during the last two months he had passed that time at whampao while i had been either at the factories or on board the major was occupied when i called and emily received me alone when she learned that i was ready to sail for home and had come to take my leave it was easy to see that she was uneasy if not distressed i felt unhappy at parting too and perhaps i had less scruple about saying as much  god only knows miss merton whether we are ever to be permitted to see each other again i remarked after the preliminary explanations had been made  the reader will remember that i am now an old man and that vanity no longer has any of that influence over me which it might be supposed to possess over one of more juvenile hopes and feelings that i relate facts without reference to their effect on myself beyond the general salvo of some lingering weaknesses of humanity i trust therefore i shall be understood in all my necessary allusions to the estimation in which i was apparently held by others  emily fairly started when i made this remark concerning the probable duration of the approaching separation and the colour left her cheek her pretty white hand shook so that she had difficulty in using her needle and there was an appearance of agitation and distress about the charming girl that i had never before witnessed in one whose manner was usually so selfpossessed and calm i now know the reason why i did not throw myself on my knees and beg the charming girl to consent to accompany me to america though i wondered at myself afterwards when i came to reflect coolly on all that passed for my stoicism i will not affirm that i fancied emilys agitation to be altogether owing to myself but i confess to an inability to account for it in any other manner as agreeable to myself the appearance of major merton at that instant however prevented everything like a scene and probably restored us both to a consciousness of the necessity of seeming calm as for the major himself he was evidently far from being unconcerned something having occurred to disturb him so very apparent was this that i commenced the discourse by asking if he were unwell  always that i fear miles he answered my physician has just told me frankly unless i get into a cold climate as soon as possible my life will not be worth six months purchase  then sail with me sir i cried with an eagerness and heartiness that must have proved my sincerity happily i am not too late to make the offer and as for getting away i am ready to sail tomorrow  i am forbidden to go near bombay continued the major looking anxiously at his daughter and that appointment must be abandoned if i could continue to hold it there is no probability of a chance to reach my station this halfyear  so much the better for me sir in four or five months from this moment i will land you in new york where you will find the climate cold enough for any disease i ask you as friendsas guestsnot as passengers and to prove it the table of the upper cabin in future shall be mine i have barely left room in the lower cabin to sleep or dress in having filled it with my own private venture as is my right  you are as generous as kind miles but what will your owners think of such an arrangement  they have no right to complain the cabin and passengers should any of the last offer after deducting a very small allowance for the ships portion of the food and water are mine by agreement all the better food i find at my own charge and should you insist on remunerating the owners for the coarser or such as they find you can do so it will be less than a hundred dollars at the most  on these conditions then i shall thankfully profit by your offer attaching however one more that i trust you may be permitted to fulfil it is important to me that i reach englandcan you touch at st helena  willingly if it be your wish the health of the crew moreover may render it desirable  there then i will quit you if an opportunity offer to proceed to england our bargain is made dear miles and tomorrow i shall be ready to embark  i think emily never looked more beautiful than she did while listening to this arrangement it doubtless relieved her mind on the painful subject of her fathers health and i fancied it relieved it also on the subject of our own immediate separation months must elapse before we could reach st helena and who could foresee what those months might bring forth as i had a good deal to do at such a moment i took my leave with my feelings lightened as it might be of a burthen the reader will at once infer i was in love  but he will be mistaken i was not in love though my imagination to use a cant phrase of some of the sects was greatly exercised lucy even then had a hold of my heart in a way of which i was ignorant myself but it was not in nature for a youth just approaching his majority to pass months and months almost alone in the society of a lovely girl who was a year or two his junior and not admit some degree of tenderness towards her in big feelings the circumstances were sufficient to try the constancy of the most faithful swain that ever lived then it must be remembered that i had never professed love to lucywas not at all aware that she entertained any other sentiment towards me than that she entertained towards rupert whereas emily but i will not prove myself a coxcomb on paper whatever i might have been at the moment in my own imagination  next day at the appointed hour i had the happiness to receive my old passengers it struck me that talcott was as much gratified as i was myself for he too had both pleasure and improvement in emily mortons society  it has often been said that the english eastindia ships are noted for quarrelling and making love the quarrels may be accounted for on the same principle as the lovemaking viz propinquity the same proximity producing hostility in whose sterner natures that in others of a gentler cast produces its opposite feeling we sailed and it is scarcely necessary to tell the reader how much the tedium of so long a voyage and the monotony of a seavoyage was relieved by the graces and gentle intercourse of our upper cabin  the other apartment being so crowded and hot i passed most of my time in the poop which was both light and airy  here i generally found the father and daughter though often the latter alone i played reasonably well on the flute and violin and had learned to accompany emily on her piano which it will be remembered mons le compte had caused to be transferred from the bombay ship to his own vessel and which had subsequently been saved from the wreck  talcott played also on the flute far better than i did myself and we frequently made a trio producing very respectable seamusicbetter indeed than neptune often got for his smiles in this manner then we travelled our long road sometimes contending with headwinds and crossseas sometimes becalmed and sometimes slipping along at a rate that rendered everybody contented and happy  in passing the straits of sunda i related to major merton and emily the incidents of the johns affair with the proas and her subsequent loss on the island of madagascar and was rewarded by the interest they took in the tale we all spoke of marble as indeed we often did and expressed our regrets at his absence the fate of my old shipmate was frequently discussed among us there being a great diversity of opinion on the subject as for the major he thought poor marble must be lost at sea for he did not perceive how any one man could manage a boat all alone by himself  talcott who had juster notions of what a seaman could do was of opinion that our late commander had run to leeward in the hope of finding some inhabited island preferring the association of even cannibals when it came to the trying moment to total solitude i thought he had gone to windward the boat being so well equipped for that service and that marble was in the expectation of falling in with some of the whalers who were known to be cruising in certain latitudes i was greatly struck however by a remark made by emily on the evening of the very day when we passed the straits of sunda  should the truth be ever known gentlemen she said i am of opinion it will be found that poor mr marble only left the island to escape from your importunities and returned to it after the ship disappeared and that he is there at this moment enjoying all the happiness of a hermit  this might be true and from that hour the thought would occasionally recur to my mind as i looked forward to passing at least several more years at sea i secretly determined to ascertain the fact for myself should occasion ever offer in the mean time the crisis had reached a part of the ocean where in those days it was incumbent on those who had the charge of a ship to keep a vigilant lookout for enemies it seems we were not fated to run the gauntlet of these pirates entirely unharmed  early on the following morning i was awoke by talcotts giving me a hearty shake of the shoulder  turn out at once captain wallingford cried my mate the rascals are closing around us like crows about a carcase as bad luck will have it we have neither room nor breeze to spare everything looks like a busy morning for us sir  in just three minutes from that moment i was on deck where all hands were soon collected the men tumbling up with their jackets in their hands major merton was already on the poop surveying the scene with a glass of his own while the two mates were clearing away the guns and getting the ship in a state to make a suitable defence to me the situation was altogether novel i had been six times in the presence of enemies before and twice as commander but never under circumstances that called so imperiously for seamanship and good conduct the ocean seemed covered with enemies major merton declaring that he could count no less than twentyeight proas all full of men and some of them armed with artillery these chaps were ahead astern to windward and to leeward and what was worse they had just wind enough to suit their purposes there being about a fiveknot breeze it was evident that the craft acted in concert and that they were desperately bent on our capture having closed around us in this manner in the night  nevertheless we were a warm ship for a merchantman and not a man in the crisis betrayed any feeling that indicated any other desire than a wish to resist to the last as for neb the fellow was in a broad grin the whole time he considered the affair as a bit of fun yet this negro was afraid to visit certain places about the farm in the dark and could not have been induced to cross a churchyard alone under a bright sun i feel well persuaded he was the oddest mixture of superstitious dread and lionhearted courage i ever met with in my life  it was still early when the proas were near enough to commence serious operations this they did by a nearly simultaneous discharge of about a dozen guns principally sixes that they carried mounted in their bows the shot came whistling in among our spars and rigging literally from every direction and three struck though they were not of a size to do any serious injury our people were at quarters having managed to man both batteries though it left scarcely any one to look after the braces and rigging and none but the officers with smallarms  mr merton must have felt that he and his daughters liberty if not their lives were in the keeping of a very youthful commander still his military habits of subordination were so strong he did not venture even a suggestion  i had my own plan and was just of an age to think it derogatory to my rank to ask advice of any one the proas were strongest ahead and on both bows where they were collecting to the number of near twenty evidently with the intention of boarding should an opportunity offer while astern and on our quarter they were much fewer and far more scattered the reason of all this was apparent by our course the pirates naturally supposing we should continue to stand on  orders were given to haul up the mainsail and to man the spankerbrails the men were taken from the starboard battery exclusively to perform this work when all was ready the helm was put up and the ship was brought as short round on her heel as possible hauling up on an easy bowline on the other tack in coming round we delivered all our larboard guns among the crowd of enemies well crammed with grape and the distance being just right for scattering this broadside was not without effect  as soon as braced up on the other tack we opened starboard and larboard on such of the chaps as came within range clearing our way as we went the headmost proas all came round in chase but being from half a mile to a mile astern we had time to open a way out of the circle and to drive all the proas who were now ahead of us to take refuge among the crowd of their fellows the manoeuvre was handsomely executed and in twenty minutes we ceased firing having all our enemies to the westward of us and in one group this was an immense advantage as it enabled us to fight with a single broadside prevented our being raked and rendered our own fire more destructive by exposing to it a more concentrated and at the same time a larger object i ought to have said before that the wind was at the southward  the crisis now tacked setting the courses and royals  the ship lay up well and the proas having collected around their admiral there was a prospect of her passing to windward of everything six of the fellows however seemed determined to prevent this by hauling close on a wind and attempting to cross our bows firing as they did so the ship stood on apparently as if to intercept them when finding ourselves near enough we kept away about three points and swept directly down in the very centre of the main body of the proas as this was done the enemy taken by surprise cleared a way for us and we passed the whole of them delivering grape and canister as fast as we could deal it out in the height of the affair and the thickest of the smoke three or four of the proas were seen quite near us attempting to close but i did not think it necessary to call the people from the guns which were worked with great quickness and did heavy execution i fancy the pirates found it hotter than they liked for they did not keep on with us though our lofty sails gave us an advantage and would have enabled us to leave them had they pursued a different course as it was we were clear of them in about five minutes and the smoke beginning to rise we soon got a view of what had been done in that brief space  in order to increase our distance however we still kept away running pretty fast through the water  by the confusion which prevailed among the pirates the rascals had been well peppered one had actually sunk and five or six were round the spot endeavouring to pick up the crew three more had suffered in their spars and the movements indicated that all had enough as soon as satisfied of this i hauled the ship up to her course and we continued to leave the cluster of boats which remained around the spot where their consort had gone down those of the fellows to windward however did not seem disposed to give it up but followed us for two hours by which time the rest of their flotilla were hull down believing there was now plenty of room i tacked towards these persevering gentry when they went about like tops and hauled off sharp on a wind we tacked once more to our course and were followed no further  the captain of a pepper ship afterwards told me that our assailants lost fortyseven men mostly killed or died of their hurts and that he had understood that the same officer commanded the crisis that had commanded the john in her affair near the same spot we had some rigging cut a few of our spars slightly injured and two men hurt one of whom happened to be neb the man most hurt died before we reached the cape but more from the want of surgical assistance than from the original character of his wound as for neb he went to duty before we reached st helena for my part i was surprised one of the proas did not get down his throat his grin being wide enough during the whole affair to admit of the passage of a twodecker  we went into the island as had been agreed but no ship offering and none being expected soon it became necessary for my passengers to continue on with us to new york  emily had behaved uncommonly well in the brush with the pirates and everybody was glad to keep her in the ship  the men swore she brought good luck forgetting that the poor girl must have met with much illluck in order to be in the situation in which she was actually placed  nothing occurred on the passage from st helena to new york worthy of being specially recorded it was rather long but i cannot say it was unpleasant at length our reckoning told us to look out for land the major and emily were on deck all expectation and ere long we heard the welcome cry a hazy cloud was just visible on our leebow it grew more and more dense and distinct until it showed the hues and furrows of a mountainside the low point of the hook and the higher land beyond then came in view we glided past the light doubled the spit and got into the upper bay just an hour before the sun of a beautiful day in june was setting this was in the year of our lord 1802    chapter xxi    drink drink to whom shall we drink   to a friend or a mistresscome let me think   to those who are absent or those who are here   to the dead that we loved or the living still dear   alas when i look i find none of the last   the present is barrenlets drink to the past   paulding   though strictly a manhattanese as a sailor i shall not run into rhapsody on the subject of the beauties of the inner or outer bay of this prosperous place no man but one besotted with provincial conceit could ever think of comparing the harbour of new york with the bay of naples nor do i know two places that have the same great elements of land and water that are less alike the harbour of new york is barely pretty not a particle more if quite as much while the bay of naples is almost what its owners so fondly term it a little bit of heaven fallen upon earth on the other hand however naples as a haven is not to be mentioned in the same breath with the great american mart which as a port has no competitor within the circle of my knowledge constantinople alone excepted  i wish my semitownsmen the manhattanese could be persuaded of these facts as when they do brag as the wisest of mortals sometimes will they might brag of their strong and not of their weak points as is now too often the case  the major emily and myself stood on the poop regarding the scene as the ship glided onward before a good southeast breeze i watched the countenances of my companions with interest for i had the nervousness of a tyro and a provincial on the subject of the opinions of the people of other lands concerning everything that affected my own  i could see that the major was not particularly struck and i was disappointed then whatever may be my opinion now emily better answered my hopes whether the charming girl really felt the vast contrast between a view of the unbroken expanse of the ocean and the scene before her or was disposed to please her host she did not hesitate to express delight i let her understand how much i was gratified and thus our long long voyage and that so far as degrees of longitude were concerned nearly embraced the circuit of the earth may be said to have terminated with the kindest feelings  the ship was off bedlows and the pilot had begun to shorten sail when a schooner crossed our forefoot beating down i had been too much occupied with the general movement of the bay to notice one small craft but this vessel happening to tack quite near us i could not but turn my eyes in her direction at that instant i heard a shout from neb who was furling one of the royals it was one of those irrepressible nigger gollies that often escaped from the fellow involuntarily  what do you mean by that uproar on the mizenroyal yard i called out angrilyfor the style of my ship had now become an object of concern with me keep silence sir or ill find a way to instruct you in the art  lordmasser mile cried the negro pointing eagerly towards the schoonerthere go pretty poll  it was our old craft sure enough and i hailed her incontinently  pretty polly ahoy  halloo  where are you bound sir and when did that schooner get in from the pacific  we are bound to martiniquethe poll got home from the south seas about six months since this is her third voyage to the west indies since  here then was the certainty that the cargo sent home and the letter with it were all safe i must be expected and the owners would soon hear of my arrival we were not kept long in doubt for as the ship entered the hudson a boat approached and in her were two of the principal members of our firm i had seen them and that is all but my own letters and the report of the officer who brought home the schooner had told them all about me could nelson after his victory of the nile have walked into the king of englands private cabinet with the news of his own success his reception would not have been more flattering than that i now received i was captain wallingforded at every sentence and commendations were so intermixed with inquiries about the value of the cargo that i did not know which to answer first i was invited to dine the very next day by both the gentlemen in the same breath and when i raised some objections connected with the duty of the ship the invitations were extended from day to day for a week  so very welcome is he who brings us gold  we went alongside of a north river wharf and had everything secure just as the sun was setting the people were then allowed to go ashore for the night not a soul of them asked for a dollar but the men walked up the wharf attended by a circle of admiring landlords that put them all above want the sailor who has three years pay under his lee is a sort of rothschild on jacks exchange all the harpies about our lads knew that the crisis and her teas c were hypothecated to meet their own ten and twenty dollar advances  i dressed myself hurriedly and ordered neb to imitate my example one of the owners had kindly volunteered to see major merton and emily to a suitable residence with an alacrity that surprised me but the influence of england and englishmen in all america was exceedingly great forty years since this was still more true in new york than in the country generally and a halfpay english major was a species of nobleman among the better sort of manhattanese of that day how many of these quasi lords have i seen whose patents of nobility were merely the commissions of captains and lieutenants signed by the majesty of england in that dayit is nonsense to deny itthe man who had served against the country provided he was a british officer was a better man than he who had served in our own ranks this was true however only as regarded society the ballotboxes and the people giving very different indications of their sentiments on such subjects  nor is this result so far as new york was concerned as surprising as at first sight it may possibly appear  viewed as a class the gentry of new york took sides with the crown it is true that the portion of this gentry which might almost be called baronialit was strictly manorialwas pretty equally divided carrying with them their collaterals but the larger portions of this entire class of the elite of society took sides with the crown and the peace of 83 found no small part of them in possession of their old social stations the confiscations affecting few beyond the most important and the richest of the delinquents i can give an instance within my own immediate knowledge of the sort of justice of these confiscations the head of one of the most important of all the colonial families was a man of indolent habits and was much indisposed to any active pursuits this gentleman was enormously rich and his estates were confiscated and sold now this attainted traitor had a younger brother who was actually serving in the british army in america his regiment sharing in the battles of bunker hill brandywine monmouth c but the major was a younger son and in virtue of that republican merit he escaped the consequences of his adhesion to the service of the crown and after the revolution the cadet returned to his native country took quiet possession of a property of no inconsiderable amount while his senior passed his days in exile paying the bitter penalty of being rich in a revolution  it was a consequence of the peculiarities first mentioned that the manhattanese society set so high a value on english connection they still admired as the provincial only can admire and they worshipped as the provincial worships or at a safe distance the strange medley of truth cant selfishness sophistry and good faith that founded the political hostility to the movements of the french revolution had as ardent believers in this country as it had in england itself and this contributed to sustain the sort of feeling i have described of the fact there can be no doubt as any one will testify who knew new york society forty years ago  no wonder then that major merton and emily fared well on their sudden arrival in the country some romance moreover was attached to their adventures and i had no great reason to give myself any anxiety on their account  there was little doubt of their soon being much more at home than i could hope to be though in my native land  neb soon reported himself ready for shoreduty and i ordered him to follow me it was my intention to proceed to the countinghouse of the owners to receive some letters that awaited me and after writing short answers to despatch the black at once to clawbonny with the intelligence of my return in 1802 the battery was the courtend of the town and it was a good deal frequented by the better classes particularly at the hour at which i was now about to cross it i have never returned from a voyage especially to europe without being particularly struck with two things in the great western emporiumsince the common councils and the editors insist on the wordviz the provincial appearance of everything that meets the eye and the beauty of the younger females meaning however by the last the true native portion of the population and not the throng from ireland and germany who now crowd the streets and who certainly as a body are not in the least remarkable for personal charms but an american can tell an american man or woman as soon as he lays eyes on either and there were few besides native girls on the battery at the time of which i am writing as there were many children taking their evening walk and black servants were far more common than now neb had his share of delights too and i heard him exclaim golly twice before we reached the centre of the battery this exclamation escaped him on passing as many sable venuses each of whom bridled up at the fellows admiration and doubtless was as much offended as the sex is apt to be on such occasions  i must have passed twenty young women that evening either of whom would induce a youth to turn round to look again and for the moment i forgot my errand neither neb nor i was in any hurry we were strolling along in this manner gazing right and left when a party approached under the trees that drew all my attention to itself in front walked a young man and young woman who were dressed simply but with a taste that denoted persons of the better class the former was remarkable for nothing unless it might be a rattling vivacity of which large doses were administered to his fair companion who seemingly swallowed it less reluctantly than doses of another sort are so often received at least i thought so while the two were at a distance by the beautiful glistening teeth that were shining like my own spotless pearls between lips of coral  the air beauty figure and indeed all connected with this singularly lovely young creature struck my imagination at once it was not so much her beauty though that was decided and attractive as the admixture of feminine delicacy with blooming health the walk so natural and yet so full of lightness and grace the laugh so joyous and still so quiet and suited to her sex and the entire air and manner which denoted equally buoyant health and happiness the gracefulness of one who thought not of herself and the refinement which is quite as much the gift of native sentiment as the fruit of art and association i could not tell what her companion was saying but as they approached i fancied them acknowledged lovers on whom fortune friends and circumstances smiled alike a glance aside told me that even neb was struck by the being before him and that he had ceased looking at the sable venuses to gaze at this  i could not keep my gaze off the face of this lovely creature who did not let me get a good look of her darkblue eyes however until i was quite near when they were naturally turned towards the form that approached for a few seconds while in the very act of passing we looked intently at each other and the charm said to be possessed by certain animals was not more powerful than was our mutual gaze in this manner we had actually passed each other and i was still in a sort of mystified prance when i heard suddenly in a voice and tone that caused every nerve to thrill within me the single word  miles  turning and taking another look it was impossible any longer to mistake lucy hardinge stood before me trembling uncertain her face now pale as death now flushed to scarlet her hands clasped her look doubting eager shrinking equally denoting hope and fear and all so blended as to render her the most perfect picture of female truth feeling diffidence and natural modesty i had ever beheld  lucyis itcan it be possibleit is then you i thought so gloriously beautiful and that without knowing you too  i take it for granted had i studied a week i should not have composed a more grateful salutation than this which burst forth in a way that set all the usual restraints of manners at defiance of course i felt bound to go through with the matter as prosperously as i had commenced and in spite of the publicity of the place in spite of half a dozen persons who heard what passed and had turned smiling to see what would come next in spite of the gravelooking gentleman who had so lately been all vivacity and gaiety i advanced folded the dear girl to my heart and gave her such a kiss as ill take upon myself to say she had never before received sailors usually do not perform such things by halves and i never was more in earnest in my life such a salutation from a young fellow who stood rather more than six feet in his stockings had a pair of whiskers that had come all the way from the pacific with very little trimming and who possessed a manliness about him of which mere walking up and down broadway would have robbed a young hercules had the effect to cover poor lucy with blushes and confusion  therethat will do miles she said struggling to get freea truce i pray you see yonder are grace and my father and rupert  there they all were sure enough the whole family having come out to take an evening walk in company with a certain mr andrew drewett a young gentleman who was a fellowstudent of ruperts and who as i afterwards ascertained was a pretty open admirer of ruperts sister there was a marked difference in the manner in which i was received by grace and lucy the first exclaimed miles  precisely as the last had exclaimed her colour heightened and tears forced themselves into her eyes but she could not be said to blush instead of first manifesting an eagerness to meet my salute and then shrinking sensitively from it she flung her delicate arms round my neck without the slightest reserve both arms too kissed me six or eight times without stopping and then began to sob as if her heart would break the spectators who saw in all this the plain honest natural undisguised affection of a sister had the good taste to walk on though i could see that their countenances sympathised with so happy a family meeting i had but a moment to press grace to my heart before mr hardinges voice drew my attention to him the good old man forgot that i was two inches taller than he was himself that i could with ease have lifted him from the earth and carried him in my arms as if he were an infant that i was bronzed by a long voyage and had pacific ocean whiskers for he caressed me as if i had been a child kissed me quite as often as grace had done blessed me aloud and then gave way to his tears as freely as both the girls but for this burst of feeling on the part of a greyheaded old clergyman i am afraid our scene would not altogether have escaped ridicule  as it was however this saved us clergymen were far more respected in america forty years ago than they are today though i think they have still as much consideration here as in most other countries and the general respect felt for the class would have insured us from any manifestations of the sort without the nature and emotion which came in its aid as for myself i was glad to take refuge in ruperts hearty but less sentimental shake of the hand after this we all sought a seat in a less public spot and were soon sufficiently composed to converse as for the gentleman named drewett he waited long enough to inquire of lucy who i was and then he had sufficient tact to wish us all good evening i overheard the little dialogue which produced this explanation  a close friend if not a near relation miss hardinge  he observed inquiringly  oh yes answered the smiling weeping girl with the undisguised truth of her honest natureboth friend and relative  may i presume to ask the name  the name mr drewettwhy it is milesdear milesyou surely have heard us speak of milesbut i forget you never were at clawbonnyis it not a most joyful surprise dearest dearest grace  mr andrew drewett waited i thought with most commendable patience for grace to squeeze lucys hand and to murmur her own felicitations when he ventured to add  you were about to say something miss hardinge  was ii declare i have forgotten what it was such a surprisesuch a joyful blessed surprisei beg pardon mr drewettah i remember now i was about to say that this is mr miles wallingford of clawbonny the gentleman who is my fathers wardgraces brother you know  and how related to yourself miss hardinge the gentleman continued a little perseveringly  to me oh very very nearthat isi forget so much this eveningwhy not at all  it was at this moment mr drewett saw fit to make his parting salutations with studied decorum and to take his leave in a manner so polite that though tempted i could not just at the moment stop the current of my feelings to admire  no one seemed to miss him however and we five who remained were soon seated in the spot i have mentioned and as much abstracted from the scene around us as if we had been on the rustic bench under the old elm on the lawnif i dare use so fine a word for so unpretending a placeat clawbonny i had my station between mr hardinge and grace while lucy sat next her father and rupert next to my sister my friend could see me without difficulty owing to his stature while i saw the glistening eyes of lucy riveted on my face as leaning on her fathers knee she bent her graceful form forward in absorbed attention  we expected you we have not been taken altogether by surprise exclaimed good mr hardinge clapping his hand on my shoulder as if to say he could now begin to treat me like a man i consented to come down just at this moment because the last canton ship that arrived brought the intelligence that the crisis was to sail in ten days  and you may judge of our surprise said rupert when we read the report in the papers the crisis captain wallingford  i supposed my letters from the island had prepared you for this i observed  in them you spoke of mr marble and i naturally concluded when it came to the pinch the man would resume the command and bring the ship home duty to the owners would be apt to induce him  he did not i answered a little proudly perhaps forgetting poor marbles probable situation for an instant in my own vanity mr marble understood well that if i knew nothing else i knew how to take care of a ship  so it seems my dear boy indeed so it doth seem said mr hardinge kindly i hear from all quarters you conduct commended and the recovery of the vessel from the french was really worthy of truxtun himself  at that day truxtun was the great gun of american naval idolatry and had as much local reputation as nelson himself enjoyed in england the allusion was a sore assault on my modesty but i got along with it as well as i could  i endeavoured to do my duty sir i answered trying not to look at lucy and seem meek and it would have been a terrible disgrace to have come home and been obliged to say the french got the ship from us when we were all asleep  but you took a ship from the french in that manner and kept her too said a soft voice every intonation of which was music to me  i looked round and saw the speaking eyes of lucy just clear of the grey coat of her father behind which she instinctively shrank the instant she caught my glance  yes i answered we did something of that sort and were a little more fortunate than our enemies but you will recollect we were much favoured by the complaisance of poor monsieur le compte in leaving us a schooner to work our mischief in  i have always thought that part of your story miles a little extraordinary observed mr hardinge though i suppose this frenchmans liberality was in some measure a matter of necessity out there in the middle of the pacific  i hardly think you do captain le compte justice sir  he was a chivalrous fellow and every way a gallant seaman  it is possible he was rather more in a hurry than he might have been but for his passengersthat is allat least i have always suspected that the wish to have miss merton all to himself induced him to get rid of us as soon as possible he evidently admired her and could have been jealous of a deadeye  miss merton exclaimed grace jealous  miss merton put in rupert leaning forward curiously  miss merton and jealous of deadeyes and wishing to get rid of us said mr hardinge smiling pray who is miss merton and who are the us and what are the deadeyes  lucy was silent  why sir i thought i wrote you all about the mertons  how we met them in london and then found them prisoners to monsieur le compte and that i intended to carry them to canton in the crisis  you told us some of this certainly but though you may have written all about a major merton you forgot to tell us about all the mertons this is the first syllable i have ever had about a miss merton how is it girlsdid miles speak of any one but the major in his letter  not a syllable to me sir of any young lady i can assure you replied grace laughing how was it to you lucy  of course he would not tell me that which he thought fit to conceal from his own sister said lucy in a low voice  it is odd i should have forgotten to mention her i cried endeavouring to laugh it off young men do not often forget to write about young ladies  this miss merton is young then brother  about your own age grace  and handsomeand agreeableand accomplished  something like yourself my dear  but handsome i take it for granted miles observed mr hardinge by the manner in which you have omitted to speak of her charms in your letters  why sir i think most personsthat is the world in generali mean such as are not overfastidious would consider miss merton particularly handsomeagreeable in person and features i would be understood to say  oh you are sufficiently explicit everybody can understand you added my laughing guardian who had no more thought of getting me married to his own daughter than to a german princess of a hundred and fortyfive quarterings if there are any such things some other time we will have the particulars of her eyes hair teeth c c  oh sir you may save me the trouble by looking at her yourself tomorrow since she and her father are both here  here exclaimed all four in a breath lucys extreme surprise extorting the monosyllable from her reserve even a little louder than from the rest  certainly here father daughter and servants i dare say i omitted to speak of the servants in my letters too but a poor fellow who has a great deal to do cannot think of everything in a minute major merton has a touch of the liver complaint and it would not do to leave him in a warm climate so no other chance offering he is proceeding to england by the way of america  and how long had you these people on board your ship miles grace asked a little gravely  actually on board with myself about nine months i should think but including the time in london at canton and on the island i should call our acquaintance one of rather more than a years standing  long enough certainly to make a young lady sufficiently obvious to a young gentlemans memory not to be forgotten in his letters  after this pointed speech there was a silence which mr  hardinge broke by some questions about the passage home from canton as it was getting cool on the battery however we all moved away proceeding to mrs bradforts  this lady as i afterwards discovered was much attached to lucy and had insisted on giving her these opportunities of seeing the world she was quite at her ease in her circumstances and belonged to a circle a good deal superior to that into which grace and myself could have claimed admission in right of our own social position lucy had been well received as her relative and as a clergymans daughter and grace on her own account as i afterwards learned it would be attaching too much credit to clawbonny to say that either of the girls had not improved by this association though it was scarcely possible to make grace more feminine and ladylike than she had been made by nature the effect on lucy was simply to put a little reserve on her native frankness and sturdy honesty though candour compels me to say that mingling with the world and especially the world to which they had been introduced by mrs bradfort had certainly increased the native charm of manner that each possessed i began to think emily merton so far from possessing any advantage over the two girls might now improve a little herself by associating with them  at the house i had to tell my whole story and to answer a multitude of questions not a syllable more was said about miss merton and even lucy had smiles to bestow and remarks to make as before when we got to the lights where the girls could remove their shawls and hats i made each of them stand before me in order to ascertain how much time had altered them grace was now nineteen and lucy was only six months her junior the greatest change was in the latter her form had ripened into something as near as possible to girlish perfection in this respect she had the advantage of grace who was a little too slight and delicate whereas lucy without any of the heaviness that so often accompanies a truly rounded person and which was perhaps a slight defect in emily mertons figure was without an angle of any sort in her entire outline grace always so handsome and so intellectual in the expression of her countenance had improved less in this respect than lucy whose eyes had obtained a tenderness and feeling that rendered them to me even more attractive than those of my own dear sister in a word any man might have been proud at finding two such admirable creatures interested in him as interested every look smile syllable and gesture of these dear girls denoted they were in me  all this time neb had been overlooked he had followed us to the house however and was already engaged in a darkcoloured flirtation with a certain miss chloe clawbonny his own secondcousin in the kitchen a lady who had attracted a portion of his admiration before we sailed and who had accompanied her young mistress to town as soon as it was ascertained the fellow was below lucy who was quite at home in her kinswomans house insisted on his being introduced i saw by the indulgent smile of mrs  bradfort that lucy was not exceeding her conceded privileges and neb was ordered up forthwith never was there a happier fellow than this nigger appeared to be on that occasion he kept rolling his tarpaulin between his fingers shifting his weight from leg to leg and otherwise betraying the confusion of one questioned by his betters for in that day a negro was ready enough to allow he had his betters and did not feel he was injured in so doing at the present time i am well aware that the word is proscribed even in the states prisons everybody being just as good as everybody else though some have the misfortune to be sentenced to hard labour while others are permitted to go at large as a matter of course the selections made through the ballotboxes only go to prove that one man is as good as another  our party did not separate until quite late suppers were eaten in 1802 and i was invited to sit down with the rest of the family and a gay set we were it was then the fashion to drink toasts gentlemen giving ladies and ladies gentlemen the usage was singular but very general more especially in the better sort of houses we men drank our wine as a matter of course while the ladies sipped theirs in that pretty manner in which females moisten their lips on such occasions after a time mrs bradfort who was very particular in the observance of forms gaily called on mr hardinge for his toast   my dear mrs bradfort said the divine goodhumouredly if it were not in your own house and contrary to all rule to give a person who is present i certainly should drink to yourself bless me bless me whom shall i give  i suppose i shall not be permitted to give our new bishop dr moore  the cry of no bishop was even more unanimous than it is at this moment among those who having all their lives dissented from episcopal authority fancy it an evidence of an increasing influence to join in a clamour made by their own voices and this moreover on a subject that not one in a hundred among them has given himself the trouble even to skim our oppositionin which mrs bradfort joined by the waywas of a very different nature however proceeding from a desire to learn what lady mr hardinge could possibly select at such a moment i never saw the old gentleman so confused before he laughed tried to dodge the appeal fidgeted and at last fairly blushed all this proceeded not from any preference for any particular individual of the sex but from natural diffidence the perfect simplicity and nature of his character which caused him to be abashed at even appearing to select a female for a toast  it was a beautiful picture of masculine truth and purity  still we would not be put off and the old gentleman composing his countenance five or six times in vain efforts to reflect then looking as grave as if about to proceed to prayer raised his glass and said  peggy perott  a general laugh succeeded this announcement peggy perott being an old maid who went about tending the sick for hire in the vicinity of clawbonny and known to us all as the ugliest woman in the county  why do you first insist on my giving a toast and then laugh at it when given cried mr hardinge halfamused halfserious in his expostulations peggy is an excellent woman and one of the most useful i know  i wonder my dear sir you did not think of adding a sentiment cried i a little pertly  and if i had it would have been such a one as no woman need be ashamed to hear attached to her name but enough of this i have given peggy perott and you are bound to drink herthat we had done already and now cousin as i have passed through the fiery furnace  unscathed demanded lucy laughing ready to kill herself  yes unscathed miss and now cousin i ask of you to honour us with a toast  mrs bradfort had been a widow many years and was fortified with the panoply of her state accustomed to such appeals which when she was young and handsome had been of much more frequent occurrence than of late she held her glass for the wine with perfect selfpossession and gave her toast with the conscious dignity of one who had often been solicited in vain to change her condition  i will give you she said raising her person and her voice as if to invite scrutiny my dear old friend good dr wilson  it was incumbent on a single person to give another who was also single and the widow had been true to the usage but good dr wilson was a halfsuperannuated clergyman whom no one could suspect of inspiring anything beyond friendship  dear medear me cried mr hardinge earnestly how much more thoughtful mrs bradfort you are than myself had i thought a moment i might have given the doctor for i studied with him and honour him vastly  this touch of simplicity produced another laughhow easily we all laughed that nightand it caused a little more confusion in the excellent divine mrs bradfort then called on me as was her right but i begged that rupert might precede me he knowing more persons and being now a sort of man of the world  i will give the charming miss winthrop said rupert without a moments hesitation tossing off his glass with an air that said how do you like that  as winthrop was a highly respectable name it denoted the set in which rupert moved and as for the young lady i dare say she merited his eulogium though i never happened to see her it was something however in 1802 for a youngster to dare to toast a winthrop or a morris or a livingston or a de lancey or a stuyvesant or a beekman or a van renssellaer or a schuyler or a rutherford or a bayard or a watts or a van cortlandt or a verplanck or a jones or a walton or any of that set they and twenty similar families composed the remnant of the colonial aristocracy and still made head within the limits of manhattan against the inroads of the vansomething elses alas  alas how changed is all this though i am obliged to believe it is all for the best  do you know miss winthrop i asked of grace in a whisper  not at all i am not much in that set she answered quietly rupert and lucy have been noticed by many persons whom i do not know  this was the first intimation i got that my sister did not possess all the advantages in society that were enjoyed by her friend as is always the case where it is believed to be our loss i felt indignant at first had it been the reverse i dare say i should have fancied it all very right consequences grew out of these distinctions which i could not then foresee but which will be related in their place rupert now called on grace for her toast a lady commonly succeeding a gentleman my sister did not seem in the least disconcerted but after a moments hesitation she said  mr edward marston  this was a strange name to me but i afterwards ascertained it belonged to a respectable young man who visited mrs bradforts and who stood very well with all his acquaintances i looked at rupert to note the effect but rupert was as calm as grace herself had been when he gave miss winthrop  i believe i have no one to call upon but you miles said grace smiling  me why you all know i am not acquainted with a soul our ulster county girls have almost all gone out of my recollection besides no one would know them here should i mention twenty  you strangely forget brother that most of us are ulster county folk try if you can recall no young lady  oh easily enough for that matter a young fellow can hardly have lived nine months in the same cabin with emily and not think of her when hard pushed i will give you miss emily merton  the toast was drunk and i thought mr hardinge looked thoughtful like one who had a guardians cares and that grace was even grave i did not dare look at lucy though i could have toasted her all night had it been in rule to drink a person who was present we began to chat again and i had answered some eight or ten questions when mrs bradfort much too precise to make any omissions reminded us that we had not yet been honoured with miss lucy hardinges toast lucy had enjoyed plenty of time to reflect and she bowed paused a moment as if to summon resolution and then mentioned  mr andrew drewett  so then lucy hardinge toasted this mr drewettthe very youth with whom she had been in such animated discourse when i first met the party had i been more familiar with the world i should have thought nothing of a thing that was so common or did i understand human nature better i might have known that no sensitive and delicate woman would betray a secret that was dear to her under so idle a form but i was young and ready myself to toast the girl i preferred before the universe and i could not make suitable allowances for difference of sex and temperament lucys toast made me very uncomfortable for the rest of the evening and i was not sorry when rupert reminded me that it was eleven and that he would go with me to a tavern in order to look for a room  the next morning was passed in transacting the business of the ship i found myself much noticed among the merchants and shipmasters and one of my owners took me on change that i might see and be seen as the papers had spoken of the recapture of the crisis on the arrival of the pretty poll and had now each an article on the arrival of the ship i had every reason to be satisfied with my reception  there are men so strong in principle as well as intellect i do suppose that they can be content with the approbation of their own consciences and who can smile at the praises or censure of the world alike but i confess to a strong sympathy with the commendation of my fellowcreatures and as strong a distaste for their disapprobation i know this is not the way to make a very great man for he who cannot judge feel and act for himself will always he in danger of making undue sacrifices to the wishes of others but you can have no more of a cat than the skin and i was sufficiently proud at finding myself a miniature hero about the lower end of wallstreet and in the columns of the newspapers as for these last no one can complain of their zeal in extolling everything national to believe them the country never was wrong or defeated or in a condition to be defeated except when a political opponent could be made to suffer by an opposite theory and then nothing was ever right as to fame i have since discovered they consider that of each individual to be public property in which each american has a part and parcelthe editors themselves more than the man who has thrown the article into the common lot but i was young in 1802 and even a paragraph in my praise in a newspaper had a certain charm for me that i will not deny then i had done well as even my enemies if i had any must have admitted    chapter xxii    ships are but boards sailors but men there be landrats and   waterrats waterthieves and landthieves i mean pirates and   then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks the man is   notwithstanding sufficientthree thousand ducatsi think i may   take his bondshylock   i saw grace and lucy and rupert and good mr hardinge every day but i could not find time to call on the mertons until near the close of a week i then paid them a visit and found them glad to see me but not at all in want of my attentions to make them comfortable the major had exhibited his claims to the british consul who happened to be a native manhattanese and was wellconnected a circumstance that then gave him an influence in society that his commission alone would not have conferred  colonel barclay for so was this gentleman called had taken the mertons by the hand as a matter of course and his example being followed by others i found that they were already in the best circle of the place emily mentioned to me the names of several of those with whom she had exchanged visits and i knew at once through lucys and graces conversation and from my own general knowledge of the traditions of the colony and state that they were among the leading people of the land socially if not politically a class altogether above any with whom i had myself ever associated now i knew that the master of a merchantman whatever might be his standing with his owner or consignee or the credit he had gained among his fellows was not likely to get admission into this set and there was the comfortable prospect before me of having my own sister and the two other girls i admired most and loved best in the worldnext to grace of coursevisiting round in houses of which the doors were shut against myself  this is always unpleasant but in my case it turned out to be more  when i told emily that grace and lucy were in town and intended coming to see her that very morning i thought she manifested less curiosity than would have been the case a month before  is miss hardinge a relative of mr rupert hardinge the gentleman to whom i was introduced at dinner yesterday she demanded after expressing the pleasure it would give her to see the ladies  i knew that rupert had dined out the day before and there being no one else of the same name i answered in the affirmative  he is the son of a respectable clergyman and of very good connections i hear  the hardinges are so considered among us both ruperts father and grandfather were clergymen and his greatgrandfather was a seamani trust you will think none the worse of him for that  a sailor i had supposed from what some of those present saidthat is i did not know it  perhaps they told you that his greatgrandfather was a british officer  emily coloured and then she laughed faintly admitting however that i had guessed right  well all this was true i added though he was a sailor old captain hardingeor commodore hardinge as he used to be called for he once commanded a squadronwas in the english navy  oh that sort of a sailorcried emily quicklyi did not know that it was usual to call gentlemen in the navy seamen  they would make a poor figure if they were not miss mertonyou might as well say that a judge is no lawyer  this was enough however to satisfy me that miss merton no longer considered the master of the crisis the first man in the world  a ring announced the arrival of the two girls they were shown up and i soon had the satisfaction of seeing these three charming young women together emily received her two guests very courteously and was franknay warmin the expression of her gratitude for all that i had done for herself and her father she even went back so far as to speak of the occurrence in the park at london and was gracious enough to declare that she and her parents owed their lives to my interference all this gave her listeners great pleasure for i believe neither ever tired of hearing my praises after this opening the conversation turned on new york its gaieties and the different persons known to them mutually i saw that the two girls were struck with the set miss merton was in which was a shade superior even to that of mrs bradforts though the fusion which usually accompanies that sort of thing brought portions of each circle within the knowledge of the other as the persons named were utter strangers to me i had nothing to say and sat listening in silence the opportunity was improved by comparing the girls with each other  in delicacy of appearance grace and lucy each had the advantage of the english beauty their hands and feet were smaller their waists finer and their tournures generally i thought the most pleasing emily had the advantage in complexion though her colour had less fineness and delicacy  perhaps her teeth were the most brilliant though grace and lucy particularly the latter had very fine teeth  the english girls shoulders and bust generally would have been more admired than those of most americanparticularly than most new yorkgirls but it was not possible to surpass those of lucy as a whole emilys countenance had the most spirit lucys the most finesse and feeling i make no comparison with the expression of graces countenance which was altogether too remarkable for its intellectual character to be included in anything like a national classification i remember i thought as they sat there in a row conversing frankly and cheerfully together lucy the handsomest in her pretty neat morningdress while i had my doubts whether emily would not have extorted the most applause in a ballroom this distinction is mentioned because i believe it national  the visit lasted an hour for i had expressed a wish to all parties that they would become acquainted and the girls seemed mutually pleased as they chatted i listened to the tones of their voices and fancied on the whole that emily had slightly the advantage in intonation and accent though it was scarcely perceptible and it was an advantage that was attended by a slight sacrifice of the charm of natural utterance she was a little more artificial in this respect than her companions and insomuch less pleasing though had the comparison been made with the manhattan style of the present day the odds would have been immensely in her favour in 1802 however some attention was still paid to the utterance tones of voice and manner of speaking of young ladies the want of it all just now is the besetting vice of the whole of our later instruction of the sex it being almost as rare a thing nowadays to find a young american girl who speaks her own language gracefully as it is to find one who is not of pleasing person  when the young ladies parted it was with an understanding that they were soon to meet again i shook hands with emily english fashion and took my leave at the same time  well miles said grace as soon as we were in the street you have certainly been of service to a very charming young womani like her excessively  and you lucyi hope you agree with grace in thinking my friend emily merton a charming young woman  lucy did not speak as frankly or as decidedly as grace so far as manner was concerned though she coincided in words  i am of the same opinion she said in a tone that was far less cheerful than her usually very cheerful manner  she is one of the loveliest creatures i ever sawand it is no wonder  what is no wonder dear asked grace observing that her friend hesitated to proceed  oh i was about to say something silly and had better not finish the speech but what a finished manner miss merton possessesdo you not think so grace  i wish she had a little less of it dear that is precisely what i should find fault with in her deportment it is manner and though we all must have some it strikes me it ought not to be seen i think all the europeans we saw in town last winter lucy had more or less of this manner  i dare say it would seem so to us notwithstanding it may be very agreeable to those who are used to ita thing to miss when one gets much accustomed to it  as lucy made this remark i detected a furtive and timid glance at myself i was mystified at the time and was actually so silly as to think the dear girl was talking at me and to feel a little resentment i fancied she wished to say there master miles you have been in london and on a desert island in the south seasthe very extremes of human habitsand have got to be so sophisticated so very unclawbonnyish as to feel the necessity of a manner in the young ladies with whom you associate the notion nettled me to a degree that induced me to pretend duty and to hurry down to the ship whom should i meet in rector street but mr hardinge who had been across to the hudson in search of me  come hither miles said the excellent old man i wish to converse with you seriously  as lucy was uppermost in my thoughts at the moment i said to myselfwhat can the dear old gentleman have to say now  i hear from all quarters the best accounts of you my dear boy mr hardinge continued and i am told you make a very superior seaman it is a feather in your cap indeed to have commanded an indiaman a twelvemonth before you are of age i have been conversing with my old friend john murray of the house of john murray and sons one of the very best merchants in america and he says push the boy ahead when you find the right stuff in him  get him a ship of his own and that will put him on the true track teach him early to have an eye to his own interests and it will make a man of him at once i have thought the matter over have had a vessel in my eye for the last month and will purchase her at once if you like the plan  but have i money enough for such a thing my dear sirafter having sailed in the john and the tigris and the crisis i should not like to take up with any of your bs no 2  you have forgotten to mention the pretty poll miles said the divine smiling be under no fear however for your dignity the vessel i have in treaty is all you could wish they tell me having made but one voyage and is sold on account of the death of her owner as for money you will remember i have thirteen thousand dollars of your income invested in stocks and stocks that cost but ten the peace has brought everything up and you are making money right and left how have your own pay and private venture turned out  perfectly well sir i am near three thousand dollars in pocket and shall have no need to call on you for my personal wants then i have my prizemoney to touch  even neb wages and prizemoney brings me nine hundred dollars with your permission sir i should like to give the fellow his freedom  wait till you are of age miles and then you can do as you please i hold four thousand dollars of your invested money which has been paid in and i have placed it in stocks altogether i find we can muster in solid cash more than twenty thousand dollars while the price of the ship as she stands almost ready for sea is only fifteen  now go and look at the vessel if you like her i will close the bargain at once  but my dear mr hardinge do you think yourself exactly qualified to judge of the value of a ship  poh poh dont imagine i am so conceited as to purchase on my own knowledge i have taken some of the very best advice of the city there is john murray to begin witha great shipholder himselfand archibald gracie and william bayardall capital judges have taken an interest in the affair three others of my friends have walked round to look at the vessel and all approvenot a dissenting voice  may i ask sir who have seen her besides the gentlemen you have named they i admit are indeed good judges  whywhyyesdo you happen to know anything of dr benjamin moore now miles  never heard of him sir in my life but a physician can be no great judge of a ship  no more of a physician than yourself boydr benjamin moore the gentleman we elected bishop while you were absent  oh he you wished to toast instead of miss peggy perott cried i smiling well what does the bishop think of herif he approve she must be orthodox  he says she is the handsomest vessel he ever laid eyes on miles and let me tell you the favourable opinion of so good a man as dr moore is of value even though it be about a ship  i could not avoid laughing and i dare say most of the readers will also at this touch of simplicity and yet why should not a bishop know as much of ships as a set of ignoramuses who never read a theological book in their lives some of them not even the bible should know about bishops the circumstance was not a tittle more absurd than many that are occurring daily before our eyes and to which purely from habit we submit very much as a matter of course  well sir i replied as soon as i could i will look at the ship get her character and give you an answer at once i like the idea for it is pleasant to be ones own master  in that day 15000 would buy a very excellent ship as ships went the vessel i was taken to see was coppered and copperfastened buttbolted and she measured just five hundred tons she had a great reputation as a sailer and what was thought a good deal of in 1802 was philadelphia built she had been one voyage to china and was little more than a year old or the best possible age for a vessel her name was the dawn and she carried an aurora for her figurehead whether she were or were not inclined to puseyism i never could ascertain although i can affirm she had the services of the protestant episcopal catholic church read on board her afterwards on more than one occasion  the result of my examination and inquiries was favourable and by the end of the week the dawn was purchased  the owners of the crisis were pleased to express their regrets for they had intended that i should continue in the command of their vessel but no one could object to a mans wishing to sail in his own employment i made this important acquisition at what was probably the most auspicious moment of american navigation it is a proof of this that the very day i was put in possession of the ship good freights were offered to no less than four different parts of the world i had my choice between holland france england and china after consulting with my guardian i accepted that to france which not only paid the best but i was desirous of seeing more of the world than had yet fallen to my share i could make a voyage to bordeaux and back in five months and by the end of that time i should be of age and consequently my own master as i intended to have great doings at clawbonny on that occasion i thought it might be well not to go too far from home accordingly after shipping talcott and the philadelphian whose name was walton for my mates we began to take in cargo as soon as possible  in the meantime i bethought me of a visit to the paternal home it was a season of the year when most people who were anybodies left town and the villas along the shores of the hudson had long been occupied mr hardinge too pined for the country and his flock the girls had had enough of town which was getting to be very dull and everybody rupert excepted seemed anxious to go up the river i had invited the mertons to pass part of the summer at the farm moreover and it was time the invitation should be renewed for the majors physicians had advised him to choose some cooler residence than the streets of a hot close town could furnish during the summer months emily had been so much engrossed with the set into which she had fallen since her landing and which it was easy for me to see was altogether superior to that in which she had lived at home that i was surprised at the readiness with which she urged her father to redeem his promise  mr hardinge tells me sir that clawbonny is really a pretty spot she said and the country around it is thought to be very healthy you cannot get answers from home she meant england for several months and i know captain wallingford will be happy to receive us besides we are pledged to accept this additional favour from him  i thought major merton felt some of my own surprise at emilys earnestness and manner but his resistance was very feeble the old gentlemans health indeed was pretty thoroughly undermined and i began to have serious doubts of his living even to return to europe he had some relatives in boston and had opened a correspondence with them and i had thought more than once of the expediency of apprising them of his situation at present however nothing better could be done than to get him into the country  having made all the arrangements with the others i went to persuade rupert to be of the party for i thought it would make both grace and lucy so much the happier  miles my dear fellow said the young student gaping clawbonny is certainly a capitalish place but you will admit it is somewhat stupid after new york my good kinswoman mrs bradfort has taken such a fancy to us all and has made me so comfortablewould you believe it boy she has actually given me six hundred a year for the last two years besides making lucy presents fit for a queen  a sterling woman is she this cousin margaret of ours  i heard this truly not without surprise for in settling with my owners i found rupert had drawn every cent to which he was entitled under the orders i had left when i last went to sea  as mrs bradfort was more than at her ease however had no nearer relative than mr hardinge and was much attached to the family i had no difficulty in believing it true so far as the ladys liberality was concerned i heartily wished rupert had possessed more selfrespect but he was as he was  i am sorry you cannot go with us i answered for i counted on you to help amuse the mertons  the mertonswhy surely they are not going to pass the summer at clawbonny  they quit town with us tomorrow why should not the mertons pass the summer at clawbonny  why miles my dear boy you know how it is with the worldhow it is with these english in particular they think everything of rank you know and are devotees of style and appearance and all that sort of thing you know as no one understands better than myself for i pass most of my time in the english set you know  i did not then understand what had come over rupert though it is all plain enough to me now he had truly enough got into what was then called the english set now there is no question that so far as the natives themselves were concerned this was as good a set as ever existed in his country and it is also beyond all cavil that many respectable english persons of both sexes were occasionally found in it but it had this great defectevery englishman who wore a good coat and had any of the slang of society made his way into the outskirts at least of this set and rupert whose own position was not yet thoroughly confirmed had fallen a great deal into the association of these accidental comers and goers they talked large drank deep and had a lofty disdain for everything in the country though it was very certain they were just then in much better company where they were than they had ever been at home like most tyroes rupert fancied these blustering gentry persons to imitate and as they seldom conversed ten minutes without having something to say of my lord aor sir john b persons they had read of or seen in the streets he was weak enough to imagine they knew all about the dignitaries of the british empire as rupert was really a gentleman and had good manners naturally it was a grievous thing to see him fashioning himself anew as it might be on such very questionable models  clawbonny is not a stylish place i am ready to allow i answered after a moment of hesitation still it is respectable  there is a good farm a valuable mill and a good old comfortable straggling stone house  very true miles my dear fellow and all as dear to me you know as the apple of my eyebut farmishyoung ladies like the good things that comes from farms but do not admire the homeliness of the residence i speak of young english ladies in particular now you see major merton is a fieldofficer and that is having good rank in a respectable profession you knowi suppose you understand miles that the king puts most of his sons into the army or navyall this makes a difference you understand  i understand nothing about it what is it to me where the king of england puts his sons  i wish my dear miles if the truth must be said that you and i had been a little less boyish when we were boys than happened to be the case it would have been all the better for us both  well i wish no such thing a boy should be a boy and a man a man i am content to have been a boy while i was a boy it is a fault in this country that boys fancy themselves men too soon  ah my dear fellow you will not or do not understand me what i mean is that we were both precipitate in the choice of a professioni retired in time but you persevere that is all  you did retire in season my lad if truth is what you are after for had you staid a hundred years on board ship you never would have made a sailor  when i said this i fancied i had uttered a pretty severe thing rupert took it so coolly however as to satisfy me at once that he thought differently on the subject  clearly it is not my vocation nature intended me for something better i trust and i mistook a boyish inclination for a taste a little experience taught me better and i am now where i feel i ought to be i wish miles you had come to the study of the law at the time you went to sea  you would have been by this time at the bar and would have had a definite position in society  i am very glad i did not what the deuce should i have done as a lawyeror what advantage would it have been to me to be admitted to the bar  advantagewhy my dear fellow every advantage in the world you know how it is in this country i suppose in the way of society my dear miles  not iand by the little i glean from the manner you sheer about in your discourse i wish to know nothing do young men study law merely to be genteel  do not despise knowledge my boy it is of use even in trifles now in this country you know we have very few men of mere leisureheirs of estates to live on their incomes as is done in europe but ninetenths of us must follow professions of which there are only halfadozen suitable for a gentleman the army and navy are nothing you know two or three regiments scattered about in the woods and halfadozen vessels after these there remain the three learned professions divinity law and physic in our family divinity has run out i fear as for physic throw physic to the dogs as miss merton says  who i exclaimed in surprise throw physic to the dogswhy that is shakspeare man  i know it and it is miss emily merlons too you have made us acquainted with a charming creature at least miles by this going to sea her notions on such subjects are as accurate as a sundial  and has miss emily merton ever conversed with you on the subject of my profession rupert  indeed she has and regretted it again and again  you know as well as i do miles to be a sailor other than in a navy is not a genteel profession  i broke out into a fit of laughter at this remark it struck me as infinitely droll and as somewhat silly i knew my precise position in society perfectly had none of the silly swaggering about personal merit and of one mans being as good as another that has since got into such general use among us and understood perfectly the useful and unavoidable classifications that take place in all civilized communities and which while they are attended by certain disadvantages as exceptions produce great benefits as a whole and was not disposed at all to exaggerate my claims or to deny my deficiencies but the idea of attaching any considerations of gentility to my noble manly daring profession sounded so absurd i could not avoid laughing in a few moments however i became grave  harkee rupert said i i trust miss merton does not think i endeavoured to mislead her as to my true position or to make her think i was a greater personage than i truly am  ill not answer for that when we were first acquainted i found she had certain notions about clawbonny and your estate and all that which were rather english you know now in england an estate gives a man a certain consideration whereas land is so plenty with us that we think nothing of the man who happens to own a little of it  stock in america as it is so much nearer readymoney is a better thing than land you know  how true was this even ten years since how false is it today the proprietor of tens of thousands of acres was indeed under the papermoney regime a less important man than the owner of a handful of scrip which has had all its value squeezed out of it little by little that was truly the age when the representative of property was of far more importance than the property itself and all because the country existed in a fever that set everything in motion we shall see just such times again i fear  but what had emily merton to do with all this  miss merton oh she is english you know and felt as english persons always do at the sound of acres i set it all right however and you need be under no concern  the devil you did and pray in what manner was this done how was the matter set right  rupert took the segar from his mouth suffered the smoke to issue by a small deliberate jet cocking his nose up at the same time as if observing the stars and then deigned to give me an answer your smokers have such a disdainful ultraphilosophical manner sometimes  why just in this way my fine fellow i told her clawbonny was a farm and not an estate you know that did a good deal of itself then i entered into an explanation of the consideration of farmers in this country you know and made it all as plain as a b c she is a quick girl is emily and takes a thing remarkably soon  did miss merton say anything to induce you to suppose she thought the less of me for these explanations  of course notshe values you amazinglyquite worships you as a sailorthinks you a sort of merchantcaptain nelson or blake or truxtun and all that sort of thing all young ladies however are exceedingly particular about professions i suppose you know miles as well as i do myself  what lucy rupertdo you imagine lucy cares a straw about my not being a lawyer for instance  do iout of all question dont you remember how the girls weptgrace as well as lucywhen we went to sea boy it was all on account of the ungentility of the profession if a fellow can use such a word  i did not believe this for i knew grace better to say the least and thought i understood lucy sufficiently at that time to know she wept because she was sorry to see me go away still lucy had grown from a very young girl since i sailed in the crisis into a young woman and might view things differently now from what she had done three years before i had not time however for further discussion at that moment and i cut the matter short  well rupert what am i to expect i asked clawbonny or no clawbonny  why now you say the mertons are to be of the party i suppose i shall have to go it would be inhospitable else  i do wish miles you would manage to establish visiting relations with some of the families on the other side of the river there are plenty of respectable people within a few hours sail of clawbonny  my father and my grandfather and my greatgrandfather managed as you call it to get along for the last hundred years well enough on the west side and although we are not quite as genteel as the east we will do well enough the wallingford sails early in the morning to save the tide and i hope your lordship will turn out in season and not keep us waiting if you do i shall be ungenteel enough to leave you behind  i left rupert with a feeling in which disgust and anger were blended i wish to be understood more particularly as i know i am writing for a stiffnecked generation i never was guilty of the weakness of decrying a thing because i did not happen to possess it myself i knew my own place in the social scale perfectly nor was i as i have just said in the least inclined to fancy that one man was as good as another i knew very well that this was not true either in nature or in the social relations in political axioms any more than in political truths at the same time i did not believe nature had created men unequal in the order of primogeniture from male to male keeping in view all the facts i was perfectly disposed to admit that habits education association and sometimes chance and caprice drew distinctions that produced great benefits as a whole in some small degree qualified perhaps by cases of individual injustice this last exception however being applicable to all things human it had no influence on my opinions which were sound and healthful on all these points practical commonsenselike and in conformity with the decisions of the world from the time of moses down to our own or i dare say of adam himself if the truth could be known and as i have said more than once in these rambling memoirs i was not disposed to take a false view of my own social position i belonged at most to the class of small proprietors as they existed in the last century and filled a very useful and respectable niche between the yeoman and gentleman considering the last strictly in reference to the upper class of that day now it struck me that emily merton with her english notions might very well draw the distinctions rupert had mentioned nor am i conscious of having cared much about it though she did if i were a less important person on terra firma with all the usages and notions of ordinary society producing their influence than i had been when in command of the crisis in the centre of the pacific so was miss merton a less important young lady in the midst of the beauty of new york than she had been in the isolation of marble land this i could feel very distinctly but lucys supposed defection did more than annoy me i felt humbled mortified grieved i had always known that lucy was better connected than i was myself and i had ever given rupert and her the benefit of this advantage as some offset to my own and graces larger means but it had never struck me that either the brother or sister would be disposed to look down upon us in consequence the world is everywhereand america on account of its social vicissitudes more than most other countriesconstantly exhibiting pictures of the struggles between fallen consequence and rising wealth the last may and does have the best of it in the mere physical part of the strife but in the more moral if such a word can be used the quiet ascendency of better manners and ancient recollections is very apt to overshadow the fussy pretensions of the vulgar aspirant who places his claims altogether on the allmighty dollar it is vain to deny it men ever have done it and probably ever will defer to the past in matters of this sortit being much with us in this particular as it is with our own lives which have had all their greatest enjoyments in bygone days i knew all thisfelt all thisand was greatly afraid that lucy through mrs bradforts influence and her town associations might have learned to regard me as captain wallingford of the merchantservice and the son of another captain wallingford of the same line in life i determined therefore to watch her with jealous attention during the few days i was to remain at clawbonny with such generous intentions the reader is not to be surprised if i found some of that for which i so earnestly soughtpeople being very apt to find precisely the thing for which they look when it is not lost money  the next morning we were all punctual and sailed at the proper hour the mertons seemed pleased with the river and having a fresh southerly wind in our favour with a strong floodtide we actually landed at the mill the same afternoon everything is apt to be agreeable when the traveller gets on famously and i thought i never saw emily in better spirits than she was when we first reached the top of the ascent that lies above the landing i had given her my arm as due to hospitality while the others got up as they could for i observed that rupert assisted no one as for lucy i was still too much vexed with her and had been so all day to be as civil as i ought we were soon at a point that commanded a view of the house meadows orchards and fields  this then is clawbonny exclaimed emily as soon as i pointed out the place to her upon my word a very pretty farm captain wallingford even prettier than you represented it to be mr rupert hardinge  oh i always do justice to everything of wallingfords you know we were children together and became so much attached in early life that its no wonder we remain so in these our later days  rupert was probably nearer the truth than he imagined when he made this speech my regard for him by this time being pretty much reduced to habit and certainly it had no increase from any fresh supplies of respect i began to hope he might not marry grace though i had formerly looked forward to the connection as a settled thing let him get miss merton if he can i said to myself it will be no great acquisition i fancy to either side  how different was it with his father and i may add with lucy the old gentleman turned to me with tears in his eyes pointed to the dear old house with a look of delight and then took my arm without reference to the wants of miss merton and led me on conversing earnestly of my affairs and of his own stewardship lucy had her fathers arm on the other side and the good divine was too much accustomed to her to mind the presence of his daughter  away we three went therefore leading the way while rupert took charge of emily and grace major merton followed leaning on his own man  it is a lovelyit is a lovely spot miles said mr hardinge and i do most sincerely hope you will never think of tearing down that respectablelooking comfortable substantial good oldfashioned house to build a new one  why should i dear sir the house with an occasional addition all built in the same style has served us a century and may very well serve another why should i wish for more or a better house  why sure enough but now you are a sort of a merchant you may grow rich and wish to be the proprietor of a seat  the time had been when such thoughts often crossed my mind but i cared less for them then to own a seat was the great object of my ambition in boyhood but the thought had weakened by time and reflection  what does lucy think of the matter do i want or indeed deserve a better house  i shall not answer either question replied the dear girl a little saucily i thought i do not understand your wants and do not choose to speak of your deservings but i fancy the question will be settled by a certain mrs wallingford one of these days clever women generally determine these things for their husbands  i endeavoured to catch lucys eye when this was said by leaning a little forward myself but the girl turned her head in such a manner as prevented my seeing her face  the remark was not lost on mr hardinge however who took it up with warmth and all the interest of a most pure and disinterested affection  i suppose you will think of marrying one of these days miles he said but on no account marry a woman who will desert clawbonny or who would wish materially to alter it no goodhearted woman indeedno truehearted womanwould ever dream of either dear me dear me  the happy days and the sorrowful daysthe gracious mercies of providence and the chastening afflictionsthat i myself have seen and felt and witnessed under these same roofs  this was followed by a sort of enumeration of the events of the last forty years including passages in the lives of all who had dwelt at the farm the whole concluding with the divines solemnly repeatingno no miles do not think even of marrying a woman who would wish you to desert or materially alter clawbonny    chapter xxiii    if thou best rated by thy estimation   thou dost deserve enough and yet enough   may not extend so far as to the lady   merchant of venice   next morning i was early afoot and i found grace as much alive to the charms of home as i was myself she put on a gypsy and accompanied me into the garden where to my surprise i found lucy it looked like old times to be in that spot again with those two dear girls  rupert alone was wanting to complete the picture but i had an intimate conviction that rupert as he had been at least could never come within the setting of the family group again i was rejoiced however to see lucy and more so just where i found her and i believe told her as much with my eyes the charming girl looked happier than she had appeared the day before or for many previous days indeed and i felt less apprehension than of late concerning her having met with any agreeable youth of a more genteel profession than that of a merchantcaptain  i did not expect to find you here miss lucy cried grace eating halfripe currants too or my eyes deceive me at this early hour in the morning it is not twenty minutes since you were in your own room quite unadorned  the green fruit of dear clawbonny is better than the ripe fruit of those vile new york markets exclaimed lucy with a fervour so natural as to forbid any suspicion of acting i should prefer a clawbonny potatoe to a new york peach  grace smiled and as soon as lucys animation had a little subsided she blushed  how much better would it be miles my sister resumed could you be induced to think and feel with us and quit the seas to come and live for the rest of your days on the spot where your fathers have so long lived before you would it not lucy  miles will never do that lucy answered with emphasis  men are not like us females who love everything we love at all with our whole hearts men prefer wandering about and being shipwrecked and left on desert islands to remaining quietly at home on their own farms no no youll never persuade miles to do that  i am not astonished my brother thinks desert islands such pleasant abodes when he can find companions like miss merton on them  you will remember sister of mine in the first place that marble land is very far from being a desert island at all and in the next that i first found miss merton in hyde park london almost in the canal for that matter   i think it a little odd that miles never told us all about this in his letters at the time lucy when young gentlemen drag young ladies out of canals their friends at home have a right to know something of the matter  how much unnecessary misery is inflicted by unmeaning expressions like this grace spoke lightly and probably without a second thought about the matter but the little she said not only made me thoughtful and uneasy but it drove everything like a smile from the usually radiant countenance of her friend the conversation dragged and soon after we returned together to the house  i was much occupied that morning in riding about the place with mr hardinge and in listening to his account of his stewardship with the main results i was already acquaintednay possessed them in the dawnbut the details had all to be gone over with the most minute accuracy  a more simpleminded being there was not on earth than mr hardinge and that my affairs turned out so well was the result of the prosperous condition of the country at that day the system my father had adopted in his lifetime and the good qualities of the different agents he had chosen every one of whom remained in the situation in which he was at the sad moment of the fatal accident at the mill  had matters really depended on the knowledge and management of the most excellent divine they would soon have been at sixes and sevens  i am no believer in miracles my dear miles observed my guardian with amusing selfcomplacency but i do think a change has been wrought in me to meet the emergencies of a situation in which the interests of two orphans have been so suddenly intrusted to my guidance and care  god be thanked everything prospers your affairs as well as those of my dear grace it is wonderful boy how a man of my habits has been directed in his purchases of wheat for instance i who never bought a bushel until the whole responsibility of your mills fell upon my shoulders i take no credit to myself for itno credit to myself  i hope the miller has not been backward my dear sir in giving you all the assistance in his power  morganyes he is always ready and you know i never forget to send him into the market to both buy and sell really his advice has been so excellent that to me it has the appearance of being almost miraculousprophetic i should say were it not improper we should avoid all exaggeration in our gratitude boy  very truly sir and in what manner have you managed to get along so well with the crops on the place itself  favoured by the same great adviser miles it is really wonderful the crops we have had and the judgment that has been so providentially shown in the management of the fields as well as of the mills  of course sir old hiram nebs uncle has always been ready to give you his aidhiram has a great deal of judgment in his way  no doubtno doubthiram and i have done it all led by a providential counsel well my boy you ought to be satisfied with your earthly lot for every thing seems to prosper that belongs to you of course you will marry one of these days and transmit this place to your son as it has been received from your fathers  i keep that hope in perspective sir or as we sailors say for a sheetanchor  your hope of salvation boy is your sheetanchor i trust nevertheless we are not to be too hard on young men and must let them have a little romance in their compositions yes yes i trust you will not become so much wedded to your ship as not to think of taking a wife one of these days it will be a happy hour to me when i can see another mrs miles wallingford at clawbonny she will be the third for i can remember your grandmother  can you recommend to me a proper person to fill that honourable station sir said i smiling to myself and exceedingly curious to hear the answer  what do you think of this miss merton boy she is handsome and that pleases young men clever and that pleases old ones welleducated and that will last when the beauty is gone and so far as i can judge amiable and that is as necessary to a wife as fidelity marry no woman miles that is not amiable  may i ask what you call amiable sirand when that question is answered i may venture to go so far as to inquire whom you call amiable  very sensible distinctions and such as are entitled to fair answers at least the first i do not call levity amiability nor mere constitutional gaiety some of the seemingly most lighthearted women i have ever known have been anything but amiable there must be an unusual absence of selfishnessa person must live less for herself than othersor rather must find her own happiness in the happiness of those she loves to make a truly amiable woman  heart and principle are at the bottom of what is truly amiable though temperament and disposition undoubtedly contribute as for the whom your own sister grace is a truly amiable young woman i never knew her do anything to hurt anothers feelings in my life  i suppose you will admit sir i cannot very well marry grace  i wish you could with all my heartyes with all my heart were not you and grace brother and sister i should consider myself well quit of the responsibility of my guardianship in seeing you man and wife  as that is out of the question i am not without hopes you can mention another who will do just as well so far as i am concerned  well there is this miss mertonthough i do not know her well enough to venture absolutely on a recommendation  now i told lucy no later than yesterday while we were on the river and as you were pointing out to miss merton the forts in the highlands that i thought you would make one of the handsomest couples in the stateand moreover i told herbless me how this corn grows the plants will be in tassel in a few days and the crop must turn out most beneficenttruly trulythere is a providence in all things for at first i was for putting the corn on yonder hillside and the potatoes here but old hiram was led by some invisible agency to insist on this field for the corn and the hillside for the potatoesand now look and see what crops are in promise think of a niggers blundering on such a thing  in 1802 even welleducated and wellintentioned clergymen had no scruples in saying nigger  but sir you have quite forgotten to add what else you told lucy  truetrueit is very natural that you should prefer hearing me talk about miss merton to hearing me talk about potatoesill tell that to lucy too you may depend on it  i sincerely hope you will do no such thing my dear sir i cried in no little alarm  ah that betrays guiltconsciousness i should say for what guilt can there be in a virtuous loveand rely on it both the girls shall know all about it lucy and i often talk over your matters miles for she loves you as well as your own sister ah my fine fellow you blush at it like a girl of sixteen but there is nothing to be ashamed of and there is no occasion for blushes  well sir letting my blushesthe blushes of a shipmasterbut setting aside my blushes for mercys sake what more did you tell lucy  what more why i told her how you had been on a desert island quite alone as one might say with miss merton and how you had been at sea living in the same cabin as it were for nine months and it would be wonderfulwonderful indeed if two so handsome young persons should not feel an attachment for each other country might make some difference to be sure  and station sirwhat do you think would be the influence of the difference of station also  stationbless me miles what difference in station is there between you and miss merton that it should cause any obstacle to your union  you know what it is sir as well as i do myself she is the daughter of an officer in the british army and i am the master of a ship you will admit i presume mr hardinge that there is such a thing as a difference in station  beyond all question it is exceedingly useful to remember it and i greatly fear the loose appointments of magistrates and other functionaries that are making round the country will bring all our notions on such subjects into great confusion i can understand that one man is as good as another in rights miles but i cannot understand he is any better because he happens to be uneducated ignorant or a blackguard  mr hardinge was a sensible man in all such distinctions though so simple in connection with other matters  you can have no difficulty however in understanding that in new york for instance i should not be considered the equal of major mertoni mean socially altogether and not in personal merit or the claims which years giveand of course not the equal of his daughter  whyyesi know what you mean now there may be some little inequality in that sense perhaps but clawbonny and the ship and the money at use would be very apt to strike a balance  i am afraid not sir i should have studied law sir had i wished to make myself a gentleman  there are lots of vulgar fellows getting into the law milesmen who have not half your claims to be considered gentlemen i hope you do not think i wished you and rupert to study law in order to make gentlemen of you  no sir it was unnecessary to take that step as regards rupert who was fully born in the station clergymen have a decided position all over the world i believe and then you are extremely well connected otherwise mr hardinge  rupert has no occasion for such an assistancewith me it was a little different  milesmilesthis is a strange fancy to come over a young man in your situationand who i am afraid has been the subject of envy only too often to rupert  if the truth were known mr hardinge i dare say both rupert and lucy in their secret hearts think they possess advantages in the way of social station that do not belong to grace and myself  mr hardinge looked hurt and i was soon sorry that i had made this speech nor would i have the reader imagine that what i had said proceeded in the least from that narrow selfish feeling which under the blustering pretension of equality presumes to deny the existence of a very potent social fact but simply from the sensitiveness of feelings which on this subject were somewhat in danger of becoming morbid through the agency of the most powerful passion of the human heartor that which has well been called the masterpassion nevertheless mr hardinge was much too honest a man to deny a truth and much too sincere to wish even to prevaricate about it however unpleasant it might be to acknowledge it in all its unpleasant bearings  i now understand you miles and it would be idle to pretend that there is not some justice in what you say though i attach very little importance to it myself rupert is not exactly what i could wish him to be in all things and possibly he may be coxcomb enough at times to fancy he has this slight advantage over youbut as for lucy ill engage she never thinks of you but as a second brother and that she loves you exactly as she loves rupert  mr hardinges simplicity was of proof and it was idle to think of making any impression on it i changed the subject therefore and this was easily enough done by beginning again to talk about the potatoes i was far from being easy nevertheless for i could not avoid seeing that the good divines restlessness might readily widen the little breach which had opened between his daughter and myself  that day at dinner i discovered that graces winter in town had led to a sensible melioration of the domestic economy most especially as related to the table my father and mother had introduced some changes which rendered the clawbonny household affairs a little different from those of most other of the ulster county families near our own class but their innovations or improvements or whatever they might be called were far from being as decided as those introduced by their daughter nothing perhaps sooner denotes the condition of people than the habits connected with the table if eating and drinking be not done in a certain way and a way founded in reason too as indeed are nearly all the customs of polished life whatever may be the cant of the ultras of reasonbut if eating and drinking be not done in a certain way your people of the world perceive it sooner than almost anything else there is also more of common sense and innate fitness in the usages of the table so long as they are not dependent on mere caprice than in almost any other part of our deportment for everybody must eat and most persons choose to eat decently  i had been a little nervous on the subject of the mertons in connection with the clawbonny table i will confess and great was my delight when i found the breakfast going off so well as for the major himself by no means familiar with the higher classes of his own country he had that great stamp of a gentleman simplicity and he was altogether above the cockney distinctions of eating and drinking those about cheese and malt liquors and such vulgar niceties nor was he a man to care about the silverforkisms but he understood that portion of the finesse of the table which depended on reason and taste and was accustomed to observe it this i knew from near a twelve months intercourse and i had feared we might turn out to be a little too rustic  grace had made provisions against all this with a tact and judgment for which i could have worshipped her i knew the viands the vegetables and the wines would all be good of their kind for in these we seldom failed nor did i distrust the cookery the englishdescended families of the middle states of my class understanding that to perfection but i feared we should fail in those little incidents of style and arrangement and in the order of the service that denote a wellregulated table this is just what grace had seen to and i found that a great revolution had been quietly effected in this branch of our domestic economy during my absence thanks to graces observations while at mrs bradforts  emily seemed pleased at dinner and lucy could again laugh and smile after the cloth was removed the major and mr hardinge discussed a bottle of madeira and that too of a quality of which i had no reason to be ashamed while we young people withdrew together to a little piazza that was in the shade at that hour and took seats for a chat rupert was permitted to smoke on condition that he would not approach within fifteen feet of the party no sooner was this little group thus arranged the three girls in a crescent than i disappeared  grace i have not yet spoken to you of a necklace of pearls possessed by your humble servant i cried as my foot again touched the piazzai would not say a word about it  yet lucy and i heard all about it answered grace with provoking calmness but would not ask to see it lest you should accuse us of girlish curiosity we waited your high pleasure in the matter  you and lucy heard i had such a necklace  most unquestionably i grace wallingford and she lucy hardinge i hope it is no infringement on the rights of mr miles clawbonnyso the girls often called me when they affected to think i was on my highropesi hope it is no infringement on the rights of mr miles clawbonny to say as much  and pray how could you and lucy know anything about it  that is altogether another question perhaps we may accord an answer after we have seen the necklace  miss merton told us miles said lucy looking at me with gentleness for she saw i really wished an answer and what could lucy hardinge ever refuse me that was right in itself when she saw my feelings were really interested  miss merton then i have been betrayed and the surprise i anticipated is lost  i was vexed and my manner must have shown it in a slight degree emily coloured bit her lip and said nothing but grace made her excuses with more spirit than it was usual for her to show  you are rightly punished master miles she cried for you had no business to anticipate surprises they are vulgar things at best and they are worse than that when they come from a distance of fifteen thousand milesfrom a brother to a sister besides you have surprised us sufficiently once already in connection with miss merton  i i exclaimed  me added emily  yes i and me did you tell us one word about her in your letters and have you not now both surprised and delighted us by making us acquainted with so charming a person i can pardon such a surprise on account of its consequences but nothing so vulgar as a surprise about pearls  emily blushed now and in her it was possible to tell the difference between a blush and the suffusion that arose from a different feeling but she looked immensely superior to anything like explanations  captain wallingfordhow i disliked that captaincaptain wallingford can have but little knowledge of young ladies she said coldly if he supposes such pearls as he possesses would not form the subject of their conversation  i was coxcomb enough to fancy emily was vexed that i had neglected to be more particular about her being on the island and her connection with the ship this might have been a mistake however  let us see the pearls miles and that will plead your apology said lucy  there thenyour charming eyes young ladies never looked on pearls like those before  female nature could not suppress the exclamations of belight that succeeded even rupert who had a besetting weakness on the subject of all personal ornaments laid aside his segar and came within the prescribed distance the better to admire it was admitted all round new york had nothing to compare with them i then mentioned that they had been fished up by myself from the depths of the sea  how much that adds to their value said lucy in a low voice but in her warm sincere manner  that was getting them cheap was it not miss wallingford inquired emily with an emphasis i disliked  very though i agree with lucy it makes them so much the more valuable  if miss merton will forget my charge of treason and condescend to put on the necklace you will all see it to much greater advantage than at present if a fine necklace embellishes a fine woman the advantage is quite reciprocal  i have seen my pearls once already on her neck and know the effect  a wish of graces aided my application and emily placed the ornaments around her throat the dazzling whiteness of her skin gave a lustre to the pearls that they certainly did not previously possess one scarcely knew which to admire the mostthe ornaments or their setting  how very very beautiful they are now cried lucy in generous admiration oh miss merton pearls should ever be your ornaments  those pearls you mean lucy put in rupert who was always extremely liberal with other peoples means the necklace ought never to be removed  miss merton knows their destination i said gallantly and the terms of ownership  emily slowly undid the clasp placed the string before her eyes and looked at it long and silently  and what is this destination miles what these terms of ownership my sister asked  of course he means them for you dear lucy remarked in haste for whom else can he intend such an ornament  you are mistaken miss hardinge grace must excuse me for being a little selfish this time at least i do not intend those pearls for miss wallingford but for mrs wallingford should there ever be such a person  upon my word such a double temptation my boy i wonder miss merton ever had the fortitude to remove them from the enviable position they so lately occupied cried rupert glancing meaningly towards emily who returned the look with a slight smile  of course miss merton understood that my remark was ventured in pleasantry i said stiffly and not in presumption  it was decided however when in the pacific that these pearls ought to have that destination it is true clawbonny is not the pacific and one may be pardoned for seeing things a little differently here from what they appeared there i have a few more pearls however very inferior in quality i confess to those of the necklace but such as they are i should esteem it a favour ladies if you would consent to divide them equally among you they would make three very pretty rings and as many breastpins  i put into graces hands a little box containing all the pearls that had not been placed on the string there were many fine ones among them and some of very respectable size though most were of the sort called seed in the whole there were several hundreds  we will not balk his generosity said grace smilingso miss merton we will separate the pearls into three parcels and draw lots for them here are handsome ornaments among them  they will have one value with you at least grace and quite likely with lucy while they might possibly possess another with miss merton i fished up every one of those pearls with my own hands  certainly that will give them value with both lucy and me dearest miles as would the simple fact that they are your giftbut what is to give them their especial value with miss merton  they may serve to remind miss merton of some of her hairbreadth escapes of the weeks passed on the island and of scenes that a few years hence will probably possess the colours of a dream in her recollection  one pearl i will take with this particular objectsaid emily with more feeling than i had seen her manifest since she had got back into the world if miss wallingford will do me the favour to select it  let it be enough for a ring at least grace returned in her own sweetest manner half a dozen of the finest of these pearls of which one shall be on miles account and five on mine  on those conditions let it then be six i have no occasion for pearls to remind me how much my father and my self owe to captain wallingford  come rupert added grace you have a taste in these things let us have your aid in the selection  rupert was by no means backward in complying for he loved to be meddling in such matters  in the first place he said i shall at once direct that the number be increased to seven this fine one in the centre and three on each side gradually diminishing in size we must look to quality and not to weight for the six puisne judges as we should call them in the courts the chief justice will be a noblelooking fellow and the associates ought to be of good quality to keep his honours company  why do you not call your judges my lords as we do in england mr hardinge inquired emily in her prettiest manner  why sure enough i wish with all my heart we did and then a man would have something worth living for  rupert exclaimed lucy colouringyou know it is because our government is republican and that we have no nobles among us nor do you say exactly what you think you would not be my lord if you could  as i never shall be a my lord and i am afraid never a your honourthere miss mertonthere are numbers two and threeobserve how beautifully they are graduated as to size  well your honour added grace who began to be a little uneasy at the manner rupert and emily exhibited towards each otherwell your honour what is to come next  numbers four and five of courseand here they are miss merton as accurately diminished as if done by hand  a beautiful ring it will makei envy those who will be recalled to mind by so charming an object  you will now be one of those yourself mr hardingeobserved emily with great tactfor you are fully entitled to it by the trouble you are giving yourself and the taste and judgment you possess  lucy looked petrified she had so long accustomed herself to think of grace as her future sister that the open admiration expressed in ruperts countenance which was too manifest to escape any of us first threw a glimmering of light on suspicions of the most painful nature i had long seen that lucy understood her brothers character better than any of usmuch better indeed than his simpleminded father and as for myself i was prepared to expect anything but consistency and principle in his conduct dearly as i prized lucy and by this time the slight competition that emily merton had presented to my fancy had entirely given way to the dear creatures heart and naturebut dearly as i prized lucy i would greatly have preferred that my sister should not marry her brother and so far from feeling resentment on account of his want of fidelity i was rather disposed to rejoice at it i could appreciate his want of merit and his unfitness to be the husband of such a woman as grace even at my early age but alas i could not appreciate the effects of his inconstancy on a heart like that of my sister could i have felt as easy on the subject of mr andrew drewett and of my own precise position in society i should have cared very little just then about rupert and his caprices  the pearls for the ring were soon selected by rupert and approved of by grace after which i assumed the office of dividing the remainder myself i drew a chair took the box from rupert and set about the task  i shall make a faithful umpire girls i observed as pearl after pearl was laid first on one spot then on anotherfor i feel no preference between yougrace is as lucy lucy is as grace with me  that may be fortunate miss hardinge since it indicates no preference of a particular sort that might require repressing said emily smiling significantly at lucy when gentlemen treat young ladies as sisters it is a subject of rejoicing these sailors need severe lessons to keep them within the rules of the land  why this was said i did not understand but rupert laughed at it as if it were a capital thing to mend the matter he added a little boisterously for him  you see miles you had better have taken to the lawthe ladies cannot appreciate the merits of you tars  so it would seem i returned a little drily after all miss merton has experienced and seen of the trade  emily made no reply but she regarded her pearls with a steadiness that showed she was thinking more of their effect than that of either her own speech or mine i continued to divide the pearls and soon had the work complete  what am i to do nowi askedwill you draw lots girls or will you trust to my impartiality  we will certainly confide in the last answered grace  the division is so very equitable that i do not well see how you can defraud either  that being the case this parcel is for you lucy and grace that is yours  grace rose put her arms affectionately around my neck and gave me one of the hundred kisses that i had received first and last for presents of one sort and another the deep attachment that beamed in her saintlike eyes would of itself have repaid me for fifty such gifts at the moment i was almost on the point of throwing her the necklace in the bargain but some faint fancies about mrs miles wallingford prevented me from so doing as for lucy not a little to my surprise she received the pearls muttered a few unintelligible words but did not even rise from her chair  emily seemed to tire of this so she caught up her gypsy said the evening was getting to be delightful and proposed a walk rupert and grace cheerfully acquiesced and the three soon left the place lucy preparing to follow as soon as a maid could bring her hat and i excusing myself on the score of business in my own room  milessaid lucy as i was about to enter the house she herself standing on the edge of the piazza on the point of following the party but holding towards me the little paper box in which i had placed her portion of the pearls  do you wish me to put them away for you lucy  no milesnot for mebut for yourselffor grace for mrs miles wallingford if you prefer that  this was said without the slightest appearance of any other feeling than a gentle request i was surprised and scarce knew what to make of it at first i refused to take the box  i hope i have done nothing to merit this lucy i said halfaffronted halfgrieved  remember miles the dear girl answeredwe are no longer children but have reached an age when it is incumbent on us to respect appearances a little these pearls must be worth a good deal of money and i feel certain my father when he came to think of it would scarce approve of my receiving them  and this from you dear lucy  this from me dear miles returned the precious girl tears glistening in her eyes though she endeavoured to smile now take the box and we will be just as good friends as ever  will you answer me one question as frankly and as honestly as you used to answer all my questions  lucy turned pale and she stood reflecting an instant before she spoke  i can answer no question before it is asked was at length her answer  have you thought so little of my presents as to have thrown away the locket i gave you before i sailed for the northwest coast  no miles i have kept the locket and shall keep it as long as i live it was a memorial of our childish regard for each other and in that sense is very dear to me you will let me keep the locket i am sure  if it were not you lucy hardinge whom i know to be truth itself i might be disposed to doubt you so many strange things exist and so much caprice especially in attachments is manifested here ashore  you need doubt nothing i tell you mileson no account would i deceive you  that i believenay i see it is your present object to undeceive me i do not doubt anything you tell me lucy  i wish i could see that locket however show it to me if you have it on your person  lucy made an eager movement as if about to produce the locket then she arrested the impetuous indication while her cheeks fairly burned with the blushes that suffused them  i see how it is lucythe thing is not to be found it is mislaid the lord knows where and you do not like to avow it  the locket at that moment lay as near the blessed creatures heart as it could be placed and her confusion proceeded from the shame of letting that fact be known this i could not see and consequently did not know a very small and further indication of feeling on my part might have betrayed the circumstance but pride prevented it and i took the still extended box i dare say in a somewhat dramatic manner lucy looked at me earnestly i saw it was with difficulty that she kept from bursting into tears  you are not hurt miles she said  i should not be frank if i denied it even emily merton you saw consented to accept enough pearls for a ring  i did perceive it and yet you remember she felt the impropriety of receiving such large gifts from gentlemen  miss merton has gone through so much so much in your company miles that no wonder she is willing to retain some little memorial of it all until  she hesitated but lucy chose not to finish the sentence  she had been pale but her cheeks were now like the rose again  when rupert and i first went to sea lucy you gave me your little treasure in goldevery farthing you had on earth i fancy  i am glad i did miles for we were very young then and you had been so kind to me i rejoice i had a little gratitude but we are now in situations she added smiling so sweetly as to render it difficult for me to refrain from catching her in my arms and folding her to my heart that place both of us above the necessity of receiving aid of this sort  i am glad to hear thisthough i shall never part with the dear recollection of the halfjoes  or i with that of the locket we will retain these then as keepsakes my dear mrs bradfort too is very particular about rupert or myself receiving favours of this sort from any but herself she has adopted us in a manner and i owe to her liberality the means of making the figure i do apart from that miles we are all as poor as we have ever been  i wished rupert had half his sisters selfrespect and pride of character but he had not for in spite of his kinswomans prohibitions he had not scrupled to spend nearly three years of the wages that accrued to me as thirdmate of the crisis for the money i cared not a stiver it was a very different thing as to the feeling  as for lucy she hastened away as soon as she had induced me to accept the box and i had no choice but to place all the pearls together and put them in graces room as my sister had desired me to do with her own property before proceeding on her walk  i determined i would converse confidentially with grace that very evening about the state of affairs in general and if possible learn the worst concerning mr andrew drewetts pretensions shall i frankly own the truth i was sorry that mrs bradfort had made lucy so independent as it seemed to increase the chasm that i fancied was opening between us    chapter xxiv    your name abruptly mentioned casual words   of comment on your deeds praise from your uncle   news from the armies talk of your return   a word let fall touching your youthful passion   suffused her cheek called to her drooping eye   a momentary lustre   i had no difficulty in putting my project of a private interview with grace in execution in my own house there was one room at clawbonny that from time immemorial had been appropriated exclusively to the use of the heads of the establishment it was called the family room as one would say familypictures or familyplate  in my fathers time i could recollect that i never dreamed of entering it unless asked or ordered and even then i always did so with some such feeling as i entered a church  what gave it a particular and additional sanctity in out eyes also was the fact that the wallingford dead were always placed in their coffins in this room and thence they were borne to their graves it was a very small triangular room with the fireplace in one corner and possessing but a single window that opened on a thicket of rosebushes ceringos and lilacs there was also a light external fence around this shrubbery as if purposely to keep listeners at a distance the apartment had been furnished when the house was built being in the oldest part of the structures and still retained its ancient inmates the chairs tables and most of the other articles had actually been brought from england by miles the first as we used to call the emigrant though he was thus only in reference to the clawbonny dynasty having been something like miles the twentieth in the old country my mother had introduced a small settee or some such seat as the french would call a causeuse a most appropriate article in such a place  in preparation for the interview i had slipped into graces hand a piece of paper on which was written meet me in the familyroom precisely at six this was sufficient at the hour named i proceeded to the room myself the house of clawbonny in one sense was large for an american residence that is to say it covered a great deal of ground every one of the three owners who preceded me having built the two last leaving entire the labours of the first my turn had not yet come of course but the reader knows already that i most irreverently had once contemplated abandoning the place for a seat nearer the hudson  in such a suite of constructions sundry passages became necessary and we had several more than was usual at clawbonny besides having as many pairs of stairs in consequence of this ample provision of stairs the chambers of the family were totally separated from those of all the rest of the house  i began to reflect seriously on what i had to say and how it was to be said as i walked through the long passage which led to the familyroom or the triangle as my own father had nicknamed the spot grace and i had never yet held what might be termed a family consultation i was too young to think of such a thing when last at home and no former occasion had offered since my return i was still quite young and had more diffidence than might have been expected in a sailor to me it was far more embarrassing to open verbal communications of a delicate nature than it would have been to work a ship in action but for this mauvaise honte i do think i should have been explicit with lucy and not have parted from her on the piazza as i did leaving everything in just as much doubt as it had been before a word passed between us then i entertained a profound respect for grace something more than the tenderness of a brother for a sister for mingled with my strong affection for her was a deference a species of awe of her angellike character and purity that made me far more disposed to receive advice from her than to bestow it  in the frame of mind which was natural to all these blended feelings i laid my hand on the oldfashioned brass latch by which the door of the triangle was closed on entering the room i found my sister seated on the causeuses the window open to admit air the room looking snug but cheerful and its occupants sweet countenance expressive of care not altogether free from curiosity the last time i had been in that room it was to look on the pallid features of my mothers corpse previously to closing the coffin all the recollections of that scene rushed upon our minds at the same instant and taking a place by the side of grace i put an arm around her waist drew her to me and receiving her head on my bosom she wept like a child my tears could not be altogether restrained and several minutes passed in profound silence no explanations were needed i knew what my sister thought and felt and she was equally at home as respects my sensations  at length we regained our selfcommand and grace lifted her head  you have not been in this room since brother she observed half inquiringly  i have not sister it is now many yearsmany for those who are as young as ourselves  miles you will think better about that seat and never abandon clawbonnynever destroy this blessed room  i begin to think and feel differently on the subject from what i once did if this house were good enough for our forefathers why is it not good enough for me it is respectable and comfortable and what more do i want  and so warm in winter and so cool in summer with good thick stone walls while everything they build now is a shingle palace besides you can add your portion and each addition has already been a good deal modernized it is so pleasant to have a house that partakes of the usages of different periods  i hardly think i shall ever abandon clawbonny my dear for i find it growing more and more precious as other ties and expectations fail me  grace drew herself entirely from my arms and looked intently and as i fancied anxiously at me from the other corner of the settee then she affectionately took one of my hands in both her own and pressed it gently  you are young to speak of such things my dear brother she said with a tone and air of sadness i had never yet remarked in her voice and manner much too young for a man though i fear we women are born to know sorrow  i could not speak if i would for i fancied grace was about to make some communications concerning rupert  notwithstanding the strong affection that existed between my sister and myself not a syllable had ever been uttered by either that bore directly on our respective relations with rupert and lucy hardinge i had long been certain that rupert who was never backward in professions had years before spoken explicitly to grace and i made no doubt they were engaged though probably subject to some such conditions as the approval of his father and myself approvals that neither had any reason for supposing would be withheld  still grace had never intimated anything of the sort and my conclusions were drawn from conjectures founded as i imagined on sufficient observation on the other hand i had never spoken to grace of my love for lucy until within the last month indeed when jealousy and distrust came to quicken the sentiment i was unconscious myself with how much passion i did actually love the dear girl for previously to that my affection had seemed so much a matter of course was united with so much that was fraternal in appearance at least that i had never been induced to enter into an inquiry as to the nature of this regard we were both therefore touching on hallowed spots in our hearts and each felt averse to laying bare the weakness  oh you know how it is with life grace i answered with affected carelessness after a moments silence now all sunshine and now all cloudsi shall probably never marry my dear sister and you or your children will inherit clawbonny then you can do as you please with the house as a memorial of myself however i will leave orders for stone to be got out this fall and next year i will put up the south wing of which we have so much talked and add three or four rooms in which one will not be ashamed to see his friends  i hope your are ashamed of nothing that is at clawbonny now milesas for your marrying my dear brother that remains to be seen young men do not often know their own minds on such a subject at your age  this was said not altogether without pleasantry though there was a shade of sadness in the countenance of the beloved speaker that from the bottom of my heart i wished were not there i believe grace understood my concern and that she shrunk with virgin sensitiveness from touching further on the subject for she soon added  enough of this desponding talk why have you particularly desired to see me here miles  why oh you know i am to sail next week and we have never been hereand now we are both of an age to communicate our thoughts to each otheri supposedthat isthere must be a beginning of all things and it is as well to commence now as any other time you do not seem more than half a sister in the company of strangers like the mertons and hardinges  strangers miles how long have you regarded the last as strangers  certainly not strangers in the way of acquaintance but strangers to our blood there is not the least connection between us and them  no but much love and love that has lasted from childhood i cannot remember the time when i have not loved lucy hardinge  quite truenor i lucy is an excellent girl and one is almost certain of always retaining a strong regard for her  how singularly the prospects of the hardinges are changed by this sudden liking of mrs bradfort  it is not sudden miles you have been absent years and forget how much time there has been to become intimate and attached mr hardinge and mrs bradfort are sisters children and the fortune of the last which i am told exceeds six thousand ayear in improving real estate in town besides the excellent and valuable house in which she lives came from their common grandfather who cut off mrs hardinge with a small legacy because she married a clergyman mr hardinge is mrs bradforts heiratlaw and it is by no means unnatural that she should think of leaving the property to those who in one sense have as good a right to it as she has herself  and is it supposed she will leave rupert her heir  i believe it isat leasti thinki am afraidrupert himself imagines it though doubtless lucy will come in for a fair share the affection of mrs bradfort for lucy is very strongso strong indeed that she offered last winter openly to adopt her and to keep her with her constantly  you know how true and warmhearted a girl lucy is and how easy it is to love her  this is all new to mewhy was not the offer accepted  neither mr hardinge nor lucy would listen to it i was present at the interview in which it was discussed and our excellent guardian thanked his cousin for her kind intentions but in his simple way he declared as long as life was spared him he felt it a duty to keep his girl or at least until he committed her to the custody of a husband or death should part them  and lucy  she is much attached to mrs bradfort who is a good woman in the main though she has her weaknesses about the world and society and such things lucy wept in her cousins arms but declared she never could leave her father  i suppose you do not expect added grace smiling that she had anything to say about a husband  and how did mrs bradfort receive this joint declaration of resistance to her pleasure backed as the last was by dollars  perfectly well the affair terminated by mr hardinges consenting to lucys passing each winter in town until she marry rupert you know lives there as a student at law at present and will become established there when admitted to the bar  and i suppose the knowledge that lucy is likely to inherit some of the old bleecker estate has not in the least diminished her chance of finding a husband to remove her from the paternal custody of her father  no husband could ever make lucy anything but mr  hardinges daughter but you are right miles in supposing that she has been sought i am not in her secrets for lucy is a girl of too much principle to make a parade of her conquests even under the pretence of communicating them to her dearest friendand in that light beyond all question does she regard me but i feel as morally certain as one can be without actually knowing the facts that lucy refused one gentleman winter before last and three last winter  was mr andrew drewett of the number i asked with a precipitation of which i was immediately ashamed  grace started a little at the vivacity of my manner and then she smiled though i still thought sadly  of course not she answered after a moments thought or he would not still be in attendance lucy is too frank to leave an admirer in doubt an instant after his declaration is made and her own mind made up and not one of all those who i am persuaded have offered has ever ventured to continue more than a distant acquaintance as mr drewett never has been more assiduous than down to the last moment of our remaining in town it is impossible he should have been rejected i suppose you know mr hardinge has invited him here  here andrew drewett and why is he coming here  i heard him ask mr hardinges permission to visit us here and you know how it is with our dear good guardianthe milk of human kindness himself and so perfectly guileless that he never sees more than is said in such matters it was impossible he could refuse besides he likes drewett who apart from some fashionable follies is both clever and respectable mr drewett has a sister married into one of the best families on the other side of the river and is in the habit of coming into the neighbourhood every summer doubtless he will cross from his sisters house to clawbonny  i felt indignant for just one minute and then reason resumed its sway mr hardinge in the first place had the written authority or request of my mother that he would invite whom he pleased during my minority to the house and on that score i felt no disapprobation but it seemed so much like braving my own passion to ask an open admirer of lucys to my own house that i was very near saying something silly luckily i did not and grace never knew what i suffered at this discovery lucy had refused several offersthat was something and i was dying to know what sort of offers they were i thought i might at least venture to ask that question  did you know the four gentlemen that you suppose lucy to have refused said i with as indifferent an air as i could assume affecting to destroy a cobweb with my rattan and even carrying my acting so far as to make an attempt at a low whistle  certainly how else should i know anything about it  lucy has never said a word to me on the subject and though mrs bradfort and i have had our pleasantries on the subject neither of us is in lucys secrets  ay your pleasantries on the subject that i dare say  there is no better fun to a woman than to see a man make a fool of himself in this way little does she care how much a poor fellow suffers  grace turned pale and i could see that her sweet countenance became thoughtful and repentant  perhaps there is truth in your remark and justice n your reproach miles none of us treat this subject with as much seriousness as it deserves though i cannot suppose any woman can reject a man whom she believes to be seriously attached to her without feeling for him still attachments of this nature affect your sex less than ours and i believe few men die of love lucy moreover never has and i believe never would encourage any man whom she did not like this principle must have prevented any of that intimate connection without which the heart never can get much interested the passion that is produced without any exchange of sentiment or feeling miles cannot be much more than imagination or caprice  i suppose those four chaps are all famously cured by this time then said i pretending again to whistle  i cannot answer for thatit is so easy to love lucy and to love her warmly i only know they visit her no longer and when they meet her in society behave just as i think a rejected admirer would behave when he has not lost his respect for his late flame mrs bradforts fortune and position may have had their influence on two but the others i think were quite sincere  mrs bradfort is quite in a high set gracealtogether above what we have been accustomed to  my sister coloured a little and i could see she was not at her ease still grace had too much selfrespect and too much character ever to feel an oppressive inferiority where it did not exist in essentials and she had never been made to suffer as the more frivolous and vain often suffer by communications with a class superior to their own especially when that class as always happens contains those who having nothing else to be proud of take care to make others feel their inferiority  this is true miles she answered or i might better say both are true certainly i never have seen as many wellbred persons as i meet in her circleindeed we have little around us at clawbonny to teach us any distinctions in such tastes mr hardinge simple as he is is so truly a gentleman that he has not left us altogether in the dark as to what was expected of us and i fancy the higher people truly are in the world the less they lay stress on anything but what is substantial in these matters  and lucys admirersand lucy herself  how lucy herself  was she well receivedcourtedadmired met as an equal and treated as an equal and you too  had you lived more in the world miles you would not have asked the question but lucy has been always received as mrs bradforts daughter would have been received and as for myself i have never supposed it was not known exactly who i am  captain miles wallingfords daughter and captain miles wallingfords sister said i with a little bitterness on each emphasis  precisely and a girl proud of her connections with both rejoined grace with strong affection  i wish i knew one thing grace and i think i ought to know it too  if you can make the last appear miles you may rest assured you shall know it if it depend on me  did any of these gentrythese softhanded fellowsever think of offering to you  grace laughed and she coloured so deeplyoh how heavenly was her beauty with that roseate tint on her cheekbut she coloured so deeply that i felt satisfied that she too had refused her suitors the thought appeased some of my bitter feelings and i had a sort of semisavage pleasure in believing that a daughter of clawbonny was not to be had for the asking by one of that set the only answers i got were these disclosures by blushes  what are the fortune and position of this mr drewett since you are resolved to tell me nothing of your own affairs  both are good and such as no young lady can object to he is even said to be rich  thank god he then is not seeking lucy in the hope of getting some of mrs bradforts money  not in the least it is so easy to love lucy for lucys sake that even a fortunehunter would be in danger of being caught in his own trap but mr drewett is above the necessity of practising so vile a scheme for making money  here that the present generation may not be misled and imagine fortunehunting has come in altogether within the last twenty years i will add that it was not exactly a trade in this countrya regular occupationin 1802 as it has become in 1844 there were such things then certainly as men or women who were ready to marry anybody who would make them rich but i do not think theirs was a calling to which either sex served regular apprenticeships as is practised today still the business was carried on to speak in the vernacular and sometimes with marked success  you have not told me grace i resumed whether you think lucy is pleased or not with the attentions of this gentleman  my sister looked at me intently for a moment as if to ascertain how far i could or could not ask such a question with indifference it will be remembered that no verbal explanations had ever taken place between us on the subject of our feelings towards the companions of our childhood and that all that was known to either was obtained purely by inference between myself and lucy nothing had ever passed indeed which might not have been honestly referred to our long and early association so far as the rules of intercourse were concerned though i sometimes fancied i could recall a hundred occasions on which lucy had formerly manifested deep attachment for myself nor did i doubt her being able to show similar proofs by reversing the picture this however was or i had thought it to be merely the language of the heart the tongue having never spoken of course grace had nothing but conjecture on this subject and alas she had begun to see how possible it was for those who lived near each other to change their views on such subjects no wonder then if she fancied it still easier for those who had been separated for years   i have not told you miles grace answered after a brief delay because it would not be proper to communicate the secrets of my friend to a young man even to you were it in my power as it is not since lucy never has made to me the slightest confidential communication of any sort or nature touching love  never i exclaimedreading my fancied doom in the startling fact for i conceived it impossible had she ever really loved me that the matter should not have come up in conversation between two so closely unitednever  what no girlishno childish preferencehave you never had no mutual preferences to reveal  neveranswered grace firmly though her very temples seemed illuminatednever we have been satisfied with each others affection and have had no occasion to enter into any unfeminine and improper secrets if any such existed  a long and i doubt not a mutually painful pause succeeded  grace said i at lengthi am not envious of this probable accession of fortune to the hardinges but i think we should all have been much more unitedmuch happierwithout it  my sisters colour left her face she trembled all over and she became pale as death  you may be right in some respects miles she answered after a time and yet it is hardly generous to think so why should we wish to see our oldest friends those who are so very dear to us our excellent guardians children less well off than we are ourselves no doubt no doubt it may seem better to us that clawbonny should be the castle and we its possessors but others have their rights and interests as well as ourselves give the hardinges money and they will enjoy every advantage known in this countrymore than money can possibly give uswhy then ought we to be so selfish as to wish them deprived of this advantage place lucy where you will she will always be lucy and as for rupert so brilliant a young man needs only an opportunity to rise to anything the country possesses  grace was so earnest spoke with so much feeling appeared so disinterested so holy i had almost said that i could not find in my heart the courage to try her any farther  that she began to distrust rupert i plainly saw though it was merely with the glimmerings of doubt a nature as pure as hers and a heart so true admitted with great reluctance the proofs of the unworthiness of one so long loved it was evident moreover that she shrunk from revealing her own great secret while she had only conjectures to offer in regard to lucy and even these she withheld as due to her sex and the obligations of friendship i forgot that i had not been ingenuous myself and that i made no communication to justify any confidence on the part of my sister that which would have been treachery in her to say under this state of the case might have been uttered with greater frankness on my own part after a pause to allow my sister to recover from her agitation i turned the discourse to our own more immediate family interests and soon got off the painful subject altogether  i shall be of age grace i said in the course of my explanations before you see me again we sailors are always exposed to more chances and hazards than people ashore and i now tell you should anything happen to me my will may be found in my secretary signed and sealed the day i attain my majority i have given orders to have it drawn up by a lawyer of eminence and shall take it to sea with me for that very purpose  from which i am to infer that i must not covet clawbonny answered grace with a smile that denoted how little she cared for the factyou give it to our cousin jack wallingford as a male heir worthy of enjoying the honour  no dearest i give it to you it is true the law would do this for me but i choose to let it be known that i wish it to be so i am aware my father made that disposition of the place should i die childless before i became of age but once of age the place is all mine and that which is all mine shall be all thine after i am no more  this is melancholy conversation and i trust useless  under the circumstances you mention miles i never should have expected clawbonny nor do i know i ought to possess it it comes as much from jack wallingfords ancestors as from our own and it is better it should remain with the name i will not promise you therefore i will not give it to him the instant i can  this jack wallingford of whom i have not yet spoken was a man of fiveandforty and a bachelor he was a cousingerman of my fathers being the son of a younger brother of my grandfathers and somewhat of a favourite  he had gone into what was called the new countries in that day or a few miles west of cayuga bridge which put him into western new york i had never seen him but once and that was on a visit he paid us on his return from selling quantities of pot and pearl ashes in town articles made oh his new lands he was said to be a prosperous man and to stand little in need of the old paternal property  after a little more conversation on the subject of my will grace and i separated each more closely bound to the other i firmly believed for this dialogue in the family room never had my sister seemed more worthy of all my love and certain i am never did she possess more of it of clawbonny she was as sure as my power over it could make her  the remainder of the week passed as weeks are apt to pass in the country and in summer feeling myself so often uncomfortable in the society of the girls i was much in the fields always possessing the good excuse of beginning to look after my own affairs mr hardinge took charge of the major an intimacy beginning to spring up between these two respectable old men there were indeed so many points of common feeling that such a result was not at all surprising they both loved the churchi beg pardon the holy catholic protestant episcopal church  they both disliked bonapartethe major hated him but my guardian hated nobodyboth venerated billy pitt and both fancied the french revolution was merely the fulfilment of prophecy through the agency of the devils as we are now touching upon times likely to produce important results let me not be misunderstood as an old man aiming in a new sphere to keep enlightened the generation that is coming into active life it may be necessary to explain  an attempt has been made to induce the country to think that episcopalian and tory were something like synonymous terms in the times that tried mens souls this is sufficiently impudent per se in a country that possessed washington jay hamilton the lees the morrises the late bishop white and so many other distinguished patriots of the southern and middle states but men are not particularly scrupulous when there is an object to be obtained even though it be pretended that heaven is an incident of that object i shall therefore confine my explanations to what i have said about billy pitt and the french  the youth of this day may deem it suspicious that an episcopal divineprotestant episcopal i mean but it is so hard to get the use of new terms as applied to old thoughts in the decline of lifemay deem it suspicious that a protestant episcopal divine should care anything about billy pitt or execrate infidel france i will therefore just intimate that in 1802 no portion of the country dipped more deeply into similar sentiments than the descendants of those who first put foot on the rock of plymouth and whose progenitors had just before paid a visit to geneva where it is said or sung they had found a church without a bishop and a state without a king in a word admiration of mr pitt and execration of bonaparte were by no means such novelties in america in that day as to excite wonder for myself however i can truly say that like most americans who went abroad in those stirring times i was ready to say with mercutio a plague on both your houses for neither was even moderately honest or even decently respectful to ourselves party feeling however the most inexorable and the most unprincipled of all tyrants and the bane of american liberty notwithstanding all our boasting decreed otherwise and while one half the american republic was shouting hosannas to the great corsican the other half was ready to hail pitt as the heavenborn minister the remainder of the nation felt and acted as americans should it was my own private opinion that france and england would have been far better off had neither of these worthies ever had a being  nevertheless the union of opinion between the divine and the major was a great bond of union in friendship i saw they were getting on well together and let things take their course as for emily i cared very little about her except as she might prove to be connected with rupert and through rupert with the happiness of my sister as for rupert himself i could not get entirely weaned from one whom i had so much loved in boyhood and who moreover possessed the rare advantage of being lucys brother and mr  hardinges son sidneys sister pembrokes mother gave him a value in my eyes that he had long ceased to possess on his own account  you see neb i said towards the end of the week as the black and i were walking up from the mill in company mr rupert has altogether forgotten that he ever knew the name of a rope in a ship his hands are as white as a young ladys  nebber mind dat masser mile masser rupert nebber feel a saterfaction to be wracked away or to be prisoner to injin golly no gentleum to be envy sir em doesnt enjoy dat  you have a queer taste neb from all which i conclude you expect to return to town with me in the wallingford this evening and to go out in the dawn  sartain masser mile how you tink of goin to sea and leave nigger at home  here neb raised such a laugh that he might have been heard a hundred rods seeming to fancy the idea he had suggested was so preposterous as to merit nothing but ridicule  well neb i consent to your wishes but this will be the last voyage in which you will have to consult me on the subject as i shall make out your freedom papers the moment i am of age  what dem demanded the black quick as lightning  why papers to make you your own mastera free

did he ebber hear of a clawbonny that want to be a free nigger tell me dat once an i hab an answer  you have asked me more than i can answer boy for i am not in the secret of your own wishes much less in those of all your ancestors  neb pulled off his tarpaulin scratched his wool rolled his black eyes at me as if he enjoyed the manner in which he had puzzled me after which he set off on a tumbling excursion in the road going like a wheel on his hands and feet showing his teeth like rows of pearls and concluding the whole with roar the third that sounded as if the hills and valleys were laughing in the very fatness of their fertility the physical tour de force was one of those feats of agility in which neb had been my instructor ten years before  spose i free who do sich matter for you masser mile cried neb like one laying down an unanswerable proposition no no siri belong to you you belong to me and we belong to one anodder  this settled the matter for the present and i said no more  neb was ordered to be in readiness for the next day and at the appointed hour i met the assembled party to take my leave on this my third departure from the roof of my fathers it had been settled the major and emily were to remain at the farm until july when they were to proceed to the springs for the benefit of the water after living so long in a hot climate i had passed an hour with my guardian alone and he had no more to say than to wish me well and to bestow his blessing i did not venture an offer to embrace lucy it was the first time we had parted without this token of affection but i was shy and i fancied she was cold she offered me her hand as frankly as ever however and i pressed it fervently as i wished her adieu  as for grace she wept in my arms just as she had always done and the major and emily shook hands cordially with me it being understood i should find them in new york at my return rupert accompanied me down to the sloop  if you should find an occasion miles let us hear from you said my old friend i have a lively curiosity to learn something of the frenchmen nor am i entirely without the hope of soon gratifying the desire in person  youif you have any intention to visit france what better opportunity than to go in my cabin is it business that will take you there  not at all pure pleasure our excellent cousin thinks a gentleman of a certain class ought to travel and i believe she has an idea of getting me attached to the legation in some form or other  this sounded so odd to me rupert hardinge who had not one penny to rub against another so lately was now talking of his european tour and of legations i ought to have been glad of his good fortune and i fancied i was  i said nothing this time concerning his taking up any portion of my earnings having the sufficient excuse of not being on pay myself rupert did not stay long in the sloop and we were soon under way i looked eagerly along the high banks of the creek fringed as it was with bushes in hopes of seeing grace at least nor was i disappointed she and lucy had taken a direct path to the point where the two waters united and were standing there as the sloop dropped past they both waved their handkerchiefs in a way to show the interest they felt in me and i returned the parting salutations by kissing my hand again and again at this instant a sailboat passed our bows and i saw a gentleman standing up in it waving his handkerchief quite as industriously as i was kissing my hand a look told me it was andrew drewett who directed his boat to the point and was soon making his bows to the girls in person his boat ascended the creek no doubt with his luggage while the last i saw of the party it was walking off in company taking the direction of the house    chapter xxv    or feeling as the storm increases   the love of terror nerve thy breast   didst venture to the coast   to see the mighty warship leap   from wave to wave upon the deep   like chamois goat from steep to steep   till low in valley lost   allston   roger talcott had not been idle during my absence  clawbonny was so dear to me that i had staid longer than was proposed in the original plan and i now found the hatches on the dawn a crew shipped and nothing remaining but to clear out i mean the literal thing and not the slang phrase one of those of which so many have crept into the american language through the shop and which even find their way into print such as charter coaches on a boat on board a stage and other similar elegancies on a boat always makes me even at my present time of life  the dawn was cleared the day i reached town  several of the crew of the crisis had shipped with us anew the poor fellows having already made away with all their wages and prizemoney in the short space of a month  this denoted the usual improvidence of sailors and was thought nothing out of the common way the country being at peace a difficulty with tripoli excepted it was no longer necessary for ships to go armed the sudden excitement produced by the brush with the french had already subsided and the navy was reduced to a few vessels that had been regularly built for the service while the lists of officers had been curtailed of twothirds of their names we were no longer a warlike but were fast getting to be a strictly commercial body of seamen i had a single sixpounder and half a dozen muskets in the dawn besides a pair or two of pistols with just ammunition enough to quell a mutiny fire a few signalguns or to kill a few ducks  we sailed on the 3rd of july i have elsewhere intimated that the manhattanese hold exaggerated notions of the comparative beauty of the scenery of their port sometimes presuming to compare it even with naples to the bay of which it bears some such resemblance as a dutch canal bears to a river flowing through rich meadows in the freedom and grace of nature nevertheless there are times and seasons when the bay of new york offers a landscape worthy of any pencil it was at one of these felicitous moments that the dawn cast off from the wharf and commenced her voyage to bordeaux there was barely air enough from the southward to enable us to handle the ship and we profited by a morning ebb to drop down to the narrows in the midst of a fleet of some forty sail most of the latter however being coasters still we were a dozen ships and brigs bound to almost as many different countries the little air there was seemed scarcely to touch the surface of the water and the broad expanse of bay was as placid as an inland lake of a summers morning yes yesthere are moments when the haven of new york does present pictures on which the artist would seize with avidity but the instant nature attempts any of her grander models on this a spot that seems never to rise much above the level of commercial excellencies it is found that the accessaries are deficient in sublimity or even beauty  i have never seen our home waters so lovely as on this morning the movements of the vessels gave just enough of life and variety to the scene to destroy the appearance of sameness while the craft were too far from the land to prevent one of the most unpleasant effects of the ordinary landscape scenery of the placethat produced by the disproportion between the tallness of their spars and the low character of the adjacent shores as we drew near the narrows the wind increased and forty sail working through the pass in close conjunction terminated the piece with something like the effect produced by a finale in an overture the brightness of the morning the placid charms of the scenery and the propitious circumstances under which i commenced the voyage in a commercial point of view had all contributed to make me momentarily forget my private griefs and to enter cheerfully into the enjoyment of the hour  i greatly disliked passengers they appealed to me to lessen the dignity of my position and to reduce me to the level of an innkeeper or one who received boarders i wished to command a ship not to take in lodgers persons whom you are bound to treat with a certain degree of consideration and in one sense as your superiors still it had too much of an appearance of surliness and a want of hospitality to refuse a respectable man a passage across the ocean when he might not get another chance in a month and that too when it was important to himself to proceed immediately in this particular instance i became the dupe of a mistaken kindness on the part of my former owners  these gentlemen brought to me a mr brighamwallace mortimer brigham was his whole name to be particularas a person who was desirous of getting to france with his wife and wifes sister in order to proceed to italy for the health of the married lady who was believed to be verging on a decline these people were from the eastward and had fallen into the old error of americans that the south of france and italy had residences far more favourable for such a disease than our own country this was one of the provincial notions of the day that were entailed on us by means of colonial dependency i suppose the colonial existence is as necessary to a people as childhood and adolescence are to the man but as my lady mary wortley montagu told her friend lady richnay but look you my dear madam i grant it a very fine thing to continue always fifteen that everybody must approve ofit is quite fair but indeed indeed one need not be five years old  i was prevailed on to take these passengers and i got a specimen of their characters even as we dropped down the bay in the midst of the agreeable scene to which i have just alluded they were gossips and that too of the lowest or personal cast nothing made them so happy as to be talking of the private concerns of their fellowcreatures and as ever must happen where this propensity exists ninetenths of what they said rested on no better foundation than surmises inferences drawn from premises of questionable accuracy and judgments that were entered up without the authority or even the inclination to examine witnesses  they had also a peculiarity that i have often remarked in persons of the same propensity most of their gossiping arose from a desire to make apparent their own intimacy with the private affairs of people of markoverlooking the circumstance that in thus making the concerns of others the subjects of their own comments they were impliedly admitting a consciousness of their own inferiority men seldom condescending thus to busy themselves with the affairs of any but those of whom they feel it to be a sort of distinction to converse i am much afraid goodbreeding has more to do with the suppression of this vice than good principles as the world goes i have remarked that persons of a high degree of selfrespect and a good tone of manners are quite free from this defect of character while i regret to be compelled to say that i have been acquainted with divers very saintly professors including one or two parsons who have represented the very beau ideal of scandal  my passengers gave me a taste of their quality as i have said before we had got a mile below governors island  the ladies were named sarah and jane and between them and wallace mortimer what an insight did i obtain into the private affairs of sundry personages of salem in massachusetts together with certain glimpses in at boston folk all however referring to qualities and facts that might be classed among the real or supposed i can at this distant day recall scene 1st act 1st of the drama that continued while we were crossing the ocean with the slight interruption of a few days produced by seasickness  wallace said sarah did you say yesterday that john viner had refused to lend his daughters husband twenty thousand dollars to get him out of his difficulties and that he failed in consequence  to be sure it was the common talk through wall street yesterday and everybody believes itthere was no more truth in the story than in one of the forty reports that have killed general jackson so often in the last twenty years yes no one doubts itbut all the viners are just so all of us in our part of the world know what to think of the viners  yes i suppose so drawled jane ive heard it said this john viners father ran all the way from the commons in boston to the foot of state street to get rid of a dun against this very son who had his own misfortunes when he was young  the story is quite likely true in part rejoined wallace though it cant be quite accurate as the old gentleman had but one leg and running was altogether out of the question with him it was probably old tim viner who ran like a deer when a young man as ive heard people say  well then i suppose he ran his horse added jane in the same quiet drawling tone something must have run or they never would have got up the story  i wondered if miss jane hitchcox had ever taken the trouble to ascertain who they were i happened to know both the viners and to be quite certain there was not a word of truth in the report of the twenty thousand dollars having heard all the particulars of the late failure from one of my former owners who was an assignee and a considerable creditor under the circumstances i thought i would hint as much  are you quite sure that the failure of viner  co was owing to the circumstance you mention mr brigham i inquired  pretty certain i am measurably acquainted with their affairs and think i am tolerably safe in saying so  now measurably acquainted meant that he lived within twenty or thirty miles of those who did know something of the concerns of the house in question and was in the way of catching scraps of the gossip that fell from disappointed creditors how much of this is there in this good country of ours men who live just near enough to one another to feel the influence of all that rivalry envy personal strifes and personal malignancies can generate fancy they are acquainted from this circumstance with those to whom they have never even spoken onehalf the idle tales that circulate up anddown the land come from authority not one tittle better than this how much would men learn could they only acquire the healthful lesson of understanding that nothing which is much out of the ordinary way and which circulates as received truths illustrative of character is true in all its material parts and very little in any but to return to my passengers and that portion of their conversation which most affected myself they continued commenting on persons and families by name seemingly more to keep their hands in than for any other discoverable reason as each appeared to be perfectly conversant with all the gossip that was started when sarah casually mentioned the name of mrs bradfort with some of whose supposed friends it now came out they had all a general visiting acquaintance  dr hosack is of opinion she cannot live long i hear said jane with a species of fierce delight in killing a fellowcreature provided it only led to a gossip concerning her private affairs her case has been decided to be a cancer now for more than a week and she made her will last tuesday  only last tuesday exclaimed sarah in surprise  well i heard she had made her will a twelvemonth since and that she left all her property to young rupert hardinge in the expectation some persons thought that he might marry her  how could that be my dear asked the husband in what would she be better off for leaving her own property to her husband  why by law would she not i dont exactly know how it would happen for i do not particularly understand these things but it seems natural that a woman would be a gainer if she made the man she was about to marry her heir she would have her thirds in his estate would she not  but mrs brigham said i smiling is it quite certain mrs bradfort wishes to marry rupert hardinge at all  i know so little of the parties that i cannot speak with certainty in the matter i admit captain wallingford  well but sarah dear interposed the more exacting jane you are making yourself unnecessarily ignorant  you very well know how intimate we are with the greenes and they know the winters perfectly well who are nextdoor neighbours to mrs bradfort i dont see how you can say we havent good means of being measurably wellinformed  now i happened to know through grace and lucy that a disagreeable old person of the name of greene did live next door to mrs bradfort but that the latter refused to visit her firstly because she did not happen to like her and secondly because the two ladies belonged to very different social circles a sufficient excuse for not visiting in town even though the parties inhabited the same house but the brighams being salem people did not understand that families might reside next door to each other in a large town for a long series of months or even years and not know each others names it would not be easy to teach this truth one of everyday occurrence to the inhabitant of one of our provincial towns who was in the habit of fancying he had as close an insight into the private affairs of all his neighbours as they enjoyed themselves  no doubt we are all as well off as most strangers in new york observed the wife still it ought to be admitted that we may be mistaken i have heard it said there is an old mr hardinge a clergyman who would make a far better match for the lady than his son however it is of no great moment now for when our neighbour mrs john foote saw dr hosack about her own child she got all the particulars out of him about mrs bradforts case from the highest quarter and i had it from mrs foote herself  i could not have believed that a physician of dr hosacks eminence and character would speak openly of the diseases of his patients i observed a little tartly i am afraid  oh he didnt said sarah eagerlyhe was as cunning as a fox mrs foote owned herself and played her off finely but mrs foote was cunninger than any halfdozen foxes and got it all out of him by negations  negations i exclaimed wondering what was meant by the term though i had understood i was to expect a little more philosophy and metaphysics not to say algebra in my passengers than usually accompanied petticoats in our part of the world  certainly negations answered the matron with a smile as complacent as that which usually denotes the consciousness of intellectual superiority one who is a little practised can ascertain a fact as well by means of negatives as affirmatives it only requires judgment and use  then mrs bradforts disease is only ascertained by the negative process  so i supposebut what does one want more put in the husbandand that she made her will last week i feel quite sure as it was generally spoken of among our friends  here were people who had been in new york only a month looking out for a ship mere passengers as it might be who knew more about a family with which i had myself such an intimate connection than its own members i thought it no wonder that such a race was capable of enlightening mankind on matters and things in general but the game did not end here  i suppose miss lucy hardinge will get something by mrs bradforts death observed miss jane and that she and mr andrew drewett will marry as soon as it shall become proper  here was a speculation for a man in my state of mind  the names were all right some of the incidents even were probable if not correct yet how could the facts be known to these comparative strangers did the art of gossiping with all its meannesses lies devices inventions and cruelties really possess so much advantage over the intercourse of the confiding and honest as to enable those who practise it to discover facts hidden from eyewitnesses and eyewitnesses too that had every inducement of the strongest interest in the issue not to be deceived i felt satisfied the moment mrs greenes name was mentioned that my passengers were not in the true new york set and justly enough inferred they were not very good authority for one half they said and yet how could they know anything of drewetts attachment to lucy unless their information were tolerably accurate  i shall not attempt to repeat all that passed while the ship dropped down the bay but enough escaped the gossips to render me still more unhappy than i had yet been on the subject of lucy i could and did despise these people that was easy enough but it was not so easy to forget all that they said and surmised this is one of the causes attendant on the habit of loose talking one never knowing what to credit and what not in spite of all my disgust and a firm determination not to contribute in any manner to the stock in trade of these people i found great difficulty in evading their endless questions how much they got out of me by means of the process of negations i never knew but they got no great matter through direct affirmatives something however persons so indefatigable to whom gossiping was the great aim of life must obtain and they ascertained that mr hardinge was my guardian that rupert and i had passed our boyhoods in each others company and that lucy was even an inmate of my own house the day we sailed this little knowledge only excited a desire for more and by the end of a week i was obliged to submit to devices and expedients to pump me than which even the thumbscrew was scarcely more efficient i practised on the negative system myself with a good deal of dexterity however and threw my inquisitors off very handsomely more than once until i discovered that wallace mortimer determined not to be baffled actually opened communications with neb in order to get a clearer insight into my private affairs after this i presume my readers will not care to hear any more about these gentry whose only connection with my life grew out of the misgivings they contributed largely to create in my mind touching the state of lucys affections  this much they did effect and i was compelled to submit to their power we are all of us more or less the dupes of knaves and fools  all this however was the fruits of several weeks intercourse and i have anticipated events a little in order to make the statements in connection meeting a breeze as has been said already the dawn got over the bar about two oclock and stood off the land on an easy bowline in company with the little fleet of squarerigged vessels that went out at the same time by sunset navesink again dipped and i was once more fairly at sea  this was at the period when the commerce of america was at its height the spirit shown by the young republic in the french affair had commanded a little respect though the supposed tendencies of the new administration was causing anything but a cordial feeling towards the country to exist in england that powerful nation however had made a hollow peace with france the previous march and the highway of nations was temporarily open to all ships alike a state of things that existed for some ten months after we sailed nothing to be apprehended consequently lay before me beyond the ordinary dangers of the ocean  for these last i was now prepared by the experience of several years passed almost entirely on board ship during which time i had encircled the earth itself in my peregrinations  our run off the coast was favourable and the sixth day out we were in the longitude of the tail of the grand bank  i was delighted with my ship which turned out to be even more than i had dared to hope for she behaved well under all circumstances sailing even better than she worked the first ten days of our passage were prosperous and we were midocean by the 10th of the month during this time i had nothing to annoy me but the ceaseless cancans of my passengers i had heard the name of every individual of note in salem with certain passages in his or her life and began to fancy i had lived a twelvemonth in the place at length i began to speculate on the reason why this morbid propensity should exist so much stronger in that part of the world than in any other i had visited there was nothing new in the disposition of the people of small places to gossip and it was often done in large towns more especially those that did not possess the tone of a capital lady mary wortley montagu and horace walpole wrote gossip but it was spiced with wit as is usual with the scandal of such places as london and paris whereas this to which i was doomed to listen was nothing more than downright impertinent vulgar meddling with the private affairs of all those whom the gossips thought of sufficient importance to talk about  at clawbonny we had our gossip too but it was innocent seldom infringed much on the truth and usually respected the right of every person to possess certain secrets that might remain inviolate to the world no such rules prevailed with my passengers like a certain editor of a newspaper of my acquaintance who acts as if he fancied all things in heaven and earth were created expressly to furnish materials for paragraphs they appeared to think that everybody of their acquaintance existed for no other purpose than to furnish them food for conversation there must have been some unusual cause for so much personal espionnage and at length i came to the following conclusion on the subject i had heard that church government among the puritans descended into all the details of life that it was a part of their religious duty to watch over each other jog the memories of the delinquents and serve god by ferreting out vice this is a terrible inducement to fill the mind with the motes of a neighbourhood and the mind thus stowed as we sailors say will be certain to deliver cargo then come the institutions with their neverending elections and the construction that has been put on the right of the elector to inquire into all things the whole consummated by the journals who assume a power to penetrate the closet ay even the heartand lay bare its secrets is it any wonder if we should become in time a nation of mere gossips as for my passengers even neb got to consider them as so many nuisances  from some cause or other whether it was having these loosetongued people on board or not is more than i can say but certain it is about the time salem was handsomely cleaned out and a heavy inroad had been made upon boston that the weather changed it began to blow in gusts sometimes from one point of the compass sometimes from another until the ship was brought to very short canvass from a dread of being caught unprepared at length these fantasies of the winds terminated in a tremendous gale such as i had seldom then witnessed and such indeed as i have seldom witnessed since it is a great mistake to suppose that the heaviest weather occurs in the autumnal spring or winter months much the strongest blows i have ever known have taken place in the middle of the warm weather  this is the season of the hurricanes and out of the tropics i think it is also the season of the gales it is true these gales do not return annually a long succession of years frequently occurring without one but when they do come they may be expected in our own seas in july august or september  the wind commenced at southwest on this occasion and it blew fresh for several hours sending us ahead on our course at the rate of eleven knots as the sea got up and sail was reduced our speed was a little diminished perhaps but we must have made more than a hundred miles in the first ten hours the day was bright cloudless genial and even bland there being nothing unpleasant in the feeling of the swift currents of the air that whirled past us at sunset i did not quite like the appearance of the horizon and we let the ship wade through it under her three topsails singlereefed her forecourse and foretopmast staysail  this was short canvass for a vessel that had the wind nearly over her taffrail at nine oclock second reefs were taken in and at ten the mizentopsail was furled i then turned in deeming the ship quite snug leaving orders with the mates to reduce the sail did they find the ship straining or the spars in danger and to call me should anything serious occur i was not called until daylight when talcott laid his hand on my shoulder and said you had better turn out captain wallingford we have a peeler and i want a little advice  it was a peeler indeed when i reached the deck the ship was under a forecourse and a closereefed maintopsail canvass that can be carried a long time while running off but which i at once saw was quite too much for us  an order was given immediately to take in the topsail  notwithstanding the diminutive surface that was exposed the surges given by this bit of canvass as soon as the clews were eased off sufficiently to allow the cloth to jerk shook the vessels hull it was a miracle that we saved the mast or that we got the cloth rolled up at all at one time i thought it would be necessary to cut it from the yard fortunately the gale was steady this day proving bright and clear like that which had preceded   the men aloft made several attempts to hail the deck but the wind blew too heavily to suffer them to be heard talcott had gone on the yard himself and i saw him gesticulating in a way to indicate there was something ahead  the seas were running so high that it was not easy to obtain much of a look at the horizon but by getting into the mizenrigging i had a glimpse of a vessels spars to the eastward of us and directly on our course it was a ship under bare poles running as nearly before us as she could but making most fearful yaws sometimes sheering away off to starboard in a way to threaten her with broachingto then taking a yaw to port in which i could see all three of her masts with their yards pointed nearly at us i got but one glimpse of her hull as it rose on a sea at the same instant with the dawn and it actually appeared as if about to be blown away though i took the stranger to be a vessel at least as large as we were ourselves we were evidently approaching her fast though both vessels were going the same way  the dawn steered beautifully one of the greatest virtues in a ship under the circumstances in which we were then placed a single man was all that we had at the wheel and he controlled it with ease i could see it was very different with the ship ahead and fancied they had made a mistake on board her by taking in all their canvass talcott and the gang aloft had not got out of the top however before we had a hint that it would be well to imitate the strangers prudence though our vessel steered so much better than another no ship can keep on a direct line while running before the wind in a heavy sea the waves occasionally fly past a vessel like the scud glancing through the air then they seem to pause altogether as if to permit the ship to overtake them when a vessel is lifted aft by one of these torrents of rushing waters the helm loses a portion of its power and the part of the vast machine that first receives the impulse seems intent on exchanging places with the bows vessels often driving sideways before the surges for spaces of time that are exceedingly embarrassing to the mariner this happens to the beststeering ships and is always one source of danger in very heavy weather to those that are running off the merit of the dawn was in coming under command again quickly and in not losing so much of the influence of her helm as is frequently the case with wildsteering craft i understand there is a sloopofwar now in the navy that is difficult to get through a narrow passage in a blow in consequence of her having this propensity to turn her head first one way then another like a gay horse that breaks his bridle  the hint given just as talcott was quitting the top and to which there has been allusion was given under the impulsion of one of these driving seas the dawn still carried her foretopmast staysail a small triangular piece of stout canvass and which was particularly useful as leading from the end of the bowsprit towards the head of the foretopmast in preventing her from broachingto or pressing up with her bows so near the wind as to produce the danger of seas breaking over the mass of the hull and sweeping the decks the landsman will understand this is the gravest of the dangers that occur at sea in very heavy weather  when the ship is thrown broadside to the sea or comes up so as to bring the wind abeam or even forward of the beam as in lyingto there is always risk from this source another clanger which is called pooping is of a character that one who is ignorant of the might of the ocean when aroused would not be apt to foresee it proceeds from the impetuous velocity of the waves which rushing ahead so much faster than the vessel that is even driving before the gale breaks against the quarter or stern and throws its masses of water along the deck in a line with its keel i suppose the president steamer to have been lost by the first of these two dangers as will appear in the following little theory  there is no doubt that wellconstructed steamers are safer craft the danger from fire excepted than the ordinary ship except in very heavy weather with an ordinary gale they can contend with sufficient power but it is an unfortunate consequence of their construction that exactly as the danger increases their power of meeting it diminishes  in a very heavy swell one cannot venture to resort to a strong head of steam since one wheel may be nearly out of water while the other is submerged and thus endanger the machinery now the great length of these vessels renders it difficult to keep them up to the wind or head to sea the safest of all positions for a vessel in heavy weather while it exposes them to the additional risk of having the water break aboard them near the waist in running dead before it in a word i suppose a steamer difficult to be kept out of the trough in very heavy weather and no vessel can be safe in the trough of the seas under such circumstances one of great length less so than others this is true however only in reference to those steamers which carry the oldfashioned wheel erricsons screw and hunters submerged wheels rendering steamships in my poor judgment the safest craft in the world  the dawn was overtaken by the seas from time to time and then like everything else that floats she yawed or rather had her stern urged impetuously round as if it were in a hurry to get ahead of the bows on these occasions the noise made by the foretopmast staysail as it collapsed and filled resembled the report of a small gun we had similar reports from the foresail which for moments at a time was actually becalmed as the ship settled into the trough and then became distended with a noise like that of the shaking of a thousand carpets all filled with sancho panzas at the same instant as yet the cloth and gear had stood these violent shocks admirably but just as talcott was leading his party down the ship made one of her sidelong movements the staysail filled with a tremendous report and away it flew to leeward taken outof the boltrope as if it had been cut by shears and then used by the furies of the tempest talcott smiled as he gazed at the driving canvass which went a quarter of a mile before it struck the water whirling like a kite that has broken its string and then he shook his head i disliked too the tremendous surges of the foresail when it occasionally collapsed and as suddenly filled menacing to start every bolt and to part every rope connected with block or spar  we must get in that forecourse mr talcott i said or we shall lose something i see the ship ahead is under barepoles and it were better we were as snug if i did not dislike losing such a wind it would be wiser to heaveto the ship man the buntlines and clewgarnets at once and wait for a favourable moment  we had held on to our canvass too long the fault of youth as i had determined to shorten sail however we now set about it in earnest and with all the precautions exacted by the circumstances everybody that could be mustered was placed at the clewlines and buntlines with strict orders to do his best at the proper moments the firstmate went to the tack and the second to the sheet i was to take in the sail myself i waited for a collapse and then while the ship was buried between two mounds of water when it was impossible to see a hundred yards from her in any direction and the canvass was actually dropping against the mast i gave the usual orders every man hauled as if for life and we had got the clews pretty well up when the vessel came out of the cavern into the tempest receiving the whole power of the gale with a sudden surge into the bellying canvass away went everything as if the gear were cobwebs at the next instant the sail was in ribands i was deeply mortified as well as rendered uneasy by this accident as the ship ahead unquestionably was in full view of all that happened  it was soon apparent however that professional pride must give place to concern for the safety of the vessel the wind had been steadily increasing in power and had now reached a pass when it became necessary to look things steadily in the face the strips of canvass that remained attached to the yard with the blocks and gear attached threshed about in a way to threaten the lives of all that approached this was only at the intervals when the ship settled into the troughs for while under the full influence of the gale pennants never streamed more directly from a mast than did these heavy fragments from the foreyard  it was necessary to get rid of them and talcott had just volunteered to go on the yard with this end when neb sprang into the rigging without an order and was soon beyond the reach of the voice this daring black had several narrow escapes more especially from the foresheet blocks but he succeeded in cutting everything adrift and in leaving nothing attached to the spar but the boltrope of the head of the sail it is true little effected this object when the knife could be applied the threads of the stout canvass snapping at the touch  as soon as the ship was under bare poles though at the sacrifice of two of her sails i had leisure to look out for the other vessel there she was more than half a mile ahead of us yawing wildly and rolling her lower yardarm to the waters edge as we drew nearer i got better glimpses of this vessel which was a ship and as i fancied an english west indiaman deeploaded with the produce of the islands deeploaded as i fancied for it was only at instants that she could be seen at all under circumstances to judge of this fact sometimes her hull appearing to be nearly smothered in the brine and then again her copper glistening in the sun resembling a light vessel kept under the care of some thrifty housewife  the dawn did not fly now all her canvass was gone as fast as she had previously done she went through the water at a greater rate than the vessel ahead but it required an hour longer to bring the two ships within a cables length of each other then indeed we got a near view of the manner in which the elements can play with such a mass of wood and iron as a ship when in an angry mood  there were instants when i fancied i could nearly see the keel of the stranger for half its length as he went foaming up on the crest of a wave apparently ready to quit the water altogether then again he would settle away into the blue abyss hiding everything beneath his tops when both vessels sunk together no sign of our neighbour was visible though so near we came up after one of these deep plunges into the valleys of the ocean and to our alarm saw the english ship yawing directly athwart our course and within fifty fathoms of us this was about the distance at which i intended to pass little dreaming of finding the other ship so completely in our way the englishman must have intended to come a little nearer and got one of those desperate sheers that so often ran away with him  there he was however and a breathless minute followed when he was first seen two vehicles dashing along a highway with frightened and runaway teams would not present a sight onehalf as terrific as that which lay directly before our eyes  the dawn was plunging onward with a momentum to dash in splinters did she strike any resisting object and yawing herself sufficiently to render the passage hazardous  but the stranger made the matter tenfold worse when i first saw him in this fearful proximity his broadside was nearly offered to the seas and away he was flying on the summit of a mountain of foam fairly crossing our forefoot  at the next moment he fell off before the wind again and i could just see his tops directly ahead his sheer had been toport our intention having been to pass him on his starboard side but perceiving him to steer so wild i thought it might be well to go in the other direction quick as the words could be uttered therefore i called out to port the helm this was done of course and just as the dawn felt the new influence the other vessel took the same sheer and away we both went to starboard at precisely the same instant i shouted to right our helm to hard astarboard and it was well i did a minute more would have brought us down headlong on the englishman even now we could only see his hull at instants but the awful proximity of his spars denoted the full extent of the danger luckily we hit on opposite directions or our common destruction would have been certain but it was one thing in that cauldron of a sea to determine on a course and another to follow it as we rose on the last wave that alone separated us from the stranger he was nearly ahead and as we glanced onward i saw that we should barely clear his larboard quarter our helm being already a starboard no more could be done should he take another sheer to port we must infallibly cut him in twain as i have said he had jammed his helm toport and slowly and with a species of reluctance he inclined a little aside then we came up both ships rolling off or our yards must have interlocked and passing his quarter with our bows we each felt the sheer at the same instant and away we went asunder the sterns of the ships looking at each other and certainly not a hundred feet apart a shout from talcott drew me to our taffrail and standing on that of our neighbour what or whom should i see waving his hat but the red countenance of honest moses marble    chapter xxvi    at the piping of all hands   when the judgment signals spread   when the islands and the lands   and the seas give up the dead   and the south and the north shall come   when the sinner is dismayd   and the just man is afraid   then heaven be thy aid   poor tom   brainard   the two ships in the haste of their respective crews to get clear of each other were now running in the troughs and the same idea would seem to have suggested itself to me and the other master at the same instant instead of endeavouring to keep away again one kept his helm hard aport the other as hard astarboard until we both came by the wind though on opposite tacks the englishman set his mizenstaysail and though he made bad weather of it he evidently ran much less risk than in scudding the seas came on board him constantly but not in a way to do any material damage as for the dawn she layto like a duck under bare poles i had a spare staysail stopped up in her mizenrigging from the top down and after that the ship was both easy and dry once in a while it is true her bows would meet some fellow heavier than common and then we got a few hogsheads of water forward but it went out to leeward as fast as it came in to windward at the turn of the day however the gale broke and the weather moderated sensibly both sea and wind beginning to go down  had we been alone i should not have hesitated about bearing up getting some sail on the ship and running off on my course again but the desire to speak the stranger and have some communication with marble was so strong that i could not make up my mind to do so including myself talcott neb the cabinsteward and six of the people forward there were ten of us on board who knew the exmate and of the whole ten there was not a dissenting voice concerning his identity i determined therefore to stick by the englishman and at least have some communication with my old friend as for myself i own i loved marble uncouth and peculiar as he sometimes was i owed him more than any other man living mr hardinge excepted for he had made me a seaman having been of use to me professionally in a hundred ways then we had seen so much in company that i regarded him as a portion of my experience and as in some measure identified with my own nautical career  i was afraid at one moment that the englishman intended to remain as he was all night but about an hour before sunset i had the gratification to see him set his foresail and keep off i had wore round two hours before to get the dawns head on the same tack with him and followed under bare poles as the stranger soon set his maintopsail close reefed and then his fore it enabled us to make a little sail also in order to keep up with him this we did all that night and in the morning both ships were under everything that would draw with a moderate breeze from the northward and no great matter of sea going the english vessel was about a league to leeward of us and a little ahead under such circumstances it was easy to close  accordingly just as the two ships companies were about to go to breakfast the dawn ranged up under the leequarter of the stranger  what ships that i hailed in the usual manner  the dundee robert ferguson masterwhat ships that  the dawn miles wallingford where are you from  from rio de janeiro bound to london where are you from  from new york to bordeaux a heavy blow we have just had of it  quite the like of it ive not seen in many a day  youve a pratty seaboat yon  she made capital weather in the late gale and ive every reason to be satisfied with her pray havent you an american on board of the name of marble we fancied that we saw the face of an old shipmate on your taffrail yesterday and have kept you company in order to inquire after his news  ay ay answered the scotch master waving his hand  the chiel will be visiting you prasently hes below stowing away his dunnage and will be thanking you for a passage home im thinking  as these words were uttered marble appeared on deck and waved his hat again in recognition this was enough as we understood each other the two ships took sufficient room and hoveto we lowered our boat and talcott went alongside of the dundee in quest of our old shipmate newspapers and news were exchanged and in twenty minutes i had the extreme gratification of grasping marble once more by the hand  my old friend was too much affected to speak for some little time he shook hands with everybody and seemed as much astonished as he was delighted at finding so many of us together again but not a syllable did he utter for several minutes i had his chest passed into the cabin and then went and took my seat alongside of him on the hencoops intending to hear his story as soon as he was disposed to give it but it was no easy matter to get out of earshot of my passengers during the gale they had been tonguetied and i had a little peace but no sooner did the wind and sea go down than they broke out in the old spot and began to do boston in the way they had commenced  now marble had come on board in a manner so unusual and it was evident a secret history was to be revealed that all three took post in the companionway in a manner to render it impossible anything material could escape them i knew the folly of attempting a change of position on deck we should certainly be followed up and people of this class so long as they can make the excuse of saying they heard any part of a secret never scruple about inventing the portions that happen to escape their ears  consequently i desired marble and talcott to follow me and incontinently i led the way into the maintop i was obeyed the secondmate having the watch and all three of us were soon seated with our legs over the toprim as comfortable as so many gossips who had just finished their last cups have stirred the fire and drawn their heads together to open a freshbudget neither sarah nor jane could follow us thank god  there dn em said i a little pointedly for it was enough to make a much more scrupulous person swear weve got the length of the mainrigging between us and i do not think theyll venture into the top this fine morning in order to overhear what shall be said it would puzzle even wallace mortimer to do that talcott  if they do observed talcott laughing we can retreat to the crosstrees and thence to the royalyard  marble looked inquisitive but at the same time he looked knowing  i understand he said with a nod three people with six sets of earsis it not so miles  precisely though you only do them credit by halves for you should have added to this inventory forty tongues  well that is a large supply the man or woman who is so well provided should carry plenty of ballast however as you say theyre out of hail now and must guess at all they repeat if repeating it can be called  quite as much as ninetenths of what they give as coming from others observed talcott people never can tell so much of other persons affairs without bailing out most of their ideas from their own scuttlebutts  well let them go tobordeaux said i since they are bound there and now my dear marble here we are and dying to know all that has happened to you you have firm friends in talcott and myself either of us ready to give you his berth for the asking  thankee my dear boysthankee with all my heart and soul returned the honest fellow dashing the moisture from his eyes with the back of his hand i believe you would boys i do believe you would one or both i am glad miles you came up into this bloody top for i wouldnt like to let your reglar longshore harpies see a man of my time of life and one that has been to sea now man and boy close on to forty years with as much blubber about him as one of your right whales welland now for the log for i suppose youll insist on overhauling it lads  that we shall and see you miss no leaf of it be as particular as if it were overhauled in an insurance case  ay theyre bloody knaves sometimes them underwriters und a fellow need be careful to get his dues out of themthat is to say some others agin are gentlemen down to their shoebuckles and no sooner see a poor shipwrecked devil than they open their tills and begin to count out before he has opened his mouth  well but your own adventures my old friend you forget we are dying with curiosity  ayyour curositys a troublesome inmate and will never be quiet as long as one tries to keep it under hatches especially female curosity well i must gratify you and so ill make no more bones about it though its giving an account of my own obstinacy and folly i reckon now my boys you missed me the day the ship sailed from the island  that we did and supposed you had got tired of your experiment before it began i answered so were off before we were ourselves  you had reason for so thinking though you were out in your reckoning too no it happened in this fashion  after you left me i began to generalize over my sitiation and i says to myself says i moses marble them lads will never consent to sail and leave you here on this island alone like a bloody hermit says i if you want to hold on says i and try your hand at a hermitage says i or to play robinson crusoe says i you must be out of the way when the crisis sailsboys whats become of the old ship not a word have i heard about her yet  she was loading for london when we sailed her owners intending to send her the same voyage over again  and they refused to let you have her miles on account of your youth notwithstanding all you did for them  not so they pressed me to keep her but i preferred a ship of my own the dawn is my property master moses  thank god then there is one honest chap among the owners and how did she behave had you any trouble with the pirates  perceiving the utter uselessness of attempting to hear his own story before i rendered an account of the crisis and her exploits i gave marble a history of our voyage from the time we parted down to the day we reached new york  and that scaramouch of a schooner that the frenchman gave us in his charity  the pretty poll she got home safe was sold and is now in the westindia trade there is a handsome balance amounting to some fourteen hundred dollars in the owners hands coming to you from prizemoney and wages  it is not in nature for any man to be sorry he has money i saw by marbles eyes that this sum so unusually large for him to possess formed a new tie to the world and that he fancied himself a much happier man in possessing it he looked at me earnestly for quite a minute and then remarked i make no doubt with sincere regret  miles if i had a mother living now that money might make her old age comfortable it seems that they who have no mothers have money and they who have no money have mothers  i waited a moment for marble to recover his selfcommand and then urged him to continue his story  i was telling you how i generalized over my sitiation resumed the exmate as soon as i found myself alone in the hut i came to the conclusion that i should be carried off by force if i remained till next day and so i got into the launch carried her out of the lagoon taking care to give the ship a berth went through the reef and kept turning to windward until daybreak by that time the island was quite out of sight though i saw the upper sails of the ship as soon as you got her under way i kept the topgallantsails in sight until i made the island again and as you went off i ran in and took possession of my dominions with no one to dispute my will or to try to reason me out of my consait  i am glad to hear you term that notion a conceit for certainly it was not reason you soon discovered your mistake my old messmate and began to think of home  i soon discovered miles that if i had neither father nor mother brother nor sister that i had a country and friends the bit of marble on which i was found in the stonecutters yard then seemed as dear to me as a gold cradle is to a kings son and i thought of you and all the rest of younay i yearned after you as a mother would yearn for her children  poor fellow you were solitary enough i dare sayhad you no amusement with your pigs and poultry  for a day or two they kept me pretty busy but by the end of a week i discovered that pigs and poultry were not made to keep company with man i had consaited that i could pass the rest of my days in the bosom of my own family like any other man who had made his fortune and retired but i found my household too small for such a life as that my great mistake was in supposing that the marble family could be happy in its own circle  this was said bitterly though it was said drolly and while it made  talcott and myself laugh it also made us sorry  i fell into another mistake however boys marble continued and it might as well be owned i took it into my head that i should be all alone on the island but i found to my cost that the devil insisted on having his share ill tell you how it is miles a man must either look ahead or look astarn there is no such thing as satisfying himself with the present moorings now this was my misfortune for ahead i had nothing to look forward to and astarn what comfort had i in overhauling past sins  i think i can understand your difficulties my friend how did you manage to get rid of them  i left the island you had put the frenchmans launch in capital condition and all i had to do was to fill up the breakers with fresh water kill a hog and salt him away put on board a quantity of biscuit and be off as for eatables you know there was no scarcity on the island and i took my choice i make no doubt there are twenty hogsheads of undamaged sugars at this very moment in the hold of that wreck and on the beach of the island i fed my poultry on it the whole time i staid  and so you abandoned marble land to the pigs and the fowls  i did indeed miles and i hope the poor creaturs will have a comfortable time of it i gave em what the lawyers call a quitclaim and sailed two months to a day after you went off in the crisis  i should think old shipmate that your voyage must have been as solitary and desperate as your life ashore  im amazed to hear you say that im never solitary at sea one has so much to do in taking care of his craft and then he can always look forward to the day hell get in  but this generalizing night and day without any port ahead and little comfort in looking astarn will soon fit a man for bedlam i just weathered cape crazy i can tell you lads and that too in the white water as for my vyge being desperate what was there to make it so i should like to know  you must have been twelve or fifteen hundred miles from any island where you could look forward to anything like safety and that is a distance one would rather not travel all alone on the high seas  pshaw all consait youre getting notional miles now youre a master and owner whats a run of a thousand or fifteen hundred miles in a tight boat and with plenty of grub and water it was the easiest matter in the world and if it warnt for that bloody cape horn i should have made as straight a wake for coenties slip as the trending of the land would have allowed as it was i turned to windward for i knew the savages to leeward werent to be trusted you see it was as easy as working out a days work i kept the boat on a wind all day and long bits of the night too until i wanted sleep and then i hove her to under a reefed mainsail and slept as sound as a lord i hadnt an uncomfortable moment after i got outside of the reef again and the happiest hour of my life was that in which i saw the treetops of the island dip  and how long were you navigating in this manner and what land did you first make  seven weeks though i made half a dozen islands every one of them just such a looking object as that i had left  you werent about to catch me ashore again in any of them miserable places i gave the old boat a slap and promised to stick by her as long as she would stick by me and i kept my word i saw savages moreover on one or two of the islands and gave them a berth having no fancy for being barbacued  and where did you finally make your landfall  nowhere so far as the launch was concerned i fell in with a manilla ship bound to valparaiso and got on board her and sorry enough was i for the change when i came to find out how they lived the captain took me in however and i worked my passage into port finding no ship likely to sail soon i entered with a native who was about to cross the andes bound over on this side for the east coast  dont you remember miles monsters of mountains that we could see a bit inland and covered with snow all along the west side of south america you must remember the chaps i mean  certainlythey are much too plain and objects much too striking ever to be forgotten when once seen  well thems the andes and rough customers they be let me tell you boys you know there is little amusement in a sailors walking on the levellest arth and handsomest highways on account of the bloody ups and downs a fellow meets with and so you may get some idee of the time we had of it when i tell you had all the seas we saw in the last blow been piled on top of each other they would have made but a large pancake compared to them ere andes  natur must have outdone herself in making em and when they were thrown together what good comes of it all such mountains might be of some use in keeping the french and english apart but you leave nothing but bloody spaniards on one side of them andes and find bloody spaniards and portugeese on the other however we found our way over them and brought up at a place called buenos ayres from which i worked my passage round to rio in a coaster at rio you know i felt quite at home having stopped in there often in going backward and forward  and thence you took passage in the dundee for london intending to get a passage home by the first opportunity  it needs no witch to tell that i had to scull about rio for several months doing odd jobs as a rigger and the like of that until finding no yankee came in i got a passage in a scotchman ill not complain of sawney who was kind enough to me as a shipwrecked mariner for that was the character i sailed under hermits being no way fashionable among us protestants though its very different among them catholic chaps i can tell you i happened to mention to a landlady on the road that i was a sort of a hermit on his travels when i thought the poor woman would have gone down on her knees and worshipped me  here then was the history of moses marble and the end of the colony of marble land pigs and poultry excepted  it was now my turn to be examined i had to answer fifty curious inquiries some of which i found sufficiently embarrassing  when in answer to his interrogatories marble learned that the major and miss merton had actually been left at clawbonny i saw the exmate wink at talcott who smiled in reply then where was rupert and how came on the law the farm and mills were not forgotten and as for neb he was actually ordered up into the top in order that there might be another shake of the hand and that he might answer for himself in a word nothing could be more apparent than the delight of marble at finding himself among us once more i believed even then that the man really loved me and the reader will remember how long we had sailed together and how much we had seen in company  more than once did my old shipmate dash the tears from his eyes as he spoke of his satisfaction  i say milesi say roger he criedthis is like being at home and none of your bloody hermitages blast me if i think now i should dare pass through a wood all alone im never satisfied unless i see a fellowcreatur for fear of being left i did pretty well with the scotchman who has a heart though its stowed away in oatmeal but this is home i must ship as your steward miles for hang on to you i will  if we ever part again until one or both go into dock it will be your fault my old friend if i have thought of you once since we parted i have dreamed of you fifty times talcott and i were talking of you in the late gale and wondering what sail you would advise us to put the ship under  the old lessons have not all been forgotten boys it was easy enough to see that i said to myself as you stood down upon us that chap has a real seadog aboard as is plain by the manner in which he has everything snug while he walks ahead like an owner in a hurry to be first in the market  it was then agreed marble should keep a watch whenever it suited him and that he should do just as he pleased aboard at some future day some other arrangement might be made though he declared his intention to stick by the ship and also announced a determination to be my firstmate for life as soon as talcott got a vessel as doubtless he would through the influence of his friends as soon as he returned home i laughed at all this though i bade him heartily welcome and then i nicknamed him commodore adding that he should sail with me in that capacity doing just as much and just as little duty as he pleased as for money there was a bag of dollars in the cabin and he had only to put his hand in and take what he wanted the key of the locker was in my pocket and could be had for asking nobody was more delighted with this arrangement than neb who had even taken a fancy to marble from the moment when the latter led him up from the steerage of the john by the ear  i say miles what sort of bloody animals are them passengers of yours marble next demanded looking over the rim of the top down at the trio on deck with a good deal of curiosity expressed in his countenance this is the first time i ever knew a shipmaster driven aloft by his passengers in order to talk secrets  that is because you never sailed with the brigham family my friend theyll pump you till you suck in the first twentyfour hours rely on it theyll get every fact about your birth the island where you first saw me what you have been about and what you mean to do in a word the past present and future  leave me to overlay their curosity answered the exmate or new commodorei got my hand in by boarding six weeks with a connecticut old maid once and ill defy the keenest questioner of them all  we had a little more discourse when we all went below and i introduced marble to my passengers as one who was to join our mess after this things went on in their usual train in the course of the day however i overheard the following brief dialogue between brigham and marble the ladies being much too delicate to question so rough a mariner  you came on board us somewhat unexpectedly i rather conclude captain marble commenced the gentleman  not in the least i have been expecting to meet the dawn just about this spot more than a month now  well that is odd i do not comprehend how such a thing could well be foreseen  do you understand spherical trigonometry sir  i cannot say i am at all expertive looked into mathematics but have no great turn for the study  it would be hopeless then to attempt to explain the matter if you had your hand in at the spherical i could make it all as plain as the capstan  you and captain wallingford must be somewhat old acquaintances i conclude  somewhat answered marble very drily  have you ever been at the place that he calls clawbonny  a queer name i rather think captain  not at all sir i know a place down in the eastern states that was called scratch and claw and a very pretty spot it was  its not usual for us to the eastward to give names to farms and places it is done a little by the boston folk but they are notional as everybody knows  exactly i suppose it was for want of use the chap i mean made out no better in naming his place  mr brigham was no fool he was merely a gossip he took the hint and asked no more questions of marble he tried neb notwithstanding but the black having his orders obeyed them so literally that i really believe we parted in bordeaux a fortnight later without any of the familys making the least discovery glad enough was i to get rid of them yet brief as had been our intercourse they produced a sensible influence on my future happiness such is the evil of this habit of loose talking men giving credit to words conceived in ignorance and uttered in the indulgence of one of the most contemptible of all our propensities to return to my ship  we reached bordeaux without any further accident or delay i discharged in the usual way and began to look about me for another freight it had been my intention to return to new york and to keep the festivities of attaining my majority at clawbonny but i confess the discourse of these eternal gossips the brighams had greatly lessened the desire to see home again so soon a freight for new york was offered me but i postponed an answer until it was given to another ship at length an offer was made me to go to cronstadt in russia with a cargo of wines and brandies and i accepted it the great and better informed merchants as it would seem distrusted the continuance of the hollow peace that then existed and a company of them thought it might be well to transfer their liquors to the capital of the czar in readiness for contingencies an american ship was preferred on account of her greater speed as well as on account of her probable neutral character in the event of troubles occurring at any unlookedfor moment  the dawn took in her wines and brandies accordingly and sailed for the baltic about the last of august she had a long but a safe passage delivering the freight according to the charterparty in good condition while at cronstadt the american consul and the consignees of an american ship that had lost her master and chiefmate by the smallpox applied to me to let marble carry the vessel home i pressed the offer on my old friend but he obstinately refused to have anything to do with the vessel i then recommended talcott and after some negotiation the latter took charge of the hyperion i was sorry to part with my mate to whom i had become strongly attached but the preferment was so clearly to his advantage that i could take no other course the vessel being ready she sailed the day after talcott joined her and sorry am i to be compelled to add that she was never heard of after clearing the cattegat  the equinox of that season was tremendously severe and it caused the loss of many vessels that of the hyperion doubtless among the rest  marble insisted on taking talcotts place and he now became my chiefmate as i had once been his after a little delay i took in freight on russian government account and sailed for odessa it was thought the sublime porte would let an american through but after reaching the dardanelles i was ordered back and was obliged to leave my cargo in malta which it was expected would be in possession of its own knights by that time agreeably to the terms of the late treaty from malta i sailed for leghorn in quest of another freight i pass over the details of these voyages as really nothing worthy of being recorded occurred  they consumed a good deal of time the delay at the dardanelles alone exceeding six weeks during which negotiations were going on up at constantinople but all in vain in consequence of all these detentions and the length of the passages i did not reach leghorn until near the close of march i wrote to grace and mr hardinge whenever a favourable occasion offered but i did not get a letter from home during the whole period it was not in the power of my sister or guardianlate guardian would be the most accurate expression as i had been of age since the previous octoberto write it being impossible for me to let them know when or where a letter would find me it followed that while my friends at home were kept tolerably apprised of my movements i was absolutely in the dark as respected them that this ignorance gave me great concern it would be idle to deny yet i had a species of desperate satisfaction in keeping aloof and in leaving the course clear to mr andrew drewett as respects substantials i had sent a proper power of attorney to mr hardinge who i doubted not would take the same care of my temporal interests he had never ceased to do since the day of my beloved mothers death  freights were not offering freely at leghorn when the dawn arrived after waiting a fortnight however i began to take in for america and on american account in the meantime the cargo coming to hand slowly i left marble to receive it and proceeded on a little excursion in tuscany or etruria as that part of the world was then called i visited pisa lucca florence and several other intermediate towns at florence i passed a week looking at sights and amusing myself the best way i could the gallery and the churches kept me pretty busy and the reader will judge of my surprise one day at hearing my own name uttered on a pretty high key by a female voice in the duomo or cathedral of the place on turning i found myself in the presence of the brighams i was overwhelmed with questions in a minute where had i been where was talcott where was the ship when did i sail and whither did i sail after this came the communications they had been to paris had seen the french consul and had dined with mr r n livingston then negotiating the treaty of louisiana had seen the louvre had been to geneva had seen the lake had seen mont blanc had crossed mont cenis had been at milan rome had seen the pope naples had seen vesuvius had been at paestum had come back to florence and nous voici glad enough was i when i got them fairly within the gates of the city of the lily next came america from which part of the world they received such delightful letters one from mrs jonathan little a salem lady then residing in new york had just reached them it contained four sheets and was full of news then commenced the details and i was compelled to listen to a string of gossip that connected nearly all the people of mark my informants had ever heard of in the great commercial emporium that was to be how suitable is this name emporium would not have been sufficiently distinctive for a town in which the merchants are all in all in which they must have the postoffice in which they support the nation by paying all the revenue in which the sun must shine and the dew fall to suit their wants and in which the winds themselves may be recreant to their duty when they happen to be foul like the holy catholic protestant episcopal church trading commercial trafficking emporium should have been the style of such a place and i hope ere long some of the manor born genii of that great town will see the matter rectified  by the way captain wallingford cut in jane at one of sarahs breathing intervals that reminded me strongly of the colloquial frenchmans sil crache il est perdu you know something of poor mrs bradfort i believe  i assented by a bow  it was just as we told you cried sarah taking her revenge  the poor woman is dead and no doubt of that cancer what a frightful disease and how accurate has our information been in all that affair  i think her will the most extraordinary of all added mr brigham who as a man kept an eye more to the main chance i suppose you have heard all about her will captain wallingford  i reminded the gentleman that this was the first i had ever heard of the ladys death  she has left every dollar to young mr hardinge her cousins son added jane cutting off that handsome genteel young lady his sister as well as her father without a centin 1803 they just began to speak of cents instead of farthingsand everybody says it was so cruel  that is not the worst of it put in sarah they do say miss merton the english lady that made so much noise in new yorklet me see mr brigham what earls granddaughter did we hear she was  this was a most injudicious question as it gave the husband an opportunity to take the word out of her mouth  lord cumberlands i believe or some such personbut no matter whose it is quite certain general merton her father consents to let her marry young mr hardinge now mrs bradforts will is known and as for the sister he declares he will never give her a dollar  he will have sixteen thousand dollars a year said jane with emphasis  six my dear sixreturned the brother who had reasonably accurate notions touching dollars and cents or he never would have been travelling in italy six thousand dollars a year was just mrs bradforts income as my old schoolfellow upham told me and there isnt another man in york who can tell fortunes as true as himself he makes a business of it and dont fail one time in twenty  and is it quite certain that mr rupert hardinge gets all the fortune of mrs bradfort i asked with a strong effort to seem composed  not the least doubt of it in the world everybody is talking about it and there cannot well be a mistake you know as it was thought the sister would be an heiress and people generally take care to be pretty certain about that class but of course a young man with that fortune will be snapped up as a swallow catches a fly ive bet sarah a pair of gloves we hear of his marriage in three months  the brighams talked an hour longer and made me promise to visit them at their hotel a place i could not succeed in finding that evening i left florence for leghorn writing a note of apology in order not to be rude of course i did not believe half these people had told me but a part i made no doubt was true mrs bradfort was dead out of all question and i thought it possible she might not so far have learned to distinguish between the merit of lucy and that of rupert to leave her entire fortune to the last as for the declaration of the brother that he would give his sister nothing that seemed to me to be rather strong for even rupert i knew the dear girl too well and was certain she would not repine and i was burning with the desire to be in the field now she was again penniless  what a change was this here were the hardinges those whom i had known as poor almost as dependants on my own family suddenly enriched i knew mrs bradfort had a large six thousand a year besides her own dwellinghouse which stood in wall street a part of the commercial emporium that was just beginning to be the focus of banking and all other monied operations and which even then promised to become a fortune of itself it is true that old daniel mcormick still held his levees on his venerable stoop where all the heavy men in town used to congregate and joke and buy and sell and abuse boney and that the winthrops the wilkeses the jaunceys the verplancks the whites the ludlows and other families of mark then had their town residences in this wellknown street but coming events were beginning to cast their shadows before and it was easy to foresee that this single dwelling might at least double ruperts income under the rapid increase of the country and the town though lucy was still poor rupert was now rich  if family connection that allimportant and magical influence could make so broad a distinction between us while i was comparatively wealthy and lucy had nothing what to regard the worst side of the picture might i not expect from it when the golden scale preponderated on her side that andrew drewett would still marry her i began to fear again well why not i had never mentioned love to the sweet girl fondly ardently as i was attached to her and what reason had i for supposing that one in her situation could reserve her affections for a truant sailor i am afraid i was unjust enough to regret that this piece of good fortune should have befallen rupert he must do something for his sister and every dollar seemed to raise a new barrier between us  from that hour i was all impatience to get home had not the freight been engaged i think i should have sailed in ballast by urging the merchants however we got to sea may 15th with a full cargo a portion of which i had purchased on my own account with the money earned by the ship within the last ten months nothing occurred worthy of notice until the dawn neared the straits of gibraltar here we were boarded by an english frigate and first learned the declaration of a new war between france and england a contest that in the end involved in it all the rest of christendom hostilities had already commenced the first consul having thrown aside the mask just three days after we left port the frigate treated us well it being too soon for the abuses that followed and we got through the pass without further molestation   as soon as in the atlantic i took care to avoid everything we saw and nothing got near us until we had actually made the highlands of navesink an english sloopofwar however had stood into the angles of the coast formed by long island and the jersey shore giving us a race for the hook i did not know whether i ought to be afraid of this cruiser or not but my mind was made up not to be boarded if it could be helped we succeeded in passing ahead and entered the hook while he was still a mile outside of the bar i got a pilot on the bar as was then very usual and stood up towards the town with studdingsails set it being just a twelvemoth almost to an hour from the day when i passed up the bay in the crisis the pilot took the ship in near coenties slip marbles favourite berth and we had her secured and her sails unbent before the sun set    chapter xxvii    with look like patient jobs eschewing evil   with motions graceful as a birds in air   thou art in sober truth the veriest devil   that ere clinched fingers in a captives hair   halleck   there was about an hour of daylight when i left the comptinghouse of the consignees and pursued my way up wall street to broadway i was on my way to the city hotel then as now one of the best inns of the town on trinity church walk just as i quitted the wall street crossing whom should i come plump upon in turning but rupert hardinge he was walking down the street in some little haste and was evidently much surprised perhaps i might say startled at seeing me nevertheless rupert was not easily disconcerted and his manner at once became warm if not entirely free from embarrassment he was in deep mourning though otherwise dressed in the height of the fashion  wallingford he exclaimedit was the first time he did not call me mileswallingford my fine fellow what cloud did you drop fromwe have had so many reports concerning you that your appearance is as much a matter of surprise as would be that of bonaparte himself  of course your ship is in  of course i answered taking his offered hand you know i am wedded to her for better for worse until death or shipwreck doth us part  ay so ive always told the ladiesthere is no other matrimony in wallingford ive said often than that which will make him a ships husband but you look confoundedly wellthe sea agrees with you famously  i make no complaint of my healthbut tell me of that of our friends and families your father  is up at clawbonny just nowyou know how it is with him no change of circumstances will ever make him regard his little smokehouse looking church as anything but a cathedral and his parish as a diocese since the great change in our circumstances all this is useless and i often thinkyou know one wouldnt like to say as much to himbut i often think he might just as well give up preaching altogether  well this is good so farnow for the rest of you all  you meet my impatience too coldly  yes you were always an impatient fellow why i suppose you need hardly be told that i have been admitted to the bar  that i can very well imagineyou must have found your seatraining of great service on the examination  ah my dear wallingfordwhat a simpleton i was  but one is so apt to take up strange conceits in boyhood that he is compelled to look back at them in wonder in after life but which way are you walkingslipping an arm in mineif up ill take a short turn with you theres scarce a soul in town at this season but youll see prodigiously fine girls in broadway at this hour notwithstanding those that belong to the other sets you know those that belong to families that cant get into the country among the leaves yes as i was saying one scarce knows himself after twenty now i can hardly recall a taste or an inclination that i cherished in my teens that has not flown to the winds nothing is permanent in boyhoodwe grow in our persons and our minds sentiments affections views hopes wishes and ambition all take new directions  this is not very flattering rupert to one whose acquaintance with you may be said to be altogether boyish  oh of course i dont mean that habit keeps all right in such matters and i dare say i shall always be as much attached to you as i was in childhood still we are on diverging lines now and cannot for ever remain boys  you have told me nothing of the rest i said half choked in my eagerness to hear of the girls and yet unaccountably afraid to ask i believe i dreaded to hear that lucy was married how and where is grace  oh graceyes i forgot her to my shame as you would naturally wish to inquire why my dear captain to be as frank as one ought with so old an acquaintance your sister is not in a good way im much afraid though ive not seen her in an age she was down among us in the autumn but left town for the holidays for them she insisted on keeping at clawbonny where she said the family had always kept them and away she went since then she has not returned but i fear she is far from well you know what a fragile creature grace ever has beenso americanah wallingford our females have no constitutionscharming as angels delicate as fairies and all that but not to be compared to the english women in constitutions  i felt a torrent of fire rushing through my blood and it was with difficulty i refrained from hurling the heartless scoundrel who leaned on my arm into the ditch a moment of reflection however warned me of the precipice on which i stood he was mr hardinges son lucys brother and i had no proofs that he had ever induced grace to think he loved her it was so easy for those who had been educated as we four had been to be deceived on such a point that i felt it unsafe to do anything precipitately  friendship habit as rupert expressed it might so easily be mistaken for the fruits of passion that one might well be deceived then it was allimportant to graces selfrespect to her feelings in some measure to her character to be careful that i suppressed my wrath though it nearly choked me  i am sorry to hear this i answered after a long pause the deep regret i felt at having such an account of my sisters health contributing to make my manner seem natural very very sorry to hear it grace is one that requires the tenderest care and watching and i have been making passage after passage in pursuit of money when i am afraid i should have been at clawbonny discharging the duties of a brother i can never forgive myself  money is a very good thing captain answered rupert with a smile that appeared to mean more than the tongue expresseda surprisingly good thing is money  but you must not exaggerate graces illness which i dare say is merely constitutional and will lead to nothing i hope your many voyages have produced their fruits  and lucy i resumed disregarding his question concerning my own success as an owner where and how is she  miss hardinge is in townin her ownthat is in our housein wall street though she goes to the place in the morning no one who can likes to remain among these hot bricks that has a pleasant countryhouse to fly to and open to receive him but i forgoti have supposed you to know what it is very likely you have never heard  i learned the death of mrs bradfort while in italy and seeing you in black at once supposed it was for her  yes thats just it an excellent woman has been taken from us and had she been my own mother i could not have received greater kindnesses from her her end my dear wallingford was admitted by all the clergy to be one of the most edifying known in the place for years  and mrs bradfort has left you her heir it is now time to congratulate you on your good fortune as i ununderstand her estate came through females to her and from a common ancestor of hers and yours there is not the slightest reason why you should not be gratified by the bequest but lucyi hope she was not altogether forgotten  rupert fidgeted and i could see that he was on tenterhooks  as i afterwards discovered he wished to conceal the real facts from the world and yet he could not but foresee that i would probably learn them from his father  under all the circumstances therefore he fancied it best to make me a confidant we were strolling between trinity and pauls church walks then the most fashionable promenade in town and before he would lay open his secret my companion led me over by the oswego market and down maiden lane lest he might betray himself to the more fashionable stocks and stones he did not open his lips until clear of the market when he laid bare his budget of griefs in something that more resembled his old confidential manner than he had seen fit to exhibit in the earlier part of our interview  you must know miles he commenced that mrs  bradfort was a very peculiar womana very peculiar sort of a person indeed an excellent lady i am ready to allow and one that made a remarkably edifying and but one whose peculiarities i have understood she inherited with her fortune women do get the oddest conceits into their heads you know and american women before all others a republic being anything but favourable to the continuation of property in the same line miss merton who is a girl of excellent sense as you well know yourself miles says now in england i should have succeeded quite as a matter of course to all mrs bradforts real estate  you as a lawyera common law lawyercan scarcely require the opinion of an englishwoman to tell you what the english laws would do in a question of descent  oh theyve a plaguey sight of statutes in that country as well as ourselves between the two the common law is getting to be a very uncommon sort of a law but to cut the matter short mrs bradfort made a will  dividing her property equally between you and lucy i dare say to miss mertons great dissatisfaction  why not just so milesnot exactly so a very capricious peculiar woman was mrs bradfort  i have often remarked when a person has succeeded in throwing dust into anothers eyes but is discarded on being found out that the rejected of principle is very apt to accuse his former dupe of being capricious when in fact he has only been deceived as i said nothing however leaving rupert to flounder on in the best manner he could the latter after a pause proceeded  but her end was very admirable he said and to the last degree edifying you must know she made a will and in that will she left everything even to the town and country houses tomy sister  i was thunderstruck here were all my hopes blown again to the winds after a long pause i resumed the discourse  and whom did she leave as executor i asked instantly foreseeing the consequences should that office be devolved on rupert himself  my father the old gentleman has had his hands full between your father and mother and mrs bradfort fortunately the estate of the last is in a good condition and is easily managed almost entirely in stores and houses in the best part of the town well insured a few thousands in stocks and as much in bonds and mortgages the savings from the income and something like a years rents in bank  a good seven thousand a year with enough surplus to pay for repairs collection and other charges  and all this then is lucys i exclaimed feeling something like the bitterness of knowing that such an heiress was not for me  temporarily though of course i consider lucy as only my trustee for half of it you know how it is with the women they fancy all us young men spendthrifts and so between the two they have reasoned in this wayrupert is a good fellow at bottom but rupert is young and he will make the money flynow ill give it all to you lucy in my will but of course youll take care of your brother and let him have half or perhaps twothirds being a male at the proper time which will be as soon as you come of age and can convey you understand lucy is but nineteen and cannot convey these two years  and lucy admits this to be trueyou have proof of all this  proof id take my own affidavit of it you see it is reasonable and what i had a right to expect everything tends to confirm it between ourselves i had quite 2000 of debt and yet you see the good lady did not leave me a dollar to pay even my honest creditors a circumstance that so pious a woman and one who made so edifying an end would never think of doing without ulterior views  considering lucy as my trustee explains the whole thing  i thought mrs bradfort made you an allowance rupert some 600 a year besides keeping you in her own house  a thousandbut what is 1000 a year to a fashionable man in a town like this first and last the excellent old lady gave me about 5000 all of which confirms the idea that at the bottom she intended me for her heir  what woman in her senses would think of giving 5000 to a relative to whom she did not contemplate giving more  the thing is clear on its face and i should certainly go into chancery with anybody but lucy  and lucywhat says she to your views on the subject of mrs bradforts intentions  why you have some acquaintance with lucyused to be intimate with her as one might say when children and know something of her characterthis to me who fairly worshipped the earth on which the dear girl trodshe never indulges in professions and likes to take people by surprise when she contemplates doing them a service this was just as far from lucys natural and honest mode of dealing as it was possible to beand so she has been as mum as one who has lost the faculty of speech however she never speaks of her affairs to others that is a good sign and indicates an intention to consider herself as my trustee and what is better still and more plainly denotes what her conscience dictates in the premises she has empowered her father to pay all my debts the current income and loose cash being at her disposal at once it would have been better had she given me the money to satisfy these creditors with it for i knew which had waited the longest and were best entitled to receive the dollars at once but its something to have all their receipts in my pocket and to start fair again thank heaven that much is already done to do lucy justice moreover she allows me 1500 a year ad interim now miles ive conversed with you as with an old friend and because i knew my father would tell you the whole when you get up to clawbonny but you will take it all in strict confidence it gives a fashionable young fellow so silly an air to be thought dependent on a sister and she three years younger than himself  so i have hinted the actual state of the case round among my friends but it is generally believed that i am in possession already and that lucy is dependent on me instead of my being dependent on her the idea moreover is capital for keeping off fortunehunters as you will see at a glance  and will the report satisfy a certain mr andrew drewett i asked struggling to assume a composure i was far from feeling he was all attention when i sailed and i almost expected to hear there was no longer a lucy hardinge  to tell you the truth miles i thought so too until the death of mrs bradfort the mourning however most opportunely came to put a stop to anything of the sort were it even contemplated it would be so awkward you will understand to have a brotherinlaw before everything is settled and the trust is accounted for au restei am very well satisfied with andrew and let him know i am his friend he is well connected fashionable has a pretty little fortune and as i sometimes tell lucy that he is intended for her as mrs bradfort no doubt foresaw inasmuch as his estate added to just onethird of that of our dear departed cousin would just make up the present income  on my honour now i do not think the difference would be 500 per annum  and how does your sister receive your hints  oh famouslyjust as all girls do you know she blushes and sometimes she looks vexed then she smiles and puts up her lip and says nonsense and what folly  rupert im surprised at you and all that sort of stuff which deceives nobody youll understand not even her poor simple silly brother but miles i must quit you now for i have an engagement to accompany a party to the theatre and was on my way to join them when we met  cooper plays and you know what a lion he is one would not wish to lose a syllable of his othello  stop rupertone word more before we part from your conversation i gather that the mertons are still here  the mertons why certainly established in the land and among its tiptop people the colonel finds his health benefited by the climate and he has managed to get some appointment which keeps him among us he has boston relatives moreover and i believe is fishing up some claims to property in that quarter the mertons here indeed what would new york be without the mertons  and my old friend the major is promoted tooyou called him colonel i think  did i i believe he is oftener called general merton than anything else you must be mistaken about his being only a major miles everybody here calls him either colonel or general  never mind i hope it is as you say goodbye rupert ill not betray you and  wellyou were about to say  why mention me to lucy you know we were acquainted when children tell her i wish her all happiness in her new position to which i do not doubt she will do full credit and that i shall endeavour to see her before i sail again  youll not be at the theatre this evening cooper is well worth seeinga most famous fellow in othello  i think not do not forget to mention me to your sister and so once more adieu  we partedrupert to go towards broadway at a great pace and i to lounge along uncertain whither to proceed  i had sent neb to inquire if the wallingford were down and understood she would leave the basin at sunrise it was now my intention to go up in her for though i attached no great importance to any of ruperts facts his report concerning my sisters health rendered me exceedingly uneasy insensibly i continued my course down maiden lane and soon found myself near the ship i went on board had an explanation with marble gave some orders to neb and went ashore again all in the course of the next halfhour  by a sort of secret attraction i was led towards the park and soon found myself at the door of the theatre mrs bradfort had now been dead long enough to put lucy in second mourning and i fancied i might get a view of her in the party that rupert was to accompany buying a ticket i entered and made my way up into the shakspeare box  had i been better acquainted with the place with the object in view i should have gone into the pit  notwithstanding the lateness of the season it was a very full house coopers in that day was a name that filled every mouth and he seldom failed to fill every theatre in which he appeared with many firstrate qualifications for his art and a very respectable conception of his characters he threw everything like competition behind him though there were a few as there ever will be among the superlatively intellectual who affected to see excellencies in fennel and others to which this great actor could not aspire the public decided against these select few and as is invariably the case when the appeal is made to human feelings the public decided right puffery will force into notice and sustain a false judgment in such matters for a brief space but nature soon asserts her sway and it is by natural decisions that such points are ever the most justly determined  whatever appeals to human sympathies will be answered by human sympathies popularity too often gains its ascendency behind the hypocrites mask in religion it is usually a magnificent mystification in politics it frequently becomes the patriots stalkinghorse on which he rides to power in social life it is the reward of empty smiles unmeaning bows and hollow squeezes of the hand but with the player the poet and all whose pursuits bring them directly in contact with the passions the imagination and the heart it is the unerring test of merit with certain qualifications connected with the mind and the higher finish of pure art it may be questioned if cooper were not the greatest actor of his day in a certain range of his own characters  i have said that the house was full i got a good place however though it was not in the front row of course i could only see the side boxes beneath and not even quite all of them my eyes ran eagerly over them and i soon caught a glimpse of the fine curling hair of rupert he sat by the side of emily merton the majori knew he was a colonel or general only by means of a regular manhattan promotion which is so apt to make hundreds of counts copper captains and travelling prodigies of those who are very small folk at homethe major sat next and at his side i saw a lady whom i at once supposed to be lucy  every nerve in my system thrilled as i caught even this indistinct view of the dear creature i could just see the upper part of her face as it was occasionally turned towards the major and once i caught that honest smile of hers which i knew had never intentionally deceived  the front seat of the box had two vacant places the bench would hold six while it had yet only four the audience however was still assembling and presently a stir in lucys box denoted the arrival of company the whole party moved and andrew drewett handed an elderly lady in his mother as i afterwards ascertained and took the other place himself i watched the salutations that were exchanged and understood that the new comers had been expected the places had been reserved for them and old mrs drewett was doubtless the chaperone though one having a brother and the other a father with her the two young ladies had not hesitated about preceding the elderly lady they had come from different quarters of the town and had agreed to meet at the theatre old mrs drewett was very particular in shaking hands with lucy though i had not the misery of seeing her son go through the same ceremony still he was sufficiently pointed in his salutations and during the movements i perceived he managed to get next to lucy leaving the major to entertain his mother all this was natural and what might have been expected yet it gave me a pang that i cannot describe  i sat for half an hour perfectly inattentive to the play meditating on the nature of my real position towards lucy  i recalled the days of childhood and early youth the night of my first departure from home my return and the incidents accompanying my second departure the affair of the locket and all i had truly felt myself and all that i had supposed lucy herself to feel on those several occasions could it be possible i had so much deceived myself and that the interest the dear girl had certainly manifested in me had been nothing but the fruits of her naturally warm and honest hearther strong disposition to franknesshabit as rupert had so gently hinted in reference to ourselves then i could not conceal from myself the bitter fact that i was now no equal match for lucy in the eyes of the world  while she was poor and i comparatively rich the inequality in social station might have been overlooked it existed certainly but was not so very marked that it might not even in that day be readily forgotten but now lucy was an heiress had much more than double my own fortunehad a fortune indeed while i was barely in easy circumstances as persons of the higher classes regarded wealth  the whole matter seemed reversed it was clear that a sailor like myself with no peculiar advantages those of a tolerable education excepted and who was necessarily so much absent had not the same chances of preferring his suit as one of your town idlers a nominal lawyer for instance who dropped in at his office for an hour or two just after breakfast and promenaded broadway the rest of the time until dinner or a man of entire leisure like andrew drewett who belonged to the city library set and had no other connection with business than to see that his rents were collected and his dividends paid the more i reflected the more humble i became he less my chances seemed and i determined to quit the theatre at once the reader will remember that i was new york born and bred a state of society in which few natives acted on the principle that there was nothing too high to be aspired to nothing too low to be done i admitted i had superiors and was willing to defer to the facts and opinions of the world as i knew it  in the lobby of the building i experienced a pang at the idea of quitting the place without getting one look at the face of lucy i was in an humble mood it is true but that did not necessarily infer a total selfdenial i determined therefore to pass into the pit with my boxcheck feast my eyes by one long gaze at the dear creatures ingenuous countenance and carry away the impression as a lasting memorial of her whom i so well loved and whom i felt persuaded i should ever continue to love after this indulgence i would studiously avoid her in order to release my thoughts as much as possible from the perfect thraldom in which they had existed ever since i had heard of mrs bradforts death previously to that time i am afraid i had counted a little more than was becoming on the ease of my own circumstances and lucys comparative poverty  not that i had ever supposed her to be in the least mercenarythis i knew to be utterly totally falsebut because the good town of manhattan even in 1803 was tant soit peu addicted to dollars and lucys charms would not be likely to attract so many suitors in the modest setting of a poor country clergymans means as in the golden frame by which they had been surrounded by mrs bradforts testamentary devise even supposing rupert to come in for quite one half  i had no difficulty in finding a convenient place in the pit one from which i got a front and near view of the whole six as they sat ranged side by side of the major and old mrs drewett it is unnecessary to say much the latter looked as all dowagerlike widows of that day used to appear respectable staid and richly attired the good lady had come on the stage during the revolution and had a slightly military aira parade in her graces that was not altogether unknown to the èlèves of that school i dare say she could use such words as martinets mowhairs brigadiers and other terms familiar to her class alas  how completely all these little traces of the past are disappearing from our habits and manners  as for the major he appeared much better in health and altogether altered in mien i could readily detect the influence of the world on him he was evidently a so much greater man in new york than he had been whew i found him in london that it is not wonderful he felt the difference between the acts i remarked that all the principal persons in the front rows were desirous of exchanging nods with the british officer a proof that he was circulating freely in the best set and had reached a point when not to know him argues yourself unknown   footnote  the miserable moral dependence of this country on great britain forty years since cannot well be brought home to the present generation it is still too great but has not a tithe of its former force  the writer has himself known an italian prince a man of family and of high personal merit pass unnoticed before a society that was eager to make the acquaintance of most of the agents of the birmingham button dealers and this simply because one came from italy and the other from england the following anecdote which is quite as true as any other fact in this work furnishes a good example of what is meant it is now a quarter of a century since the writers first book appeared two or three months after the publication he was walking down broadway with a friend when a man of much distinction in the new york circles was passing up on the other sidewalk the gentleman in question caught the writers eye bowed and crossed the street to shake hands and inquire after the authors health the difference in years made this attention marked you are in high favour observed the friend as the two walked away to have  pay you such a complimentyour book must have done this now mark my wordsi have been puffed in some english magazine and  knows it the two were on their way to the authors publishers and on entering the door honest charles wiley put a puff on the book in question into the writers hand  what rendered the whole more striking was the fact that the paragraph was as flagrant a puff as was ever written and had probably been paid for by the english publisher the gentleman in question was a man of talents and merit but he had been born half a century too soon to enjoy entire mental independence in a country that had so recently been a colony  emily certainly looked well and happy i could see that she was delighted with ruperts flattery and i confess i cared very little for his change of sentiment or his success  that both major and emily merton were different persons in the midst of the world and in the solitudes of the pacific was as evident as it was that i was a different personage in command of the crisis and in the pit of the park theatre  i dare say at that moment miss merton had nearly forgotten that such a man as miles wallingford existed though i think she sometimes recalled the string of magnificent pearls that were to ornament the neck of his wife should he ever find any one to have him  but lucy dear upright warmhearted truthtelling beloved lucy all this time i forget to speak of her there she sat in maiden loveliness her beauty still more developed her eye as beaming lustrous feeling as ever her blush as sensitive her smile as sweet and her movements as natural and graceful the simplicity of her halfmourning too added to her beauty which was of a character to require no further aid from dress than such as was dependent purely on taste as i gazed at her enthralled i fancied nothing was wanting to complete the appearance but my own necklace powerful robust man as i was with my frame hardened by exposure and trials i could have sat down and wept after gazing some time at the precious creature under the feeling produced by the conviction that i was never to renew my intercourse with her on terms of intimacy at least the thought that from day to day we were to become more and more strangers was almost too much to be borne as it was scalding tears forced themselves to my eyes though i succeeded in concealing the weakness from those around me  at length the tragedy terminated the curtain dropped and the audience began to move about the pit which had just before been crowded was now nearly empty and i was afraid of being seen still i could not tear myself away but remained after ninetenths of those around me had gone into the lobbies  it was easy now to see the change which had come over lucys position in the attentions she received all the ladies in the principal boxes had nods and smiles for her and half the fashionablelooking young men in the house crowded round her box or actually entered it to pay their compliments i fancied andrew drewett had a selfsatisfied air that seemed to say you are paying your homage indirectly to myself in paying it to this young lady as for lucy my jealous watchfulness could not detect the smallest alteration in her deportment so far as simplicity and nature were concerned she appeared in a trifling degree more womanly perhaps than when i saw her last being now in her twentieth year but the attentions she received made no visible change in her manners i had become lost in the scene and was standing in a musing attitude my side face towards the box when i heard a suppressed exclamation in lucys voice i was too near her to be mistaken and it caused the blood to rush to my heart in a torrent turning i saw the dear girl with her hand extended over the front of the box her face suffused with blushes and her eyes riveted on myself i was recognised and the surprise had produced a display of all that old friendship certainly that had once existed between us in the simplicity and truth of childhood  miles wallingford she said as i advanced to shake the offered hand and as soon as i was near enough to permit her to speak without attracting too much attentionyou arrived and we knew nothing of it  it was plain rupert had said nothing of having seen me or of our interview in the street he seemed a little ashamed and leaned forward to say  i declare i forgot to mention lucy that i met captain wallingford as i was going to join the colonel and miss merton  oh we have had a long talk together and it will save you a history of past events  i may nevertheless say i rejoined how happy i am to see miss hardinge looking so well and to be able to pay my compliments to my old passengers  of course i shook hands with the major and emily bowed to drewett was named to his mother and was invited to enter the box as it was not quite in rule to be conversing between the pit and the front rows i forgot my prudent resolutions and was behind lucy in three minutes andrew drewett had the civility to offer me his place though it was with an air that said plain enough what do i care for himhe is a shipmaster and i am a man of fashion and fortune and can resume my seat at any moment while the poor fellow can only catch his chances as he occasionally comes into port at least i fancied his manner said something like this  thank you mr drewett said lucy in her sweetest manner mr wallingford and i are very very old friendsyou know he is graces brother and you have been at clawbonnydrewett bowed civilly enoughand i have a thousand things to say to him so miles take this seat and let me hear all about your voyage  as half the audience went away as soon as the tragedy ended the second seat of the box was vacated and the other gentlemen getting on it to stretch their limbs i had abundance of room to sit at lucys side half facing her at the same time as she insisted on hearing my story before we proceeded to anything else i was obliged to gratify her  by the way major merton i cried as the tale was closed an old friend of yours moses marble by name has come to life again and is at this moment in new york  i then related the manner in which i had fallen in with my old mate this was a most unfortunate selfinterruption for me giving the major a fair opportunity for cutting into the conversation the orchestra moreover giving notice that the curtain would soon rise for the afterpiece the old gentleman soon got me into the lobby to hear the particulars  i was supremely vexed and i thought lucy appeared sorry but there was no help for it and then we could not converse while the piece was going on  i suppose you care little for this silly farce observed the major looking in at one of the windows after i had gone over marbles affair in detail if not we will continue our walk and wait for the ladies to come out drewett and hardinge will take good care of them  i assented and we continued to walk the lobby till the end of the act major merton was always gentlemanlike and he even behaved to me as if he remembered the many obligations he was under he now communicated several little facts connected with his own circumstances alluding to the probability of his remaining in america a few years  our chat continued some time my looks frequently turning towards the door of the box when my companion suddenly observed  your old acquaintances the hardinges have had a lucky windfallone i fancy they hardly expected a few years since  probably not though the estate has fallen into excellent hands i answered i am surprised however that mrs bradfort did not leave the property to the old gentleman as it once belonged to their common grandfather and he properly stood next in succession  i fancy she thought the good parson would not know what to do with it now rupert hardinge is clever and spirited and in a way to make a figure in the world and it is probably in better hands than if it had been left first to the old gentleman  the old gentleman has been a faithful steward to me and i doubt not would have proved equally so to his own children but does rupert get all mrs bradforts property  i believe not there is some sort of a trust i have heard him say and i rather fancy that his sister has some direct or reversionary interest perhaps she is named as the heir if he die without issue there was a silly story that mrs bradfort had left everything to lucy but i have it from the best authority that that is not true the idea of rupert hardinges being the best authority for any thing a fellow who never knew what unadulterated truth was from the time he was in petticoats or could talkas i know there is a trust though one of no great moment i presume lucy has some contingent interest subject most probably to her marrying with her brothers approbation or some such provision the old lady was sagacious and no doubt did all that was necessary  it is wonderful how people daily deceive themselves on the subject of property those who care the most about it appearing to make the greatest blunders in the way of bequests in particular the lies that are told are marvellous  it is now many years since i learned to take no heed of rumours on such subjects and least of all rumours that come from the class of the moneygripers such people refer everything to dollars and seldom converse a minute without using the word here however was major merton evidently ruperts dupe though with what probable consequences it was not in my power to foresee it was clearly not my business to undeceive him and the conversation getting to be embarrassing i was not sorry to hear the movement which announced the end of the act at the box door to my great regret we met mrs drewett retiring the ladies finding the farce dull and not worth the time lost in listening to it rupert gave me an uneasy glance and he even dragged me aside to whispermiles what i told you this evening is strictly a family secret and was entrusted to a friend  i have nothing to do with your private concerns rupert i answeredonly let me expect you to act honourably especially when women are concerned  everything will come right depend on it the truth will set everything right and all will come out just as i predicted  i saw lucy looking anxiously around while drewett had gone to order the carriages to advance and i hoped it might be for me in a moment i was by her side at the next mr  andrew drewett offered his arm saying her carriage stopped the way we moved into the outer lobby in a body and then it was found that mrs drewetts carriage was up first while lucys was in the rear yes lucys carriagethe dear girl having come into immediate possession of her relatives houses furniture horses carriages and everything else without reserve just as they had been left behind by the last incumbent when she departed from the scene of life to lie down in the grave mrs bradforts arms were still on the chariot i observed its owner refusing all ruperts solicitations to supplant them by those of hardinge the latter took his revenge however by telling everybody how generous he was in keeping a carriage for his sister  the major handed mrs drewett in and her son was compelled to say good night to see his mother home this gave me one blessed minute with lucy by herself she spoke of grace said they had now been separated months longer than they ever had been before in their lives and that all her own persuasions could not induce my sister to rejoin her in town while her own wish to visit clawbonny had been constantly disappointed rupert insisting that her presence was necessary for so many arrangements about business  grace is not as humble as i was in old times miles said the dear girl looking me in the face half sadly half reproachfully the light of the lamp falling full on her tearful tender eyes and i hope you are not about to imitate her bad example she wishes us to know she has clawbonny for a home but i never hesitated to admit how poor we were while you alone were rich   god bless you lucy i whispered squeezing her hand with fervourit cannot be thathave you heard anything of graces health  oh she is well i knowrupert tells me that and her letters are cheerful and kind as ever without a word of complaint but i must see her soon grace wallingford and lucy hardinge were not born to live asunder here is the carriage i shall see you in the morning milesat breakfast sayeight oclock precisely  it will be impossiblei sail for clawbonny with the first of the flood and that will make at four i shall sleep in the sloop  major merton put lucy into the carriage the goodnights were passed and i was left standing on the lowest step of the building gazing after the carriage rupert walking swiftly away    chapter xxviii    hear me a little   for i have only been silent so long   and given way unto this course of fortune   by noting of the lady i have markd   a thousand blushing apparitions start   into her face a thousand innocent shames   in angel whiteness bear away those blushes   shakespeare   i reached the wallingford before eleven where i found neb in attendance with my trunks and other effects being now on board my own craft i gave orders to profit by a favourable turn in the wind and to get underway at once instead of waiting for the flood when i left the deck the sloop was above the state prison a point towards which the town itself had made considerable progress since the time i first introduced it to the reader notwithstanding this early start we did not enter the creek until about eight in the morning of the second day  no sooner was the vessel near enough than my foot was on the wharf and i began to ascend the hill from the summit of the latter i saw my late guardian hurrying along the road it afterwards appearing that a stray paper from town had announced the arrival of the dawn and that i was expected to come up in the sloop i was received with extended hands was kissed just as if i had still been a boy and heard the guileless old man murmuring his blessings on me and a prayer of thankfulness nothing ever changed good mr hardinge who now that he could command the whole income of his daughter was just as well satisfied to live on the three or four hundreds he got from his glebe and his parish as he ever had been in his life  welcome back my dear boy welcome back added mr hardinge his voice and manner still retaining their fervour  i said you mustyou would be on board as soon as they reported the sloop in sight for i judged your heart by my own ah miles will the time ever come when clawbonny will be good enough for you you have already as much money as you can want and more will scarce contribute to your happiness  speaking of money my dear sir i answered while i have to regret the loss of your respectable kinswoman i may be permitted to congratulate you on the accession to an old family propertyi understand you inherit in your family all of mrs bradforts estateone valuable in amount and highly acceptable no doubt as having belonged to your ancestors  no doubtno doubtit is just as you say and i hope these unexpected riches will leave us all as devout servants of god as i humbly trust they found us the property however is not mine but lucys i need not have any reserve with you though rupert has hinted it might be prudent not to let the precise state of the case be known since it might bring a swarm of interested fortunehunters about the dear girl and has proposed that we rather favour the notion the estate is to be divided among us this i cannot do directly you will perceive as it would be deception but one may be silent with you however it is a different matter and so i tell you the truth at once i am made executor and act of course and this makes me the more glad to see you for i find so much business with pounds shillings and pence draws my mind off from the duties of my holy office and that i am in danger of becoming selfish and mercenary a selfish priest miles is as odious a thing as a mercenary woman  little danger of your ever becoming anything so worldly my dear sir but graceyou have not mentioned my beloved sister  i saw mr hardinges countenance suddenly change the expression of joy instantly deserted it and it wore an air of uncertainty and sadness a less observant man than the good divine in all the ordinary concerns of life did not exist but it was apparent that he now saw something to trouble him  yes grace he answered doubtingly the dear girl is here and all alone and not as blithe and amusing as formerly  i am glad of your return on her account too miles  she is not well i fear i would have sent for a physician last week or the moment i saw her but she insists on it there is no need of one she is frightfully beautiful miles  you know how it is with graceher countenance always seemed more fitted for heaven than earth and now it always reminds me of a seraphs that was grieving over the sins of men  i fear sir that ruperts account then is true and that grace is seriously ill  i hope not boyi fervently pray not she is not as usualthat is true but her mind her thoughts all her inclinations and if i may so express it her energies seem turned to heaven there has been an awakening in the spirit of grace that is truly wonderful she reads devout books meditates and i make no doubt prays from morn till night this is the secret of her withdrawal from the world and her refusing of all lucys invitations you know how the girls love each otherbut grace declines going to lucy though she knows that lucy cannot come to her  i now understood it all a weight like that of a mountain fell upon my heart and i walked on some distance without speaking to me the words of my excellent guardian sounded like the knell of a sister i almost worshipped  and gracedoes she expect me now i at length ventured to say though the words were uttered in tones so tremulous that even the usually unobservant divine perceived the change  she does and delighted she was to hear it the only thing of a worldly nature that i have heard her express of late was some anxious sisterly wish for your speedy return grace loves you miles next to her god  oh how i wished this were true but alas alas i knew it was far otherwise  i see you are disturbed my dear boy on account of what i have said resumed mr hardinge probably from serious apprehensions about your sisters health she is not well i allow but it is the effect of mental ailments  the precious creature has had too vivid views of her own sinful nature and has suffered deeply i fear i trust my conversation and prayers have not been without their effect through the divine aid and that she is now more cheerfulnay she has assured me within half an hour if it turned out that you were in the sloop she should be happy  for my life i could not have conversed longer on the painful subject i made no reply as we had still a considerable distance to walk i was glad to turn the conversation to other subjects lest i should become unmanned and sit down to weep in the middle of the road  does lucy intend to visit clawbonny this summer  i asked though it seemed strange to me to suppose that the farm was not actually lucys home i am afraid i felt a jealous dislike to the idea that the dear creature should have houses and lands of her own or any that was not to be derived through me  i hope so answered her father though her new duties do not leave lucy as much her own mistress as i could wish you saw her and her brother miles i take it for granted  i met rupert in the street sir and had a short interview with the mertons and lucy at the theatre young mr and old mrs drewett were of the party  the good divine turned short round to me and looked as conscious and knowing as one of his singleness of mind and simplicity of habits could look had a knife penetrated my flesh i could not have winced more than i did still i affected a manner that was very foreign to my feelings  what do you think of this young mr drewett boy  asked mr hardinge with an air of confidential interest and an earnestness of manner that with him was inseparable from all that concerned his daughter do you approve  i believe i understand you siryou mean me to infer that mr drewett is a suitor for miss hardinges hand  it would be improper to say this much even to you miles did not drewett take good care himself to let everybody know it  possibly with a view to keep off other pretendersi rejoined with a bitterness i could not control  now mr hardinge was one of the last men in the world to suspect evil he looked surprised therefore at my remark and i was probably not much out of the way in fancying that he looked displeased  that is not right my dear boy he said gravely  we should try to think the best and not the worst of our fellowcreaturesexcellent old man how faithfully didst thou practise on thy preceptit is a wise rule and a safe one more particularly in connection with our own weaknesses then it is but natural that drewett should wish to secure lucy and if he adopt no means less manly than the frank avowal of his own attachment surely there is no ground of complaint  i was rebuked and what is more i felt that the rebuke was merited as some atonement for my error i hastened to add  very truly sir i admit the unfairness of my remark and can only atone for it by adding it is quite apparent mr  drewett is not influenced by interested motives since he certainly was attentive to miss hardinge previously to mrs  bradforts death and when he could not possibly have anticipated the nature of her will  quite true miles and very properly and justly remarked  now to you who have known lucy from childhood and who regard her much as rupert does it may not seem so very natural that a young man can love her warmly and strongly for herself alonesuch is apt to be the effect of brotherly feeling but i can assure you lucy is really a charming as we all know she is a most excellent girl  to whom are you speaking thus sir i can assure you nothing is easier than for me to conceive how possible it is for any man to love your daughter as respects grace i confess there is a differencefor i affirm she has always seemed to me too saintly too much allied to heaven already to be subject herself to the passions of earth  that is what i have just been telling you and we must endeavour to overcome and humanizeif i may so express itgraces propensity there is nothing more dangerous to a healthful frame of mind in a religious point of view miles than excitementit is disease and not faith nor charity nor hope nor humility nor anything that is commanded but our native weaknesses taking a wrong direction under a physical impulse rather than the fruits of repentance and the succour afforded by the spirit of god  we nowhere read of any excitement and howlings and waitings among the apostles  how could i enlighten the good old man on the subject of my sisters malady that grace with her welltempered mind was the victim of religious exaggeration i did not for a moment believe but that she had had her heart blighted her affections withered her hopes deceived by ruperts levity and interestedness his worldlymindedness and vanity i could foresee and was prepared to learn though these were facts not to be communicated to the father of the offender  i made no answer but managed to turn the conversation towards the farm and those interests about which i could affect an interest that i was very far from feeling just at that moment this induced the divine to inquire into the result of my late voyage and enabled me to collect sufficient fortitude to meet grace with the semblance of firmness at least  mr hardinge made a preconcerted signal as soon as he came in view of the house that apprised its inmates of my arrival and we knew while still half a mile from the buildings that the news had produced a great commotion all the blacks met us on the little lawnfor the girls since reaching womanhood had made this change in the old dooryardand i had to go through the process of shaking hands with every one of them this was done amid hearty bursts of laughter the mode in which the negroes of that day almost always betrayed their joy and many a welcome home masser mile and where a neb got to dis time masser mile was asked by more than one and great was the satisfaction when i told his generation and race that the faithful fellow would be up with the cart that was to convey my luggage but grace awaited me i broke through the throng and entered the house in the door i was met by chloe a girl about my own sisters age and a sort of cousin of nebs by the halfblood who had been preferred of late years to functions somewhat resembling those of a ladys maid i say of the halfblood for to own the truth few of the new york blacks in that day could have taken from their brothers and sisters under the old dictum of the common law which declared that none but heirs of the whole blood should inherit chloe met me in the doorway and greeted me with one of her sweetest smiles as she curtsied and really looked as pleased as all my slaves did at seeing their young master again how they touched my heart at times by their manner of talking about ole masser and ole missus always subjects of regret among negroes who had been well treated by them  metaphysicians may reason as subtly as they can about the races and colours and on the aptitude of the black to acquire but no one can ever persuade me out of the belief of their extraordinary aptitude to love as between themselves and their masters their own children and those of the race to which they were subject i have often seen instances which have partaken of the attachment of the dog to the human family and cases in which the children of their masters have been preferred to those of their own flesh and blood were of constant occurrence  i hope you been werry well sah masser mile said chloe who had some extra refinement as the growth of her position  perfectly my good girl and i am glad to see you looking so wellyou really are growing handsome chloe  oh masser mileyou so drollnow you stay home sah long time  i am afraid not chloe but one never knows where shall i find my sister  miss grace tell me come here masser mile and say she wish to see you in de familyroom she wait dere now some time  thank you chloe and do you see that no one interrupts us i have not seen my sister for near a year  sartain sah all as you say then the girl whose face shone like a black bottle that had just been dipped in water showed her brilliant teeth from ear to ear laughed outright looked foolish after which she looked earnest when the secret burst out of her heart in the melodious voice of a young negress that did not know whether to laugh or to crywhere neb masser mile what he do now de feller  he will kiss you in ten minutes chloe so put the best face on the matter you are able  dat he wontde sauceboxmiss grace teach me better dan dat  i waited to hear no more but proceeded towards the triangular little room with steps so hurried and yet so nervous that i do not remember ever before to have laid my hand on a lock in a manner so tremulousi found myself obliged to pause ere i could muster resolution to open the door a hope coming over me that the impatience of grace would save me the trouble and that i should find her in my arms before i should be called on to exercise any more fortitude all was still as death however within the room and i opened the door as if i expected to find one of the bodies i had formerly seen in its coffin in this last abiding place above ground of one dead my sister was on the causeuse literally unable to rise from debility and agitation  i shall not attempt to describe the shock her appearance gave me i was prepared for a change but not one that placed her as my heart instantly announced so near the grave  grace extended both arms and i threw myself at her side drew her within my embrace and folded her to my heart with the tenderness with which one would have embraced an infant in this situation we both wept violently and i am not ashamed to say that i sobbed like a child i dare say five minutes passed in this way without either of us speaking a word  a merciful and all gracious god be praised you are restored to me in time miles murmured my sister at length i was afraid it might be too late  gracegracewhat means this lovemy precious my only my most dearly beloved sister why do i find you thus  is it necessary to speak milescannot you seedo you not see and understand it all  the fervent pressure i gave my sister announced how plainly i comprehended the whole history that grace could ever love and forget i did not believe but that her tenderness for rupertone whom i knew for so frivolous and selfish a being should reduce her to this terrible state i had not indeed foreseen as a thing possible little did i then understand how confidingly a woman loves and how apt she is to endow the being of her choice with all the qualities se could wish him to possess in the anguish of my soul i muttered loud enough to be heard the heartless villain  grace instantly rose from my arms at that moment she looked more like a creature of heaven than one that was still connected with this wicked world her beauty could scarcely be called impaired though i dreaded that she would be snatched away from me in the course of the interview so frail and weak did it appear was her hold of life  in some respects i never saw her more lovely than she seemed on this very occasion this was when the hectic of disease imparted to the sweetest and most saintlike eyes that were ever set in the human countenance a species of holy illumination her countenance now was pale and colourless however and her look sorrowful and filled with reproach  brother she said solemnly this must not be it is not what god commandsit is not what i expected from youwhat i have a right to expect from one whom i am assured loves me though none other of earth can be said to do so  it is not easy my sister for a man to forget or forgive the wretch who has so long misled youmisled us all and then turned to another under the impulse of mere vanity  miles my kind and manly brother listen to me grace rejoined fervently pressing one of my hands in both of hers and scarcely able to command herself through alarm all thoughts of anger of resentment of pride even must be forgotten  you owe it to my sex to the dreadful imputations that might otherwise rest on my namehad i anything to reproach myself with as a woman i could submit to any punishment but surely surely it is not a sin so unpardonable to be unable to command the affections that i deserve to have my name after i shall be dead mixed up with rumours connected with such a quarrel you have lived as brothers toothen there is good excellent truthful pious mr hardinge who is yet my guardian you know and lucy dear truehearted faithful lucy  why is not dear truehearted faithful lucy here watching over you grace at this very moment i demanded huskily  she knows nothing of my situationit is a secret as well as its cause from all but god myself and you ah  i knew it would be impossible to deceive your love miles  which has ever been to me all that a sister could desire  and lucy how has her affection been deceivedhas she too eyes only for those she has recently learned to admire  you do her injustice brother lucy has not seen me since the great change that i can myself see has come over me another time i will tell you all at present i can only say that as soon as i had certain explanations with rupert i left town and have studiously concealed from dear lucy the state of my declining health i write to her weekly and get answers everything passing between us as cheerfully and apparently as happily as ever no do not blame lucy who i am certain would quit everything and everybody to come to me had she the smallest notion of the truth on the contrary i believe she thinks i would rather not have her at clawbonny just at this moment much as she knows i love her for one of lucys observation and opportunities cannot but suspect the truth let me lie on your breast brother it wearies me to talk so much  i sat holding this beloved sister in my arms fully an hour neither of us speaking i was afraid of injuring her by further excitement and she was glad to take refuge in silence from the feelings of maiden shame that could not be otherwise than mingled with such a dialogue as my cheek leaned on her silken hair i could see large tears rolling down the pallid cheeks but the occasional pressure of the hands told me how much she was gladdened by my presence after some ten or fifteen minutes the exhausted girl dropped into feverish and disturbed slumbers that i would have remained motionless throughout the night to maintain i am persuaded it was quite an hour before this scene terminated grace then arose and said with one of her most angelic smiles  you see how it is with me milesfeeble as an infant and almost as troublesome you must bear with me for you will be my nurse one promise i must have dearest before we leave this room  it is yours my sister let it be what it may i can now refuse you nothing said i melted to feminine tenderness  and yet grace since you exact a promise i have a mind to attach a condition  what condition miles can you attach that i will refuse  i consent to everything without even knowing your wishes  then i promise not to call rupert to an account for his conductnot to question himnay even not to reproach him i rejoined enlarging my pledges as i saw by graces eyes that she exacted still more  the last promise however appeared fully to satisfy her  she kissed my hand and i felt hot tears falling on it  now name your conditions dearest brother she said after a little time taken to recover herself name them and see how gladly i shall accept them all  i have but oneit is this i must take the complete direction of the care of youmust have power to send for what physician i please what friends i please what advice or regimen i please  oh miles you could notcannot think of sending for him  certainly not his presence would drive me from the house with that one exception then my condition is allowed  grace made a sign of assent and sunk on my bosom again nearly exhausted with the scene through which she had just gone i perceived it would not do to dwell any longer on the subject we had been alluding to rather than discussing and for another hour did i sit sustaining that beloved form declining to speak and commanding silence on her part at the end of this second little sleep grace was more refreshed than she had been after her first troubled repose and she declared herself able to walk to her room where she wished to lie on her own bed until the hour of dinner  i summoned chloe and together we led the invalid to her chamber as we threaded the long passages my sisters head rested on my bosom her eyes were turned affectionately upward to my face and several times i felt the gentle pressure of her emaciated hands given in the fervour of devoted sisterly love  i needed an hour to compose myself after this interview  in the privacy of my own room i wept like a child over the wreck of the being i had left so beautiful and perfect though even then the canker of doubt had begun to take root i had yet her explanations to hear and resolved to command myself so far as to receive them in a manner not to increase the pain grace must feel in making them as soon as sufficiently calm i sat down to write letters one was to marble i desired him to let the secondmate see the ship discharged and to come up to me by the return of the sloop i wished to see him in person as i did not think i could be able to go out in the vessel on her next voyage and i intended him to sail in her as master it was necessary we should consult together personally i did not conceal the reason of this determination though i said nothing of the cause of my sisters state marble had a list of physicians given him and he was to bring up with him the one he could obtain commencing with the first named and following in the order given i had earned ten thousand dollars nett by the labours of the past year and i determined every dollar of it should be devoted to obtaining the best advice the country then afforded i had sent for such men as hosack post bayley mknight moore c and even thought of endeavouring to procure rush from philadelphia but was deterred from making the attempt by the distance and the pressing nature of the emergency in 1803 philadelphia was about three days journey from clawbonny even allowing for a favourable time on the river with a moderately unfavourable five or six whereas the distance can now be passed including the chances of meeting the departures and arrivals of the different lines in from twelve to fifteen hours such is one of the prodigious effects of an improved civilization and in all that relates to motion and which falls short of luxury or great personal comfort this country takes a high place in the scale of nations that it is as much in arrears in other great essentials however particularly in what relates to tavern comforts no man who is familiar with the better civilization of europe can deny  it is a singular fact that we have gone backward in this last particular within the present century and all owing to the increasingly gregarious habits of the population but to return to my painful theme from which even at this distance of time i am only too ready to escape  i was on the point of writing to lucy but hesitated i hardly knew whether to summon her to clawbonny or not  that she would come and that instantly the moment she was apprised of graces condition i did not in the least doubt i was not so mad as to do her character injustice because i had my doubts about being loved as i had once hoped to be that lucy was attached to me in one sense i did not in the least doubt this her late reception of me sufficiently proved and i could not question her continued affection for grace after all the latter had just told me  even did lucy prefer andrew drewett it was no proof she was not just as kindhearted as ready to be of service and as true in her friendship as she ever had been still she was ruperts sister must have penetration enough to understand the cause of graces illness and might not enter as fully into her wrongs as one could wish in a person that was to watch the sick pillow i resolved to learn more that day before this portion of my duty was discharged  neb was summoned and sent to the wharf with an order to get the wallingford ready to sail for town at the first favourable moment the sloop was merely to be in ballast and was to return to clawbonny with no unnecessary delay  there was an eminent but retired physician of the name of bard who had a country residence on the other bank of the hudson and within a few hours sail from clawbonny i knew his character though i was not acquainted with him personally few of us of the right bank indeed belonged to the circles of the left in that day the increasing wealth and population of the country has since brought the western side into more notice i wrote also to dr bard inclosing a cheque for a suitable fee made a strong appeal to his feelingswhich would have been quite sufficient with such a manand ordered neb to go out in the grace and lucy immediately to deliver the missive just as this arrangement was completed chloe came to summon me to my sisters room  i found grace still lying on her bed but stronger and materially refreshed for a moment i began to think my fears had exaggerated the danger and that i was not to lose my sister a few minutes of close observation however convinced me that the first impression was the true one i am not skilled in the theories of the science if there be any great science about it and can hardly explain even now the true physical condition of grace she had pent up her sufferings in her own bosom for six cruel months in the solitude of a countryhouse living most of the time entirely alone and this they tell me is what few even of the most robust frames can do with impunity frail as she had ever seemed her lungs were sound and she spoke easily and with almost all her original force so that her wasting away was not the consequence of anything pulmonary i rather think the physical effects were to be traced to the unhealthy action of the fluids which were deranged through the stomach and spleen the insensible perspiration was affected also i believe the pores of the skin failing to do their duty i dare say there is not a graduate of the thousand and one medical colleges of the country who is not prepared to laugh at this theory while unable quite likely to produce a betterso much easier is it to pull down than to build up but my object is merely to give the reader a general idea of my poor sisters situation in outward appearance her countenance denoted that expression which the french so well describe by their customary term of fatigué rather than any other positive indication of diseasegraces frame was so delicate by nature that a little falling away was not as perceptible in her as it would have been in most persons though her beautiful little hands wanted that fulness which had rendered their taper fingers and roseate tint formerly so very faultless there must have been a good deal of fever as her colour was often higher than was formerly usual it was this circumstance that continued to render her beauty even unearthly without its being accompanied by the emaciation so common in the latter stages of pulmonary disease though its tendency was strongly to undermine her strength  grace without rising from her pillow now asked me for an outline of my late voyage she heard me i make no doubt with real interest for all that concerned me in a measure concerned her her smile was sweetness itself as she listened to my successes and the interest she manifested in marble with whose previous history she was well acquainted was not less than i had felt myself in hearing his own account of his adventures all this delighted me as it went to prove that i had beguiled the sufferer from brooding over her own sorrows and what might not be hoped for could we lead her back to mingle in the ordinary concerns of life and surround her with the few friends she so tenderly loved and whose absence perhaps had largely contributed to reducing her to her present state this thought recalled lucy to my mind and the wish i had to ascertain how far it might be agreeable to the latter to be summoned to clawbonny i determined to lead the conversation to this subject  you have told me grace i said that you send and receive letters weekly to and from lucy  each time the wallingford goes and comes and that you know is weekly i suppose the reason i got no letter today was owing to the fact that the sloop sailed before her time the lord high admiral was on board and like wind and tide he waits for no man  bless youbless you dearest sisterthis gaiety removes a mountain from my heart  grace looked pleased at first then as she gazed wistfully into my face i could see her own expression change to one of melancholy concern large tears started from her eyes and three or four followed each other down her cheeks  all this said plainer than words that though a fond brother might be momentarily deceived she herself foresaw the end  i bowed my head to the pillow stifled the groans that oppressed me and kissed the tears from her cheeks to put an end to these distressing scenes i determined to be more businesslike in future and suppress all feeling as much as possible  the lord high admiral i resumed is a species of turk on board ship as honest moses marble will tell you when you see him grace but now for lucy and her lettersi dare say the last are filled with tender secrets touching such persons as andrew drewett and others of her admirers which render it improper to show any of them to me  grace looked at me with earnestness as if to ascertain whether i was really as unconcerned as i affected to be  then she seemed to muse picking the cotton of the spotless counterpane on which she was lying like one at a loss what to say or think  i see how it is i resumed forcing a smile the hint has been indiscreet a rough son of neptune is not the proper confidant for the secrets of miss lucy hardinge  perhaps you are right fidelity to each other being indispensable in your sex  it is not that miles i doubt if lucy ever wrote me a line that you might not seein proof of which you shall have the package of her letters with full permission to read every one of them it will be like reading the correspondence of another sister  i fancied grace laid an emphasis on the last word she used and i started at its unwelcome soundunwelcome as applied to lucy hardinge to a degree that i cannot express  i had observed that lucy never used any of these terms as connected with me and it was one of the reasons why i had indulged in the folly of supposing that she was conscious of a tenderer sentiment but lucy was so natural so totally free from exaggeration so just and true in all her feelings that one could not expect from her most of the acts of girlish weakness as for grace she called chloe gave her the keys of her secretary and told her to bring me the package she described  go and look them over miles said my sister as i received the letters there must be more than twenty of them and you can read half before the dinner hour i will meet you at table and let me implore you not to alarm good mr hardinge he does not believe me seriously ill and it cannot benefit him or me to cause him pain  i promised discretion arid hastened to my own room with the precious bundle of lucys letters shall i own the truth i kissed the papers fervently before they were loosened and it seemed to me i possessed a treasure in holding in my hand so many of the dear girls epistles i commenced in the order of the date and began to read with eagerness it was impossible for lucy hardinge to write to one she loved and not exhibit the truth and nature of her feelings these appeared in every paragraph in which it was proper to make any allusions of the sort but the letters had other charms it was apparent throughout that the writer was ignorant that she wrote to an invalid though she could not but know that she wrote to a recluse her aim evidently was to amuse grace of whose mental sufferings she could not well be ignorant lucy was a keen observer and her epistles were filled with amusing comments on the follies that were daily committed in new york as well as in paris or london i was delighted with the delicate pungency of her satire which however was totally removed from vulgar scandal there was nothing in these letters that might not have been uttered in a drawingroom to any but the persons concerned and yet they were filled with a humour that rose often to wit relieved by a tact and taste that a man never could have attained  throughout it was apparent to me lucy in order to amuse grace was giving a full scope to a natural talentone that far surpassed the same capacity in her brother being as true as his was meritricious and jesuiticalwhich she had hitherto concealed from us all merely because she had not seen an occasion fit for its use allusions in the letters themselves proved that grace had commented on this unexpected display of observant humour and had expressed her surprise at its existence it was then as novel to my sister as it was to myself i was struck also with the fact that ruperts name did not appear once in all these letters they embraced just twentyseven weeks between the earliest and the latest date and there were nineandtwenty letters two having been sent by private conveyances her fathers most probably he occasionally making the journey by land yet no one of them contained the slightest allusion to her brother or to either of the mertons this was enough to let me know how well lucy understood the reason of graces withdrawal to clawbonny  and how was it with miles wallingfords name some of my fair readers may be ready to ask i went carefully through the package in the course of the evening and i set aside two as the only exceptions in which my name did not appear on examining these two with jealous care i found each had a postscript one of which was to the following effect i see by the papers that miles has sailed for malta having at last left those stubborn turks i am glad of this as one would not wish to have the excellent fellow shut up in the seven towers however honourable it may have been the other postscript contained this dear miles has got to leghorn my father tells me and may be expected home this summer how great happiness this will bring you dearest grace i can well understand and i need scarcely say that no one will rejoice more to see him again than his late guardian and myself  that the papers were often looked over to catch reports of my movements in europe by means of ships arriving from different parts of the world was apparent enough but i scarce knew what to make of the natural and simply affectionate manner in which my name was introduced it might proceed from a wish to gratify grace and a desire to let the sister know all that she herself possessed touching the brothers movements then andrew drewetts name occurred very frequently though it was generally in connection with that of his mother who had evidently constituted herself a sort of regular chaperone for lucy more especially during the time she was kept out of the gay world by her mourning i read several of these passages with the most scrupulous attention in order to detect the feeling with which they had been written but the most practised art could not have more successfully concealed any secret of this sort than lucys nature this often proves to be the case the justminded and true among men daily becoming the profoundest mysteries to a vicious cunning deceptive and selfish world an honest man indeed is ever a parodox to all but those who see things with his own eyes this is the reason that improper motives are so often imputed to the simplest and seemingly most honest deeds  the result was to write entreating lucy to come to clawbonny first taking care to secure her fathers assent to aid my request this was done in a way not to awaken any alarm and yet with sufficient strength to render it tolerably certain she would come on deliberate reflection and after seeing my sister at table where she ate nothing but a light vegetable diet and passing the evening with her i thought i could not do less in justice to the invalid or her friend i took the course with great regret on several accounts and among others from a reluctance to appear to draw lucy away from the society of my rival into my own  yet what right had i to call myself the rival or competitor of a man who had openly professed an attachment where i had never breathed a syllable myself that might not readily be mistaken for the language of that friendship which time and habit and a respect for each others qualities so easily awaken among the young of different sexes i had been educated almost as lucys brother and why should she not feel towards me as one  neb went out in the boat as soon as he got his orders and the wallingford sailed again in ballast that very night  she did not remain at the wharf an hour after her wheat was out i felt easier when these duties were discharged and was better prepared to pass the night in peace graces manner and appearance too contributed to this calm for she seemed to revive and to experience some degree of earthly happiness in having her brother near her when mr hardinge read prayers that night she came to the chair where i stood took my hand in hers and knelt at my side  i was touched to tears by this act of affection which spoke as much of the tenderness of the sainted and departed spirit lingering around those it had loved on earth as of the affection of the world i folded the dear girl to my bosom as i left her at the door of her own room that night and went to my own pillow with a heavy heart seamen pray little less than they ought amid the rude scenes of their hazardous lives still i had not quite forgotten the lessons of childhood and sometimes practised on them that night i prayed fervently beseeching god to spare my sister if in his wisdom it were meet and i humbly invoked his blessings on the excellent divine and on lucy by name i am not ashamed to own it let who may deride the act    chapter xxix    wherever sorrow is relief would be   if you do sorrow at my grief in love   by giving love your sorrow and my grief   were both extermind   as you like it   i saw but little of grace during the early part of the succeeding day she had uniformly breakfasted in her own room of late and in the short visit i paid her there i found her composed with an appearance of renewed strength that encouraged me greatly as to the future mr hardinge insisted on rendering an account of his stewardship that morning and i let the good divine have his own way though had he asked me for a receipt in full i would cheerfully have given it to him without examining a single item  there was a singular peculiarity about mr hardinge no one could live less for the world generally no one was less qualified to superintend extensive worldly interests that required care or thought and no one would have been a more unsafe executor in matters that were intricate or involved still in the mere business of accounts he was as methodical and exact as the most faithful banker rigidly honest and with a strict regard for the rights of others living moreover on a mere pittance for the greater part of his life this conscientious divine never contracted a debt he could not pay what rendered this caution more worthy of remark was the fact that he had a spendthrift son but even rupert could never lure him into any weakness of this sort i question if his actual cash receipts independently of the profits of his little glebe exceeded 300 in any one year yet he and his children were ever welldressed and i knew from observation that his table was always sufficiently supplied he got a few presents occasionally from his parishioners it is true but they did not amount to any sum of moment it was method and a determination not to anticipate his income that placed him so much above the world while he had a family to support whereas now that mrs bradforts fortune was in the possession of his children he assured me he felt himself quite rich though he scrupulously refused to appropriate one dollar of the handsome income that passed through his hands as executor to his own uses it was all lucys who was entitled to receive this income even in her minority and to her he paid every cent quarterly the sister providing for ruperts ample wants  of course i found everything exact to a farthing the necessary papers were signed the power of attorney was cancelled and i entered fully into the possession of my own  an unexpected rise in the value of flour had raised my shore receipts that year to the handsome sum of nine thousand dollars this was not properly income however but profits principally obtained through the labour of the mill  by putting all my loose cash together i found i could command fully 30000 in addition to the price of the ship  this sum was making me a man quite at my ease and properly managed it opened a way to wealth how gladly would i have given every cent of it to see grace as healthy and happy as she was when i left her at mrs bradforts to sail in the crisis  after settling the figures mr hardinge and i mounted our horses and rode over the property to take a look at the state of the farm our road took us near the little rectory and the glebe and here the simpleminded divine broke out into ecstasies on the subject of the beauties of his own residence and the delight with which he should now return to his ancient abode he loved clawbonny no less than formerly but he loved the rectory more  i was born in that humble snug quiet old stone cottage miles he said and there i lived for years a happy husband and father and i hope i may say a faithful shepherd of my little flock st michaels clawbonny is not trinity new york but it may prove on a small scale as to numbers as fitting a nursery of saints what humble and devout christians have i known to kneel at its little altar miles among whom your mother and your venerable old grandmother were two of the best i hope the day is not distant when i shall meet there another mrs miles wallingford marry young my boy early marriages prove happier than late where there are the means of subsistence  you would not have me marry until i can find a woman whom i shall truly love dear sir  heaven forbid i would rather see you a bachelor to my dying day but america has enough females that a youth like you could and indeed ought to love i could direct you to fifty myself  well sir your recommendations would have great weight with me i wish you would begin  that i will that i will if you wish it my dear boy  well there is a miss hervey miss kate hervey in town a girl of excellent qualities and who would just suit you could you agree  i recollect the young lady the greatest objection i should raise to her is a want of personal attractions of all mrs bradforts acquaintances i think she was among the very plainest  what is beauty miles in marriage very different recommendations are to be looked for by the husband  yet i have understood you practised on another theory mrs hardinge even as i recollect her was very handsome  yes that is true answered the good divine simply she was so but beauty is not to be considered as an objection  if you do not relish the idea of kate hervey what do you say to jane harwoodthere is a pretty girl for you  a pretty girl sir but not for me but in naming so many young ladies why do you overlook your own daughter  i said this with a sort of desperate resolution tempted by the opportunity and the direction the discourse had taken  when it was uttered i repented of my temerity and almost trembled to hear the answer  lucy exclaimed mr hardinge turning suddenly to towards me and looking so intently and earnestly in my face that i saw the possibility of such a thing then struck him for the first time sure enough why should you not marry lucy there is not a particle of relationship between you after all though i have so long considered you as brother and sister i wish we had thought of this earlier miles it would be a most capital connectionthough i should insist on your quitting the sea lucy has too affectionate a heart to be always in distress for an absent husband  i wonder the possibility of this thing did not strike me before it was too late in a man so much accustomed to see what is going on around me to overlook this  the words too late sounded to me like the doom of fate and had my simpleminded companion but the tithe of the observation which he so much vaunted he must have seen my agitation i had advanced so far however that i determined to learn the worst whatever pain it might cost me  i suppose sir the very circumstance that we were brought up together has prevented us all from regarding the thing as possible but why too late my excellent guardian if we who are the most interested in the thing should happen to think otherwise  certainly not too late if you include lucy herself in your conditions but i am afraid miles it is too late for lucy  am i to understand then that miss hardinge is engaged to mr drewett are her affections enlisted in his behalf  you may be certain of one thing boy and that is if lucy be engaged her affections are enlistedso conscientious a young woman would never marry without giving her heart with her hand as for the fact however i know nothing except by inference i do suppose a mutual attachment to exist between her and andrew drewett  of course with good reason sir lucy is not a coquette or a girl to encourage when she does not mean to accept  thats all i know of the matter drewett continues to visit is as attentive as a young man well can be where a young woman is as scrupulous as is lucy about the proper forms and i infer they understand each other i have thought of speaking to lucy on the subject but i do not wish to influence her judgment in a case where there exists no objection drewett is every way a suitable match and i wish things to take their own course there is one little circumstance however that i can mention to you as a sort of son miles and which i consider conclusive as to the girls inclinationsi have remarked that she refuses all expedients to get her to be alone with drewettrefuses to make excursions in which she must be driven in his curricle or to go anywhere with him even to the next door so particular is she that she contrives never to be alone with him even in his many visits to the house  and do you consider that as a proof of attachmentof her being engaged does your own experience sir confirm such a notion  what else can it be if it be not a consciousness of a passionof an attachment that she is afraid every one will see you do not understand the sex i perceive miles or the finesse of their natures would be more apparent to you  as for my experience no conclusion can be drawn from that as i and my dear wife were thrown together very young all alone in her mothers country house and the old lady being bedridden there was no opportunity for the bashful maiden to betray this consciousness but if i understand human nature such is the secret of lucys feelings towards andrew drewett it is of no great moment to you miles notwithstanding as there are plenty more young women to be had in the world  true sir but there is only one lucy hardinge i rejoined with a fervour and strength of utterance that betrayed more than i intended  my late guardian actually stopped his horse this time to look at me and i could perceive deep concern gathering around his usually serene and placid brow he began to penetrate my feelings and i believe they caused him real grief  i never could have dreamed of this mr hardinge at length exclaimed do you really love lucy my dear miles  better than i do my own life siri almost worship the earth she treads onlove her with my whole heart and have loved i believe if the truth were known ever since i was sixteenperhaps i had better say twelve years old  the truth escaped me as the torrent of the mississippi breaks through the levee and a passage once open for its exit it cleared a way for itself until the current of my feelings left no doubt of its direction i believe i was a little ashamed of my own weakness for i caused my horse to walk forward mr hardinge accompanying the movement for a considerable distance in a profound and i doubt not a painful silence  this has taken me altogether by surprise miles my late guardian resumed altogether by surprise what would i not give could this have been known a year or two since my dear boy i feel for you from the bottom of my heart for i can understand what it must be to love a girl like lucy without hope why did you not let this be known sooneror why did you insist on going to sea having so strong a motive for remaining at home  i was too young at that time sir to act on or even to understand my own feelings on my return in the crisis i found lucy in a set superior to that in which i was born and educated and it would have been a poor proof of my attachment to wish to bring her down nearer to my own level  i understand you miles and can appreciate the generosity of your conduct though i am afraid it would have been too late on your return in the crisis that was only a twelvemonth since and then i rather think andrew drewett had offered there is good sense in your feeling on the subject of marriages in unequal conditions in life for they certainly lead to many heartburnings and greatly lessen the chances of happiness one thing is certain in all such cases if the inferior cannot rise to the height of the superior the superior must sink to the level of the inferior  man and wife cannot continue to occupy different social positions and as for the nonsense that is uttered on such subjects by visionaries under the claim of its being common sense it is only fit for pretending theories and can have nothing to do with the great rules of practice you were right in principle then miles though you have greatly exaggerated the facts of your own particular case  i have always known sir and have ever been ready to admit that the hardinges have belonged to a different class of society from that filled by the wallingfords  this is true but in part only and by no means true to a degree that need have drawn any impassable line between you and lucy you forget how poor we then were and bow substantial a benefit the care of clawbonny might have been to my dear girl besides you are of reputable descent and position if not precisely of the gentry and this is not a country or an age to carry notions of such a nature beyond the strict bounds of reason you and lucy were educated on the same level and after all that is the great essential for the marriage connection  there was great good sense in what mr hardinge said and i began to see that pride and not humility might have interfered with my happiness as i firmly believed it was now too late however i began to wish the subject changed for i felt it grating on some of my most sacred feelings  with a view to divert the conversation to another channel therefore i remarked with some emphasis affecting an indifference i did not feel  what cannot be cured must be endured sir and i shall endeavour to find a sailors happiness hereafter in loving my ship besides were andrew drewett entirely out of the question it is now too late in another sense since it would never do for the man who himself at his ease in the way of money hesitated about offering when his mistress was poor to prove his love by proposing to mrs  bradforts heiress still i own to so much weakness as to wish to know before we close the subject for ever why mr  drewett and your daughter do not marry if they are engaged  perhaps it is owing only to lucys mourning  i have myself imputed it to another cause rupert is entirely dependent on his sister and i know lucy so well as to feel certainsome extraordinary cause not interposingthat she wishes to bestow half her cousins fortune on her brother this cannot be done until she is of age and she wants near two years of attaining her majority  i made no answer for i felt how likely this was to be true lucy was not a girl of professions and she would be very apt to keep a resolution of this nature a secret in her own breast until ready to carry it into execution no more passed between mr hardinge and myself on the subject of our recent conversation though i could see my avowal had made him sad and that it induced him to treat me with more affection even than had been his practice once or twice in the course of the next day or two i overheard him soliloquizinga habit to which he was a good deal addictedduring which he would murmur what a pityhow much to be regrettedi would rather have him for a son than any man on earth and other similar expressions  of course these involuntary disclosures did not weaken my regard for my late guardian  about noon the grace  lucy came in and neb reported that dr bard was not at home he had left my letter however and it would be delivered as soon as possible  he told me also that the wind had been favourable on the river and that the wallingford must reach town that day  nothing further occurred worthy of notice i passed the afternoon with grace in the little room and we conversed much of the past of our parents in particular without adverting however to her situation any further than to apprise her of what i had done i thought she was not sorry to learn i had sent for lucy now that i was with her and it was no longer possible her illness could be concealed as for the physicians when they were mentioned i could see a look of tender concern in graces eyes as if she regretted that i still clung to the delusion of hoping to see her health restored notwithstanding these little drawbacks we passed a sweet eventide together for more than an hour grace lay on my bosom occasionally patting her hand on my cheeks as the child caresses its mother this was an old habit of hers and it was one i was equally delighted and pained to have her resume now we were of the age and stature of man and woman  the next day was sunday and grace insisted on my driving her to church this was done accordingly in a very oldfashioned but very easy boston chaise that had belonged to my mother and with very careful driving  the congregation like the churchedifice of st michaels was very small being confined with some twenty or thirty exceptions to the family and dependants of clawbonny mr hardinges little flock was hedged in by other denominations on every side and it was not an easy matter to break through the barriers that surrounded it then he was not possessed with the spirit of proselytism contenting himself with aiding in the spiritual advancement of those whom providence had consigned to his care on the present occasion however the little building was full and that was as much as could have happened had it been as large as st peters itself the prayers were devoutly and fervently read and the sermon was plain and filled with piety  my sister professed herself in no manner wearied with the exertion we dined with mr hardinge at the rectory which was quite near the church and the irreverent businesslike makeweight sort of look of going in to one service almost as soon as the other was ended as if to score off so much preaching and praying as available at the least trouble being avoided by having the evening service commence late she was enabled to remain until the close of the day mr hardinge rarely preached but once of a sunday  he considered the worship of god and the offices of the church as the proper duties of the day and regarded his own wisdom as a matter of secondary importance but one sermon cost him as much labour and study and anxiety as most clergymens two his preaching also had the high qualification of being addressed to the affections of his flock and not to its fears and interests he constantly reminded us of gods love and of the beauty of holiness while i do not remember to have heard him allude half a dozen times in his life to the terrors of judgment and punishment except as they were connected with that disappointed love i suppose there are spirits that require these allusions and the temptations of future happiness to incite their feelings but i like the preacher who is a christian because he feels himself drawn to holiness by a power that is of itself holy and not those who appeal to their people as if heaven and hell were a mere matter of preference and avoidance on the ground of expediency i cannot better characterize mr hardinges preaching than by saying that i do not remember ever to have left his church with a sense of fear towards the creator though i have often been impressed with a love that was as profound as the adoration that had been awakened  another calm and comparatively happy evening was passed during which i conversed freely with grace of my own intentions endeavouring to revive in her an interest in life by renewing old impressions and making her participate in my feelings had i been with her from the hour spring opened with its renewal of vegetation and all the joys it confers on the innocent and happy i have often thought since i might have succeeded as it was she listened with attention and apparently with pleasure for she saw it served to relieve my mind we did not separate until i insisted grace should retire and chloe had made more than one remonstrance about her young mistresss exceeding the usual time on leaving my sisters chamber the negress followed me with a light lest i should fall among the intricate turnings and the ups and downs of the old building  well chloe i said as we proceeded together how do you find neb does he improve by this running about on the oceanespecially do you think he is tanned  de feller  yes he is a fellow sure enough and let me tell you chloe a very capital fellow too if it can be of any advantage to him in your favour to know the truth i will just say a more useful seaman does not sail the ocean than neb and that i consider him as of much importance as the mainmast  what be dat masser mile  i see nothing chloethere are no spooks at clawbonny you know  no sah what be ting neb like feller  oh i ask your pardonthe mainmast you mean it is the most important spar in the ship and i meant that neb was as useful as that mast in battle too neb is as brave as a lion  here chloe could stand it no longer she fairly laughed outright in pure natural admiration of her suitors qualities  when this was performed she ejaculated once more de fellerdropped a curtsey said good night masser mile and left me at my own door alas alasamong the improvements of this age we have entirely lost the breed of the careless goodnatured affectionate faithful hardworking and yet happy blacks of whom more or less were to be found in every respectable and longestablished family of the state forty years ago  the next day was one of great anxiety to me i rose early and the first thing was to ascertain the direction of the wind in midsummer this was apt to be southerly and so it proved on that occasion neb was sent to the point as a lookout he returned about ten and reported a fleet of sloops in sight these vessels were still a long distance down the river but they were advancing at a tolerable rate whether the wallingford were among them or not was more than could yet be told i sent him back to his station as soon as he had eaten and unable to remain quiet in the house myself i mounted my horse and rode out into the fields here as usual i experienced the happiness of looking at objects my ancestors loved to regard and which always have had a strong and near interest with me  perhaps no country that ever yet existed has been so little understood or so much misrepresented as this america of ours it is as little understood i was on the point of saying at home as it is abroad and almost as much misrepresented  certainly its possessors are a good deal addicted to valuing themselves on distinctive advantages that in reality they do not enjoy while their enemies declaim about vices and evils from which they are comparatively free facts are made to suit theories and thus it is that we see wellintentioned and otherwise respectable writers constantly running into extravagances in order to adapt the circumstances to the supposed logical or moral inference  this reasoning backwards has caused alison with all his knowledge and fairmindedness to fall into several egregious errors as i have discovered while recently reading his great work on europe he says we are a migratory race and that we do not love the sticks and stones that surround us but quit the paternal roof without regret and consider the playgrounds of infancy as only so much land for the market he also hazards the assertion that there is not such a thing as a literal farmerthat is a tenant who farms his land from a landlordin all america now as a rule and comparing the habits of america with those of older countries in which land is not so abundant this may be true but as literal fact nothing can be less so fourfifths of the inhabited portion of the american territory has a civilized existence of half a centurys duration and there has not been time to create the longlived attachments named more especially in the regions that are undergoing the moral fusion that is always an attendant of a new settlement  that thousands of heartless speculators exist among us who do regard everything even to the graves of their fathers as only so much improvable property is as undeniable as the fact that they are odious to all men of any moral feeling but thousands and tens of thousands are to be found in the country who do reverence their family possessions from a sentiment that is creditable to human nature i will not mention clawbonny and its history lest i might be suspected of being partial but it would be easy for me to point out a hundred families embracing all classes from the great proprietor to the plain yeoman who own and reside on the estates of those who first received them from the hand of nature and this after one or two centuries of possession what will mr alison say for instance of the manor of rensselear a manor in the legal sense it is no longer certainly the new institutions destroying all the feudal tenures but as mere property the late patroon transmitted it as regularly to his posterity as any estate was ever transmitted in europe this extensive manor lies in the heart of new york a state about as large and about as populous as scotland and it embraces no less than three cities in its bosom though their sites are not included in its ownership having been exempted by earlier grants it is of more than two centuries existence and it extends eightandforty miles east and west and half that distance north and south nearly all this vast property is held at this hour of the van rensselears as landlords and is farmed by their tenants there being several thousands of the latter the same is true on a smaller scale of the livingston the van cortlandt the philipse the nicoll and various other old new york estates though several were lost by attainder in the revolution i explain these things lest any european who may happen to read this book should regard it as fiction for allowing for trifling differences a hundred clawbonnys are to be found on the two banks of the hudson at this very hour  footnote  even the american may learn the following facts with some surprise it is now about fiveandtwenty years since the writer as tenant by the courtesy came into possession of two farms lying within twentythree miles of new york in each of which there had been three generations of tenants and as many of landlords without a scrap of a pen having passed between the parties so far as the writer could ever discover receipts for rent excepted he also stands in nearly the same relation to another farm in the same county on which a lease for ninety years is at this moment running one of the covenants of which prescribes that the tenant shall frequent divine service according to the church of england when opportunity offers  what an evidence of the nature of the tyranny from which our ancestors escaped more especially when it is seen that the tenant was obliged to submit to this severe exaction in consideration of a rent that is merely nominal  but to return to the narrative  my curiosity increased so much as the day advanced that i rode towards the point to look for the sloop there she was sure enough and there was neb too galloping a young horse bareback to the house with the news i met him with an order to proceed to the wharf with the chaise while i dashed on in the same direction myself almost devoured with an impatience to learn the success of my different missions as i galloped along i could see the upper part of the wallingfords sails gliding through the leaves that fringed the bank and it was apparent that she and i would reach the wharf almost at the same instant notwithstanding all my anxiety it was impossible to get a glimpse of the vessels deck  i did not quit the saddle until the planks of the wharf were under the horses hoofs then i got a view of the sloops decks for the first time a respectablelooking tall slender middleaged man with a bright dark eye was on the quarterdeck and i bowed to him inferring at once that he was one of the medical gentlemen to whom i had sent the message in effect it was post the second named on my list the first not being able to come he returned my bow but before i could alight and go on board to receive him marbles head rose from the cabin and my mate sprang ashore and shook me cordially by the hand  here i am miles my boy cried marble whom off duty i had earnestly begged to treat me with his old freedom and who took me at my wordhere i am miles my boy and farther from saltwater than i have been in fiveandtwenty years so this is the famous clawbonny i cannot say much for the port which is somewhat crowded while it contains but one craft though the river outside is pretty well as rivers go dye know lad that ive been in a fever all the way up lest we should get ashore on one side or the other your having land on both tacks at once is too much of a good thing this coming up to clawbonny has put me in mind of running them straits though we have had rather better weather this passage and a clearer horizon what dye call that affair up against the hillside yonder with the jigamerree that is turning in the water  thats a mill my friend and the jigamerree is the very wheel on which you have heard me say my father was crushed  marble looked sorrowfully at the wheel squeezed my hand as if to express sorrow for having reminded me of so painful an event and then i heard him murmuring to himselfwell i never had a father to lose no bloody mill could do me that injury  that gentleman on the quarterdeck i remarked is a physician for whom i sent to town i suppose  ay ayhes some such matter i do suppose though ive been generalizing so much about this here river and the manner of sailing a craft of that rig ive had little to say to him im always a better friend to the cook than to the surgeon but miles my lad theres a rare un in the ships aftercabin i can tell you  that must be lucyand i did not stop to pay my compliments to the strange gentleman but almost leaped into the vessels cabin  there was lucy sure enough attended by a respectablelooking elderly black female one of the halfdozen slaves that had become hers by the death of mrs bradfort neither spoke but we shook hands with frankness and i understood by the anxious expression of my companions eye all she wished to know  i really think she seems better and certainly she is far more cheerful within his last day or two i answered to the appeal yesterday she was twice at church and this morning for a novelty she breakfasted with me  god be praised lucy exclaimed with fervour then she sat down and relieved her feelings in tears i told her to expect me again in a few minutes and joined the physician who by this time was apprised of my presence the calm considerate manner of post gave me a confidence i had not felt for some days and i really began to hope it might still be within the power of his art to save the sister i so dearly loved  our dispositions for quitting the sloop were soon made and we ascended the hill together lucy leaning on my arm  on its summit was the chaise into which the doctor and marble were persuaded to enter lucy preferring to walk  the negress was to proceed in the vehicle that had been sent for the luggage and lucy and i set out arm and arm to walk rather more than a mile in company and that too without the presence of a third person such an occurrence under any other circumstances than those in which we were both placed would have made me one of the happiest men on earth but in the actual situation in which i found myself it rendered me silent and uncomfortable not so with lucy ever natural and keeping truth incessantly before her eyes the dear girl took my arm without the least embarrassment and showed no sign of impatience or of doubt  she was sad but full of a gentle confidence in her own sincerity and motives  this is dear clawbonny again she exclaimed after we had walked in silence a short distance how beautiful are the fields how fresh the woods how sweet the flowers  oh miles a day in such a spot as this is worth a year in town  why then do you who have now so much at your command pass more than half your time between the heated bricks of wall street when you know how happy we should all be to see you here among us again  i have not been certain of this that has been the sole reason of my absence had i known i should be welcome nothing would have induced me to suffer grace to pass the last six sad sad months by herself  known that you should be welcome surely you have not supposed lucy that i can ever regard you as anything but welcome here  i had no allusion to youthought not of you miles at allanswered lucy with the quiet manner of one who felt she was thinking acting and speaking no more than what was perfectly rightmy mind was dwelling altogether on grace  is it possible you could doubt of graces willingness to see you at all times and in all places lucy  i have doubted ithave thought i was acting prudently and well in staying away just at this time though i now begin to fear the decision has been hasty and unwise  may i ask why lucy hardinge has come to so singular and violent an opinion as connected with her bosom friend and almost sister grace wallingford  that almost sister oh miles what is there i possess which i would not give that there might be perfect confidence again between you and me on this subject such confidence as existed when we were boy and girlchildren i might say  and what prevents it certain i am the alienation does not cannot come from me you have only to speak lucy to have an attentive listener to ask to receive the truest answers what can then prevent the confidence you wish  there is one obstaclesurely miles you can readily imagine what i mean  can it be possible lucy is alluding to andrew drewetti thought to myself has she discovered my attachment and does she will she can she regret her own engagement  a lover who thought thus would not be apt to leave the question long in doubt  deal plainly with me i implore of you lucy i said solemnly one word uttered with your old sincerity and frankness may close a chasm that has now been widening between us for the last year or two what is the obstacle you mean  i have seen and felt the alienation to which you allude quite as sensibly as you can have done so yourself miles the dear girl answered in her natural simple manner and i will trust all to your generosity need i say more to explain what i mean than mention the name of rupert  what of him lucybe explicit vague allusions may be worse than nothing   lucys little hand was on my arm and she had drawn its glove on account of the heat i felt it press me almost convulsively as she addedi do i must think you have too much affection and gratitude for my dear father too much regard for me ever to forget that you and rupert once lived together as brothers  grace has my promise already on that subject i shall never take the worlds course with rupert in this affair  i heard lucys involuntary sob as if she gasped for breath and turning i saw her sweet eyes bent on my face with an expression of thankfulness that could not be mistaken  i would have given the same pledge to you lucy and purely on your own account it would be too much to cause you to mourn for your brothers  i did not name the offence lest my feelings should tempt me to use too strong a term  this is all i askall i desire miles bless youbless you for having so freely given me this assurance now my heart is relieved from this burthen i am ready to speak frankly to you still had i seen grace  have no scruples on account of your regard for womanly feelingi know everything and shall not attempt to conceal from you that disappointed love for rupert has brought my sister to the state she is in this might not have happened had either of us been with her but buried as she has been alone in this place her wounded sensibilities have proved too strong for a frame that is so delicate  there was a pause of a minute after i ended  i have long feared that some such calamity would befall us lucy answered in a low measured tone i think you do not understand grace as well as i do miles her mind and feelings have a stronger influence than common over her body and i fear no society of ours or of others could have saved her this trial still we must not despair it is a trialthat is just the word and by means of tenderness the most sedulous care good advice and all that we two can do to aid there must yet be hope now there is a skilful physician here he must be dealt fairly by and should know the whole  i intended to consult you on this subjectone has such a reluctance to expose graces most sacred feelings  surely it need not go quite as far as that returned lucy with sensitive quickness somethingmuchmust be left to conjecture but dr post must know that the mind is at the bottom of the evil though i fear that young ladies can seldom admit the existence of such a complaint without having it attributed to a weakness of this nature  that proceeds from the certainty that your sex has so much heart lucy your very existence being bound up in others  grace is one of peculiar strength of affectionsbut miles we will talk no further of this at present i scarce know how to speak of my brothers affairs and you must give me time to reflect now we are at clawbonny again we cannot long continue strangers to each other  this was said so sweetly i could have knelt and kissed her shoeties and yet so simply as not to induce misinterpretation  it served to change the discourse however and the remainder of the way we talked of the past lucy spoke of her cousins death relating various little incidents to show how much mrs bradfort was attached to her and how good a woman she was but not a syllable was said of the will  i was required in my turn to finish the narrative of my last voyage which had not been completed at the theatre  when lucy learned that the rough seaman who had come in the sloop was marble she manifested great interest in him declaring had she known it during the passage that she would have introduced herself all this time ruperts name was not mentioned between us and i reached the house feeling that something like the interest i had formerly possessed there had been awakened in the bosom of my companion she was at least firmly and confidingly my friend  chloe met lucy at the door with a messagemiss grace wanted to see miss lucy alone i dreaded this interview and looked forward to being present at it but lucy begged me to confide in her and i felt bound to comply while the dear girl was gone to my sisters room i sought the physician with whom i had a brief but explicit conference i told this gentleman how much grace had been alone permitting sorrow to wear upon her frame and gave him to understand that the seat of my sisters malady was mental suffering post was a cool discriminating man and he ventured no remark until he had seen his patient though i could perceive by the keen manner in which his piercing eye was fixed on mine that all i said was fully noted  it was more than an hour before lucy reappeared it was obvious at a glance that she had been dreadfully agitated and cruelly surprised at the condition in which she had found grace it was not that disease in any of its known forms was so very apparent but that my sister resembled already a being of another world in the beaming of her countenancein the bright unearthly expression of her eyesand in the slightness and delicacy of the hold she seemed generally to have on life grace had always something of this about hermuch i might better have said but it now appeared to be left nearly alone as her thoughts and strength gradually receded from the means of existence  the physician returned with lucy to my sisters room where he passed more than an hour as long a time indeed he afterwards told me himself as he thought could be done without fatiguing his patient the advice he gave me was cautious and discreet certain tonics were prescribed we were told to endeavour to divert the mind of our precious charge from her sources of uneasiness by gentle means and prudent expedients change of scene was advised also could it be done without producing too much fatigue i suggested the wallingford as soon as this project was mentioned  she was a small sloop it is true but had two very comfortable cabins my father having had one of them constructed especially in reference to my mothers occasional visits to town the vessel did little at that season of the year besides transporting flour to market and bringing back wheat in the autumn she carried wood and the products of the neighbourhood a holiday might be granted her and no harm come of it dr post approved the idea saying frankly there was no objection but the expense if i could bear that a better plan could not possibly be adopted  that night we discussed the matter in the family circle mr hardinge having come from the rectory to join us  everybody approved of the scheme it was so much better than leaving grace to pine away by herself in the solitude of clawbonny  i have a patient at the springs said dr post who is very anxious to see me and to own the truth i am a little desirous of drinking the waters myself for a week carry me to albany and land me after which you can descend the river and continue your voyage to as many places and for as long a time as the strength of miss wallingford and your own inclinations shall dictate  this project seemed excellent in all our eyes even grace heard it with a smile placing herself entirely in our hands  it was decided to put it in practice    chapter xxx    and she sits and gazes at me   with those deep and tender eyes   like the stars so still and saintlike   looking downward from the skies   longfellow   the next morning i set about the measures necessary for carrying out our plan marble was invited to be of the party the arrangements concerning the ship allowing of his absence for a few days once engaged he was of infinite service entering into the plan as my mate the regular skipper was glad to have a furlough and i retained on board no one of the proper crew but the riverpilot a man who could not be dispensed with by this arrangement we cleared the cabin from company that was not desirable for the circumstances neb and three of the clawbonny blacks were delighted to go on such an excursion and all were more or less familiar with the little duty that would be required of them indeed marble neb and myself were every way able to take care of the vessel but we chose to have plenty of physical force and a cook was indispensable  clawbonny supplied the latter in the person of old dido of that ilk  by noon the whole party were ready to embark grace was driven to the wharf and she walked on board the sloop supported by lucy and myself more however from solicitude than from absolute necessity every precaution however was taken by order of the physician to prevent anything like excitement the blacks in particular who would have followed miss grace to the waters edge being ordered to remain at home chloe to her manifest satisfaction was permitted to accompany her young mistress and great was her delight how often that day did the exclamation of de feller escape her as she witnessed nebs exploits in different parts of the sloop it was some little time before i could account for the blacks superfluous activity imputing it to zeal in my sisters service but in the end i discovered grace had to share the glory with chloe  no sooner was everybody on board than we cast off  the jib was soon up and under this short sail we moved slowly out of the creek with a pleasant southerly breeze  as we passed the point there stood the whole household arrayed in a line from the tottering greyheaded and muddylooking negro of seventy down to the glistening jetblack toddling things of two and three the distance was so small it was easy to trace even the expressions of the different countenances which varied according to the experience forebodings and characters of the different individuals notwithstanding the sort of reverential attachment all felt for miss grace and the uncertainty some among these unsophisticated creatures must have experienced on the subject of her health it was not in nature for such a cluster of niggers to exhibit unhappiness at a moment when there were so many grounds of excitement the people of this race know nothing of the word perhaps but they delight in the thing quite as much as if they did nothing but electioneer all their lives most pliant instruments would their untutored feelings make in the hands of your demagogue and possibly it may have some little influence on the white american to understand how strong is his resemblance to the nigger when he gives himself up to the mastery of this much approved mental power the day was glorious a brighter sun never shining in italy or on the grecian islands the air balmy the vessel was gay to the eye having been painted about a month before and every one seemed bent on a holiday circumstances sufficient in themselves to make this lighthearted race smiling and happy as the sloop went slowly past the whole line doffed their hats or curtsied showing at the same time a row of ivory that shone like so many gay windows in their sable faces i could see that grace was touched by this manifestation of interest such a fieldday in the clawbonny corps not having occurred since the first time my mother went to town after the death of my father fortunately everything else was soothing to my sisters spirits and so long as she could sit on the deck holding lucys hand and enjoy the changing landscape with her brother within call it was not possible she should be altogether without happiness  rounding the point as we entered the river the wallingford easedoff sheet set a studdingsail and flyingtopsail and began to breast the hudson on her way towards its sources  in 1803 the celebrated river we were navigating though it had all the natural features it possesses today was by no means the same picture of moving life the steamboat did not appear on its surface until four years later and the journeys up and down its waters were frequently a week in length in that day the passenger did not hurry on board just as a bell was disturbing the neighbourhood hustling his way through a rude throng of porters cartmen orangewomen and newsboys to save his distance by just a minute and a half but his luggage was often sent to the vessel the day before he passed his morning in saying adieu and when he repaired to the vessel it was with gentlemanlike leisure often to pass hours on board previously to sailing and not unfrequently to hear the unwelcome tidings that this event was deferred until the next day how different too was the passage from one in a steamboat there was no jostling of each other no scrambling for places at table no bolting of food no impertinence manifested no swearing about missing the eastern or southern boats or schenectady or saratoga or boston trains on account of a screw being loose norany other unseemly manifestation that anybody was in a hurry on the contrary wine and fruit were provided as if the travellers intended to enjoy themselves and a journey in that day was a festa no more embarked than could be accommodated and the company being selected the cabin was taken to the exclusion of all unwelcome intruders now the man who should order a bottle of wine to be placed at the side of his plate would be stared at as a fool and not without reason altogether for did it escape the claws of his convives and the waiters he would probably reach the end of his journey before he could drink it in 1803 not only did the dinner pass in peace and with gentlemanlike deliberation not only were the cooler and the fruit taken on deck and the one sipped and the other eaten at leisure in the course of an afternoon but in the course of many afternoons passages were certainly made in twentyfour hours in the sloops but these were the exceptions a week being much more likely to be the time passed in the enjoyment of the beautiful scenery of the river the vessel usually got aground once at least and frequently several times in a trip and often a day or two were thus delightfully lost giving the stranger an opportunity of visiting the surrounding country the necessity of anchoring with a foul wind on every opposing tide too increased these occasions thus lending to the excursion something of the character of an exploring expedition nonoa man would learn more in one passage up or down the hudson forty years since than can be obtained by a dozen at the present time i have a true seamans dislike for a steamboat and sometimes wish they were struck out of existence though i know it is contrary to all the principles of political economy and opposed to what is called the march of improvement of one thing however i feel quite certain that these inventions coupled with the gregarious manner of living that has sprung up in the large taverns is as one of our writers expresses it doing wonders for the manners of the people though in my view of the matter the wonder is that they have any left  there might have been thirty sail in sight when the wallingford got fairly into the river some turning down on a young ebb making their fifteen or twenty miles in six hours and others like ourselves stealing along against it at about the same rate half a dozen of these craft were quite near us and the decks of most of those which were steering north had parties including ladies evidently proceeding to the springs i desired marble to sheer as close to these different vessels as was convenient having no other object in view than amusement and fancying it might aid in diverting the thoughts of my sister from her own sorrows to the faces and concerns of others the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that the wallingford constructed under the orders of an old sailor and for his own uses was a fast vessel in this particular she had but one or two competitors on the river packets belonging to hudson poughkeepsie and singsing she was now only in fair ballasttrim and being admirably provided with sails in the light wind we had she actually went four feet to mostoftheothervesselsinsights three my request to marbleor order as he chose to call itwas easily enough complied with and we were soon coming up close on the quarter of a sloop that had its decks crowded with passengers who evidently belonged to the better class while on its forecastle were several horses and a carriage customary accompaniments to such a scene in that day  i had not been so happy in a long time as i felt at that moment grace was better as i fancied at least and it was certain she was more composed and less nervous than i had seen her since my return and this of itself was removing the weight of a mountain from my heart there was lucy too her rounded cheek rosy with the pleasure of the moment full of health and with eyes that never turned on me that they did not beam with confidence and kindnessthe sincerest friendship if not lovewhile every look movement syllable or gesture that was directed towards grace betrayed how strongly the hearts of these two precious creatures were still knit together in sisterly affection my guardian too seemed happier than he had been since our conversation on the state of my own feelings towards his daughter he had made a condition that we should allthe doctor exceptedreturn to clawbonny in time for service on the ensuing sunday and he was then actually engaged in looking over an old sermon for the occasion though not a minute passed in which he did not drop the manuscript to gaze about him in deep enjoyment of the landscape the scene moreover was so full of repose that even the movements of the different vessels scarce changed its sabbathlike character i repeat that i had not felt so perfectly happy since i held my last conversation with the salem witches in the duomo of firenze  marble was excessively delighted with the behaviour of the wallingford the latter was a sloop somewhat smaller than common though her accommodations were particularly commodious while she was sparred on the scale of a flyer  her greatest advantage in the way of sailing however would have been no great recommendation to her on a wind for she was nearly start light and might not have been able to carry full sail in hard november weather even on the hudsona river on which serious accidents have been known to occur there was little danger in midsummer however and we went gliding up on the quarter of the gull of troy without feeling concern of any sort  what sloop is that demanded the skipper of the gull as our boomend came within a fathom of his rail our name being out of his view  the wallingford of clawbonny just out of port bound up on a party of pleasure  now clawbonny was not then nor is it now what might be called a legal term there was no such place known in law beyond the right which usage gives and i heard a low laugh among the passengers of the gull as they heard the homely appellation this came from the equivocal position my family occupied midway between the gentry and yeomanry of the state as they both existed in 1803 had i said the sloop came from near coldenham it would have been all right for everybody who was then anybody in new york knew who the coldens were or morrisania the morrises being people of mark or twenty other places on the river but the wallingfords were as little known as clawbonny when you got fifteen or twenty miles from the spot where they had so long lived this is just the difference between obscurity and notoriety when the latter extends to an entire nation it gives an individual or a family the note that frees them entirely from the imputation of existing under the first condition and this note favourably diffused through christendom forms a reputationtransmitted to posterity it becomes fame unfortunately neither we nor our place had even reached the first simple step in this scale of renown and poor clawbonny was laughed at on account of something dutch that was probably supposed to exist in the soundthe anglosaxon race having a singular aptitude to turn up their noses at everything but their own possessions and everybody but themselves  i looked at lucy with sensitive quickness to see how she received this sneer on my birthplace but with her it was so much a matter of course to think well of everything connected with the spot its name as well as its more essential things that i do not believe she perceived this little sign of derision  while the passengers of the gull felt this disposition to smile it was very different with her skipper his dutch pilot whose name was abrahamus van valtenberg but who was more familiarly known as brom folleck for so the children of new netherlands twisted their cognomens in converting them into english the black cook the mulatto steward and the all hands who were one man and a boy there had been generations of sloops which bore the name of watlingford as well as generations of men at clawbonny and this every riverman knew in point of fact we counted four generations of men and six of sloops now none of these vessels was worthy of being mentioned but this which my father had caused to be built but she had a reputation that extended to everybody on the river the effect of all this was to induce the skipper of the gull to raise his hat and to say  that then i suppose is mr wallingford himselfyou are welcome back on the river i remember the time well when your respected father would make that boat do anything but talk nothing but the new paint which is different from the last prevented me from knowing the sloop  had i taken a look at her bows this couldnt have happened  footnote  a story is told of a scotchman of the name of farquharsonwho settled among the high dutch on the mohawk sometime previously to the revolution where unable to pronounce his name the worthy formers called him feuerstein pronounced firestyne the son lived and died under this appellation but the grandson removing to a part of the country where english alone was spoken chose to anglisise his name and by giving it a free translation became mr flint  this speech evidently gave me and my vessel an estimation with the passengers of the gull that neither had enjoyed the moment before there was some private conversation on the quarterdeck of the other vessel and then a highly respectable and gentlemanlike looking old man came to the rail bowed and commenced a discourse  i have the pleasure of seeing captain wallingford i believe he remarked with whom my friends the mertons came passengers from china they have often expressed their sense of your civilities he continued as i bowed in acquiescence and declare they should ever wish to sail with you were they again compelled to go to sea  now this was viewing my relation to the mertons in any point of view but that in which i wished it to be viewed or indeed was just still it was natural and the gentleman who spoke a man of standing and character no doubt fancied he was saying that which must prove particularly acceptable to me another proof how dangerous it is to attempt to decide on other mens feelings or affairs i could not decline the discourse and while the wallingford went slowly past the gull i was compelled to endure the torment of hearing the mertons mentioned again and again in the hearing of lucy and grace on the nerves of the latter of whom i knew it must be a severe trial at length we got rid of this troublesome neighbour though not until lucy and her father were recognised and spoken to by several of the ladies in the other party while my late guardian and his daughter were thus engaged i stole a glance at my sister  she was pale as death and seemed anxious to go below whither i led her most happily i have every reason to think as things turned out  when the wallingford had left the gull some little distance astern i returned to the deck and lucy went to take my place by the side of graces berth she reappeared however in a very few minutes saying that my sister felt an inclination to rest herself and might fall asleep feeble almost as an infant these frequent slumbers had become necessary in a measure to the patients powers chloe coming up soon after with a report that her young mistress seemed to be in a doze we all remained on deck in order not to disturb her in this manner half an hour passed and we had drawn quite near to another sloop that was going in the same direction with ourselves at this moment mr hardinge was deeply immersed in his sermon and i perceived that lucy looked at him from time to time as if she expected to catch his eye i fancied something distressed her and yet it was not easy to imagine exactly what it could be  do you not intend to go nearer the other sloop lucy at length inquired alluding to the vessel that was almost in a line with us but to which i had ordered neb to give a respectable berth  i thought the gossip of the last quite sufficient but if you like these interviews certainly  lucy seemed embarrassed she coloured to her temples paused a moment and then added affecting to laughand it was so seldom lucy affected anything but this time she did affect to laughas she said  i do wish to go near that sloop though it is not exactly for the reason you suppose  i could see she was distressed though it was not yet easy to imagine the cause lucys requests were laws to me and neb was ordered to sheer down on the quarter of this second sloop as we had done on that of the first as we drew near her stern told us that she was called the orpheus of singsing a combination of names that proved some wag had been connected with the christening her decks had also a party of both sexes on them though neither carriage nor horses all this time lucy stood quite near me as if reluctant to move and when we were sufficiently near the sloop she pressed still nearer to my side in the way in which her sex are apt to appeal to those of the other who possess their confidence when most feeling the necessity of support  now miles she said in an under tone you must speak that sloop as you call it i can never hold a loud conversation of this sort in the presence of so many strangers  very willingly lucy though you will have the goodness to let me know exactly what i am to say   certainlybegin then in your sailor fashion and when that is done i will tell you what to add  enoughorpheus there i called out just raising my voice sufficiently to be heard  ay aywhats wanted answered the skipper taking a pipe from his mouth as he leaned with his back against his own tiller in a way that was just in accordance with the sleepy character of the scene  i looked at lucy as much as to say what next  ask him if mrs drewett is on board his sloopmrs andrew drewett not mrthe old lady i mean added the dear girl blushing to the eyes  i was so confoundedi might almost add appalled that it was with great difficulty i suppressed an exclamation  command myself i did however and observing that the skipper was curiously awaiting my next question i put it  is mrs andrew drewett among your passengers sir  i inquired with a cold distinctness  my neighbour nodded his head and spoke to some of his passengers most of whom were on the maindeck seated on chairs and concealed from us as yet by the wallingfords mainsail her boom being guyed out on the side next the orpheus with its end just clear of her quarter  she is and wishes to know who makes the inquiry  returned the singsing skipper in the singsong manner in which ordinary folk repeat what is dictated  say that miss hardinge has a message to mrs drewett from mrs ogilvie who is on board that other sloop added lucy in a low and as i thought tremulous tone  i was nearly choked but made out to communicate the fact as directed in an instant i heard the foot of one who leaped on the orpheuss quarterdeck and then andrew drewett appeared hat in hand a face all smiles eyes that told his tale as plain as any tongue could have uttered it and such salutations as denoted the most perfect intimacy  lucy took my arm involuntarily and i could feel that she trembled the two vessels were now so near and everything around us was so tranquil that by lucys advancing to the wallingfords quarterdeck and drewetts coming to the taffrail of the orpheus it was easy to converse without any unseemly raising of the voice all that had been said between me and the skipper indeed had been said on a key but little higher than common by the change in lucys position i could no longer see her face but i knew it was suffused and that she was far from being as composed and collected as was usual with her demeanour all this was death to my recent happiness though i could not abstain from watching what now passed with the vigilance of jealousy  goodmorning lucy commenced and the words were uttered in a tone that i thought bespoke great familiarity if not confidence will you have the goodness to tell your mother that mrs ogilvie begs she will not leave albany until after her arrival the other sloop mrs ogilvie thinks cannot be more than an hour or two after you and she is very desirous of making a common party toah there comes mrs drewett said lucy hastily interrupting herself and i can deliver my message myself  mrs drewett coming aft at this instant lucy certainly did turn to her and communicated a message which it seems the lady in the gull had earnestly requested her to deliver in passing  and now returned mrs drewett when lucy had ceased first civilly saluting me and now my dear lucy we have something for you so sudden was your departure on the receipt of that naughty letter my letter summoning the dear girl to the bedside of her friend was meant that you left your workbox behind you and as i knew it contained many notes besides banknotes i would not allow it to be separated from me until we met here it is in what manner shall we contrive to get it into your hands  lucy started and i could see that she both felt and looked anxious as i afterwards learned she had been passing a day at mrs drewetts villa which joined her own both standing on the rocks quite near to that spot which a mawkish set among us is trying to twist from plain homely upanddown old fashioned hell gate into the exquisite and lackadaisical corruption of hurl gateheaven save the mark what puny piece of folly and affectation will they attempt nextbut lucy was paying this visit when she received my letter and it appears such was her haste to get to grace that she quitted the house immediately leaving behind her a small workbox unlocked and in it various papers that she did not wish read of course one of lucys sentiments and tone could hardly suspect a lady and mrs drewett was strictly that of rummaging her box or of reading her notes and letters but one is never easy when such things can be supposed to be in the way of impertinent eyes there are maids as well as mistresses and i could see in a moment that she wished the box was again in her own possession under the circumstances therefore i felt it was time to interfere  if your sloop will roundto mr drewett i remarked receiving a cold salutation from the gentleman in return for my own bow the first sign of recognition that had passed between us i will roundto myself and send a boat for the box  this proposal drew all eyes towards the skipper who was still leaning against his tiller smoking for life or death i was not favourably received extorting a grunt in reply that any one could understand denoted dissent the pipe was slowly removed and the private opinion of this personage was pretty openly expressed in his dutchified dialect  if a body coult get a wint for der askin dis might do very well he said but nobody rountsto mit a fair wind  i have always remarked that they who have used a dialect different from the common forms of speech in their youth and come afterwards to correct it by intercourse with the world usually fall back into their early infirmities in moments of trial perplexity or anger this is easily explained habit has become a sort of nature in their childhood and it is when most tried that we are the most natural then this skipper an albanyor albonny man as he would probably have styled himself had got down the river as far as singsing and had acquired a tolerable english but being now disturbed he fell back upon his original mode of speaking the certain proof that he would never give in i saw at once the hopelessness of attempting to persuade one of his school and had begun to devise some other scheme for getting the box on board when to my surprise and not a little to my concern i saw andrew drewett first taking the box from his mother step upon the end of our mainboom and move along the spar with the evident intention to walk as far as our deck and deliver lucy her property with his own hands the whole thing occurred so suddenly that there was no time for remonstrance  young gentlemen who are thoroughly in love are not often discreet in matters connected with their devotion to their mistresses i presume drewett saw the boom placed so favourably as to tempt him and he fancied it would be a thing to mention to carry a lady her workbox across a bridge that was of so precarious a footing had the spar lain on the ground it would certainly have been no exploit at all to for any young man to walk its length carrying his arms full of workboxes but it was a very different matter when the same feat had to be performed on a sloops boom in its place suspended over the water with the sail set and the vessel in motion this drewett soon discovered for advancing a step or two he grasped the toppinglift which luckily for him happened to be taut for a support all this occurred before there was time for remonstrance or even for thought at the same instant neb in obedience to a sign previously given by me had put the helm down a little and the boomend was already twenty feet from the quarterdeck of the orpheus  of course all the women screamed or exclaimed on some key or other poor mrs drewett hid her face and began to moan her son as lost i did not dare look at lucy who remained quiet as to voice after the first involuntary exclamation and as immovable as a statue luckily her face was from me as drewett was evidently discomposed i thought it best however to devise something not only for his relief but for that of lucys box which was in quite as much jeopardy as the young man himself more so indeed if the latter could swim i was on the point of calling out to drewett to hold on and i would cause the boomend to reach over the orpheuss maindeck after which he might easily drop down among his friends when neb finding some one to take the helm suddenly stood at my side  he drop dat box sartain masser mile halfwhispered the negro he leg begin to shake already and he wonerful skeard  i would not have that happen for a good dealcan you save it neb  sartain sir only hab to run out on e boom and bring it in and gib it miss lucy she mighty particlar about dat werry box masser mile as i see a hundrer time and more too  well lay out boy and bring it inand look to your footing neb   this was all neb wanted the fellow had feet shaped a good deal like any other aquatic bird with the essential difference however that no small part of his foundation had been laid abaft the perpendicular of the tendon achilles and being without shoes he could nearly encircle a small spar in his grasp often and often had i seen neb run out on a topsailyard the ship pitching heavily catching at the lift and it was a mere trifle after that to run out on a spar as large as the wallingfords mainboom a tolerably distinctive scream from chloe first apprised me that the negro was in motion looking in that direction i saw him walking steadily along the boom notwithstanding drewetts loud remonstrances and declarations that he wanted no assistance until he reached the spot where the young gentleman stood grasping the lift with his legs submitting to more tremour than was convenient neb now grinned looked as amiable as possible held out his hand and revealed the object of his visit  masser mile tink e gentleum better gib me miss lucy boxsaid neb as politely as he knew how  i believe in my soul that drewett could have kissed neb so glad was he to obtain this little relief the box was yielded without the slightest objection neb receiving it with a bow after which the negro turned round as coolly as if he were on the deck and walked deliberately and steadily in to the mast he stopped an instant just at the small of the spar to look back at drewett who was saying something to pacify his mother and i observed that as he stood with his heels in a line the toes nearly met underneath the boom which his feet grasped something in the manner of talons a deep sigh reached my ear as neb bounded lightly on deck and i knew whence it came by the exclamation of  de feller  as for neb he advanced with his prize which he offered to lucy with one of his best bows but in a way to show he was not conscious of having performed any unusual exploit  lucy handed the box to chloe without averting her eyes from drewett in whose situation she manifested a good deal more concern than i liked or fancied he deserved  thank you mr drewett she said affecting to think the box had been recovered altogether by his address it is now safe and there is no longer any necessity for your coming here let mr wallingford do what he saysi had mentioned in a low voice the practicability of my own schemeand return to your own sloop  but two things now interposed to the execution of this very simple expedient the first was drewetts pride blended with a little obstinacy and the other was the albonny skippers pride blended with a good deal of obstinacy the first did not like to retreat after neb had so clearly demonstrated it was no great matter to walk on the boom and the latter soured by the manner in which we had outsailed him and fancying andrew had deserted to get on board a faster vessel resented the whole by sheering away from us to the distance of a hundred yards i saw that there remained but a single expedient and set about adopting it without further delay  take good hold of the lift mr drewett and steady yourself with both hands ease away the peak halyards to tauten that lift a little more forward now one of you stand by to ease off the guy handsomely and the rest come aft to the mainsheet look out for yourself mr drewett we are about to haul in the boom when it will be a small matter to get you in upon the taffrail stand by to luff handsomely so as to keep the boom as steady as possible  but drewett clamorously protested against our doing anything of the sort he was getting used to his situation and intended to come in nebfashion in a minute more all he asked was not to be hurried  nononotouch nothing i entreat of you captain wallingfordhe said earnestly if that black can do it surely i ought to do it too  but the black has claws and you have none sir then he is a sailor and used to such things and you are none sir moreover he was barefooted while you have got on stiff and i dare say slippery boots  yes the boots are an encumbrance if i could only throw them off i should do well enough as it is however i hope to have the honour of shaking you by the hand miss hardinge without the disgrace of being helped  mr hardinge here expostulated but all in vain for i saw plainly enough drewett was highly excited and that he was preparing for a start these signs were now so apparent that all of us united our voices in remonstrances and lucy said imploringly to medo not let him move milesi have heard him say he cannot swim  it was too late pride mortified vanity obstinacy love or what you will rendered the young man deaf and away he went abandoning the lift his sole protection i saw the moment he quitted his grasp that he would never reach the mast and made my arrangements accordingly i called to marble to stand by to luff and just as the words passed my lips a souse into the water told the whole story the first glance at poor drewetts frantic manner of struggling told me that lucy was really aware of his habits and that he could not swim i was in light duck jacket and trowsers with seamans pumps and placing a foot on the rail i alighted alongside of the drowning young man just as he went under well assured he would reappear i waited for that and presently i got a view of his hair within reach of my arm and i grasped it in a way to turn him on his back and bring his face uppermost at this moment the sloop was gliding away from us marble having instantly put the helm hard down in order to roundto as i afterwards learned the state of the case was no sooner understood in the other sloop than the albonny men gave in and imitated the wallingford  there was no time for reflection as soon as drewetts hair was in my grasp i raised his head from the water by an effort that forced me under it to let him catch his breath and then relaxed the power by which it had been done to come up myself i had done this to give him a moment to recover his recollection in the hope he would act reasonably and i now desired him to lay his two hands on my shoulders permit his body to sink as low as possible and breathe and trust the rest to me if the person in danger can be made to do this an ordinarily good swimmer could tow him a mile without any unusual effort but the breathing spell afforded to drewett had the effect just to give him strength to struggle madly for existence without aiding his reason on the land he would have been nothing in my hands but in the water the merest boy may become formidable  god forgive me if i do him injustice but i have sometimes thought since that drewett was perfectly conscious who i was and that he gave some vent to his jealous distrust of lucys feelings towards me this may be all imagination but i certainly heard the words lucy wallingford clawbonny hateful muttered by the man even as he struggled there for life the advantage given him by turning to allow him to put his hands on my shoulders liked to have cost me dear instead of doing as i directed he grasped my neck with both arms and seemed to wish to mount on my head forcing his own shoulders quite out of water and mine by that much weight beneath it it was while we were thus placed his mouth within an inch or two of my very ear that i heard the words muttered which have been mentioned it is possible however that he was unconscious of that which terror and despair extorted from him  i saw no time was to be lost and my efforts became desperate  i first endeavoured to swim with this great encumbrance but it was useless the strength of hercules could not long have buoyed up the under body of such a load sufficiently to raise the nostrils for breath and the convulsive twitches of drewetts arms were near strangling me i must throw him off or drown abandoning the attempt to swim i seized his hands with mine and endeavoured to loosen his grasp of my neck of course we both sank while i was thus engaged for it was impossible to keep my head above water by means of my feet alone with a man of some size riding from his shoulders up above the level of my chin  i can scarcely describe what followed i confess i thought ho longer of saving drewetts life but only of saving my own we struggled there in the water like the fiercest enemies each aiming for the mastery as if one were to live the other must die we sank and rose to the surface for air solely by my efforts no less than three times drewett getting the largest benefits by the latter thus renewing his strength while mine great as it was by nature began gradually to fail a struggle so terrific could not last long  we sank a fourth time and i felt it was not to rise again when relief came from an unexpected quarter from boyhood my father had taught me the important lesson of keeping my eyes open under water by means of this practice i not only felt but saw the nature of the tremendous struggle that was going on it also gave me a slight advantage over drewett who closed his eyes by enabling me to see how to direct my own exertions while sinking as i believed for the last time i saw a large object approaching me in the water which in the confusion of the moment i took for a shark though sharks never ascended the hudson so high and were even rare at new york there it was however swimming towards us and even descending lower as if to pass beneath in readiness for the fatal snap beneath it did pass and i felt it pressing upward raising drewett and myself to the surface as i got a glimpse of the light and a delicious draught of air drewett was drawn from my neck by marble whose encouraging voice sounded like music in my ears at the next instant my shark emerged puffing like a porpoise and then i heard  hole on masser milehere he nigger close by  i was dragged into the boat i scarce knew how and lay down completely exhausted while my late companion seemed to me to be a lifeless corpse in a moment neb dripping like a black river god and glistening like a wet bottle placed himself in the bottom of the boat took my head into his lap and began to squeeze the water from my hair and to dry my face with some ones handkerchiefi trust it was not his own  pull away lads for the sloop said marble as soon as everybody was out of the river this gentleman seems to have put on the hatches for the last timeas for miles hell never drown in fresh water
