69789543	literary friends and acquaintancesstudies of lowell  by william dean howells    studies of lowell  i have already spoken of my earliest meetings with lowell at cambridge when i came to new england on a literary pilgrimage from the west in 1860 i saw him more and more after i went to live in cambridge in 1866 and i now wish to record what i knew of him during the years that passed between this date and that of his death if the portrait i shall try to paint does not seem a faithful likeness to others who knew him i shall only claim that so he looked to me at this moment and at that if i do not keep myself quite out of the picture what painter ever did     i  it was in the summer of 1865 that i came home from my consular post at venice and two weeks after i landed in boston i went out to see lowell at elmwood and give him an inkstand that i had brought him from italy the bronze lobster whose back opened and disclosed an inkpot and a sandbox was quite ugly but i thought it beautiful then and if lowell thought otherwise he never did anything to let me know it he put the thing in the middle of his writingtable he nearly always wrote on a pasteboard pad resting upon his knees and there it remained as long as i knew the placea matter of twentyfive years but in all that time i suppose the inkpot continued as dry as the sandbox  my visit was in the heat of august which is as fervid in cambridge as it can well be anywhere and i still have a sense of his study windows lifted to the summer night and the crickets and grasshoppers crying in at them from the lawns and the gardens outside other people went away from cambridge in the summer to the sea and to the mountains but lowell always stayed at elmwood in an impassioned love for his home and for his town i must have found him there in the afternoon and he must have made me sup with him dinner was at two oclock and then go with him for a long night of talk in his study he liked to have some one help him idle the time away and keep him as long as possible from his work and no doubt i was impersonally serving his turn in this way aside from any pleasure he might have had in my company as some one he had always been kind to and as a fresh arrival from the italy dear to us both  he lighted his pipe and from the depths of his easychair invited my shy youth to all the ease it was capable of in his presence it was not much i loved him and he gave me reason to think that he was fond of me but in lowell i was always conscious of an older and closer and stricter civilization than my own an unbroken tradition a more authoritative status his democracy was more of the head and mine more of the heart and his denied the equality which mine affirmed but his nature was so noble and his reason so tolerant that whenever in our long acquaintance i found it well to come to open rebellion as i more than once did he admitted my right of insurrection and never resented the outbreak i disliked to differ with him and perhaps he subtly felt this so much that he would not dislike me for doing it he even suffered being taxed with inconsistency and where he saw that he had not been quite just he would take punishment for his error with a contrition that was sometimes humorous and always touching  just then it was the dark hour before the dawn with italy and he was interested but not much encouraged by what i could tell him of the feeling in venice against the austrians he seemed to reserve a like scepticism concerning the fine things i was hoping for the italians in literature and he confessed an interest in the facts treated which in the retrospect i am aware was more tolerant than participant of my enthusiasm that was always lowells attitude towards the opinions of people he liked when he could not go their lengths with them and nothing was more characteristic of his affectionate nature and his just intelligence he was a man of the most strenuous convictions but he loved many sorts of people whose convictions he disagreed with and he suffered even prejudices counter to his own if they were not ignoble in the whimsicalities of others he delighted as much as in his own     ii  our associations with italy held over until the next day when after breakfast he went with me towards boston as far as the village for so he liked to speak of cambridge in the custom of his younger days when wide tracts of meadow separated harvard square from his lifelong home at elmwood we stood on the platform of the horsecar together and when i objected to his paying my fare in the american fashion he allowed that the italian usage of each paying for himself was the politer way he would not commit himself about my returning to venice for i had not given up my place yet and was away on leave but he intimated his distrust of the flattering conditions of life abroad he said it was charming to be treated da signore but he seemed to doubt whether it was well and in this as in all other things he showed his final fealty to the american ideal  it was that serious and great moment after the successful close of the civil war when the republican consciousness was more robust in us than ever before or since but i cannot recall any reference to the historical interest of the time in lowells talk it had been all about literature and about travel and now with the suggestion of the word village it began to be a little about his youth i have said before how reluctant he was to let his youth go from him and perhaps the touch with my juniority had made him realize how near he was to fifty and set him thinking of the past which had sorrows in it to age him beyond his years he would never speak of these though he often spoke of the past he told once of having been on a brief journey when he was six years old with his father and of driving up to the gate of elmwood in the evening and his father saying ah this is a pleasant place i wonder who lives herewhat little boy at another time he pointed out a certain window in his study and said he could see himself standing by it when he could only get his chin on the windowsill his memories of the house and of everything belonging to it were very tender but he could laugh over an escapade of his youth when he helped his fellowstudents pull down his fathers fences in the pure zeal of goodcomradeship     iii  my fortunes took me to new york and i spent most of the winter of 18656 writing in the office of the nation i contributed several sketches of italian travel to that paper and one of these brought me a precious letter from lowell he praised my sketch which he said he had read without the least notion who had written it and he wanted me to feel the full value of such an impersonal pleasure in it at the same time he did not fail to tell me that he disliked some pseudocynical verses of mine which he had read in another place and i believe it was then that he bade me sweat the heine out of me as men sweat the mercury out of their bones  when i was asked to be assistant editor of the atlantic monthly and came on to boston to talk the matter over with the publishers i went out to cambridge and consulted lowell he strongly urged me to take the position i thought myself hopefully placed in new york on the nation and at the same time he seemed to have it on his heart to say that he had recommended some one else for it never he owned having thought of me  he was most cordial but after i came to live in cambridge where the magazine was printed and i could more conveniently look over the proofs he did not call on me for more than a month and seemed quite to have forgotten me we met one night at mr nortons for one of the dante readings and he took no special notice of me till i happened to say something that offered him a chance to give me a little humorous snub i was speaking of a paper in the magazine on the claudian emissary and i demanded no doubt a little too airily something like who in the world ever heard of the claudian emissary you are in cambridge mr howells lowell answered and laughed at my confusion having put me down he seemed to soften towards me and at parting he said with a light of halfmocking tenderness in his beautiful eyes goodnight fellowtownsman i hardly knew we were fellowtownsmen i returned he liked that apparently and said he had been meaning to call upon me and that he was coming very soon  he was as good as his word and after that hardly a week of any kind of weather passed but he mounted the steps to the door of the ugly little house in which i lived two miles away from him and asked me to walk these walks continued i suppose until lowell went abroad for a winter in the early seventies they took us all over cambridge which he knew and loved every inch of and led us afield through the straggling unhandsome outskirts bedrabbled with squalid irish neighborhoods and fraying off into marshes and salt meadows he liked to indulge an excess of admiration for the local landscape and though i never heard him profess a preference for the charles river flats to the finest alpine scenery i could well believe he would do so under provocation of a fit listeners surprise he had always so much of the boy in him that he liked to tease the overserious or oversincere he liked to tease and he liked to mock especially his juniors if any touch of affectation or any little exuberance of manner gave him the chance when he once came to fetch me and the young mistress of the house entered with a certain excessive elasticity he sprang from his seat and minced towards her with a burlesque of her buoyant carriage which made her laugh when he had given us his heart in trust of ours he used us like a younger brother and sister or like his own children he included our children in his affection and he enjoyed our fondness for them as if it were something that had come back to him from his own youth i think he had also a sort of artistic a sort of ethical pleasure in it as being of the good tradition of the old honest simple material from which pleasing effects in literature and civilization were wrought he liked giving the children books and writing tricksy fancies in these where he masked as a fairy prince and as long as he lived he remembered his early kindness for them     iv  in those walks of ours i believe he did most of the talking and from his talk then and at other times there remains to me an impression of his growing conservatism i had in fact come into his life when it had spent its impulse towards positive reform and i was to be witness of its increasing tendency towards the negative sort he was quite past the storm and stress of his antislavery age with the close of the war which had broken for him all his ideals of inviolable peace he had reached the age of misgiving i do not mean that i ever heard him express doubt of what he had helped to do or regret for what he had done but i know that he viewed with critical anxiety what other men were doing with the accomplished facts his anxiety gave a cast of what one may call reluctance from the political situation and turned him back towards those civic and social defences which he had once seemed willing to abandon i do not mean that he lost faith in democracy this faith he constantly then and signally afterwards affirmed but he certainly had no longer any faith in insubordination as a means of grace he preached a quite socratic reverence for law as law and i remember that once when i had got back from canada in the usual disgust for the american customhouse and spoke lightly of smuggling as not an evil in itself and perhaps even a right under our vexatious tariff he would not have it but held that the illegality of the act made it a moral of fence this was not the logic that would have justified the attitude of the antislavery men towards the fugitive slave act but it was in accord with lowells feeling about john brown whom he honored while always condemning his violation of law and it was in the line of all his later thinking in this he wished you to agree with him or at least he wished to make you but he did not wish you to be more of his mind than he was himself in one of those squalid irish neighborhoods i confessed a grudge a mean and cruel grudge i now think it for the increasing presence of that race among us but this did not please him and i am sure that whatever misgiving he had as to the future of america he would not have had it less than it had been the refuge and opportunity of the poor of any race or color yet he would not have had it this alone there was a line in his poem on agassiz which he left out of the printed version at the fervent entreaty of his friends as saying too bitterly his disappointment with his country writing at the distance of europe and with america in the perspective which the alien environment clouded he spoke of her as the land of broken promise it was a splendid reproach but perhaps too dramatic to bear the full test of analysis and yet it had the truth in it and might i think have usefully stood to the end of making people think undoubtedly it expressed his sense of the case and in the same measure it would now express that of many who love their country most among us it is well to hold ones country to her promises and if there are any who think she is forgetting them it is their duty to say so even to the point of bitter accusation i do not suppose it was the common man of lincolns dream that lowell thought america was unfaithful to though as i have suggested he could be tender of the common mans hopes in her but he was impeaching in that blotted line her sincerity with the uncommon man the man who had expected of her a constancy to the ideals of her youth end to the high martyrmoods of the war which had given an unguarded and bewildering freedom to a race of slaves he was thinking of the shame of our municipal corruptions the debased quality of our national statesmanship the decadence of our whole civic tone rather than of the increasing disabilities of the hardworking poor though his heart when he thought of them was with them too as it was in the time when the slave would not let him sleep  he spoke very rarely of those times perhaps because their political and social associations were so knit up with the saddest and tenderest personal memories which it was still anguish to touch not only was he                    not of the race         that hawk their sorrows in the market place  but so far as my witness went he shrank from mention of them i do not remember hearing him speak of the young wife who influenced him so potently at the most vital moment and turned him from his whole scholarly and aristocratic tradition to an impassioned championship of the oppressed and he never spoke of the children he had lost i recall but one allusion to the days when he was fighting the antislavery battle along the whole line and this was with a humorous relish of his irish servants disgust in having to wait upon a negro whom he had asked to his table  he was rather severe in his notions of the subordination his domestics owed him they were to do as they were bid and yet he had a tenderness for such as had been any time with him which was wounded when once a hired man long in his employ greedily overreached him in a certain transaction he complained of that with a simple grief for the mans indelicacy after so many favors from him rather than with any resentment his hauteur towards his dependents was theoretic his actual behavior was of the gentle consideration common among americans of good breeding and that recreant hired man had no doubt never been suffered to exceed him in shows of mutual politeness often when the maid was about weightier matters he came and opened his door to me himself welcoming me with the smile that was like no other sometimes he said siete il benvenuto or used some other italian phrase which put me at ease with him in the region where we were most at home together  looking back i must confess that i do not see what it was he found to make him wish for my company which he presently insisted upon having once a week at dinner after the meal we turned into his study where we sat before a wood fire in winter and he smoked and talked he smoked a pipe which was always needing tobacco or going out so that i have the figure of him before my eyes constantly getting out of his deep chair to rekindle it from the fire with a paper lighter he was often out of his chair to get a book from the shelves that lined the walls either for a passage which he wished to read or for some disputed point which he wished to settle if i had caused the dispute he enjoyed putting me in the wrong if he could not he sometimes whimsically persisted in his error in defiance of all authority but mostly he had such reverence for the truth that he would not question it even in jest  if i dropped in upon him in the afternoon i was apt to find him reading the old french poets or the plays of calderon or the divina commedia which he magnanimously supposed me much better acquainted with than i was because i knew some passages of it by heart one day i came in quoting          io son cantava io son dolce sirena         che i marinai in mezzo al mar dismago  he stared at me in a rapture with the matchless music and then uttered all his adoration and despair in one word damn he said and no more i believe he instantly proposed a walk that day as if his study walls with all their vistas into the great literatures cramped his soul liberated to a sense of ineffable beauty of the verse of the somma poeta but commonly be preferred to have me sit down with him there among the mute witnesses of the larger part of his life as i have suggested in my own case it did not matter much whether you brought anything to the feast or not if he liked you he liked being with you not for what he got but for what he gave he was fond of one man whom i recall as the most silent man i ever met i never heard him say anything not even a dull thing but lowell delighted in him and would have you believe that he was full of quaint humor     v  while lowell lived there was a superstition which has perhaps survived him that he was an indolent man wasting himself in barren studies and minor efforts instead of devoting his great powers to some monumental work worthy of them if the robust body of literature both poetry and prose which lives after him does not yet correct this vain delusion the time will come when it must and in the meantime the delusion cannot vex him now i think it did vex him then and that he even shared it and tried at times to meet such shadowy claim as it had one of the things that people urged upon him was to write some sort of story and it is known how he attempted this in verse it is less known that he attempted it in prose and that he went so far as to write the first chapter of a novel he read this to me and though i praised it then i have a feeling now that if he had finished the novel it would have been a failure but i shall never finish it he sighed as if he felt irremediable defects in it and laid the manuscript away to turn and light his pipe it was a rather oldfashioned study of a whimsical character and it did not arrive anywhere so far as it went but i believe that it might have been different with a yankee story in verse such as we have fragmentarily in the nooning and fitzadams story still his gift was essentially lyrical and meditative with the universal new england tendency to allegory he was wholly undramatic in the actuation of the characters which he imagined so dramatically he liked to deal with his subject at first hand to indulge through himself all the whim and fancy which the more dramatic talent indulges through its personages  he enjoyed writing such a poem as the cathedral which is not of his best but which is more immediately himself in all his moods than some better poems he read it to me soon after it was written and in the long walk which we went hard upon the reading our way led us through the port far towards east cambridge where he wished to show me a tupelotree of his acquaintance because i said i had never seen one his talk was still of the poem which he was greatly in conceit of later his satisfaction with it received a check from the reserves of other friends concerning some whimsical lines which seemed to them too great a drop from the higher moods of the piece their reluctance nettled him perhaps he agreed with them but he would not change the lines and they stand as he first wrote them in fact most of his lines stand as he first wrote them he would often change them in revision and then in a second revision go back to the first version  he was very sensitive to criticism especially from those he valued through his head or heart he would try to hide his hurt and he would not let you speak of it as though your sympathy unmanned him but you could see that he suffered this notably happened in my remembrance from a review in a journal which he greatly esteemed and once when in a notice of my own i had put one little thorny point among the flowers he confessed a puncture from it he praised the criticism hardily but i knew that he winced under my recognition of the didactic quality which he had not quite guarded himself against in the poetry otherwise praised he liked your liking and he openly rejoiced in it and i suppose he made himself believe that in trying his verse with his friends he was testing it but i do not believe that he was and i do not think he ever corrected his judgment by theirs however he suffered from it  in any matter that concerned literary morals he was more than eager to profit by another eye one summer he sent me for the magazine a poem which when i read it i trembled to find in motive almost exactly like one we had lately printed by another contributor there was nothing for it but to call his attention to the resemblance and i went over to elmwood with the two poems he was not at home and i was obliged to leave the poems i suppose with some sort of note for the next mornings post brought me a delicious letter from him all one cry of confession the most complete the most ample he did not trouble himself to say that his poem was an unconscious reproduction of the other that was for every reason unnecessary but he had at once rewritten it upon wholly different lines and i do not think any reader was reminded of mrs akerss among the laurels by lowells footpath he was not only much more sensitive of others rights than his own but in spite of a certain severity in him he was most tenderly regardful of their sensibilities when he had imagined them he did not always imagine them     vi  at this period between the years 1866 and 1874 when he unwillingly went abroad for a twelvemonth lowell was seen in very few cambridge houses and in still fewer boston houses he was not an unsocial man but he was most distinctly not a society man he loved chiefly the companionship of books and of men who loved books but of women generally he had an amusing diffidence he revered them and honored them but he would rather not have had them about this is oversaying it of course but the truth is in what i say there was never a more devoted husband and he was content to let his devotion to the sex end with that he especially could not abide difference of opinion in women he valued their taste their wit their humor but he would have none of their reason i was by one day when he was arguing a point with one of his nieces and after it had gone on for some time and the impartial witness must have owned that she was getting the better of him he closed the controversy by giving her a great kiss with the words you are a very good girl my dear and practically putting her out of the room as to women of the flirtatious type he did not dislike them no man perhaps does but he feared them and he said that with them there was but one way and that was to run  i have a notion that at this period lowell was more freely and fully himself than at any other the passions and impulses of his younger manhood had mellowed the sorrows of that time had softened he could blamelessly live to himself in his affections and his sobered ideals his was always a duteous life but he had pretty well given up making man over in his own image as we all wish some time to do and then no longer wish it he fulfilled his obligations to his fellowmen as these sought him out but he had ceased to seek them he loved his friends and their love but he had apparently no desire to enlarge their circle it was that hour of civic suspense in which public men seemed still actuated by unselfish aims and one not essentially a politician might contentedly wait to see what would come of their doing their best at any rate without occasionally withholding open criticism or acclaim lowell waited among his books for the wounds of the war to heal themselves and the nation to begin her healthfuller and nobler life with slavery gone what might not one expect of american democracy  his life at elmwood was of an entire simplicity in the old colonial mansion in which he was born he dwelt in the embowering leafage amid the quiet of lawns and gardenplots broken by few noises ruder than those from the elms and the syringas where       the oriole clattered and the catbird sang  from the tracks on brattle street came the drowsy tinkle of horsecar bells and sometimes a funeral trailed its black length past the corner of his grounds and lost itself from sight under the shadows of the willows that hid mount auburn from his study windows in the winter the deep new england snows kept their purity in the stretch of meadow behind the house which a double row of pines guarded in a domestic privacy all was of a modest dignity within and without the house which lowell loved but did not imagine of a manorial presence and he could not conceal his annoyance with an overenthusiastic account of his home in which the simple chiselling of some panels was vaunted as rich woodcarving there was a graceful staircase and a good wide hall from which the diningroom and drawingroom opened by opposite doors behind the last in the southwest corner of the house was his study  there literally he lived during the six or seven years in which i knew him after my coming to cambridge summer and winter he sat there among his books seldom stirring abroad by day except for a walk and by night yet more rarely he went to the monthly midday dinner of the saturday club in boston he was very constant at the fortnightly meetings of his whistclub because he loved the old friends who formed it he came always to the dante suppers at longfellows and he was familiarly in and out at mr nortons of course but otherwise he kept to his study except for some rare and almost unwilling absences upon university lecturing at johns hopkins or at cornell  for four years i did not take any summer outing from cambridge myself and my associations with elmwood and with lowell are more of summer than of winter weather meetings but often we went our walks through the snows trudging along between the horsecar tracks which enclosed the only wellbrokenout paths in that simple old cambridge i date one memorable expression of his from such a walk when as we were passing longfellows house in midstreet he came as near the declaration of his religious faith as he ever did in my presence he was speaking of the new testament and he said the truth was in it but they had covered it up with their hagiology though he had been bred a unitarian and had more and more liberated himself from all creeds he humorously affected an abiding belief in hell and similarly contended for the eternal punishment of the wicked he was of a religious nature and he was very reverent of other peoples religious feelings he expressed a special tolerance for my own inherited faith no doubt because mrs lowell was also a swedenborgian but i do not think he was interested in it and i suspect that all religious formulations bored him in his earlier poems are many intimations and affirmations of belief in an overruling providence and especially in the god who declares vengeance his and will repay men for their evil deeds and will right the weak against the strong i think he never quite lost this though when in the last years of his life i asked him if he believed there was a moral government of the universe he answered gravely and with a sort of pain the scale was so vast and we saw such a little part of it  as to tine notion of a life after death i never had any direct or indirect expression from him but i incline to the opinion that his hold upon this weakened with his years as it is sadly apt to do with men who have read much and thought much they have apparently exhausted their potentialities of psychological life mystical lowell was as every poet must be but i do not think he liked mystery one morning he told me that when he came home the night before he had seen the doppelganger of one of his household though as he joked he was not in a state to see double  he then said he used often to see peoples doppelganger at another time as to ghosts he said he was like coleridge he had seen too many of em lest any weaker brethren should be caused to offend by the restricted oath which i have reported him using in a moment of transport it may be best to note here that i never heard him use any other imprecation and this one seldom  any grossness of speech was inconceivable of him now and then but only very rarely the human nature of some story unmeet for ladies was too much for his sense of humor and overcame him with amusement which he was willing to impart and did impart but so that mainly the human nature of it reached you in this he was like the other great cambridge men though he was opener than the others to contact with the commoner life he keenly delighted in every native and novel turn of phrase and he would not undervalue a vital word or a notion picked up out of the road even if it had some dirt sticking to it  he kept as close to the common life as a man of his patrician instincts and cloistered habits could i could go to him with any new find about it and be sure of delighting him after i began making my involuntary and all but unconscious studies of yankee character especially in the country he was always glad to talk them over with me still when i had discovered a new accent or turn of speech in the fields he had cultivated i was aware of a subtle grudge mingling with his pleasure but this was after all less envy than a fine regret  at the time i speak of there was certainly nothing in lowells dress or bearing that would have kept the common life aloof from him if that life were not always too proud to make advances to any one in this retrospect i see him in the sack coat and rough suit which he wore upon all outdoor occasions with heavy shoes and a round hat i never saw him with a high hat on till he came home after his diplomatic stay in london then he had become rather rigorously correct in his costume and as conventional as he had formerly been indifferent in both epochs he was apt to be gloved and the strong broad hands which left the sensation of their vigor for some time after they had clasped yours were notably white at the earlier period he still wore his auburn hair somewhat long it was darker than his beard which was branching and full and more strawcolored than auburn as were his thick eyebrows neither hair nor beard was then touched with gray as i now remember when he uncovered his straight wide white forehead showed itself one of the most beautiful that could be his eyes were gay with humor and alert with all intelligence he had an enchanting smile a laugh that was full of friendly joyousness and a voice that was exquisite music everything about him expressed his strenuous physical condition he would not wear an overcoat in the coldest cambridge weather at all times he moved vigorously and walked with a quick step lifting his feet well from the ground     vii  it gives me a pleasure which i am afraid i cannot impart to linger in this effort to materialize his presence from the fading memories of the past i am afraid i can as little impart a due sense of what he spiritually was to my knowledge it avails nothing for me to say that i think no man of my years and desert had ever so true and constant a friend he was both younger and older than i by insomuch as he was a poet through and through and had been out of college before i was born but he had already come to the age of selfdistrust when a man likes to take counsel with his juniors as with his elders and fancies he can correct his perspective by the test of their fresher vision besides lowell was most simply and pathetically reluctant to part with youth and was willing to cling to it wherever he found it he could not in any wise bear to be leftout when mr bret harte came to cambridge and the talk was all of the brilliant characterpoems with which he had then first dazzled the world lowell casually said with a most touching however ungrounded sense of obsolescence he could remember when the biglow papers were all the talk i need not declare that there was nothing ungenerous in that he was only too ready to hand down his laurels to a younger man but he wished to do it himself through the modesty that is always a quality of such a nature he was magnanimously sensitive to the appearance of fading interest he could not take it otherwise than as a proof of his fading power i had a curious hint of this when one year in making up the prospectus of the magazine for the next i omitted his name because i had nothing special to promise from him and because i was half ashamed to be always flourishing it in the eyes of the public i see that you have dropped me this year he wrote and i could see that it had hurt and i knew that he was glad to believe the truth when i told him  he did not care so much for popularity as for the praise of his friends if he liked you he wished you not only to like what he wrote but to say so he was himself most cordial in his recognition of the things that pleased him what happened to me from him happened to others and i am only describing his common habit when i say that nothing i did to his liking failed to bring me a spoken or oftener a written acknowledgment this continued to the latest years of his life when the effort even to give such pleasure must have cost him a physical pang  he was of a very catholic taste and he was apt to be carried away by a little touch of life or humor and to overvalue the piece in which he found it but mainly his judgments of letters and men were just one of the dangers of scholarship was a peculiar danger in the cambridge keeping but lowell was almost as averse as longfellow from contempt he could snub and pitilessly where he thought there was presumption and apparently sometimes merely because he was in the mood but i cannot remember ever to have heard him sneer he was often wonderfully patient of tiresome people and sometimes celestially insensible to vulgarity in spite of his reserve he really wished people to like him he was keenly alive to neighborly goodwill or illwill and when there was a question of widening elmwood avenue by taking part of his grounds he was keenly hurt by hearing that some one who lived near him had said he hoped the city would cut down lowells elms his english elms which his father had planted and with which he was himself almost one blood     viii  in the period of which i am speaking lowell was constantly writing and pretty constantly printing though still the superstition held that he was an idle man to this time belongs the publication of some of his finest poems if not their inception there were cases in which their inception dated far back even to ten or twenty years he wrote his poems at a heat and the manuscript which came to me for the magazine was usually the first draft very little corrected but if the cold fit took him quickly it might hold him so fast that he would leave the poem in abeyance till he could slowly live back to a liking for it  the most of his best prose belongs to the time between 1866 and 1874 and to this time we owe the several volumes of essays and criticisms called among my books and my study windows he wished to name these more soberly but at the urgence of his publishers he gave them titles which they thought would be attractive to the public though he felt that they took from the dignity of his work he was not a good business man in a literary way he submitted to others judgment in all such matters i doubt if he ever put a price upon anything he sold and i dare say he was usually surprised at the largeness of the price paid him but sometimes if his need was for a larger sum he thought it too little without reference to former payments this happened with a long poem in the atlantic which i had urged the countingroom authorities to deal handsomely with him for i did not know how many hundred they gave him and when i met him i ventured to express the hope that the publishers had done their part he held up four fingers quattro he said in italian and then added with a disappointment which he tried to smile away i thought they might have made it cinque  between me and me i thought quattro very well but probably lowell had in mind some end which cinque would have fitted better it was pretty sure to be an unselfish end a pleasure to some one dear to him a gift that he had wished to make long afterwards when i had been the means of getting him cinque for a poem onetenth the length he spoke of the payment to me it came very handily i had been wanting to give a watch  i do not believe at any time lowell was able to deal with money       like wealthy men not knowing what they give  more probably he felt a sacredness in the money got by literature which the literary man never quite rids him self of even when he is not a poet and which made him wish to dedicate it to something finer than the every day uses he lived very quietly but he had by no means more than he needed to live upon and at that time he had pecuniary losses he was writing hard and was doing full work in his harvard professorship and he was so far dependent upon his salary that he felt its absence for the year he went abroad i do not know quite how to express my sense of something unworldly of something almost womanlike in his relation to money  he was not only generous of money but he was generous of himself when he thought he could be of use or merely of encouragement he came all the way into boston to hear certain lectures of mine on the italian poets which he could not have found either edifying or amusing that he might testify his interest in me and show other people that they were worth coming to he would go carefully over a poem with me word by word and criticise every turn of phrase and after all be magnanimously tolerant of my sticking to phrasings that he disliked in a certain line       the silvern chords of the piano trembled  he objected to silvern why not silver i alleged leathern golden and like adjectives in defence of my word but still he found an affectation in it and suffered it to stand with extreme reluctance another line of another piece       and what she would would rather that she would not  he would by no means suffer he said that the stress falling on the last word made it publicschool english and he mocked it with the answer a maid had lately given him when he asked if the master of the house was at home she said no sir he is not when she ought to have said no sir he isnt he was appeased when i came back the next day with the stanza amended so that the verse could read       and what she would would rather she would not so  but i fancy he never quite forgave my word silvern yet he professed not to have prejudices in such matters but to use any word that would serve his turn without wincing and he certainly did use and defend words as undisprivacied and disnatured that made others wince  he was otherwise such a stickler for the best diction that he would not have had me use slovenly vernacular even in the dialogue in my stories my characters must not say they wanted to do so and so but wished and the like in a copy of one of my books which i found him reading i saw he had corrected my erring western woulds and shoulds as he grew old he was less and less able to restrain himself from setting people right to their faces once in the vast area of my ignorance he specified my small acquaintance with a certain period of english poetry saying youre rather shady there old fellow but he would not have had me too learned holding that he had himself been hurt for literature by his scholarship  his patience in analyzing my work with me might have been the easy effort of his habit of teaching and his willingness to give himself and his own was no doubt more signally attested in his asking a brother man of letters who wished to work up a subject in the college library to stay a fortnight in his house and to share his study his beloved study with him this must truly have cost him dear as any author of fixed habits will understand happily the man of letters was a good fellow and knew how to prize the favordone him but if he had been otherwise it would have been the same to lowell he not only endured but did many things for the weaker brethren which were amusing enough to one in the secret of his inward revolt yet in these things he was considerate also of the editor whom he might have made the sharer of his selfsacrifice and he seldom offered me manuscripts for others the only real burden of the kind that he put upon me was the diary of a virginian who had travelled in new england during the early thirties and had set down his impressions of men and manners there it began charmingly and went on very well under lowells discreet pruning but after a while he seemed to fall in love with the character of the diarist so much that he could not bear to cut anything    ix  he had a great tenderness for the broken and ruined south whose sins he felt that he had had his share in visiting upon her and he was willing to do what he could to ease her sorrows in the case of any particular southerner he could not help looking askance upon the dramatic shows of retribution which some of the northern politicians were working but with all his misgivings he continued to act with the republican party until after the election of hayes he was away from the country during the garfield campaign he was in fact one of the massachusetts electors chosen by the republican majority in 1816 and in that most painful hour when there was question of the policy and justice of counting hayes in for the presidency it was suggested by some of lowells friends that he should use the original right of the electors under the constitution and vote for tilden whom one vote would have chosen president over hayes after he had cast his vote for hayes he quietly referred to the matter one day in the moment of lighting his pipe with perhaps the faintest trace of indignation in his tone he said that whatever the first intent of the constitution was usage had made the presidential electors strictly the instruments of the party which chose them and that for him to have voted for tilden when he had been chosen to vote for hayes would havebeen an act of bad faith  he would have resumed for me all the old kindness of our relations before the recent year of his absence but this had inevitably worked a little estrangement he had at least lost the habit of me and that says much in such matters he was not so perfectly at rest in the cambridge environment in certain indefinable ways it did not so entirely suffice him though he would have been then and always the last to allow this i imagine his friends realized more than he that certain delicate but vital filaments of attachment had frayed and parted in alien air and left him heartloose as he had not been before  i do not know whether it crossed his mind after the election of hayes that he might be offered some place abroad but it certainly crossed the minds of some of his friends and i could not feel that i was acting for myself alone when i used a family connection with the president very early in his term to let him know that i believed lowell would accept a diplomatic mission i could assure him that i was writing wholly without lowells privity or authority and i got back such a letter as i could wish in its delicate sense of the situation the president said that he had already thought of offering lowell something and he gave me the pleasure a pleasure beyond any other i could imagine of asking lowell whether he would accept the mission to austria i lost no time carrying his letter to elmwood where i found lowell over his coffee at dinner he saw me at the threshold and called to me through the open door to come in and i handed him the letter and sat down at table while he ran it through when he had read it he gave a quick ah and threw it over the length of the table to mrs lowell she read it in a smiling and loyal reticence as if she would not say one word of all she might wish to say in urging his acceptance though i could see that she was intensely eager for it the whole situation was of a perfect new england character in its tacit significance after lowell had taken his coffee we turned into his study without further allusion to the matter  a day or two later he came to my house to say that he could not accept the austrian mission and to ask me to tell the president so for him and make his acknowledgments which he would also write himself he remained talking a little while of other things and when he rose to go he said with a sigh of vague reluctance i should like to see a play of calderon as if it had nothing to do with any wish of his that could still be fulfilled upon this hint i acted and in due time it was found in washington that the gentleman who had been offered the spanish mission would as lief go to austria and lowell was sent to madrid     x  when we met in london some years later he came almost every afternoon to my lodging and the story of our oldtime cambridge walks began again in london phrases there were not the vacant lots and outlying fields of his native place but we made shift with the vast simple parks and we walked on the grass as we could not have done in an american park and were glad to feel the earth under our feet i said how much it was like those earlier tramps and that pleased him for he wished whenever a thing delighted him to find a cambridge quality in it  but he was in love with everything english and was determined i should be so too beginning with the english weather which in summer cannot be overpraised he carried of course an umbrella but he would not put it up in the light showers that caught us at times saying that the english rain never wetted you the thick short turf delighted him he would scarcely allow that the trees were the worse for foliage blighted by a vile easterly storm in the spring of that year the tender air the delicate veils that the moisture in it cast about all objects at the least remove the soft colors of the flowers the dull blue of the low sky showing through the rifts of the dirty white clouds the hovering pall of london smoke were all dear to him and he was anxious that i should not lose anything of their charm  he was anxious that i should not miss the value of anything in england and while he volunteered that the aristocracy had the corruptions of aristocracies everywhere he insisted upon my respectful interest in it because it was so historical perhaps there was a touch of irony in this demand but it is certain that he was very happy in england he had come of the age when a man likes smooth warm keeping in which he need make no struggle for his comfort disciplined and obsequious service society perfectly ascertained within the larger society which we call civilization and in an alien environment for which he was in no wise responsible he could have these without a pang of the selfreproach which at home makes a man unhappy amidst his luxuries when he considers their cost to others he had a position which forbade thought of unfairness in the conditions he must not wake because of the slave it was his duty to sleep besides at that time lowell needed all the rest he could get for he had lately passed through trials such as break the strength of men and how them with premature age he was living alone in his little house in lowndes square and mrs lowell was in the country slowly recovering from the effects of the terrible typhus which she had barely survived in madrid he was yet so near the anguish of that experience that he told me he had still in his nerves the expectation of a certain agonized cry from her which used to rend them but he said he had adjusted himself to this and he went on to speak with a patience which was more affecting in him than in men of more phlegmatic temperament of how we were able to adjust ourselves to all our trials and to the constant presence of pain he said he was never free of a certain distress which was often a sharp pang in one of his shoulders but his physique had established such relations with it that though he was never unconscious of it he was able to endure it without a recognition of it as suffering  he seemed to me however very well and at his age of sixtythree i could not see that he was less alert and vigorous than he was when i first knew him in cambridge he had the same brisk light step and though his beard was well whitened and his auburn hair had grown ashen through the red his face had the freshness and his eyes the clearness of a young mans i suppose the novelty of his life kept him from thinking about his years or perhaps in contact with those great insenescent englishmen he could not feel himself old at any rate he did not once speak of age as he used to do ten years earlier and i then half through my forties was still you young dog to him it was a bright and cheerful renewal of the early kindliness between us on which indeed there had never been a shadow except such as distance throws he wished apparently to do everything he could to assure us of his personal interest and we were amused to find him nervously apprehensive of any purpose such as was far from us to profit by him officially he betrayed a distinct relief when he found we were not going to come upon him even for admissions to the houses of parliament which we were to see by means of an english acquaintance he had not perhaps found some other fellowcitizens so considerate he dreaded the halfduties of his place like presentations to the queen and complained of the cheap ambitions he had to gratify in that way  he was so eager to have me like england in every way and seemed so fond of the english that i thought it best to ask him whether he minded my quoting in a paper about lexington which i was just then going to print in a london magazine some humorous lines of his expressing the mounting satisfaction of an imaginary yankee storyteller who has the old fight terminate in lord percys coming       to hammer stone for life in concord jail  it had occurred to me that it might possibly embarrass him to have this patriotic picture presented to a public which could not take our fourth of july pleasure in it and i offered to suppress it as i did afterwards quite for literary reasons he said no let it stand and let them make the worst of it and i fancy that much of his success with a people who are not gingerly with other peoples sensibilities came from the frankness with which he trampled on their prejudice when he chose he said he always told them when there was question of such things that the best society he had ever known was in cambridge massachusetts he contended that the best english was spoken there and so it was when he spoke it  we were in london out of the season and he was sorry that he could not have me meet some titles who he declared had found pleasure in my books when we returned from italy in the following june he was prompt to do me this honor i dare say he wished me to feel it to its last implication and i did my best but there was nothing in the evening i enjoyed so much as his coming up to mrs lowell at the close when there was only a title or two left and saying to her as he would have said to her at elmwood where she would have personally planned it fanny that was a fine dinner you gave us of course this was in a tender burlesque but it remains the supreme impression of what seemed to me a cloudlessly happy period for lowell his wife was quite recovered of her long suffering and was again at the head of his house sharing in his pleasures and enjoying his successes for his sake successes so great that people spoke of him seriously as an addition to society in london where one man more or less seemed like a drop in the sea she was a woman perfectly of the new england type and tradition almost repellantly shy at first and almost glacially cold with new acquaintance but afterwards very sweet and cordial she was of a dark beauty with a regular face of the spanish outline lowell was of an ideal manner towards her and of an admiration which delicately travestied itself and which she knew how to receive with smiling irony after her death which occurred while he was still in england he never spoke of her to me though before that he used to be always bringing her name in with a young loverlike fondness     xi  in the hurry of the london season i did not see so much of lowell on our second sojourn as on our first but once when we were alone in his study there was a return to the terms of the old meetings in cambridge he smoked his pipe and sat by his fire and philosophized and but for the great london sea swirling outside and bursting through our shelter and dashing him with notes that must be instantly answered it was a very fair image of the past he wanted to tell me about his coachman whom he had got at on his human side with great liking and amusement and there was a patient gentleness in his manner with the footman who had to keep coming in upon him with those notes which was like the echo of his young faith in the equality of men but he always distinguished between the simple unconscious equality of the ordinary american and its assumption by a foreigner he said he did not mind such an americans coming into his house with his hat on but if a german or englishman did it he wanted to knock it off he was apt to be rather punctilious in his shows of deference towards others and at one time he practised removing his own hat when he went into shops in cambridge it must have mystified the cambridge salesmen and i doubt if he kept it up  with reference to the doctrine of his young poetry the fierce and the tender humanity of his storm and stress period i fancy a kind of baffle in lowell which i should not perhaps find it easy to prove i never knew him by word or hint to renounce this doctrine but he could not come to seventy years without having seen many high hopes fade and known many inspired prophecies fail when we have done our best to make the world over we are apt to be dismayed by finding it in much the old shape as he said of the moral government of the universe the scale is so vast and a little difference a little change for the better is scarcely perceptible to the eager consciousness of the wholesale reformer but with whatever sense of disappointment of doubt as to his own deeds for truer freedom and for better conditions i believe his sympathy was still with those who had some heart for hoping and striving i am sure that though he did not agree with me in some of my own later notions for the redemption of the race he did not like me the less but rather the more because to my own great surprise i confess i had now and then the courage of my convictions both literary and social  he was probably most at odds with me in regard to my theories of fiction though he persisted in declaring his pleasure in my own fiction he was in fact by nature and tradition thoroughly romantic and he could not or would not suffer realism in any but a friend he steadfastly refused even to read the russian masters to his immense loss as i tried to persuade him and even among the modern spaniards for whom he might have had a sort of personal kindness from his love of cervantes he chose one for his praise the least worthy of it and bore me down with his heavier metal in argument when i opposed to alarcons factitiousness the delightful genuineness of valdes ibsen with all the norwegians he put far from him he would no more know them than the russians the french naturalists he abhorred i thought him all wrong but you do not try improving your elders when they have come to three score and ten years and i would rather have had his affection unbroken by our difference of opinion than a perfect agreement where he even imagined that this difference could work me harm he was anxious to have me know that he meant me none and he was at the trouble to write me a letter when a boston paper had perverted its report of what he said in a public lecture to my disadvantage and to assure me that he had not me in mind when once he had given his liking he could not bear that any shadow of change should seem to have come upon him he had a most beautiful and endearing ideal of friendship he desired to affirm it and to reaffirm it as often as occasion offered and if occasion did not offer he made occasion it did not matter what you said or did that contraried him if he thought he had essentially divined you you were still the same and on his part he was by no means exacting of equal demonstration but seemed not even to wish it     xii  after he was replaced at london by a minister more immediately representative of the democratic administration he came home he made a brave show of not caring to have remained away but in truth he had become very fond of england where he had made so many friends and where the distinction he had in that comfortably padded environment was so agreeable to him  it would have been like him to have secretly hoped that the new president might keep him in london but he never betrayed any ignoble disappointment and he would not join in any blame of him at our first meeting after he came home he spoke of the movement which had made mr cleveland president and said he supposed that if he had been here he should have been in it all his friends were he added a little helplessly but he seemed not to dislike my saying i knew one of his friends who was not in fact as i have told he never disliked a plump differenceunless he disliked the differer  for several years he went back to england every summer and it was not until he took up his abode at elmwood again that he spent a whole year at home one winter he passed at his sisters home in boston but mostly he lived with his daughter at southborough i have heard a story of his going to elmwood soon after his return in 1885 and sitting down in his old study where he declared with tears that the place was full of ghosts but four or five years later it was well for family reasons that he should live there and about the same time it happened that i had taken a house for the summer in his neighborhood he came to see me and to assure me in all tacit forms of his sympathy in a sorrow for which there could be no help but it was not possible that the old intimate relations should be resumed the affection was there as much on his side as on mine i believe but he was now an old man and i was an elderly man and we could not without insincerity approach each other in the things that had drawn us together in earlier and happier years his course was run my own in which he had taken such a generous pleasure could scarcely move his jaded interest his life so far as it remained to him had renewed itself in other air the later friendships beyond seas sufficed him and were without the pang without the effort that must attend the knitting up of frayed ties here  he could never have been anything but american if he had tried and he certainly never tried but he certainly did not return to the outward simplicities of his life as i first knew it there was no more roundhatandsackcoat business for him he wore a frock and a high hat and whatever else was rather like london than cambridge i do not know but drab gaiters sometimes added to the effect of a gentleman of the old school which he now produced upon the witness some fastidiousnesses showed themselves in him which were not so surprising he complained of the american lower class manner the conductor and cabman would be kind to you but they would not be respectful and he could not see the fun of this in the old way early in our acquaintance he rather stupified me by saying i like you because you dont put your hands on me and i heard of his consenting to some sort of reception in those last years yes if they wont shake hands  ever since his visit to rome in 1875 he had let his heavy mustache grow long till it dropped below the corners of his beard which was now almost white his face had lost the ruddy hue so characteristic of him i fancy he was then ailing with premonitions of the disorder which a few years later proved mortal but he still bore himself with sufficient vigor and he walked the distance between his house and mine though once when i missed his visit the family reported that after he came in he sat a long time with scarcely a word as if too weary to talk that winter i went into boston to live and i saw him only at infrequent intervals when i could go out to elmwood at such times i found him sitting in the room which was formerly the drawingroom but which had been joined with his study by taking away the partitions beside the heavy mass of the old colonial chimney he told me that when he was a newborn babe the nurse had carried him round this chimney for luck and now in front of the same hearth the white old man stretched himself in an easychair with his writingpad on his knees and his books on the table at his elbow and was willing to be entreated not to rise i remember the sun used to come in at the eastern windows full pour and bathe the air in its warmth  he always hailed me gayly and if i found him with letters newly come from england as i sometimes did he glowed and sparkled with fresh life he wanted to read passages from those letters he wanted to talk about their writers and to make me feel their worth and charm as he did he still dreamed of going back to england the next summer but that was not to be one day he received me not less gayly than usual but with a certain excitement and began to tell me about an odd experience he had had not at all painful but which had very much mystified him he had since seen the doctor and the doctor had assured him that there was nothing alarming in what had happened and in recalling this assurance he began to look at the humorous aspects of the case and to make some jokes about it he wished to talk of it as men do of their maladies and very fully and i gave him such proof of my interest as even inviting him to talk of it would convey in spite of the doctors assurance and his joyful acceptance of it i doubt if at the bottom of his heart there was not the stir of an uneasy misgiving but he had not for a long time shown himself so cheerful  it was the beginning of the end he recovered and relapsed and recovered again but never for long late in the spring i came out and he had me stay to dinner which was somehow as it used to be at two oclock and after dinner we went out on his lawn he got a longhandled spud and tried to grub up some dandelions which he found in his turf but after a moment or two he threw it down and put his hand upon his back with a groan i did not see him again till i came out to take leave of him before going away for the summer and then i found him sitting on the little porch in a western corner of his house with a volume of scott closed upon his finger there were some other people and our meeting was with the constraint of their presence it was natural in nothing so much as his saying very significantly to me as if he knew of my heresies concerning scott and would have me know he did not approve of them that there was nothing he now found so much pleasure in as scotts novels another friend equally heretical was by but neither of us attempted to gainsay him lowell talked very little but he told of having been a walk to beaver brook and of having wished to jump from one stone to another in the stream and of having had to give it up he said without completing the sentence if it had come to that with him then he fell silent again and with some vain talk of seeing him when i came back in the fall i went away sick at heart i was not to see him again and i shall not look upon his like  i am aware that i have here shown him from this point and from that in a series of sketches which perhaps collectively impart but do not assemble his personality in one impression he did not indeed make one impression upon me but a thousand impressions which i should seek in vain to embody in a single presentment what i have cloudily before me is the vision of a very lofty and simple soul perplexed and as it were surprised and even dismayed at the complexity of the effects from motives so single in it but escaping always to a clear expression of what was noblest and loveliest in itself at the supreme moments in the divine exigencies i believe neither in heroes nor in saints but i believe in great and good men for i have known them and among such men lowell was of the richest nature i have known his nature was not always serene or pellucid it was sometimes roiled by the currents that counter and cross in all of us but it was without the least alloy of insincerity and it was never darkened by the shadow of a selfish fear his genius was an instrument that responded in affluent harmony to the power that made him a humorist and that made him a poet and appointed him rarely to be quite either alone     etext editors bookmarks     i believe neither in heroes nor in saints    it is well to hold ones country to her promises    liked being with you not for what he got but for what he gave
