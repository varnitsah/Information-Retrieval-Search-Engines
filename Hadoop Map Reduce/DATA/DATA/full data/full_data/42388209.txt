42388209	passages from the american notebooks volume ii  by nathaniel hawthorne    extracts from his private letters   brook farm oak hill april 13th 1841    here i am in a polar paradise  i know not how to interpret this aspect of naturewhether it be of good or evil omen to our enterprise  but i reflect that the plymouth pilgrims arrived in the midst of storm and stepped ashore upon mountain snowdrifts and nevertheless they prospered and became a great peopleand doubtless it will be the same with us  i laud my stars however that you will not have your first impressions of perhaps our future home from such a day as this    through faith i persist in believing that spring and summer will come in their due season but the unregenerated man shivers within me and suggests a doubt whether i may not have wandered within the precincts of the arctic circle and chosen my heritage among everlasting snows    provide yourself with a good stock of furs and if you can obtain the skin of a polar bear you will find it a very suitable summer dress for this region     i have not yet taken my first lesson in agriculture except that i went to see our cows foddered yesterday afternoon  we have eight of our own and the number is now increased by a transcendental heifer belonging to miss margaret fuller  she is very fractious i believe and apt to kick over the milkpail    i intend to convert myself into a milkmaid this evening but i pray heaven that mr ripley may be moved to assign me the kindliest cow in the herd otherwise i shall perform my duty with fear and trembling     i like my brethren in affliction very well and could you see us sitting round our table at mealtimes before the great kitchen fire you would call it a cheerful sight  mrs b is a most comfortable woman to behold  she looks as if her ample person were stuffed full of tendernessindeed as if she were all one great kind heart                                       april 14th 10 a m    i did not milk the cows last night because mr ripley was afraid to trust them to my hands or me to their horns i know not which  but this morning i have done wonders  before breakfast i went out to the barn and began to chop hay for the cattle and with such righteous vehemence as mr ripley says did i labor that in the space of ten minutes i broke the machine  then i brought wood and replenished the fires and finally went down to breakfast and ate up a huge mound of buckwheat cakes  after breakfast mr ripley put a fourpronged instrument into my hands which he gave me to understand was called a pitchfork and he and mr farley being armed with similar weapons we all three commenced a gallant attack upon a heap of manure this office being concluded and i having purified myself i sit down to finish this letter     miss fullers cow hooks the other cows and has made herself ruler of the herd and behaves in a very tyrannical manner    i shall make an excellent husbandmani feel the original adam reviving within me   april 16th    since i last wrote there has been an addition to our community of four gentlemen in sables who promise to be among our most useful and respectable members  they arrived yesterday about noon mr ripley had proposed to them to join us no longer ago than that very morning  i had some conversation with them in the afternoon and was glad to hear them express much satisfaction with their new abode and all the arrangements  they do not appear to be very communicative however or perhaps it may be merely an external reserve like my own to shield their delicacy  several of their prominent characteristics as well as their black attire lead me to believe that they are members of the clerical profession but i have not yet ascertained from their own lips what has been the nature of their past lives  i trust to have much pleasure in their society and sooner or later that we shall all of us derive great strength from our intercourse with them  i cannot too highly applaud the readiness with which these four gentlemen in black have thrown aside all the fopperies and flummeries which have their origin in a false state of society  when i last saw them they looked as heroically regardless of the stains and soils incident to our profession as i did when i emerged from the goldmine     i have milked a cow     the herd has rebelled against the usurpation of miss fullers heifer and whenever they are turned out of the barn she is compelled to take refuge under our protection  so much did she impede my labors by keeping close to me that i found it necessary to give her two or three gentle pats with a shovel but still she preferred to trust herself to my tender mercies rather than venture among the horns of the herd  she is not an amiable cow but she has a very intelligent face and seems to be of a reflective cast of character i doubt not that she will soon perceive the expediency of being on good terms with the rest of the sisterhood  i have not yet been twenty yards from our house and barn but i begin to perceive that this is a beautiful place  the scenery is of a mild and placid character with nothing bold in its aspect but i think its beauties will grow upon us and make us love it the more the longer we live here  there is a brook so near the house that we shall be able to hear its ripple in the summer evenings     but for agricultural purposes it has been made to flow in a straight and rectangular fashion which does it infinite damage as a picturesque object     it was a moment or two before i could think whom you meant by mr dismal view  why he is one of the best of the brotherhood so far as cheerfulness goes for if he do not laugh himself he makes the rest of us laugh continually  he is the quaintest and queerest personage you ever sawfull of dry jokes the humor of which is so incorporated with the strange twistifications of his physiognomy that his sayings ought to be written down accompanied with illustrations by cruikshank  then he keeps quoting innumerable scraps of latin and makes classical allusions while we are turning over the goldmine and the contrast between the nature of his employment and the character of his thoughts is irresistibly ludicrous  i have written this epistle in the parlor while farmer ripley and farmer farley and farmer dismal view were talking about their agricultural concerns  so you will not wonder if it is not a classical piece of composition either in point of thought or expression                                       mr ripley has bought four black pigs   april 22d    what an abominable hand do i scribble  but i have been chopping wood and turning a grindstone all the forenoon and such occupations are apt to disturb the equilibrium of the muscles and sinews it is an endless surprise to me how much work there is to be done in the world but thank god i am able to do my share of itand my ability increases daily  what a great broadshouldered elephantine personage i shall become by and by  i milked two cows this morning and would send you some of the milk only that it is mingled with that which was drawn forth by mr dismal view and the rest of the brethren   april 28th    i was caught by a cold during my visit to boston it has not affected my whole frame but took entire possession of my head as being the weakest and most vulnerable part  never did anybody sneeze with such vehemence and frequency and my poor brain has been in a thick fog or rather it seemed as if my head were stuffed with coarse wool    sometimes i wanted to wrench it off and give it a great kick like a football  this annoyance has made me endure the bad weather with even less than ordinary patience and my faith was so far exhausted that when they told me yesterday that the sun was setting clear i would not even turn my eyes towards the west  but this morning i am made all over anew and have no greater remnant of my cold than will serve as an excuse for doing no work today  the family has been dismal and dolorous throughout the storm  the night before last william allen was stung by a wasp on the eyelid whereupon the whole side of his face swelled to an enormous magnitude so that at the breakfasttable one half of him looked like a blind giant the eye being closed and the other half had such a sorrowful and ludicrous aspect that i was constrained to laugh out of sheer pity  the same day a colony of wasps was discovered in my chamber where they had remained throughout the winter and were now just bestirring themselves doubtless with the intention of stinging me from head to foot  a similar discovery was made in mr farleys room  in short we seem to have taken up our abode in a wasps nest  thus you see a rural life is not one of unbroken quiet and serenity  if the middle of the day prove warm and pleasant i promise myself to take a walk    i have taken one walk with mr farley and i could not have believed that there was such seclusion at so short a distance from a great city  many spots seem hardly to have been visited for agesnot since john eliot preached to the indians here  if we were to travel a thousand miles we could not escape the world more completely than we can here                                       i read no newspapers and hardly remember who is president and feel as if i had no more concern with what other people trouble themselves about than if i dwelt in another planet   may 1st    every day of my life makes me feel more and more how seldom a fact is accurately stated how almost invariably when a story has passed through the mind of a third person it becomes so far as regards the impression that it makes in further repetitions little better than a falsehood and this too though the narrator be the most truthseeking person in existence  how marvellous the tendency is     is truth a fantasy which we are to pursue forever and never grasp                                       my cold has almost entirely departed  were it a sunny day i should consider myself quite fit for labor out of doors but as the ground is so damp and the atmosphere so chill and the sky so sullen i intend to keep myself on the sicklist this one day longer more especially as i wish to read carlyle on heroes                                       there has been but one flower found in this vicinityand that was an anemone a poor pale shivering little flower that had crept under a stonewall for shelter  mr farley found it while taking a walk with me      this is mayday  alas what a difference between the ideal and the real   may 4th    my cold no longer troubles me and all the morning i have been at work under the clear blue sky on a hillside  sometimes it almost seemed as if i were at work in the sky itself though the material in which i wrought was the ore from our goldmine  nevertheless there is nothing so unseemly and disagreeable in this sort of toil as you could think  it defiles the hands indeed but not the soul  this gold ore is a pure and wholesome substance else our mother nature would not devour it so readily and derive so much nourishment from it and return such a rich abundance of good grain and roots in requital of it  the farm is growing very beautiful nownot that we yet see anything of the peas and potatoes which we have planted but the grass blushes green on the slopes and hollows  i wrote that word blush almost unconsciously so we will let it go as an inspired utterance  when i go forth afield     i look beneath the stonewalls where the verdure is richest in hopes that a little company of violets or some solitary bud prophetic of the summer may be there    but not a wildflower have i yet found  one of the boys gathered some yellow cowslips last sunday but i am well content not to have found them for they are not precisely what i should like to send to you though they deserve honor and praise because they come to us when no others will we have our parlor here dressed in evergreen as at christmas  that beautiful little flowervase     stands on mr ripleys studytable at which i am now writing  it contains some daffodils and some willowblossoms  i brought it here rather than keep it in my chamber because i never sit there and it gives me many pleasant emotions to look round and be surprisedfor it is often a surprise though i well know that it is thereby something connected with the idea of a friend                                       i do not believe that i should be patient here if i were not engaged in a righteous and heavenblessed way of life  when i was in the customhouse and then at salem i was not half so patient     we had some tableaux last evening the principal characters being sustained by mr farley and miss ellen slade  they went off very well     i fear it is time for mesodcompelling as i amto take the field again   may 11th    this morning i arose at milkingtime in good trim for work and we have been employed partly in an augean labor of clearing out a woodshed and partly in carting loads of oak  this afternoon i hope to have something to do in the field for these jobs about the house are not at all to my taste   june 1st    i have been too busy to write a long letter by this opportunity for i think this present life of mine gives me an antipathy to pen and ink even more than my customhouse experience did    in the midst of toil or after a hard days work in the goldmine my soul obstinately refuses to be poured out on paper  that abominable goldmine  thank god we anticipate getting rid of its treasures in the course of two or three days  of all hateful places that is the worst and i shall never comfort myself for having spent so many days of blessed sunshine there  it is my opinion that a mans soul may be buried and perish under a dungheap or in a furrow of the field just as well as under a pile of money  mr george bradford will probably be here today so that there will be no danger of my being under the necessity of laboring more than i like hereafter  meantime my health is perfect and my spirits buoyant even in the goldmine   august 12th    i am very well and not at all weary for yesterdays rain gave us a holiday and moreover the labors of the farm are not so pressing as they have been  and joyful thought in a little more than a fortnight i shall be free from my bondage    free to enjoy naturefree to think and feel     even my customhouse experience was not such a thraldom and weariness my mind and heart were free  o labor is the curse of the world and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionably brutified  is it a praiseworthy matter that i have spent five golden months in providing food for cows and horses  it is not so   august 18thi am very well only somewhat tired with walking half a dozen miles immediately after breakfast and raking hay ever since  we shall quite finish haying this week and then there will be no more very hard or constant labor during the one other week that i shall remain a slave   august 22d    i had an indispensable engagement in the beanfield whither indeed i was glad to betake myself in order to escape a parting scene with   he was quite out of his wits the night before and i sat up with him till long past midnight  the farm is pleasanter now that he is gone for his unappeasable wretchedness threw a gloom over everything  since i last wrote we have done haying and the remainder of my bondage will probably be light  it will be a long time however before i shall know how to make a good use of leisure either as regards enjoyment or literary occupation     it is extremely doubtful whether mr ripley will succeed in locating his community on this farm  he can bring mr e to no terms and the more they talk about the matter the further they appear to be from a settlement  we must form other plans for ourselves for i can see few or no signs that providence purposes to give us a home here  i am weary weary thrice weary of waiting so many ages  whatever may be my gifts i have not hitherto shown a single one that may avail to gather gold  i confess that i have strong hopes of good from this arrangement with m but when i look at the scanty avails of my past literary efforts i do not feel authorized to expect much from the future  well we shall see  other persons have bought large estates and built splendid mansions with such little books as i mean to write so that perhaps it is not unreasonable to hope that mine may enable me to build a little cottage or at least to buy or hire one  but i am becoming more and more convinced that we must not lean upon this community  whatever is to be done must be done by my own undivided strength  i shall not remain here through the winter unless with an absolute certainty that there will be a house ready for us in the spring  otherwise i shall return to bostonstill however considering myself an associate of the community so that we may take advantage of any more favorable aspect of affairs  how much depends on these little books  methinks if anything could draw out my whole strength it would be the motives that now press upon me  yet after all i must keep these considerations out of my mind because an external pressure always disturbs instead of assisting me   salem september 3d    but really i should judge it to be twenty years since i left brook farm and i take this to be one proof that my life there was an unnatural and unsuitable and therefore an unreal one it already looks like a dream behind me  the real me was never an associate of the community there has been a spectral appearance there sounding the horn at daybreak and milking the cows and hoeing potatoes and raking hay toiling in the sun and doing me the honor to assume my name  but this spectre was not myself  nevertheless it is somewhat remarkable that my hands have during the past summer grown very brown and rough insomuch that many people persist in believing that i after all was the aforesaid spectral hornsounder cowmilker potatohoer and hayraker  but such people do not know a reality from a shadow enough of nonsense  i know not exactly how soon i shall return to the farm  perhaps not sooner than a fortnight from tomorrow   salem september 14th    master cheever is a very good subject for a sketch especially if he be portrayed in the very act of executing judgment on an evildoer  the little urchin may be laid across his knee and his arms and legs and whole person indeed should be flying all abroad in an agony of nervous excitement and corporeal smart  the master on the other hand must be calm rigid without anger or pity the very personification of that immitigable law whereby suffering follows sin  meantime the lions head should have a sort of sly twist on one side of its mouth and a wink of one eye in order to give the impression that after all the crime and the punishment are neither of them the most serious things in the world  i could draw the sketch myself if i had but the use of s magic fingers  then the acadians will do very well for the second sketch  they might be represented as just landing on the wharf or as presenting themselves before governor shirley seated in the great chair  another subject might be old cotton mather venerable in a threecornered hat and other antique attire walking the streets of boston and lifting up his hands to bless the people while they all revile him  an old dame should be seen flinging water or emptying some vials of medicine on his head from the latticed window of an oldfashioned house and all around must be tokens of pestilence and mourningas a coffin borne alonga woman or children weeping on a doorstep  can the tolling of the old south bell be painted  if not this then the military council holden at boston by the earl of loudon and other captains and governors might be taken his lordship in the great chair an oldfashioned military figure with a star on his breast  some of louis xvs commanders will give the costume  on the table and scattered about the room must be symbols of warfareswords pistols plumed hats a drum trumpet and rolledup banner in one leap it were not amiss to introduce the armed figure of an indian chief as taking part in the councilor standing apart from the english erect and stern  now for liberty tree  there is an engraving of that famous vegetable in snows history of boston  if represented i see not what scene can be beneath it save poor mr oliver taking the oath  he must have on a bagwig ruffled sleeves embroidered coat and all such ornaments because he is the representative of aristocracy and an artificial system the people may be as rough and wild as the fancy can make them nevertheless there must be one or two grave puritanical figures in the midst  such an one might sit in the great chair and be an emblem of that stern considerate spirit which brought about the revolution  but this would be a hard subject  but what a dolt am i to obtrude my counsel      september 16th    i do not very well recollect monsieur du miroir but as to mrs bullfrog i give her up to the severest reprehension the story was written as a mere experiment in that style it did not come from any depth within meneither my heart nor mind had anything to do with it  i recollect that the man of adamant seemed a fine idea to nee when i looked at it prophetically but i failed in giving shape and substance to the vision which i saw  i dont think it can be very good     i cannot believe all these stories about  because such a rascal never could be sustained and countenanced by respectable men  i take him to be neither better nor worse than the average of his tribe  however i intend to have all my copyrights taken out in my own name and if he cheat me once i will have nothing more to do with him but will straightway be cheated by some other publisherthat being of course the only alternative  governor shirleys young french wife might be the subject of one of the cuts  she should sit in the great chairperhaps with a dressingglass before herand arrayed in all manner of fantastic finery and with an outre french air while the old governor is leaning fondly over her and a puritanic councillor or two are manifesting their disgust in the background  a negro footman and a french waitingmaid might be in attendance  in liberty tree might be a vignette representing the chair in a very shattered battered and forlorn condition after it had been ejected from hutchinsons house  this would serve to impress the reader with the woful vicissitudes of sublunary things     did you ever behold such a vile scribble as i write since i became a farmer  my chirography always was abominable but now it is outrageous   brook farm september 22d 1841    here i am again slowly adapting myself to the life of this queer community whence i seem to have been absent half a lifetime so utterly have i grown apart from the spirit and manners of the place    i was most kindly received and the fields and woods looked very pleasant in the bright sunshine of the day before yesterday  i have a friendlier disposition towards the farm now that i am no longer obliged to toil in its stubborn furrows yesterday and today however the weather has been intolerablecold chill sullen so that it is impossible to be on kindly terms with mother nature     i doubt whether i shall succeed in writing another volume of grandfathers library while i remain here  i have not the sense of perfect seclusion which has always been essential to my power of producing anything  it is true nobody intrudes into my room but still i cannot be quiet  nothing here is settled everything is but beginning to arrange itself and though i would seem to have little to do with aught beside my own thoughts still i cannot but partake of the ferment around me  my mind will not be abstracted  i must observe and think and feel and content myself with catching glimpses of things which may be wrought out hereafter  perhaps it will be quite as well that i find myself unable to set seriously about literary occupation for the present it will be good to have a longer interval between my labor of the body and that of the mind  i shall work to the better purpose after the beginning of november  meantime i shall see these people and their enterprise under a new point of view and perhaps be able to determine whether we have any call to cast in our lot among them                                       i do wish the weather would put off this sulky mood  had it not been for the warmth and brightness of monday when i arrived here i should have supposed that all sunshine had left brook farm forever  i have no disposition to take long walks in such a state of the sky nor have i any buoyancy of spirit  i am a very dull person just at this time   september 25th    one thing is certain  i cannot and will not spend the winter here  the time would be absolutely thrown away so far as regards any literary labor to be performed     the intrusion of an outward necessity into labors of the imagination and intellect is to me very painful     i had rather a pleasant walk to a distant meadow a day or two ago and we found white and purple grapes in great abundance ripe and gushing with rich pure juice when the hand pressed the clusters  did you know what treasures of wild grapes there are in this land  if we dwell here we will make our own wine      september 27th    now as to the affair with  i fully confide in your opinion that he intends to make an unequal bargain with poor simple innocent menever having doubted this myself  but how is he to accomplish it  i am not nor shall be the least in his power whereas he is to a certain extent in mine  he might announce his projected library with me for the editor in all the newspapers in the universe but still i could not be bound to become the editor unless by my own act nor should i have the slightest scruple in refusing to be so at the last moment if he persisted in treating me with injustice  then as for his printing grandfathers chair i have the copyright in my own hands and could and would prevent the sale or make him account to me for the profits in case of need  meantime he is making arrangements for publishing the library contracting with other booksellers and with printers and engravers and with every step making it more difficult for himself to draw back  i on the other hand do nothing which i should not do if the affair with  were at an end for if i write a book it will be just as available for some other publisher as for him instead of getting me into his power by this delay he has trusted to my ignorance and simplicity and has put himself in my power  he is not insensible of this  at our last interview he himself introduced the subject of the bargain and appeared desirous to close it but i was not preparedamong other reasons because i do not yet see what materials i shall have for the republications in the library the works that he has shown me being ill adapted for that purpose and i wish first to see some french and german books which he has sent for to new york  and before concluding the bargain i have promised george hillard to consult him and let him do the business  is not this consummate discretion and am i not perfectly safe     i look at the matter with perfect composure and see all round my own position and know that it is impregnable                                       i was elected to two high offices last nightviz to be a trustee of the brook farm estate and chairman of the committee of finance     from the nature of my office i shall have the chief direction of all the money affairs of the community the making of bargains the supervision of receipts and expenditures etc etc etc     my accession to these august offices does not at all decide the question of my remaining here permanently  i told mr ripley that i could not spend the winter at the farm and that it was quite uncertain whether i returned in the spring     take no part i beseech you in these magnetic miracles  i am unwilling that a power should be exercised on you of which we know neither the origin nor consequence and the phenomena of which seem rather calculated to bewilder us than to teach us any truths about the present or future state of being    supposing that the power arises from the transfusion of one spirit into another it seems to me that the sacredness of an individual is violated by it there would be an intruder into the holy of holies    i have no faith whatever that people are raised to the seventh heaven or to any heaven at all or that they gain any insight into the mysteries of life beyond death by means of this strange science  without distrusting that the phenomena have really occurred i think that they are to be accounted for as the result of a material and physical not of a spiritual influence  opium has produced many a brighter vision of heaven i fancy and just as susceptible of proof as these  they are dreams    and what delusion can be more lamentable and mischievous than to mistake the physical and material for the spiritual what so miserable as to lose the souls true though hidden knowledge and consciousness of heaven in the mist of an earthborn vision  if we would know what heaven is before we come thither let us retire into the depths of our own spirits and we shall find it there among holy thoughts and feelings but let us not degrade high heaven and its inhabitants into any such symbols and forms as miss l describes do not let an earthly effluence from mrs ps corporeal system bewilder and perhaps contaminate something spiritual and sacred i should as soon think of seeking revelations of the future state in the rottenness of the gravewhere so many do seek it     the view which i take of this matter is caused by no want of faith in mysteries but from a deep reverence of the soul and of the mysteries which it knows within itself but never transmits to the earthly eye and ear  keep the imagination sanethat is one of the truest conditions of communion with heaven   brook farm september 26tha walk this morning along the needham road a clear breezy morning after nearly a week of cloudy and showery weather  the grass is much more fresh and vivid than it was last month and trees still retain much of their verdure though here and there is a shrub or a bough arrayed in scarlet and gold  along the road in the midst of a beaten track i saw mushrooms or toadstools which had sprung up probably during the night  the houses in this vicinity are many of them quite antique with long sloping roots commencing at a few feet from the ground and ending in a lofty peak  some of them have huge old elms overshadowing the yard  one may see the family sleigh near the door it having stood there all through the summer sunshine and perhaps with weeds sprouting through the crevices of its bottom the growth of the months since snow departed old barns patched and supported by timbers leaning against the sides and stained with the excrement of past ages  in the forenoon i walked along the edge of the meadow towards cow island large trees almost a wood principally of pine with the green pastureglades intermixed and cattle feeding  they cease grazing when an intruder appears and look at him with long and wary observation then bend their heads to the pasture again  where the firm ground of the pasture ceases the meadow begins loose spongy yielding to the tread sometimes permitting the foot to sink into black mud or perhaps over ankles in water  cattlepaths somewhat firmer than the general surface traverse the dense shrubbery which has overgrown the meadow  this shrubbery consists of small birch elders maples and other trees with here and there whitepines of larger growth  the whole is tangled and wild and thickset so that it is necessary to part the nestling stems and branches and go crashing through  there are creeping plants of various sorts which clamber up the trees and some of them have changed color in the slight frosts which already have befallen these low grounds so that one sees a spiral wreath of scarlet leaves twining up to the top of a green tree intermingling its bright hues with their verdure as if all were of one piece  sometimes instead of scarlet the spiral wreath is of a golden yellow  within the verge of the meadow mostly near the firm shore of pasture ground i found several grapevines hung with an abundance of large purple grapes  the vines had caught hold of maples and alders and climbed to the summit curling round about and interwreathing their twisted folds in so intimate a manner that it was not easy to tell the parasite from the supporting tree or shrub  sometimes the same vine had enveloped several shrubs and caused a strange tangled confusion converting all these poor plants to the purpose of its own support and hindering their growing to their own benefit and convenience  the broad vineleaves some of them yellow or yellowishtinged were seen apparently growing on the same stems with the silvermapled leaves and those of the other shrubs thus married against their will by the conjugal twine and the purple clusters of grapes hung down from above and in the midst so that one might gather grapes if not of thorns yet of as alien bushes  one vine had ascended almost to the tip of a large whitepine spreading its leaves and hanging its purple clusters among all its boughsstill climbing and clambering as if it would not be content till it had crowned the very summit with a wreath of its own foliage and bunches of grapes  i mounted high into the tree and ate the fruit there while the vine wreathed still higher into the depths above my head  the grapes were sour being not yet fully ripe  some of them however were sweet and pleasant   september 27tha ride to brighton yesterday morning it being the day of the weekly cattlefair  william allen and myself went in a wagon carrying a calf to be sold at the fair  the calf had not had his breakfast as his mother had preceded him to brighton and he kept expressing his hunger and discomfort by loud sonorous baas especially when we passed any cattle in the fields or in the road  the cows grazing within hearing expressed great interest and some of them came galloping to the roadside to behold the calf  little children also on their way to school stopped to laugh and point at poor little bessie he was a prettily behaved urchin and kept thrusting his hairy muzzle between william and myself apparently wishing to be stroked and patted it was an ugly thought that his confidence in human nature and nature in general was to be so ill rewarded as by cutting his throat and selling him in quarters  this i suppose has been his fate before now  it was a beautiful morning clear as crystal with an invigorating but not disagreeable coolness  the general aspect of the country was as green as summergreener indeed than mid or latter summerand there were occasional interminglings of the brilliant hues of autumn which made the scenery more beautiful both visibly and in sentiment  we saw no absolutely mean nor poorlooking abodes along the road  there were warm and comfortable farmhouses ancient with the porch the sloping roof the antique peak the clustered chimney of old times and modern cottages smart and tasteful and villas with terraces before them and dense shade and wooden urns on pillars and other such tokens of gentility  pleasant groves of oak and walnut also there were sometimes stretching along valleys sometimes ascending a hill and clothing it all round so as to make it a great clump of verdure frequently we passed people with cows oxen sheep or pigs for brighton fair  on arriving at brighton we found the village thronged with people horses and vehicles  probably there is no place in new england where the character of an agricultural population may be so well studied almost all the farmers within a reasonable distance make it a point i suppose to attend brighton fair pretty frequently if not on business yet as amateurs  then there are all the cattlepeople and butchers who supply the boston market and dealers from far and near and every man who has a cow or a yoke of oxen whether to sell or buy goes to brighton on monday  there were a thousand or two of cattle in the extensive pens belonging to the tavernkeeper besides many that were standing about one could hardly stir a step without running upon the horns of one dilemma or another in the shape of ox cow bull or ram  the yeomen appeared to be more in their element than i have ever seen them anywhere else except indeed at labormore so than at musterings and such gatherings of amusement  and yet this was a sort of festal day as well as a day of business  most of the people were of a bulky make with much bone and muscle and some good store of fat as if they had lived on fleshdiet with mottled faces too hard and red like those of persons who adhered to the old fashion of spiritdrinking  great roundpaunched country squires were there too sitting under the porch of the tavern or waddling about whip in hand discussing the points of the cattle  there were also gentlemenfarmers neatly trimly and fashionably dressed in handsome surtouts and trousers strapped under their boots  yeomen too in their black or blue sunday suits cut by country tailors and awkwardly worn  others like myself had on the blue stuff frocks which they wear in the fields the most comfortable garments that ever were invented  country loafers were among the throngmen who looked wistfully at the liquors in the bar and waited for some friend to invite them to drinkpoor shabby outatelbowed devils  also dandies from the city corseted and buckramed who had come to see the humors of brighton fair  all these and other varieties of mankind either thronged the spacious barroom of the hotel drinking smoking talking bargaining or walked about among the cattlepens looking with knowing eyes at the horned people  the owners of the cattle stood near at hand waiting for offers  there was something indescribable in their aspect that showed them to be the owners though they mixed among the crowd the cattle brought from a hundred separate farms or rather from a thousand seemed to agree very well together not quarrelling in the least  they almost all had a history no doubt if they could but have told it  the cows had each given her milk to support familieshad roamed the pastures and come home to the barnyard had been looked upon as a sort of member of the domestic circle and was known by a name as brindle or cherry  the oxen with their necks bent by the heavy yoke had toiled in the ploughfield and in hayingtime for many years and knew their masters stall as well as the master himself knew his own table  even the young steers and the little calves had something of domestic sacredness about them for children had watched their growth and petted them and played with them  and here they all were old and young gathered from their thousand homes to brighton fair whence the great chance was that they would go to the slaughterhouse and thence be transmitted in sirloins joints and such pieces to the tables of the boston folk  william allen had come to buy four little pigs to take the places of four who have now grown large at our farm and are to be fatted and killed within a few weeks  there were several hundreds in pens appropriated to their use grunting discordantly and apparently in no very good humor with their companions or the world at large  most or many of these pigs had been imported from the state of new york  the drovers set out with a large number and peddle them along the road till they arrive at brighton with the remainder  william selected four and bought them at five cents per pound  these poor little porkers were forthwith seized by the tails their legs tied and they thrown into our wagon where they kept up a continual grunt and squeal till we got home  two of them were yellowish or light goldcolor the other two were black and white speckled and all four of very piggish aspect and deportment  one of them snapped at williams finger most spitefully and bit it to the bone  all the scene of the fair was very characteristic and peculiarcheerful and lively too in the bright warm sun  i must see it again for it ought to be studied   september 28tha picnic party in the woods yesterday in honor of little frank danas birthday he being six years old  i strolled out after dinner with mr bradford and in a lonesome glade we met the apparition of an indian chief dressed in appropriate costume of blanket feathers and paint and armed with a musket  almost at the same time a young gypsy fortuneteller came from among the trees and proposed to tell my fortune  while she was doing this the goddess diana let fly an arrow and hit me smartly in the hand  the fortuneteller and goddess were in fine contrast diana being a blonde fair quiet with a moderate composure and the gypsy o g a bright vivacious darkhaired richcomplexioned damselboth of them very pretty at least pretty enough to make fifteen years enchanting  accompanied by these denizens of the wild wood we went onward and came to a company of fantastic figures arranged in a ring for a dance or a game  there was a swiss girl an indian squaw a negro of the jim crow order one or two foresters and several people in christian attire besides children of all ages  then followed childish games in which the grown people took part with mirth enoughwhile i whose nature it is to be a mere spectator both of sport and serious business lay under the trees and looked on  meanwhile mr emerson and miss fuller who arrived an hour or two before came forth into the little glade where we were assembled here followed much talk  the ceremonies of the day concluded with a cold collation of cakes and fruit  all was pleasant enoughan excellent piece of workwould t were done  it has left a fantastic impression on my memory this intermingling of wild and fabulous characters with real and homely ones in the secluded nook of the woods  i remember them with the sunlight breaking through overshadowing branches and they appearing and disappearing confusedlyperhaps starting out of the earth as if the everyday laws of nature were suspended for this particular occasion  there were the children too laughing and sporting about as if they were at home among such strange shapesand anon bursting into loud uproar of lamentation when the rude gambols of the merry archers chanced to overturn them  and apart with a shrewd yankee observation of the scene stands our friend orange a thickset sturdy figure enjoying the fun well enough yet rather laughing with a perception of its nonsensicalness than at all entering into the spirit of the thing  this morning i have been helping to gather apples  the principal farm labors at this time are ploughing for winter rye and breaking up the greensward for next years crop of potatoes gathering squashes and not much else except such yearround employments as milking  the crop of rye to be sure is in process of being thrashed at odd intervals  i ought to have mentioned among the diverse and incongruous growths of the picnic party our two spanish boys from manillalucas with his heavy features and almost mulatto complexion and jose slighter with rather a feminine facenot a gay girlish one but grave reserved eying you sometimes with an earnest but secret expression and causing you to question what sort of person he is   friday october 1sti have been looking at our four swinenot of the last lot but those in process of fattening  they lie among the clean rye straw in the sty nestling close together for they seem to be beasts sensitive to the cold and this is a clear bright crystal morning with a cool northwestwind  so there lie these four black swine as deep among the straw as they can burrow the very symbols of slothful ease and sensuous comfort  they seem to be actually oppressed and overburdened with comfort  they are quick to notice any ones approach and utter a low grunt thereuponnot drawing a breath for that particular purpose but grunting with their ordinary breathat the same time turning an observant though dull and sluggish eye upon the visitor  they seem to be involved and buried in their own corporeal substance and to look dimly forth at the outer world  they breathe not easily and yet not with difficulty nor discomfort for the very unreadiness and oppression with which their breath cones appears to make them sensible of the deep sensual satisfaction which they feel  swill the remnant of their last meal remains in the trough denoting that their food is more abundant than even a hog can demand  anon they fall asleep drawing short and heavy breaths which heave their huge sides up and down but at the slightest noise they sluggishly unclose their eyes and give another gentle grunt  they also grunt among themselves without any external cause but merely to express their swinish sympathy  i suppose it is the knowledge that these four grunters are doomed to die within two or three weeks that gives them a sort of awfulness in my conception  it makes me contrast their present gross substance of fleshly life with the nothingness speedily to come  meantime the four newly bought pigs are running about the cowyard lean active shrewd investigating everything as their nature is  when i throw an apple among them they scramble with one another for the prize and the successful one scampers away to eat it at leisure  they thrust their snouts into the mud and pick a grain of corn out of the rubbish  nothing within their sphere do they leave unexamined grunting all the time with infinite variety of expression  their language is the most copious of that of any quadruped and indeed there is something deeply and indefinably interesting in the swinish race  they appear the more a mystery the longer one gazes at them  it seems as if there were an important meaning to them if one could but find it out  one interesting trait in them is their perfect independence of character  they care not for man and will not adapt themselves to his notions as other beasts do but are true to themselves and act out their hoggish nature   october 7thsince saturday last it being now thursday i have been in boston and salem and there has been a violent storm and rain during the whole time  this morning shone as bright as if it meant to make up for all the dismalness of the past days  our brook which in the summer was no longer a running stream but stood in pools along its pebbly course is now full from one grassy verge to the other and hurries along with a murmuring rush  it will continue to swell i suppose and in the winter and spring it will flood all the broad meadows through which it flows  i have taken a long walk this forenoon along the needham road and across the bridge thence pursuing a crossroad through the woods parallel with the river which i crossed again at dedham  most of the road lay through a growth of young oaks principally  they still retain their verdure though looking closely in among them one perceives the broken sunshine falling on a few sere or brighthued tufts of shrubbery  in low marshy spots on the verge of the meadows or along the riverside there is a much more marked autumnal change  whole ranges of bushes are there painted with many variegated lines not of the brightest tint but of a sober cheerfulness  i suppose this is owing more to the late rains than to the frost for a heavy rain changes the foliage somewhat at this season  the first marked frost was seen last saturday morning  soon after sunrise it lay white as snow over all the grass and on the tops of the fences and in the yard on the heap of firewood  on sunday i think there was a fall of snow which however did not lie on the ground a moment  there is no season when such pleasant and sunny spots may be lighted on and produce so pleasant an effect on the feelings as now in october the sunshine is peculiarly genial and in sheltered places as on the side of a bank or of a barn or house one becomes acquainted and friendly with the sunshine  it seems to be of a kindly and homely nature  and the green grass strewn with a few withered leaves looks the more green and beautiful for them  in summer or spring nature is farther from ones sympathies   october 8thanother gloomy day lowering with portents of rain close at hand  i have walked up into the pastures this morning and looked about me a little  the woods present a very diversified appearance just now with perhaps more varieties of tint than they are destined to wear at a somewhat later period  there are some strong yellow hues and some deep red there are innumerable shades of green some few having the depth of summer others partially changed towards yellow look freshly verdant with the delicate tinge of early summer or of may  then there is the solemn and dark green of the pines  the effect is that every tree in the wood and every bush among the shrubbery has a separate existence since confusedly intermingled each wears its peculiar color instead of being lost in the universal emerald of summer  and yet there is a oneness of effect likewise when we choose to look at a whole sweep of woodland instead of analyzing its component trees  scattered over the pasture which the late rains have kept tolerably green there are spots or islands of dusky reda deep substantial line very well fit to be close to the groundwhile the yellow and light fantastic shades of green soar upward to the sky  these red spots are the blueberry and whortleberry bushes  the sweetfern is changed mostly to russet but still retains its wild and delightful fragrance when pressed in the hand wild chinaasters are scattered about but beginning to wither  a little while ago mushrooms or toadstools were very numerous along the woodpaths and by the roadsides especially after rain  some were of spotless white some yellow and some scarlet  they are always mysteries and objects of interest to me springing as they do so suddenly from no root or seed and growing one wonders why  i think too that some varieties are pretty objects little fairy tables centretables standing on one leg  but their growth appears to be checked now and they are of a brown tint and decayed  the farm business today is to dig potatoes  i worked a little at it the process is to grasp all the stems of a hill and pull them up  a great many of the potatoes are thus pulled clinging to the stems and to one another in curious shapeslong red things and little round ones imbedded in the earth which clings to the roots  these being plucked off the rest of the potatoes are dug out of the hill with a hoe the tops being flung into a heap for the cowyard  on my way home i paused to inspect the squashfield  some of the squashes lay in heaps as they were gathered presenting much variety of shape and hueas golden yellow like great lumps of gold dark green striped and variegated and some were round and some lay curling their long necks nestling as it were and seeming as if they had life  in my walk yesterday forenoon i passed an old house which seemed to be quite deserted  it was a twostory wooden house dark and weatherbeaten  the front windows some of them were shattered and open and others were boarded up  trees and shrubbery were growing neglected so as quite to block up the lower part  there was an aged barn near at hand so ruinous that it had been necessary to prop it up there were two old carts both of which had lost a wheel  everything was in keeping  at first i supposed that there would be no inhabitants in such a dilapidated place but passing on i looked back and saw a decrepit and infirm old man at the angle of the house its fit occupant the grass however was very green and beautiful around this dwelling and the sunshine falling brightly on it the whole effect was cheerful and pleasant  it seemed as if the world was so glad that this desolate old place where there was never to be any more hope and happiness could not at all lessen the general effect of joy  i found a small turtle by the roadside where he had crept to warm himself in the genial sunshine  he had a sable back and underneath his shell was yellow and at the edges bright scarlet  his head tail and claws were striped yellow black and red  he withdrew himself as far as he possibly could into his shell and absolutely refused to peep out even when i put him into the water  finally i threw him into a deep pool and left him  these mailed gentlemen from the size of a foot or more down to an inch were very numerous in the spring and now the smaller kind appear again   saturday october 9thstill dismal weather  our household being composed in great measure of children and young people is generally a cheerful one enough even in gloomy weather  for a week past we have been especially gladdened with a little seamstress from boston about seventeen years old but of such a petite figure that at first view one would take her to be hardly in her teens  she is very vivacious and smart laughing and singing and talking all the timetalking sensibly but still taking the view of matters that a city girl naturally would if she were larger than she is and of less pleasing aspect i think she might be intolerable but being so small and with a fair skin and as healthy as a wildflower she is really very agreeable and to look at her face is like being shone upon by a ray of the sun  she never walks but bounds and dances along and this motion in her diminutive person does not give the idea of violence  it is like a bird hopping from twig to twig and chirping merrily all the time  sometimes she is rather vulgar but even that works well enough into her character and accords with it  on continued observation one discovers that she is not a little girl but really a little woman with all the prerogatives and liabilities of a woman  this gives a new aspect to her while the girlish impression still remains and is strangely combined with the sense that this frolicsome maiden has the material for the sober bearing of a wife  she romps with the boys runs races with them in the yard and up and down the stairs and is heard scolding laughingly at their rough play  she asks william allen to place her on top of that horse whereupon he puts his large brown hands about her waist and swinging her to and fro lifts her on horseback  william threatens to rivet two horseshoes round her neck for having clambered with the other girls and boys upon a load of hay whereby the said load lost its balance and slid off the cart  she strings the seedberries of roses together making a scarlet necklace of them which she fastens about her throat  she gathers flowers of everlasting to wear in her bonnet arranging them with the skill of a dressmaker  in the evening she sits singing by the hour with the musical part of the establishment often breaking into laughter whereto she is incited by the tricks of the boys  the last thing one hears of her she is tripping up stairs to bed talking lightsomely or warbling and one meets her in the morning the very image of bright morn itself smiling briskly at you so that one takes her for a promise of cheerfulness through the day  be it said with all the rest that there is a perfect maiden modesty in her deportment  she has just gone away and the last i saw of her was her vivacious face peeping through the curtain of the cariole and nodding a gay farewell to the family who were shouting their adieus at the door  with her other merits she is an excellent daughter and supports her mother by the labor of her hands  it would be difficult to conceive beforehand how much can be added to the enjoyment of a household by mere sunniness of temper and liveliness of disposition for her intellect is very ordinary and she never says anything worth hearing or even laughing at in itself  but she herself is an expression well worth studying   brook farm october 9tha walk this afternoon to cow island  the clouds had broken away towards noon and let forth a few sunbeams and more and more blue sky ventured to appear till at last it was really warm and sunnyindeed rather too warm in the sheltered hollows though it is delightful to be too warm now after so much stormy chillness  o the beauty of grassy slopes and the hollow ways of paths winding between hills and the intervals between the road and woodlots where summer lingers and sits down strewing dandelions of gold and blue asters as her parting gifts and memorials  i went to a grapevine which i have already visited several times and found some clusters of grapes still remaining and now perfectly ripe  coming within view of the river i saw several wild ducks under the shadow of the opposite shore which was high and covered with a grove of pines  i should not have discovered the ducks had they not risen and skimmed the surface of the glassy stream breaking its dark water with a bright streak and sweeping round gradually rose high enough to fly away  i likewise started a partridge just within the verge of the woods and in another place a large squirrel ran across the woodpath from one shelter of trees to the other  small birds in flocks were flitting about the fields seeking and finding i know not what sort of food  there were little fish also darting in shoals through the pools and depths of the brooks which are now replenished to their brims and rush towards the river with a swift ambercolored current  cow island is not an islandat least at this seasonthough i believe in the time of freshets the marshy charles floods the meadows all round about it and extends across its communication with the mainland  the path to it is a very secluded one threading a wood of pines and just wide enough to admit the loads of meadow hay which are drawn from the splashy shore of the river  the island has a growth of stately pines with tall and ponderous stems standing at distance enough to admit the eve to travel far among them and as there is no underbrush the effect is somewhat like looking among the pillars of a church  i returned home by the highroad  on my right separated from the road by a level field perhaps fifty yards across was a range of young foresttrees dressed in their garb of autumnal glory  the sun shone directly upon them and sunlight is like the breath of life to the pomp of autumn  in its absence one doubts whether there be any truth in what poets have told about the splendor of an american autumn but when this charm is added one feels that the effect is beyond description  as i beheld it today there was nothing dazzling it was gentle and mild though brilliant and diversified and had a most quiet and pensive influence  and yet there were some trees that seemed really made of sunshine and others were of a sunny red and the whole picture was painted with but little relief of darksome lines only a few evergreens but there was nothing inharmonious and on closer examination it appeared that all the tints had a relationship among themselves  and this i suppose is the reason that while nature seems to scatter them so carelessly they still never shock the beholder by their contrasts nor disturb but only soothe  the brilliant scarlet and the brilliant yellow are different lines of the mapleleaves and the first changes into the last  i saw one mapletree its centre yellow as gold set in a framework of red  the native poplars have different shades of green verging towards yellow and are very cheerful in the sunshine  most of the oakleaves have still the deep verdure of summer but where a change has taken place it is into a russetred warm but sober  these colors infinitely varied by the progress which different trees have made in their decay constitute almost the whole glory of autumnal woods but it is impossible to conceive how much is done with such scanty materials in my whole walk i saw only one man and he was at a distance in the obscurity of the trees  he had a horse and a wagon and was getting a load of dry brushwood   sunday october 10thi visited my grapevine this afternoon and ate the last of its clusters  this vine climbs around a young mapletree which has now assumed the yellow leaf  the leaves of the vine are more decayed than those of the maple  thence to cow island a solemn and thoughtful walk  returned by another path of the width of a wagon passing through a grove of hard wood the lightsome hues of which make the walk more cheerful than among the pines  the roots of oaks emerged from the soil and contorted themselves across the path  the sunlight also broke across in spots and otherwheres the shadow was deep but still there was intermingling enough of bright hues to keep off the gloom from the whole path  brooks and pools have a peculiar aspect at this season  one knows that the water must be cold and one shivers a little at the sight of it and yet the grass about the pool may be of the deepest green and the sun may be shining into it  the withered leaves which overhanging trees shed upon its surface contribute much to the effect  insects have mostly vanished in the fields and woods  i hear locusts yet singing in the sunny hours and crickets have not yet finished their song  once in a while i see a caterpillarthis afternoon for instance a red hairy one with black head and tail  they do not appear to be active and it makes one rather melancholy to look at them   tuesday october 12ththe cawing of the crow resounds among the woods a sentinel is aware of your approach a great way off and gives the alarm to his comrades loudly and eagerlycaw caw caw  immediately the whole conclave replies and you behold them rising above the trees flapping darkly and winging their way to deeper solitudes  sometimes however they remain till you come near enough to discern their sable gravity of aspect each occupying a separate bough or perhaps the blasted tiptop of a pine  as you approach one after another with loud cawing flaps his wings and throws himself upon the air  there is hardly a more striking feature in the landscape nowadays than the red patches of blueberry and whortleberry bushes as seen on a sloping hillside like islands among the grass with trees growing in them or crowning the summit of a bare brown hill with their somewhat russet liveliness or circling round the base of an earthimbedded rock at a distance this hue clothing spots and patches of the earth looks more like a picture than anything elseyet such a picture as i never saw painted  the oaks are now beginning to look sere and their leaves have withered borders  it is pleasant to notice the wide circle of greener grass beneath the circumference of an overshadowing oak  passing an orchard one hears an uneasy rustling in the trees and not as if they were struggling with the wind  scattered about are barrels to contain the gathered apples and perhaps a great heap of golden or scarlet apples is collected in one place   wednesday october 13tha good view from an upland swell of our pasture across the valley of the river charles  there is the meadow as level as a floor and carpeted with green perhaps two miles from the rising ground on this side of the river to that on the opposite side the stream winds through the midst of the flat space without any banks at all for it fills its bed almost to the brim and bathes the meadow grass on either side  a tuft of shrubbery at broken intervals is scattered along its border and thus it meanders sluggishly along without other life than what it gains from gleaming in the sun  now into the broad smooth meadow as into a lake capes and headlands put themselves forth and shores of firm woodland border it covered with variegated foliage making the contrast so much the stronger of their height and rough outline with the even spread of the plain  and beyond and far away rises a long gradual swell of country covered with an apparently dense growth of foliage for miles till the horizon terminates it and here and there is a house or perhaps two among the contiguity of trees  everywhere the trees wear their autumnal dress so that the whole landscape is red russet orange and yellow blending in the distance into a rich tint of brownorange or nearly thatexcept the green expanse so definitely hemmed in by the higher ground  i took a long walk this morning going first nearly to newton thence nearly to brighton thence to jamaica plain and thence home  it was a fine morning with a northwestwind cool when facing the wind but warm and most genially pleasant in sheltered spots and warm enough everywhere while i was in motion  i traversed most of the byways which offered themselves to me and passing through one in which there was a double line of grass between the wheeltracks and that of the horses feet i came to where had once stood a farmhouse which appeared to have been recently torn down  most of the old timber and boards had been carted away a pile of it however remained  the cellar of the house was uncovered and beside it stood the base and middle height of the chimney the oven in which household bread had been baked for daily food and puddings and cake and jolly pumpkinpies for festivals opened its month being deprived of its iron door  the fireplace was close at hand  all round the site of the house was a pleasant sunny green space with old fruittrees in pretty fair condition though aged  there was a barn also aged but in decent repair and a ruinous shed on the corner of which was nailed a boys windmill where it had probably been turning and clattering for years together till now it was black with time and weatherstain  it was broken but still it went round whenever the wind stirred  the spot was entirely secluded there being no other house within a mile or two  no language can give an idea of the beauty and glory of the trees just at this moment  it would be easy by a process of worddaubing to set down a confused group of gorgeous colors like a bunch of tangled skeins of bright silk but there is nothing of the reality in the glare which would thus be produced  and yet the splendor both of individual clusters and of whole scenes is unsurpassable  the oaks are now far advanced in their change of hue and in certain positions relatively to the sun they light up and gleam with a most magnificent deep gold varying according as portions of the foliage are in shadow or sunlight  on the sides which receive the direct rays the effect is altogether rich and in other points of view it is equally beautiful if less brilliant  this color of the oak is more superb than the lighter yellow of the maples and walnuts  the whole landscape is now covered with this indescribable pomp it is discerned on the uplands afar off and blue hill in milton at the distance of several miles actually glistens with rich dark lightno not glistens nor gleamsbut perhaps to say glows subduedly will be a truer expression for it  met few people this morning a grown girl in company with a little boy gathering barberries in a secluded lane a portly autumnal gentleman wrapped in a greatcoat who asked the way to mr joseph goddards and a fishcart from the city the driver of which sounded his horn along the lonesome way   monday october 18ththere has been a succession of days which were cold and bright in the forenoon and gray sullen and chill towards night  the woods have now taken a soberer tint than they wore at my last date  many of the shrubs which looked brightest a little while ago are now wholly bare of leaves  the oaks have generally a russetbrown shade although some of them are still green as are likewise other scattered trees in the forests  the bright yellow and the rich scarlet are no more to be seen  scarcely any of them will now bear a close examination for this shows them to be rugged wilted and of faded frostbitten hue but at a distance and in the mass and enlivened by the sun they have still somewhat of the varied splendor which distinguished them a week ago  it is wonderful what a difference the sunshine makes it is like varnish bringing out the hidden veins in a piece of rich wood  in the cold gray atmosphere such as that of most of our afternoons now the landscape lies darkbrown and in a much deeper shadow than if it were clothed in green  but perchance a gleam of sun falls on a certain spot of distant shrubbery or woodland and we see it brighten with many lines standing forth prominently from the dimness around it  the sunlight gradually spreads and the whole sombre scene is changed to a motley picturethe sun bringing out many shades of color and converting its gloom to an almost laughing cheerfulness  at such times i almost doubt whether the foliage has lost any of its brilliancy  but the clouds intercept the sun again and lo old autumn appears clad in his cloak of russetbrown  beautiful now while the general landscape lies in shadow looks the summit of a distant hill say a mile off with the sunshine brightening the trees that cover it  it is noticeable that the outlines of hills and the whole bulk of them at the distance of several miles become stronger denser and more substantial in this autumn atmosphere and in these autumnal tints than in summer  then they looked blue misty and dim  now they show their great humpbacks more plainly as if they had drawn nearer to us  a waste of shrubbery and small trees such as overruns the borders of the meadows for miles together looks much more rugged wild and savage in its present brown color than when clad in green  i passed through a very pleasant woodpath yesterday quite shut in and sheltered by trees that had not thrown off their yellow robes  the sun shone strongly in among them and quite kindled them so that the path was brighter for their shade than if it had been quite exposed to the sun  in the village graveyard which lies contiguous to the street i saw a man digging a grave and one inhabitant after another turned aside from his way to look into the grave and talk with the digger  i heard him laugh with the traditionary mirthfulness of men of that occupation  in the hollow of the woods yesterday afternoon i lay a long while watching a squirrel who was capering about among the trees over my head oaks and whitepines so close together that their branches intermingled  the squirrel seemed not to approve of my presence for he frequently uttered a sharp quick angry noise like that of a scissorsgrinders wheel  sometimes i could see him sitting on an impending bough with his tail over his hack looking down pryingly upon me  it seems to be a natural posture with him to sit on his hind legs holding up his fore paws  anon with a peculiarly quick start he would scramble along the branch and be lost to sight in another part of the tree whence his shrill chatter would again be heard  then i would see him rapidly descending the trunk and running along the ground and a moment afterwards casting my eye upward i beheld him flitting like a bird among the high limbs at the summit directly above me  afterwards he apparently became accustomed to my society and set about some business of his own  he came down to the ground took up a piece of a decayed bough a heavy burden for such a small personage and with this in his mouth again climbed up and passed from the branches of one tree to those of another and thus onward and onward till he went out of sight  shortly afterwards he returned for another burden and this he repeated several times  i suppose he was building a nestat least i know not what else could have been his object  never was there such an active cheerful choleric continuallyinmotion fellow as this little red squirrel talking to himself chattering at me and as sociable in his own person as if he had half a dozen companions instead of being alone in the lonesome wood  indeed he flitted about so quickly and showed himself in different places so suddenly that i was in some doubt whether there were not two or three of them  i must mention again the very beautiful effect produced by the masses of berrybushes lying like scarlet islands in the midst of withered pastureground or crowning the tops of barren hills  their hue at a distance is lustrous scarlet although it does not look nearly as bright and gorgeous when examined close at hand  but at a proper distance it is a beautiful fringe on autumns petticoat   friday october 22da continued succession of unpleasant novembery days and autumn has made rapid progress in the work of decay  it is now somewhat of a rare good fortune to find a verdant grassy spot on some slope or in a dell and even such seldomseen oases are bestrewn with dried brown leaveswhich however methinks make the short fresh grass look greener around them  dry leaves are now plentiful everywhere save where there are none but pinetrees  they rustle beneath the tread and there is nothing more autumnal than that sound  nevertheless in a walk this afternoon i have seen two oaks which retained almost the greenness of summer  they grew close to the huge pulpit rock so that portions of their trunks appeared to grasp the rough surface and they were rooted beneath it and ascending high into the air overshadowed the gray crag with verdure  other oaks here and there have a few green leaves or boughs among their rustling and rugged shade  yet dreary as the woods are in a bleak sullen day there is a very peculiar sense of warmth and a sort of richness of effect in the slope of a bank and in sheltered spots where bright sunshine falls and the brown oaken foliage is gladdened by it  there is then a feeling of comfort and consequently of heartwarmth which cannot be experienced in summer  i walked this afternoon along a pleasant woodpath gently winding so that but little of it could be seen at a time and going up and down small mounds now plunging into a denser shadow and now emerging from it  part of the way it was strewn with the dusky yellow leaves of whitepinesthe castoff garments of last year part of the way with green grass closecropped and very fresh for the season  sometimes the trees met across it sometimes it was bordered on one side by an old railfence of mossgrown cedar with bushes sprouting beneath it and thrusting their branches through it sometimes by a stonewall of unknown antiquity older than the wood it closed in  a stonewall when shrubbery has grown around it and thrust its roots beneath it becomes a very pleasant and meditative object  it does not belong too evidently to man having been built so long ago  it seems a part of nature  yesterday i found two mushrooms in the woods probably of the preceding nights growth  also i saw a mosquito frostpinched and so wretched that i felt avenged for all the

is a great variety of shipping owned among the young people and they appear to have a considerable knowledge of the art of managing vessels  there is a fullrigged manofwar with i believe every spar rope and sail that sometimes makes its appearance and when on a voyage across the pond it so identically resembles a great ship except in size that it has the effect of a picture  all its motionsits tossing up and down on the small waves and its sinking and rising in a calm swell its heeling to the breezethe whole effect in short is that of a real ship at sea while moreover there is something that kindles the imagination more than the reality would do  if we see a real great ship the mind grasps and possesses within its real clutch all that there is of it while here the mimic ship is the representation of an ideal one and so gives us a more imaginative pleasure  there are many schooners that ply to and fro on the pond and pilotboats all perfectly rigged  i saw a race the other day between the ship above mentioned and a pilotboat in which the latter came off conqueror  the boys appear to be well acquainted with all the ropes and sails and can call them by their nautical names  one of the owners of the vessels remains on one side of the pond and the other on the opposite side and so they send the little bark to and fro like merchants of different countries consigning their vessels to one another  generally when any vessel is on the pond there are fullgrown spectators who look on with as much interest as the boys themselves towards sunset this is especially the case for then are seen young girls and their lovers mothers with their little boys in hand schoolgirls beating hoops round about and occasionally running to the side of the pond rough tars or perhaps masters or young mates of vessels who make remarks about the miniature shipping and occasionally give professional advice to the navigators visitors from the country gloved and caned young gentlemenin short everybody stops to take a look  in the mean time dogs are continually plunging into the pond and swimming about with noses pointed upward and snatching at floating chips then emerging they shake

concord august 5tha rainy daya rainy day  i am commanded to take pen in hand and i am therefore banished to the little tenfootsquare apartment misnamed my study but perhaps the dismalness of the day and the dulness of my solitude will be the prominent characteristics of what i write  and what is there to write about  happiness has no succession of events because it is a part of eternity and we have been living in eternity ever since we came to this old manse  like enoch we seem to have been translated to the other state of being without having passed through death  our spirits must have flitted away unconsciously and we can only perceive that we have cast off our mortal part by the more real and earnest life of our souls  externally our paradise has very much the aspect of a pleasant old domicile on earth  this antique housefor it looks antique though it was created by providence expressly for our use and at the precise time when we wanted itstands behind a noble avenue of balmofgilead trees and when we chance to observe a passing traveller through the sunshine and the shadow of this long avenue his figure appears too dim and remote to disturb the sense of blissful seclusion  few indeed are the mortals who venture within our sacred precincts  george prescott who has not yet grown earthly enough i suppose to be debarred from occasional visits to paradise comes daily to bring three pints of milk from some ambrosial cow occasionally also he makes an offering of mortal flowers  mr emerson comes sometimes and has been feasted on our nectar and ambrosia  mr thoreau has twice listened to the music of the spheres which for our private convenience we have packed into a musicalbox  e h who is much more at home among spirits than among fleshly bodies came hither a few times merely to welcome us to the ethereal world but latterly she has vanished into some other region of infinite space  one rash mortal on the second sunday after our arrival obtruded himself upon us in a gig  there have since been three or four callers who preposterously think that the courtesies of the lower world are to be responded to by people whose home is in paradise  i must not forget to mention that the butcher comes twice or thrice a week and we have so far improved upon the custom of adam and eve that we generally furnish forth our feasts with portions of some delicate calf or lamb whose unspotted innocence entitles them to the happiness of becoming our sustenance  would that i were permitted to record the celestial dainties that kind heaven provided for us on the first day of our arrival  never surely was such food heard of on earthat least not by me  well the abovementioned persons are nearly all that have entered into the hallowed shade of our avenue except indeed a certain sinner who came to bargain for the grass in our orchard and another who came with a new cistern  for it is one of the drawbacks upon our eden that it contains no water fit either to drink or to bathe in so that the showers have become in good truth a godsend i wonder why providence does not cause a clear cold fountain to bubble up at our doorstep methinks it would not be unreasonable to pray for such a favor  at present we are under the ridiculous necessity of sending to the outer world for water  only imagine adam trudging out of paradise with a bucket in each hand to get water to drink or for eve to bathe in  intolerable though our stout handmaiden really fetches our water  in other respects providence has treated us pretty tolerably well but here i shall expect something further to be done  also in the way of future favors a kitten would be very acceptable  animals except perhaps a pig seem never out of place even in the most paradisiacal spheres  and by the way a young colt comes up our avenue now and then to crop the seldomtrodden herbage and so does a company of cows whose sweet breath well repays us for the food which they obtain  there are likewise a few hens whose quiet cluck is heard pleasantly about the house  a black dog sometimes stands at the farther extremity of the avenue and looks wistfully hitherward but when i whistle to him he puts his tail between his legs and trots away foolish dog if he had more faith he should have bones enough   saturday august 6thstill a dull day threatening rain yet without energy of character enough to rain outright  however yesterday there were showers enough to supply us well with their beneficent outpouring as to the new cistern it seems to be bewitched for while the spout pours into it like a cataract it still remains almost empty  i wonder where mr hosmer got it perhaps from tantalus under the eaves of whose palace it must formerly have stood for like his drinkingcup in hades it has the property of filling itself forever and never being full  after breakfast i took my fishingrod and went down through our orchard to the riverside but as three or four boys were already in possession of the best spots along the shore i did not fish  this river of ours is the most sluggish stream that i ever was acquainted with  i had spent three weeks by its side and swam across it every day before i could determine which way its current ran and then i was compelled to decide the question by the testimony of others and not by my own observation owing to this torpor of the stream it has nowhere a bright pebbly shore nor is there so much as a narrow strip of glistening sand in any part of its course but it slumbers along between broad meadows or kisses the tangled grass of mowingfields and pastures or bathes the overhanging boughs of elderbushes and other waterloving plants  flags and rushes grow along its shallow margin  the yellow waterlily spreads its broad flat leaves upon its surface and the fragrant white pondlily occurs in many favored spotsgenerally selecting a situation just so far from the rivers brink that it cannot be grasped except at the hazard of plunging in  but thanks be to the beautiful flower for growing at any rate  it is a marvel whence it derives its loveliness and perfume sprouting as it does from the black mud over which the river sleeps and from which the yellow lily likewise draws its unclean life and noisome odor  so it is with many people in this world the same soil and circumstances may produce the good and beautiful and the wicked and ugly  some have the faculty of assimilating to themselves only what is evil and so they become as noisome as the yellow waterlily  some assimilate none but good influences and their emblem is the fragrant and spotless pondlily whose very breath is a blessing to all the region round about    among the productions of the rivers margin i must not forget the pickerelweed which grows just on the edge of the water and shoots up a long stalk crowned with a blue spire from among large green leaves  both the flower and the leaves look well in a vase with pondlilies and relieve the unvaried whiteness of the latter and being all alike children of the waters they are perfectly in keeping with one another     i bathe once and often twice a day in our river but one dip into the salt sea would be worth more than a whole weeks soaking in such a lifeless tide  i have read of a river somewhere whether it be in classic regions or among our western indians i know not which seemed to dissolve and steal away the vigor of those who bathed in it  perhaps our stream will be found to have this property  its water however is pleasant in its immediate effect being as soft as milk and always warmer than the air  its hue has a slight tinge of gold and my limbs when i behold them through its medium look tawny  i am not aware that the inhabitants of concord resemble their native river in any of their moral characteristics  their forefathers certainly seem to have had the energy and impetus of a mountain torrent rather than the torpor of this listless streamas it was proved by the blood with which they stained their river of peace  it is said there are plenty of fish in it but my most important captures hitherto have been a mudturtle and an enormous eel  the former made his escape to his native elementthe latter we ate and truly he had the taste of the whole river in his flesh with a very prominent flavor of mud  on the whole concord river is no great favorite of mine but i am glad to have any river at all so near at hand it being just at the bottom of our orchard  neither is it without a degree and kind of picturesqueness both in its nearness and in the distance when a blue gleam from its surface among the green meadows and woods seems like an open eye in earths countenance  pleasant it is too to behold a little flatbottomed skiff gliding over its bosom which yields lazily to the stroke of the paddle and allows the boat to go against its current almost as freely as with it  pleasant too to watch an angler as he strays along the brink sometimes sheltering himself behind a tuft of bushes and trailing his line along the water in hopes to catch a pickerel  but taking the river for all in all i can find nothing more fit to compare it with than one of the halftorpid earthworms which i dig up for bait  the worm is sluggish and so is the riverthe river is muddy and so is the worm  you hardly know whether either of them be alive or dead but still in the course of time they both manage to creep away  the best aspect of the concord is when there is a northwestern breeze curling its surface in a bright sunshiny day it then assumes a vivacity not its own  moonlight also gives it beauty as it does to all scenery of earth or water   sunday august 7that sunset last evening i ascended the hilltop opposite our house and looking downward at the long extent of the river it struck me that i had done it some injustice in my remarks perhaps like other gentle and quiet characters it will be better appreciated the longer i am acquainted with it  certainly as i beheld it then it was one of the loveliest features in a scene of great rural beauty  it was visible through a course of two or three miles sweeping in a semicircle round the hill on which i stood and being the central line of a broad vale on either side  at a distance it looked like a strip of sky set into the earth which it so etherealized and idealized that it seemed akin to the upper regions  nearer the base of the hill i could discern the shadows of every tree and rock imaged with a distinctness that made them even more charming than the reality because knowing them to be unsubstantial they assumed the ideality which the soul always craves in the contemplation of earthly beauty  all the sky too and the rich clouds of sunset were reflected in the peaceful bosom of the river and surely if its bosom can give back such an adequate reflection of heaven it cannot be so gross and impure as i described it yesterday  or if so it shall be a symbol to me that even a human breast which may appear least spiritual in some aspects may still have the capability of reflecting an infinite heaven in its depths and therefore of enjoying it  it is a comfortable thought that the smallest and most turbid mudpuddle can contain its own picture of heaven  let us remember this when we feel inclined to deny all spiritual life to some people in whom nevertheless our father may perhaps see the image of his face  this dull river has a deep religion of its own so let us trust has the dullest human soul though perhaps unconsciously  the scenery of concord as i beheld it from the summit of the hill has no very marked characteristics but has a great deal of quiet beauty in keeping with the river  there are broad and peaceful meadows which i think are among the most satisfying objects in natural scenery  the heart reposes on them with a feeling that few things else can give because almost all other objects are abrupt and clearly defined but a meadow stretches out like a small infinity yet with a secure homeliness which we do not find either in an expanse of water or of air  the hills which border these meadows are wide swells of land or long and gradual ridges some of them densely covered with wood  the white village at a distance on the left appears to be embosomed among wooded hills  the verdure of the country is much more perfect than is usual at this season of the year when the autumnal hue has generally made considerable progress over trees and grass  last evening after the copious showers of the preceding two days it was worthy of early june or indeed of a world just created  had i not then been alone i should have had a far deeper sense of beauty for i should have looked through the medium of another spirit  along the horizon there were masses of those deep clouds in which the fancy may see images of all things that ever existed or were dreamed of  over our old manse of which i could catch but a glimpse among its embowering trees appeared the immensely gigantic figure of a hound crouching down with head erect as if keeping watchful guard while the master of the mansion was away    how sweet it was to draw near my own home after having lived homeless in the world so long     with thoughts like these i descended the hill and clambered over the stonewall and crossed the road and passed up our avenue while the quaint old house put on an aspect of welcome   monday august 8thi wish i could give a description of our house for it really has a character of its own which is more than can be said of most edifices in these days  it is two stories high with a third story of attic chambers in the gableroof  when i first visited it early in june it looked pretty much as it did during the old clergymans lifetime showing all the dust and disarray that might be supposed to have gathered about him in the course of sixty years of occupancy  the rooms seemed never to have been painted at all events the walls and panels as well as the huge crossbeams had a venerable and most dismal tinge of brown  the furniture consisted of highbacked shortlegged rheumatic chairs small old tables bedsteads with lofty posts stately chests of drawers lookingglasses in antique black frames all of which were probably fashionable in the days of dr ripleys predecessor  it required some energy of imagination to conceive the idea of transforming this ancient edifice into a comfortable modern residence  however it has been successfully accomplished  the old doctors sleepingapartment which was the front room on the groundfloor we have converted into a parlor and by the aid of cheerful paint and paper a gladsome carpet pictures and engravings new furniture bijouterie and a daily supply of flowers it has become one of the prettiest and pleasantest rooms in the whole world  the shade of our departed host will never haunt it for its aspect has been changed as completely as the scenery of a theatre probably the ghost gave one peep into it uttered a groan and vanished forever  the opposite room has been metamorphosed into a storeroom through the house both in the first and second story runs a spacious hall or entry occupying more space than is usually devoted to such a purpose in modern times  this feature contributes to give the whole house an airy roomy and convenient appearance we can breathe the freer by the aid of the broad passageway  the front door of the hall looks up the stately avenue which i have already mentioned and the opposite door opens into the orchard through which a path descends to the river  in the second story we have at present fitted up three roomsone being our own chamber and the opposite one a guestchamber which contains the most presentable of the old doctors anterevolutionary furniture  after all the moderns have invented nothing better as chamber furniture than these chests of drawers which stand on four slender legs and rear an absolute tower of mahogany to the ceiling the whole terminating in a fantastically carved summit  such a venerable structure adorns our guestchamber  in the rear of the house is the little room which i call my study and which in its day has witnessed the intellectual labors of better students than myself  it contains with some additions and alterations the furniture of my bachelorroom in boston but there is a happier disposal of things now  there is a little vase of flowers on one of the bookcases and a larger bronze vase of graceful ferns that surmounts the bureau  in size the room is just what it ought to be for i never could compress my thoughts sufficiently to write in a very spacious room  it has three windows two of which are shaded by a large and beautiful willowtree which sweeps against the overhanging eaves on this side we have a view into the orchard and beyond a glimpse of the river  the other window is the one from which mr emerson the predecessor of dr ripley beheld the first fight of the revolution which he might well do as the british troops were drawn up within a hundred yards of the house and on looking forth just now i could still perceive the western abutments of the old bridge the passage of which was contested  the new monument is visible from base to summit  notwithstanding all we have done to modernize the old place we seem scarcely to have disturbed its air of antiquity  it is evident that other wedded pairs have spent their honeymoons here that children have been born here and people have grown old and died in these rooms although for our behoof the same apartments have consented to look cheerful once again  then there are dark closets and strange nooks and corners where the ghosts of former occupants might hide themselves in the daytime and stalk forth when night conceals all our sacrilegious improvements  we have seen no apparitions as yet but we hear strange noises especially in the kitchen and last night while sitting in the parlor we heard a thumping and pounding as of somebody at work in my study  nay if i mistake not for i was half asleep there was a sound as of some person crumpling paper in his hand in our very bedchamber this must have been old dr ripley with one of his sermons  there is a whole chest of them in the garret but he need have no apprehensions of our disturbing them  i never saw the old patriarch myself which i regret as i should have been glad to associate his venerable figure at ninety years of age with the house in which he dwelt  externally the house presents the same appearance as in the doctors day it had once a coat of white paint but the storms and sunshine of many years have almost obliterated it and produced a sober grayish hue which entirely suits the antique form of the structure  to repaint its reverend face would be a real sacrilege  it would look like old dr ripley in a brown wig  i hardly know why it is that our cheerful and lightsome repairs and improvements in the interior of the house seem to be in perfectly good taste though the heavy old beams and high wainscoting of the walls speak of ages gone by  but so it is  the cheerful paperhangings have the air of belonging to the old walls and such modernisms as astral lamps cardtables gilded colognebottles silver taperstands and bronze and alabaster flowervases do not seem at all impertinent  it is thus that an aged man may keep his heart warm for new things and new friends and often furnish himself anew with ideas though it would not be graceful for him to attempt to suit his exterior to the passing fashions of the day   august 9thour orchard in its day has been a very productive and profitable one and we were told that in one year it returned dr ripley a hundred dollars besides defraying the expense of repairing the house it is now long past its prime many of the trees are mossgrown and have dead and rotten branches intermixed among the green and fruitful ones and it may well be so for i suppose some of the trees may have been set out by mr emerson who died in the first year of the revolutionary war neither will the fruit probably bear comparison with the delicate productions of modern pomology  most of the trees seem to have abundant burdens upon them but they are homely russet apples fit only for baking and cooking  but we are yet to have practical experience of our fruit justice shallows orchard with its choice pippins and leathercoats was doubtless much superior  nevertheless it pleases me to think of the good minister walking in the shadows of these old fantastically shaped applestrees here plucking some of the fruit to taste there pruning away a too luxuriant branch and all the while computing how many barrels may be filled and how large a sum will be added to his stipend by their sale  and the same trees offer their fruit to me as freely as they did to himtheir old branches like withered hands and arms holding out apples of the same flavor as they held out to dr ripley in his lifetime thus the trees as living existences form a peculiar link between the dead and us  my fancy has always found something very interesting in an orchard  appletrees and all fruittrees have a domestic character which brings them into relationship with man  they have lost in a great measure the wild nature of the foresttree and have grown humanized by receiving the care of man and by contributing to his wants  they have become a part of the family and their individual characters are as well understood and appreciated as those of the human members  one tree is harsh and crabbed another mild one is churlish and illiberal another exhausts itself with its freehearted bounties  even the shapes of appletrees have great individuality into such strange postures do they put themselves and thrust their contorted branches so grotesquely in all directions  and when they have stood around a house for many years and held converse with successive dynasties of occupants and gladdened their hearts so often in the fruitful autumn then it would seem almost sacrilege to cut them down  besides the appletrees there are various other kinds of fruit in close vicinity to the house  when we first arrived there were several trees of ripe cherries but so sour that we allowed them to wither upon the branches  two long rows of currantbushes supplied us abundantly for nearly four weeks  there are a good many peachtrees but all of an old datetheir branches rotten gummy and mossyand their fruit i fear will be of very inferior quality  they produce most abundantly howeverthe peaches being almost as numerous as the leaves and even the sprouts and suckers from the roots of the old trees have fruit upon them  then three are peartrees of various kinds and one or two quincetrees  on the whole these fruittrees and the other items and adjuncts of the place convey a very agreeable idea of the outward comfort in which the good old doctor must have spent his life everything seems to have fallen to his lot that could possibly be supposed to render the life of a country clergyman easy and prosperous there is a barn which probably used to be filled annually with his hay and other agricultural products  there are sheds and a henhouse and a pigeonhouse and an old stone pigsty the open portion of which is overgrown with tall weeds indicating that no grunter has recently occupied it    i have serious thoughts of inducting a new incumbent in this part of the parsonage  it is our duty to support a pig even if we have no design of feasting upon him and for my own part i have a great sympathy and interest for the whole race of porkers and should have much amusement in studying the character of a pig  perhaps i might try to bring out his moral and intellectual nature and cultivate his affections  a cat too and perhaps a dog would be desirable additions to our household   august 10ththe natural taste of man for the original adams occupation is fast developing itself in me  i find that i am a good deal interested in our garden although as it was planted before we came here i do not feel the same affection for the plants that i should if the seed had been sown by my own hands  it is something like nursing and educating another persons children  still it was a very pleasant moment when i gathered the first stringbeans which were the earliest esculent that the garden contributed to our table  and i love to watch the successive development of each new vegetable and mark its daily growth which always affects me with surprise  it is as if something were being created under my own inspection and partly by my own aid  one day perchance i look at my beanvines and see only the green leaves clambering up the poles again tomorrow i give a second glance and there are the delicate blossoms and a third day on a somewhat closer observation i discover the tender young beans hiding among the foliage  then each morning i watch the swelling of the pods and calculate how soon they will be ready to yield their treasures  all this gives a pleasure and an ideality hitherto unthought of to the business of providing sustenance for my family  i suppose adam felt it in paradise and of merely and exclusively earthly enjoyments there are few purer and more harmless to be experienced speaking of beans by the way they are a classical food and their culture must have been the occupation of many ancient sages and heroes summersquashes are a very pleasant vegetable to be acquainted with they grow in the forms of urns and vasessome shallow others deeper and all with a beautifully scalloped edge  almost any squash in our garden might be copied by a sculptor and would look lovely in marble or in china and if i could afford it i would have exact imitations of the real vegetable as portions of my diningservice  they would be very appropriate dishes for holding gardenvegetables  besides the summersquashes we have the crooknecked wintersquash which i always delight to look at when it turns up its big rotundity to ripen in the autumn sun  except a pumpkin there is no vegetable production that imparts such an idea of warmth and comfort to the beholder  our own crop however does not promise to be very abundant for the leaves formed such a superfluous shade over the young blossoms that most of them dropped off without producing the germ of fruit  yesterday and today i have cut off an immense number of leaves and have thus given the remaining blossoms a chance to profit by the air and sunshine but the season is too far advanced i am afraid for the squashes to attain any great bulk and grow yellow in the sun  we have muskmelons and watermelons which promise to supply us with as many as we can eat after all the greatest interest of these vegetables does not seem to consist in their being articles of food  it is rather that we love to see something born into the world and when a great squash or melon is produced it is a large and tangible existence which the imagination can seize hold of and rejoice in  i love also to see my own works contributing to the life and wellbeing of animate nature  it is pleasant to have the bees come and suck honey out of my squashblossoms though when they have laden themselves they fly away to some unknown hive which will give me back nothing in return for what my garden has given them  but there is much more honey in the world and so i am content  indian corn in the prime and glory of its verdure is a very beautiful vegetable both considered in the separate plant and in a mass in a broad field rustling and waving and surging up and down in the breeze and sunshine of a summer afternoon  we have as many as fifty hills i should think which will give us an abundant supply  pray heaven that we may be able to eat it all for it is not pleasant to think that anything which nature has been at the pains to produce should be thrown away  but the hens will be glad of our superfluity and so will the pigs though we have neither hens nor pigs of our own  but hens we must certainly keep  there is something very sociable and quiet and soothing too in their soliloquies and converse among themselves and in an idle and halfmeditative mood it is very pleasant to watch a party of hens picking up their daily subsistence with a gallant chanticleer in the midst of them  milton had evidently contemplated such a picture with delight  i find that i have not given a very complete idea of our garden although it certainly deserves an ample record in this chronicle since my labors in it are the only present labors of my life  besides what i have mentioned we have cucumbervines which today yielded us the first cucumber of the season a bed of beets and another of carrots and another of parsnips and turnips none of which promise us a very abundant harvest  in truth the soil is worn out and moreover received very little manure this season  also we have cabbages in superfluous abundance inasmuch as we neither of us have the least affection for them and it would be unreasonable to expect sarah the cook to eat fifty head of cabbages  tomatoes too we shall have by and by  at our first arrival we found green peas ready for gathering and these instead of the stringbeans were the first offering of the garden to our board   saturday august 13thmy life at this time is more like that of a boy externally than it has been since i was really a boy  it is usually supposed that the cares of life come with matrimony but i seem to have cast off all care and live on with as much easy trust in providence as adam could possibly have felt before he had learned that there was a world beyond paradise  my chief anxiety consists in watching the prosperity of my vegetables in observing how they are affected by the rain or sunshine in lamenting the blight of one squash and rejoicing at the luxurious growth of another  it is as if the original relation between man and nature were restored in my case and as if i were to look exclusively to her for the support of my eve and myselfto trust to her for food and clothing and all things needful with the full assurance that she would not fail me  the fight with the worldthe struggle of a man among menthe agony of the universal effort to wrench the means of living from a host of greedy competitorsall this seems like a dream to me  my business is merely to live and to enjoy and whatever is essential to life and enjoyment will come as naturally as the dew from heaven  this is practically at least my faith  and so i awake in the morning with a boyish thoughtlessness as to how the outgoings of the day are to be provided for and its incomings rendered certain  after breakfast i go forth into my garden and gather whatever the bountiful mother has made fit for our present sustenance and of late days she generally gives me two squashes and a cucumber and promises me green corn and shellbeans very soon  then i pass down through our orchard to the riverside and ramble along its margin in search of flowers usually i discern a fragrant white lily here and there along the shore growing with sweet prudishness beyond the grasp of mortal arm  but it does not escape me so  i know what is its fitting destiny better than the silly flower knows for itself so i wade in heedless of wet trousers and seize the shy lily by its slender stem  thus i make prize of five or six which are as many as usually blossom within my reach in a single morningsome of them partially wormeaten or blighted like virgins with an eating sorrow at the heart others as fair and perfect as natures own idea was when she first imagined this lovely flower  a perfect pondlily is the most satisfactory of flowers  besides these i gather whatever else of beautiful chances to be growing in the moist soil by the riversidean amphibious tribe yet with more richness and grace than the wildflowers of the deep and dry woodlands and hedgerows sometimes the white arrowhead always the blue spires and broad green leaves of the pickerelflower which contrast and harmonize so well with the white lilies  for the last two or three days i have found scattered stalks of the cardinalflower the gorgeous scarlet of which it is a joy even to remember  the world is made brighter and sunnier by flowers of such a hue  even perfume which otherwise is the soul and spirit of a flower may be spared when it arrays itself in this scarlet glory  it is a flower of thought and feeling too it seems to have its roots deep down in the hearts of those who gaze at it  other bright flowers sometimes impress me as wanting sentiment but it is not so with this  well having made up my bunch of flowers i return home with them     then i ascend to my study and generally read or perchance scribble in this journal and otherwise suffer time to loiter onward at his own pleasure till the dinnerhour  in pleasant days the chief event of the afternoon and the happiest one of the day is our walk     so comes the night and i look back upon a day spent in what the world would call idleness and for which i myself can suggest no more appropriate epithet but which nevertheless i cannot feel to have been spent amiss  true it might be a sin and shame in such a world as ours to spend a lifetime in this manner but for a few summer weeks it is good to live as if this world were heaven  and so it is and so it shall be although in a little while a flitting shadow of earthly care and toil will mingle itself with our realities   monday august 15thgeorge hillard and his wife arrived from boston in the dusk of saturday evening to spend sunday with us  it was a pleasant sensation when the coach rumbled up our avenue and wheeled round at the door for i felt that i was regarded as a man with a household a man having a tangible existence and locality in the worldwhen friends came to avail themselves of our hospitality  it was a sort of acknowledgment and reception of us into the corps of married peoplea sanction by no means essential to our peace and wellbeing but yet agreeable enough to receive  so we welcomed them cordially at the door and ushered them into our parlor and soon into the supperroom    the night flitted over us all and passed away and up rose a gray and sullen morning     and we had a splendid breakfast of flapjacks or slapjacks and whortleberries which i gathered on a neighboring hill and perch bream and pout which i hooked out of the river the evening before  about nine oclock hillard and i set out for a walk to walden pond calling by the way at mr emersons to obtain his guidance or directions and he accompanied us in his own illustrious person  we turned aside a little from our way to visit mr  a yeoman of whose homely and selfacquired wisdom mr emerson has a very high opinion  we found him walking in his fields a short and stalwart and sturdy personage of middle age with a face of shrewd and kind expression and manners of natural courtesy  he had a very free flow of talk for with a little induction from mr emerson he began to discourse about the state of the nation agriculture and business in general uttering thoughts that had come to him at the plough and which had a sort of flavor of the fresh earth about them  his views were sensible and characteristic and had grown in the soil where we found them     and he is certainly a man of intellectual and moral substance a sturdy fact a reality something to be felt and touched whose ideas seem to be dug out of his mind as he digs potatoes beets carrots and turnips out of the ground  after leaving mr  we proceeded through woodpaths to walden pond picking blackberries of enormous size along the way  the pond itself was beautiful and refreshing to my soul after such long and exclusive familiarity with our tawny and sluggish river  it lies embosomed among wooded hills it is not very extensive but large enough for waves to dance upon its surface and to look like a piece of blue firmament earthencircled  the shore has a narrow pebbly strand which it was worth a days journey to look at for the sake of the contrast between it and the weedy oozy margin of the river  farther within its depths you perceive a bottom of pure white sand sparkling through the transparent water which methought was the very purest liquid in the world  after mr emerson left us hillard and i bathed in the pond and it does really seem as if my spirit as well as corporeal person were refreshed by that bath  a good deal of mud and river slime had accumulated on my soul but these bright waters washed them all away  we returned home in due season for dinner    to my misfortune however a box of mediterranean wine proved to have undergone the acetous fermentation so that the splendor of the festival suffered some diminution  nevertheless we ate our dinner with a good appetite and afterwards went universally to take our several siestas  meantime there came a shower which so besprinkled the grass and shrubbery as to make it rather wet for our aftertea ramble  the chief result of the walk was the bringing home of an immense burden of the trailing clematisvine now just in blossom and with which all our flowerstands and vases are this morning decorated  on our return we found mr and mrs s and e h who shortly took their leave and we sat up late telling ghoststories  this morning at seven our friends left us  we were both pleased with the visit and so i think were our guests                                       monday august 22di took a walk through the woods yesterday afternoon to mr emersons with a book which margaret fuller had left after a call on saturday eve  i missed the nearest way and wandered into a very secluded portion of the forest for forest it might justly be called so dense and sombre was the shade of oaks and pines  once i wandered into a tract so overgrown with bushes and underbrush that i could scarcely force a passage through  nothing is more annoying than a walk of this kind where one is tormented by an innumerable host of petty impediments  it incenses and depresses me at the same time  always when i flounder into the midst of bushes which cross and intertwine themselves about my legs and brush my face and seize hold of my clothes with their multitudinous gripalways in such a difficulty i feel as if it were almost as well to lie down and die in rage and despair as to go one step farther  it is laughable after i have got out of the moil to think how miserably it affected me for the moment but i had better learn patience betimes for there are many such bushy tracts in this vicinity on the margins of meadows and my walks will often lead me into them  escaping from the bushes i soon came to an open space among the woodsa very lovely spot with the tall old trees standing around as quietly as if no one had intruded there throughout the whole summer  a company of crows were holding their sabbath on their summits  apparently they felt themselves injured or insulted by my presence for with one consent they began to caw caw caw and launching themselves sullenly on the air took flight to some securer solitude  mine probably was the first human shape that they had seen all day longat least if they had been stationary in that spot but perhaps they had winged their way over miles and miles of country had breakfasted on the summit of graylock and dined at the base of wachusett and were merely come to sup and sleep among the quiet woods of concord  but it was my impression at the time that they had sat still and silent on the tops of the trees all through the sabbath day and i felt like one who should unawares disturb an assembly of worshippers  a crow however has no real pretensions to religion in spite of his gravity of mien and black attire  crows are certainly thieves and probably infidels  nevertheless their voices yesterday were in admirable accordance with the influences of the quiet sunny warm yet autumnal afternoon  they were so far above my head that their loud clamor added to the quiet of the scene instead of disturbing it there was no other sound except the song of the cricket which is but an audible stillness for though it be very loud and heard afar yet the mind does not take note of it as a sound so entirely does it mingle and lose its individuality among the other characteristics of coming autumn alas for the summer  the grass is still verdant on the hills and in the valleys the foliage of the trees is as dense as ever and as green the flowers are abundant along the margin of the river and in the hedgerows and deep among the woods the days too are as fervid as they were a month ago and yet in every breath of wind and in every beam of sunshine there is an autumnal influence  i know not how to describe it  methinks there is a sort of coolness amid all the heat and a mildness in the brightest of the sunshine  a breeze cannot stir without thrilling me with the breath of autumn and i behold its pensive glory in the far golden gleams among the long shadows of the trees  the flowers even the brightest of themthe goldenrod and the gorgeous cardinals the most glorious flowers of the yearhave this gentle sadness amid their pomp  pensive autumn is expressed in the glow of every one of them  i have felt this influence earlier in some years than in others sometimes autumn may be perceived even in the early days of july  there is no other feeling like that caused by this faint doubtful yet real perception or rather prophecy of the years decay so deliciously sweet and sad at the same time  after leaving the book at mr emersons i returned through the woods and entering sleepy hollow i perceived a lady reclining near the path which bends along its verge  it was margaret herself  she had been there the whole afternoon meditating or reading for she had a book in her hand with some strange title which i did not understand and have forgotten  she said that nobody had broken her solitude and was just giving utterance to a theory that no inhabitant of concord ever visited sleepy hollow when we saw a group of people entering the sacred precincts  most of them followed a path which led them away from us but an old man passed near us and smiled to see margaret reclining on the ground and me sitting by her side  he made some remark about the beauty of the afternoon and withdrew himself into the shadow of the wood  then we talked about autumn and about the pleasures of being lost in the woods and about the crows whose voices margaret had heard and about the experiences of early childhood whose influence remains upon the character after the recollection of them has passed away and about the sight of mountains from a distance and the view from their summits and about other matters of high and low philosophy  in the midst of our talk we heard footsteps above us on the high bank and while the person was still hidden among the trees he called to margaret of whom he had gotten a glimpse  then he emerged from the green shade and behold it was mr emerson  he appeared to have had a pleasant time for he said that there were muses in the woods today and whispers to be heard in the breezes  it being now nearly six oclock we separatedmargaret and mr emerson towards his home and i towards mine     last evening there was the most beautiful moonlight that ever hallowed this earthly world and when i went to bathe in the river which was as calm as death it seemed like plunging down into the sky  but i had rather be on earth than even in the seventh heaven just now   wednesday august 24thi left home at five oclock this morning to catch some fish for breakfast  i shook our summer appletree and ate the golden apple which fell from it  methinks these early apples which come as a golden promise before the treasures of autumnal fruit are almost more delicious than anything that comes afterwards  we have but one such tree in our orchard but it supplies us with a daily abundance and probably will do so for at least a week to come  meantime other trees begin to cast their ripening windfalls upon the grass and when i taste them and perceive their mellowed flavor and blackening seeds i feel somewhat overwhelmed with the impending bounties of providence  i suppose adam in paradise did not like to see his fruits decaying on the ground after he had watched them through the sunny days of the worlds first summer  however insects at the worst will hold a festival upon them so that they will not be thrown away in the great scheme of nature  moreover i have one advantage over the primeval adam inasmuch as there is a chance of disposing of my superfluous fruits among people who inhabit no paradise of their own  passing a little way down along the riverside i threw in my line and soon drew out one of the smallest possible of fishes  it seemed to be a pretty good morning for the angleran autumnal coolness in the air a clear sky but with a fog across the lowlands and on the surface of the river which a gentle breeze sometimes condensed into wreaths  at first i could barely discern the opposite shore of the river but as the sun arose the vapors gradually dispersed till only a warm smoky tint was left along the waters surface  the farmhouses across the river made their appearance out of the dusky cloud the voices of boys were heard shouting to the cattle as they drove them to the pastures a man whetted his scythe and set to work in a neighboring meadow  meantime i continued to stand on the oozy margin of the stream beguiling the little fish and though the scaly inhabitants of our river partake somewhat of the character of their native element and are but sluggish biters still i contrived to pull out not far from two dozen  they were all bream a broad flat almost circular fish shaped a good deal like a flounder but swimming on their edges instead of on their sides  as far as mere pleasure is concerned it is hardly worth while to fish in our river it is so much like angling in a mudpuddle and one does not attach the idea of freshness and purity to the fishes as we do to those which inhabit swift transparent streams or haunt the shores of the great briny deep standing on the weedy margin and throwing the line over the elderbushes that dip into the water it seems as if we could catch nothing but frogs and mudturtles or reptiles akin to them  and even when a fish of reputable aspect is drawn out one feels a shyness about touching him as to our river its character was admirably expressed last night by some one who said it was too lazy to keep itself clean  i might write pages and pages and only obscure the impression which this brief sentence conveys  nevertheless we made bold to eat some of my fish for breakfast and found them very savory and the rest shall meet with due entertainment at dinner together with some shellbeans green corn and cucumbers from our garden so this days food comes directly and entirely from beneficent nature without the intervention of any third person between her and us   saturday august 27tha peachtree which grows beside our house and brushes against the window is so burdened with fruit that i have had to prop it up  i never saw more splendid peaches in appearancegreat round crimsoncheeked beauties clustering all over the tree  a peartree likewise is maturing a generous burden of small sweet fruit which will require to be eaten at about the same time as the peaches there is something pleasantly annoying in this superfluous abundance it is like standing under a tree of ripe apples and giving it a shake with the intention of bringing down a single one when behold a dozen come thumping about our ears  but the idea of the infinite generosity and exhaustless bounty of our mother nature is well worth attaining and i never had it so vividly as now when i find myself with the few mouths which i am to feed the sole inheritor of the old clergymans wealth of fruits  his children his friends in the village and the clerical guests who came to preach in his pulpit were all wont to eat and be filled from these trees  now all these hearty old people have passed away and in their stead is a solitary pair whose appetites are more than satisfied with the windfalls which the trees throw down at their feet  howbeit we shall have now and then a guest to keep our peaches and pears from decaying  g b my old fellowlaborer at the community at brook farm called on me last evening and dined here today  he has been cultivating vegetables at plymouth this summer and selling them in the market  what a singular mode of life for a man of education and refinementto spend his days in hard and earnest bodily toil and then to convey the products of his labor in a wheelbarrow to the public market and there retail them outa peck of peas or beans a bunch of turnips a squash a dozen ears of green corn  few men without some eccentricity of character would have the moral strength to do this and it is very striking to find such strength combined with the utmost gentleness and an uncommon regularity of nature  occasionally he returns for a day or two to resume his place among scholars and idle people as for instance the present week when he has thrown aside his spade and hoe to attend the commencement at cambridge  he is a rare mana perfect original yet without any one salient point a character to be felt and understood but almost impossible to describe for should you seize upon any characteristic it would inevitably be altered and distorted in the process of writing it down  our few remaining days of summer have been latterly grievously darkened with clouds  today there has been an hour or two of hot sunshine but the sun rose amid cloud and mist and before he could dry up the moisture of last nights shower upon the trees and grass the clouds have gathered between him and us again  this afternoon the thunder rumbles in the distance and i believe a few drops of rain have fallen but the weight of the shower has burst elsewhere leaving us nothing but its sullen gloom  there is a muggy warmth in the atmosphere which takes all the spring and vivacity out of the mind and body   sunday august 28thstill another rainy daythe heaviest rain i believe that has fallen since we came to concord not two months ago there never was a more sombre aspect of all external nature  i gaze from the open window of my study somewhat disconsolately and observe the great willowtree which shades the house and which has caught and retained a whole cataract of rain among its leaves and boughs and all the fruittrees too are dripping continually even in the brief intervals when the clouds give us a respite  if shaken to bring down the fruit they will discharge a shower upon the head of him who stands beneath  the rain is warm coming from some southern region but the willow attests that it is an autumnal spell of weather by scattering down no infrequent multitude of yellow leaves which rest upon the sloping roof of the house and strew the gravelpath and the grass  the other trees do not yet shed their leaves though in some of them a lighter tint of verdure tending towards yellow is perceptible  all day long we hear the water drip drip dripping splash splash splashing from the eaves and babbling and foaming into the tubs which have been set out to receive it  the old unpainted shingles and boards of the mansion and outhouses are black with the moisture which they have imbibed  looking at the river we perceive that its usually smooth and mirrored surface is blurred by the infinity of raindrops the whole landscapegrass trees and houseshas a completely watersoaked aspect as if the earth were wet through  the wooded hill about a mile distant whither we went to gather whortleberries has a mist upon its summit as if the demon of the rain were enthroned there and if we look to the sky it seems as if all the water that had been poured down upon us were as nothing to what is to come  once in a while indeed there is a gleam of sky along the horizon or a halfcheerful halfsullen lighting up of the atmosphere the raindrops cease to patter down except when the trees shake off a gentle shower but soon we hear the broad quiet slow and sure recommencement of the rain  the river if i mistake not has risen considerably during the day and its current will acquire some degree of energy  in this sombre weather when some mortals almost forget that there ever was any golden sunshine or ever will be any hereafter others seem absolutely to radiate it from their own hearts and minds  the gloom cannot pervade them they conquer it and drive it quite out of their sphere and create a moral rainbow of hope upon the blackest cloud  as for myself i am little other than a cloud at such seasons but such persons contrive to make me a sunny one shining all through me  and thus even without the support of a stated occupation i survive these sullen days and am happy  this morning we read the sermon on the mount  in the course of the forenoon the rain abated for a season and i went out and gathered some corn and summersquashes and picked up the windfalls of apples and pears and peaches  wet wet weteverything was wet the blades of the cornstalks moistened me the wet grass soaked my boots quite through the trees threw their reserved showers upon my head and soon the remorseless rain began anew and drove me into the house  when shall we be able to walk again to the far hills and plunge into the deep woods and gather more cardinals along the rivers margin  the track along which we trod is probably under water now  how inhospitable nature is during a rain  in the fervid heat of sunny days she still retains some degree of mercy for us she has shady spots whither the sun cannot come but she provides no shelter against her storms  it makes one shiver to think how dripping with wet are those deep umbrageous nooks those overshadowed banks where we find such enjoyment during sultry afternoons  and what becomes of the birds in such a soaking rain as this  is hope and an instinctive faith so mixed up with their nature that they can be cheered by the thought that the sunshine will return or do they think as i almost do that there is to be no sunshine any more  very disconsolate must they be among the dripping leaves and when a single summer makes so important a portion of their lives it seems hard that so much of it should be dissolved in rain  i likewise am greedy of the summer days for my own sake the life of man does not contain so many of them that one can be spared without regret   tuesday august 30thi was promised in the midst of sundays rain that monday should be fair and behold the sun came back to us and brought one of the most perfect days ever made since adam was driven out of paradise  by the by was there ever any rain in paradise  if so how comfortless must eves bower have been and what a wretched and rheumatic time must they have had on their bed of wet roses  it makes me shiver to think of it  well it seemed as if the world was newly created yesterday morning and i beheld its birth for i had risen before the sun was over the hill and had gone forth to fish  how instantaneously did all dreariness and heaviness of the earths spirit flit away before one smile of the beneficent sun  this proves that all gloom is but a dream and a shadow and that cheerfulness is the real truth  it requires many clouds long brooding over us to make us sad but one gleam of sunshine always suffices to cheer up the landscape  the banks of the river actually laughed when the sunshine fell upon them and the river itself was alive and cheerful and by way of fun and amusement it had swept away many wreaths of meadowhay and old rotten branches of trees and all such trumpery  these matters came floating downwards whirling round and round in the eddies or hastening onward in the main current and many of them before this time have probably been carried into the merrimack and will be borne onward to the sea  the spots where i stood to fish on my preceding excursion were now under water and the tops of many of the bushes along the rivers margin barely emerged from the stream  large spaces of meadow are overflowed  there was a northwestwind throughout the day and as many clouds the remnants of departed gloom were scattered about the sky the breeze was continually blowing them across the sun  for the most part they were gone again in a moment but sometimes the shadow remained long enough to make me dread a return of sulky weather  then would come the burst of sunshine making me feel as if a rainy day were henceforth an impossibility     in the afternoon mr emerson called bringing mr   he is a good sort of humdrum parson enough and well fitted to increase the stock of manuscript sermons of which there must be a fearful quantity already in the world  mr  however is probably one of the best and most useful of his class because no suspicion of the necessity of his profession constituted as it now is to mankind and of his own usefulness and success in it has hitherto disturbed him and therefore he labors with faith and confidence as ministers did a hundred years ago  after the visitors were gone i sat at the gallery window looking down the avenue and soon there appeared an elderly womana homely decent old matron dressed in a dark gown and with what seemed a manuscript book under her arm  the wind sported with her gown and blew her veil across her face and seemed to make game of her though on a nearer view she looked like a sad old creature with a pale thin countenance and somewhat of a wild and wandering expression  she had a singular gait reeling as it were and yet not quite reeling from one side of the path to the other going onward as if it were not much matter whether she went straight or crooked  such were my observations as she approached through the scattered sunshine and shade of our long avenue until reaching the door she gave a knock and inquired for the lady of the house  her manuscript contained a certificate stating that the old woman was a widow from a foreign land who had recently lost her son and was now utterly destitute of friends and kindred and without means of support appended to the certificate there was a list of names of people who had bestowed charity on her with the amounts of their several donations none as i recollect higher than twentyfive cents  here is a strange life and a character fit for romance and poetry  all the early part of her life i suppose and much of her widowhood were spent in the quiet of a home with kinsfolk around her and children and the lifelong gossiping acquaintances that some women always create about them  but in her decline she has wandered away from all these and from her native country itself and is a vagrant yet with something of the homeliness and decency of aspect belonging to one who has been a wife and mother and has had a roof of her own above her headand with all this a wildness proper to her present life  i have a liking for vagrants of all sorts and never that i know of refused my mite to a wandering beggar when i had anything in my own pocket  there is so much wretchedness in the world that we may safely take the word of any mortal professing to need our assistance and even should we be deceived still the good to ourselves resulting from a kind act is worth more than the trifle by which we purchase it  it is desirable i think that such persons should be permitted to roam through our land of plenty scattering the seeds of tenderness and charity as birds of passage bear the seeds of precious plants from land to land without even dreaming of the office which they perform   thursday september 1stmr thoreau dined with us yesterday    he is a keen and delicate observer of naturea genuine observerwhich i suspect is almost as rare a character as even an original poet and nature in return for his love seems to adopt him as her especial child and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness  he is familiar with beast fish fowl and reptile and has strange stories to tell of adventures and friendly passages with these lower brethren of mortality  herb and flower likewise wherever they grow whether in garden or wildwood are his familiar friends  he is also on intimate terms with the clouds and can tell the portents of storms  it is a characteristic trait that he has a great regard for the memory of the indian tribes whose wild life would have suited him so well and strange to say he seldom walks over a ploughed field without picking up an arrowpoint spearhead or other relic of the red man as if their spirits willed him to be the inheritor of their simple wealth  with all this he has more than a tincture of literaturea deep and true taste for poetry especially for the elder poets and he is a good writerat least he has written a good article a rambling disquisition on natural history in the last dial which he says was chiefly made up from journals of his own observations  methinks this article gives a very fair image of his mind and characterso true innate and literal in observation yet giving the spirit as well as letter of what he sees even as a lake reflects its wooded banks showing every leaf yet giving the wild beauty of the whole scene  then there are in the article passages of cloudy and dreamy metaphysics and also passages where his thoughts seem to measure and attune themselves into spontaneous verse as they rightfully may since there is real poetry in them  there is a basis of good sense and of moral truth too throughout the article which also is a reflection of his character for he is not unwise to think and feel and i find him a healthy and wholesome man to know  after dinner at which we cut the first watermelon and muskmelon that our garden has grown mr thoreau and i walked up the bank of the river and at a certain point he shouted for his boat  forthwith a young man paddled it across and mr thoreau and i voyaged farther up the stream which soon became more beautiful than any picture with its dark and quiet sheet of water half shaded half sunny between high and wooded banks  the late rains have swollen the stream so much that many trees are standing up to their knees as it were in the water and boughs which lately swung high in air now dip and drink deep of the passing wave  as to the poor cardinals which glowed upon the bank a few days since i could see only a few of their scarlet hats peeping above the tide  mr thoreau managed the boat so perfectly either with two paddles or with one that it seemed instinct with his own will and to require no physical effort to guide it  he said that when some indians visited concord a few years ago he found that he had acquired without a teacher their precise method of propelling and steering a canoe nevertheless he was desirous of selling the boat of which he was so fit a pilot and which was built by his own hands so i agreed to take it and accordingly became possessor of the musketaquid  i wish i could acquire the aquatic skill of the original owner   september 2dyesterday afternoon mr thoreau arrived with the boat the adjacent meadow being overflowed by the rise of the stream he had rowed directly to the foot of the orchard and landed at the bars after floating over forty or fifty yards of water where people were lately making hay  i entered the boat with him in order to have the benefit of a lesson in rowing and paddling    i managed indeed to propel the boat by rowing with two oars but the use of the single paddle is quite beyond my present skill  mr thoreau had assured me that it was only necessary to will the boat to go in any particular direction and she would immediately take that course as if imbued with the spirit of the steersman  it may be so with him but it is certainly not so with me the boat seemed to be bewitched and turned its head to every point of the compass except the right one  he then took the paddle himself and though i could observe nothing peculiar in his management of it the musketaquid immediately became as docile as a trained steed  i suspect that she has not yet transferred her affections from her old master to her new one  by and by when we are better acquainted she will grow more tractable    we propose to change her name from musketaquid the indian name of the concord river meaning the river of meadows to the pondlily which will be very beautiful and appropriate as during the summer season she will bring home many a cargo of pondlilies from along the rivers weedy shore  it is not very likely that i shall make such long voyages in her as mr thoreau has made  he once followed our river down to the merrimack and thence i believe to newburyport in this little craft  in the evening   called to see us wishing to talk with me about a boston periodical of which he had heard that i was to be editor and to which he desired to contribute  he is an odd and clever young man with nothing very peculiar about himsome originality and selfinspiration in his character but none or very little in his intellect  nevertheless the lad himself seems to feel as if he were a genius  i like him well enough however but after all these originals in a small way after one has seen a few of them become more dull and commonplace than even those who keep the ordinary pathway of life  they have a rule and a routine which they follow with as little variety as other people do their rule and routine and when once we have fathomed their mystery nothing can be more wearisome  an innate perception and reflection of truth give the only sort of originality that does not finally grow intolerable   september 4thi made a voyage in the pondlily all by myself yesterday morning and was much encouraged by my success in causing the boat to go whither i would  i have always liked to be afloat but i think i have never adequately conceived of the enjoyment till now when i begin to feel a power over that which supports me  i suppose i must have felt something like this sense of triumph when i first learned to swim but i have forgotten it  o that i could run wildthat is that i could put myself into a true relation with nature and be on friendly terms with all congenial elements  we had a thunderstorm last evening and today has been a cool breezy autumnal day such as my soul and body love   september 18thhow the summertime flits away even while it seems to be loitering onward arm in arm with autumn  of late i have walked but little over the hills and through the woods my leisure being chiefly occupied with my boat which i have now learned to manage with tolerable skill  yesterday afternoon i made a voyage alone up the north branch of concord river  there was a strong westwind blowing dead against me which together with the current increased by the height of the water made the first part of the passage pretty toilsome  the black river was all dimpled over with little eddies and whirlpools and the breeze moreover caused the billows to beat against the bow of the boat with a sound like the flapping of a birds wing  the waterweeds where they were discernible through the tawny water were straight outstretched by the force of the current looking as if they were forced to hold on to their roots with all their might  if for a moment i desisted from paddling the head of the boat was swept round by the combined might of wind and tide  however i toiled onward stoutly and entering the north branch soon found myself floating quietly along a tranquil stream sheltered from the breeze by the woods and a lofty hill  the current likewise lingered along so gently that it was merely a pleasure to propel the boat against it  i never could have conceived that there was so beautiful a riverscene in concord as this of the north branch  the stream flows through the midmost privacy and deepest heart of a wood which as if but half satisfied with its presence calm gentle and unobtrusive as it is seems to crowd upon it and barely to allow it passage for the trees are rooted on the very verge of the water and dip their pendent branches into it  on one side there is a high bank forming the side of a hill the indian name of which i have forgotten though mr thoreau told it to me and here in some instances the trees stand leaning over the river stretching out their arms as if about to plunge in headlong  on the other side the bank is almost on a level with the water and there the quiet congregation of trees stood with feet in the flood and fringed with foliage down to its very surface  vines here and there twine themselves about bushes or aspens or aldertrees and hang their clusters though scanty and infrequent this season so that i can reach them from my boat  i scarcely remember a scene of more complete and lovely seclusion than the passage of the river through this wood  even an indian canoe in olden times could not have floated onward in deeper solitude than my boat  i have never elsewhere had such an opportunity to observe how much more beautiful reflection is than what we call reality  the sky and the clustering foliage on either hand and the effect of sunlight as it found its way through the shade giving lightsome hues in contrast with the quiet depth of the prevailing tints all these seemed unsurpassably beautiful when beheld in upper air  but on gazing downward there they were the same even to the minutest particular yet arrayed in ideal beauty which satisfied the spirit incomparably more than the actual scene  i am half convinced that the reflection is indeed the reality the real thing which nature imperfectly images to our grosser sense  at any rate the disembodied shadow is nearest to the soul  there were many tokens of autumn in this beautiful picture  two or three of the trees were actually dressed in their coats of many colorsthe real scarlet and gold which they wear before they put on mourning  these stood on low marshy spots where a frost has probably touched them already  others were of a light fresh green resembling the hues of spring though this likewise is a token of decay  the great mass of the foliage however appears unchanged but ever and anon down came a yellow leaf half flitting upon the air half falling through it and finally settling upon the water  a multitude of these were floating here and there along the river many of them curling upward so as to form little boats fit for fairies to voyage in  they looked strangely pretty with yet a melancholy prettiness as they floated along  the general aspect of the river however differed but little from that of summerat least the difference defies expression  it is more in the character of the rich yellow sunlight than in aught else  the water of the stream has now a thrill of autumnal coolness yet whenever a broad gleam fell across it through an interstice of the foliage multitudes of insects were darting to and fro upon its surface  the sunshine thus falling across the dark river has a most beautiful effect  it burnishes it as it were and yet leaves it as dark as ever  on my return i suffered the boat to float almost of its own will down the stream and caught fish enough for this mornings breakfast  but partly from a qualm of conscience i finally put them all into the water again and saw them swim away as if nothing had happened   monday october 10tha long while indeed since my last date  but the weather has been generally sunny and pleasant though often very cold and i cannot endure to waste anything so precious as autumnal sunshine by staying in the house  so i have spent almost all the daylight hours in the open air  my chief amusement has been boating up and down the river a week or two ago september 27 and 28 i went on a pedestrian excursion with mr emerson and was gone two days and one night it being the first and only night that i have spent away from home  we were that night at the village of harvard and the next morning walked three miles farther to the shaker village where we breakfasted  mr emerson had a theological discussion with two of the shaker brethren but the particulars of it have faded from my memory and all the other adventures of the tour have now so lost their freshness that i cannot adequately recall them  wherefore let them rest untold  i recollect nothing so well as the aspect of some fringed gentians which we saw growing by the roadside and which were so beautiful that i longed to turn back and pluck them  after an arduous journey we arrived safe home in the afternoon of the second daythe first time that i ever came home in my life for i never had a home before  on saturday of the same week my friend d r came to see us and stayed till tuesday morning  on wednesday there was a cattleshow in the village of which i would give a description if it had possessed any picturesque points  the foregoing are the chief outward events of our life  in the mean time autumn has been advancing and is said to be a month earlier than usual  we had frosts sufficient to kill the bean and squash vines more than a fortnight ago but there has since been some of the most delicious indiansummer weather that i ever experiencedmild sweet perfect days in which the warm sunshine seemed to embrace the earth and all earths children with love and tenderness  generally however the bright days have been vexed with winds from the northwest somewhat too keen and high for comfort  these winds have strewn our avenue with withered leaves although the trees still retain some density of foliage which is now imbrowned or otherwise variegated by autumn our apples too have been falling falling falling and we have picked the fairest of them from the dewy grass and put them in our storeroom and elsewhere  on thursday john flint began to gather those which remained on the trees and i suppose they will amount to nearly twenty barrels or perhaps more  as usual when i have anything to sell apples are very low indeed in price and will not fetch me more than a dollar a barrel  i have sold my share of the potatofield for twenty dollars and ten bushels of potatoes for my own use  this may suffice for the economical history of our recent life   12 oclock mjust now i heard a sharp tapping at the window of my study and looking up from my book a volume of rabelais behold the head of a little bird who seemed to demand admittance  he was probably attempting to get a fly which was on the pane of glass against which he rapped and on my first motion the feathered visitor took wing  this incident had a curious effect on me  it impressed me as if the bird had been a spiritual visitant so strange was it that this little wild thing should seem to ask our hospitality   november 8thi am sorry that our journal has fallen so into neglect but i see no chance of amendment  all my scribbling propensities will be far more than gratified in writing nonsense for the press so that any gratuitous labor of the pen becomes peculiarly distasteful  since the last date we have paid a visit of nine days to boston and salem whence we returned a week ago yesterday  thus we lost above a week of delicious autumnal weather which should have been spent in the woods or upon the river  ever since our return however until today there has been a succession of genuine indiansummer days with gentle winds or none at all and a misty atmosphere which idealizes all nature and a mild beneficent sunshine inviting one to lie down in a nook and forget all earthly care  today the sky is dark and lowering and occasionally lets fall a few sullen tears  i suppose we must bid farewell to indian summer now and expect no more love and tenderness from mother nature till next spring be well advanced  she has already made herself as unlovely in outward aspect as can well be  we took a walk to sleepy hollow yesterday and beheld scarcely a green thing except the everlasting verdure of the family of pines which indeed are trees to thank god for at this season  a range of young birches had retained a pretty liberal coloring of yellow or tawny leaves which became very cheerful in the sunshine  there were one or two oaktrees whose foliage still retained a deep dusky red which looked rich and warm but most of the oaks had reached the last stage of autumnal decaythe dusky brown hue  millions of their leaves strew the woods and rustle underneath the foot but enough remain upon the boughs to make a melancholy harping when the wind sweeps over them  we found some fringed gentians in the meadow most of them blighted and withered but a few were quite perfect  the other day since our return from salem i found a violet yet it was so cold that day that a large pool of water under the shadow of some trees had remained frozen from morning till afternoon  the ice was so thick as not to be broken by some sticks and small stones which i threw upon it  but ice and snow too will soon be no extraordinary matters with us  during the last week we have had three stoves put up and henceforth no light of a cheerful fire will gladden us at eventide  stoves are detestable in every respect except that they keep us perfectly comfortable   thursday november 24ththis is thanksgiving day a good old festival and we have kept it with our hearts and besides have made good cheer upon our turkey and pudding and pies and custards although none sat at our board but our two selves  there was a new and livelier sense i think that we have at last found a home and that a new family has been gathered since the last thanksgiving day  there have been many bright cold days latterlyso cold that it has required a pretty rapid pace to keep ones self warm awalking  day before yesterday i saw a party of boys skating on a pond of water that has overflowed a neighboring meadow running water has not yet frozen  vegetation has quite come to a stand except in a few sheltered spots  in a deep ditch we found a tall plant of the freshest and healthiest green which looked as if it must have grown within the last few weeks  we wander among the woodpaths which are very pleasant in the sunshine of the afternoons the trees looking rich and warmsuch of them i mean as have retained their russet leaves and where the leaves are strewn along the paths or heaped plentifully in some hollow of the hills the effect is not without a charm  today the morning rose with rain which has since changed to snow and sleet and now the landscape is as dreary as can well be imaginedwhite with the brownness of the soil and withered grass everywhere peeping out  the swollen river of a leaden hue drags itself sullenly along and this may be termed the first winters day   friday march 31st 1843the first month of spring is already gone and still the snow lies deep on hill and valley and the river is still frozen from bank to bank although a late rain has caused pools of water to stand on the surface of the ice and the meadows are overflowed into broad lakes  such a protracted winter has not been known for twenty years at least  i have almost forgotten the woodpaths and shady places which i used to know so well last summer and my views are so much confined to the interior of our mansion that sometimes looking out of the window i am surprised to catch a glimpse of houses at no great distance which had quite passed out of my recollection  from present appearances another month may scarcely suffice to wash away all the snow from the open country and in the woods and hollows it may linger yet longer  the winter will not have been a day less than five months long and it would not be unfair to call it seven  a great space indeed to miss the smile of nature in a single year of human life  even out of the midst of happiness i have sometimes sighed and groaned for i love the sunshine and the green woods and the sparkling blue water and it seems as if the picture of our inward bliss should be set in a beautiful frame of outward nature    as to the daily course of our life i have written with pretty commendable diligence averaging from two to four hours a day and the result is seen in various magazines  i might have written more if it had seemed worth while but i was content to earn only so much gold as might suffice for our immediate wants having prospect of official station and emolument which would do away with the necessity of writing for bread  those prospects have not yet had their fulfilment and we are well content to wait because an office would inevitably remove us from our present happy homeat least from an outward home for there is an inner one that will accompany us wherever we go  meantime the magazine people do not pay their debts so that we taste some of the inconveniences of poverty  it is an annoyance not a trouble  every day i trudge through snow and slosh to the village look into the postoffice and spend an hour at the readingroom and then return home generally without having spoken a word to a human being    in the way of exercise i saw and split wood and physically i never was in a better condition than now  this is chiefly owing doubtless to a satisfied heart in aid of which comes the exercise above mentioned and about a fair proportion of intellectual labor  on the 9th of this mouth we left home again on a visit to boston and salem  i alone went to salem where i resumed all my bachelor habits for nearly a fortnight leading the same life in which ten years of my youth flitted away like a dream  but how much changed was i  at last i had caught hold of a reality which never could be taken from me  it was good thus to get apart from my happiness for the sake of contemplating it on the 21st i returned to boston and went out to cambridge to dine with longfellow whom i had not seen since his return from europe  the next day we came back to our old house which had been deserted all this time for our servant had gone with us to boston   friday april 7thmy wife has gone to boston to see her sister m who is to be married in two or three weeks and then immediately to visit europe for six months    i betook myself to sawing and splitting wood there being an inward unquietness which demanded active exercise and i sawed i think more briskly than ever before  when i reentered the house it was with somewhat of a desolate feeling yet not without an intermingled pleasure as being the more conscious that all separation was temporary and scarcely real even for the little time that it may last  after my solitary dinner i lay down with the dial in my hand and attempted to sleep but sleep would not come    so i arose and began this record in the journal almost at the commencement of which i was interrupted by a visit from mr thoreau who came to return a book and to announce his purpose of going to reside at staten island as private tutor in the family of mr emersons brother  we had some conversation upon this subject and upon the spiritual advantages of change of place and upon the dial and upon mr alcott and other kindred or concatenated subjects  i am glad on mr thoreaus own account that he is going away as he is out of health and may be benefited by his removal but on my account i should like to have him remain here he being one of the few persons i think with whom to hold intercourse is like hearing the wind among the boughs of a foresttree and with all this wild freedom there is high and classic cultivation in him too     i had a purpose if circumstances would permit of passing the whole term of my wifes absence without speaking a word to any human being but now my pythagorean vow has been broken within three or four hours after her departure   saturday april 8thafter journalizing yesterday afternoon i went out and sawed and split wood till teatime then studied german translating lenore with an occasional glance at a beautiful sunset which i could not enjoy sufficiently by myself to induce me to lay aside the book after lamplight finished lenore and drowsed over voltaires candide occasionally refreshing myself with a tune from mr thoreaus musicalbox which he had left in my keeping  the evening was but a dull one  i retired soon after nine and felt some apprehension that the old doctors ghost would take this opportunity to visit me but i rather think his former visitations have not been intended for me and that i am not sufficiently spiritual for ghostly communication  at all events i met with no disturbance of the kind and slept soundly enough till six oclock or thereabouts  the forenoon was spent with the pen in my hand and sometimes i had the glimmering of an idea and endeavored to materialize it in words but on the whole my mind was idly vagrant and refused to work to any systematic purpose  between eleven and twelve i went to the postoffice but found no letter then spent above an hour reading at the athenaeum  on my way home i encountered mr flint for the first time these many weeks although he is our next neighbor in one direction  i inquired if he could sell us some potatoes and he promised to send half a bushel for trial  also he encouraged me to hope that he might buy a barrel of our apples  after my encounter with mr flint i returned to our lonely old abbey opened the door without the usual heartspring ascended to my study and began to read a tale of tieck slow work and dull work too  anon molly the cook rang the bell for dinnera sumptuous banquet of stewed veal and macaroni to which i sat down in solitary state  my appetite served me sufficiently to eat with but not for enjoyment  nothing has a zest in my present widowed state thus far i had written when mr emerson called  after dinner i lay down on the couch with the dial in my hand as a soporific and had a short nap then began to journalize  mr emerson came with a sunbeam in his face and we had as good a talk as i ever remember to have had with him  he spoke of margaret fuller who he says has risen perceptibly into a higher state since their last meeting  there rings the teabell  then we discoursed of ellery channing a volume of whose poems is to be immediately published with revisions by mr emerson himself and mr sam g ward    he calls them poetry for poets  next mr thoreau was discussed and his approaching departure in respect to which we agreed pretty well    we talked of brook farm and the singular moral aspects which it presents and the great desirability that its progress and developments should be observed and its history written also of c n who it appears is passing through a new moral phasis  he is silent inexpressive talks little or none and listens without response except a sardonic laugh and some of his friends think that he is passing into permanent eclipse  various other matters were considered or glanced at and finally between five and six oclock mr emerson took his leave  i then went out to chop wood my allotted space for which had been very much abridged by his visit but i was not sorry  i went on with the journal for a few minutes before tea and have finished the present record in the setting sunshine and gathering dusk      salem    here i am in my old chamber where i produced those stupendous works of fiction which have since impressed the universe with wonderment and awe  to this chamber doubtless in all succeeding ages pilgrims will come to pay their tribute of reverencethey will put off their shoes at the threshold for fear of desecrating the tattered old carpets  there they will exclaim is the very bed in which he slumbered and where he was visited by those ethereal visions which he afterwards fixed forever in glowing words  there is the washstand at which this exalted personage cleansed himself from the stains of earth and rendered his outward man a fitting exponent of the pure soul within there in its mahogany frame is the dressingglass which often reflected that noble brow those hyacinthine locks that mouth bright with smiles or tremulous with feeling that flashing or melting eye thatin short every item of the magnanimous face of this unexampled man  there is the pine tablethere the old flagbottomed chair on which he sat and at which he scribbled during his agonies of inspiration  there is the old chest of drawers in which he kept what shirts a poor author may be supposed to have possessed  there is the closet in which was reposited his threadbare suit of black  there is the wornout shoebrush with which this polished writer polished his boots there is but i believe this will be pretty much all so here i close the catalogue     a cloudy veil stretches over the abyss of my nature  i have however no love of secrecy and darkness  i am glad to think that god sees through my heart and if any angel has power to penetrate into it he is welcome to know everything that is there  yes and so may any mortal who is capable of full sympathy and therefore worthy to come into my depths but he must find his own way there  i can neither guide nor enlighten him  it is this involuntary reserve i suppose that has given the objectivity to my writings and when people think that i am pouring myself out in a tale or an essay i am merely telling what is common to human nature not what is peculiar to myself  i sympathize with them not they with me     i have recently been both lectured about and preached about here in my native city the preacher was rev mr fox of newburyport but how he contrived to put me into a sermon i know not  i trust he took for his text behold an israelite indeed in whom there is no guile   salem march 12th    that poor home how desolate it is now  last night being awake     my thoughts travelled back to the lonely old manse and it seemed as if i were wandering up stairs and down stairs all by myself  my fancy was almost afraid to be there alone  i could see every object in a dim gray lightour chamber the study all in confusion the parlor with the fragments of that abortive breakfast on the table and the precious silver forks and the old bronze image keeping its solitary stand upon the mantelpiece  then methought the wretched vigwiggie came and jumped upon the windowsill and clung there with her fore paws mewing dismally for admittance which i could not grant her being there myself only in the spirit  and then came the ghost of the old doctor stalking through the gallery and down the staircase and peeping into the parlor and though i was wide awake and conscious of being so many miles from the spot still it was quite awful to think of the ghost having sole possession of our home for i could not quite separate myself from it after all  somehow the doctor and i seemed to be there teteatete    i believe i did not have any fantasies about the ghostly kitchenmaid but i trust mary left the flatirons within her reach so that she may do all her ironing while we are away and never disturb us more at midnight  i suppose she comes thither to iron her shroud and perhaps likewise to smooth the doctors band  probably during her lifetime she allowed him to go to some ordination or other grand clerical celebration with rumpled linen and ever since and throughout all earthly futurity at least as long as the house shall stand she is doomed to exercise a nightly toil with a spiritual flatiron  poor sinnerand doubtless satan heats the irons for her  what nonsense is all this but really it does make me shiver to think of that poor home of ours   march 16th    as for this mr  i wish he would not be so troublesome  his scheme is well enough and might possibly become popular but it has no peculiar advantages with reference to myself nor do the subjects of his proposed books particularly suit my fancy as themes to write upon  somebody else will answer his purpose just as well and i would rather write books of my own imagining than be hired to develop the ideas of an engraver especially as the pecuniary prospect is not better nor so good as it might be elsewhere  i intend to adhere to my former plan of writing one or two mythological storybooks to be published under osullivans auspices in new yorkwhich is the only place where books can be published with a chance of profit  as a matter of courtesy i may call on mr  if i have time but i do not intend to be connected with this affair   sunday april 9th    after finishing my record in the journal i sat a long time in grandmothers chair thinking of many things    my spirits were at a lower ebb than they ever descend to when i am not alone nevertheless neither was i absolutely sad  many times i wound and rewound mr thoreaus little musicalbox but certainly its peculiar sweetness had evaporated and i am pretty sure that i should throw it out of the window were i doomed to hear it long and often  it has not an infinite soul  when it was almost as dark as the moonlight would let it be i lighted the lamp and went on with tiecks tale slowly and painfully often wishing for help in my difficulties  at last i determined to learn a little about pronouns and verbs before proceeding further and so took up the phrasebook with which i was commendably busy when at about a quarter to nine came a knock at my study door and behold there was molly with a letter  how she came by it i did not ask being content to suppose it was brought by a heavenly messenger  i had not expected a letter and what a comfort it was to me in my loneliness and sombreness  i called molly to take her note enclosed which she received with a face of delight as broad and bright as the kitchen fire  then i read and reread and rereread and quadruply quintuply and sextuply reread my epistle until i had it all by heart and then continued to reread it for the sake of the penmanship  then i took up the phrasebook again but could not study and so bathed and retired it being now not far from ten oclock  i lay awake a good deal in the night but saw no ghost  i arose about seven and found that the upper part of my nose and the region round about was grievously discolored and at the angle of the left eye there is a great spot of almost black purple and a broad streak of the same hue semicircling beneath either eye while green yellow and orange overspread the circumjacent country  it looks not unlike a gorgeous sunset throwing its splendor over the heaven of my countenance it will behoove me to show myself as little as possible else people will think i have fought a pitched battle    the devil take the stick of wood  what had i done that it should bemaul me so  however there is no pain though i think a very slight affection of the eyes  this forenoon i began to write and caught an idea by the skirts which i intend to hold fast though it struggles to get free  as it was not ready to be put upon paper however i took up the dial and finished reading the article on mr alcott  it is not very satisfactory and it has not taught me much  then i read margarets article on canova which is good  about this time the dinnerbell rang and i went down without much alacrity though with a good appetite enough    it was in the angle of my right eye not my left that the blackest purple was collected  but they both look like the very devil  half past five oclockafter writing the above     i again set to work on tiecks tale and worried through several pages and then at half past four threw open one of the western windows of my study and sallied forth to take the sunshine  i went down through the orchard to the riverside  the orchardpath is still deeply covered with snow and so is the whole visible universe except streaks upon the hillsides and spots in the sunny hollows where the brown earth peeps through  the river which a few days ago was entirely imprisoned has now broken its fetters but a tract of ice extended across from near the foot of the monument to the abutment of the old bridge and looked so solid that i supposed it would yet remain for a day or two  large cakes and masses of ice came floating down the current which though not very violent hurried along at a much swifter pace than the ordinary one of our sluggish rivergod  these icemasses when they struck the barrier of ice above mentioned acted upon it like a batteringram and were themselves forced high out of the water or sometimes carried beneath the main sheet of ice  at last down the stream came an immense mass of ice and striking the barrier about at its centre it gave way and the whole was swept onward together leaving the river entirely free with only here and there a cake of ice floating quietly along  the great accumulation in its downward course hit against a tree that stood in midcurrent and caused it to quiver like a reed and it swept quite over the shrubbery that bordered what in summertime is the rivers bank but which is now nearly the centre of the stream  our river in its present state has quite a noble breadth  the little hillock which formed the abutment of the old bridge is now an island with its tuft of trees along the hither shore a row of trees stand up to their knees and the smaller ones to their middles in the water and afar off on the surface of the stream we see tufts of bushes emerging thrusting up their heads as it were to breathe  the water comes over the stonewall and encroaches several yards on the boundaries of our orchard  here the supperbell rang  if our boat were in good order i should now set forth on voyages of discovery and visit nooks on the borders of the meadows which by and by will be a mile or two from the waters edge but she is in very bad condition full of water and doubtless as leaky as a sieve  on coming from supper i found that little puss had established herself in the study probably with intent to pass the night here  she now lies on the footstool between my feet purring most obstreperously  the day of my wifes departure she came to me talking with the greatest earnestness but whether it was to condole with me on my loss or to demand my redoubled care for herself i could not well make out  as puss now constitutes a third part of the family this mention of her will not appear amiss  how molly employs herself i know not  once in a while i hear a door slam like a thunderclap but she never shows her face nor speaks a word unless to announce a visitor or deliver a letter  this day on my part will have been spent without exchanging a syllable with any human being unless something unforeseen should yet call for the exercise of speech before bedtime   monday april 10thi sat till eight oclock meditating upon this world and the next     and sometimes dimly shaping out scenes of a tale then betook myself to the german phrasebook  ah these are but dreary evenings  the lamp would not brighten my spirits though it was duly filled    this forenoon was spent in scribbling by no means to my satisfaction until past eleven when i went to the village  nothing in our box at the postoffice  i read during the customary hour or more at the athenaeum and returned without saying a word to mortal  i gathered from some conversation that i heard that a son of adam is to be buried this afternoon from the meetinghouse but the name of the deceased escaped me  it is no great matter so it be but written in the book of life  my variegated face looks somewhat more human today though i was unaffectedly ashamed to meet anybodys gaze and therefore turned my back or my shoulder as much as possible upon the world  at dinner behold an immense joint of roast veal  i would willingly have had some assistance in the discussion of this great piece of calf  i am ashamed to eat alone it becomes the mere gratification of animal appetitethe tribute which we are compelled to pay to our grosser nature whereas in the company of another it is refined and moralized and spiritualized and over our earthly victuals or rather vittles for the former is a very foolish mode of spellingover our earthly vittles is diffused a sauce of lofty and gentle thoughts and tough meat is mollified with tender feelings  but oh these solitary meals are the dismallest part of my present experience  when the company rose from table they all in my single person ascended to the study and employed themselves in reading the article on oregon in the democratic review  then they plodded onward in the rugged and bewildering depths of tiecks tale until five oclock when with one accord they went out to split wood  this has been a gray day with now and then a sprinkling of snowflakes through the air    today no more than yesterday have i spoken a word to mortal    it is now sunset and i must meditate till dark   april 11thi meditated accordingly but without any very wonderful result  then at eight oclock bothered myself till after nine with this eternal tale of tieck  the forenoon was spent in scribbling but at eleven oclock my thoughts ceased to flowindeed their current has been wofully interrupted all alongso i threw down my pen and set out on the daily journey to the village  horrible walking  i wasted the customary hour at the athenaeum and returned home if home it may now be called  till dinnertime i labored on tiecks tale and resumed that agreeable employment after the banquet  just when i was on the point of choking with a huge german word molly announced mr thoreau  he wished to take a row in the boat for the last time perhaps before he leaves concord  so we emptied the water out of her and set forth on our voyage  she leaks but not more than she did in the autumn  we rowed to the foot of the hill which borders the north branch and there landed and climbed the moist and snowy hillside for the sake of the prospect  looking down the river it might well have been mistaken for an arm of the sea so broad is now its swollen tide and i could have fancied that beyond one other headland the mighty ocean would outspread itself before the eye  on our return we boarded a large cake of ice which was floating down the river and were borne by it directly to our own landingplace with the boat towing behind  parting with mr thoreau i spent half an hour in chopping wood when molly informed me that mr emerson wished to see me  he had brought a letter of ellery channing written in a style of very pleasant humor this being read and discussed together with a few other matters he took his leave since which i have been attending to my journalizing duty and thus this record is brought down to the present moment   april 25thspring is advancing sometimes with sunny days and sometimes as is the case now with chill moist sullen ones  there is an influence in the season that makes it almost impossible for me to bring my mind down to literary employment perhaps because several months pretty constant work has exhausted that species of energy perhaps because in spring it is more natural to labor actively than to think  but my impulse now is to be idle altogetherto lie in the sun or wander about and look at the revival of nature from her deathlike slumber or to be borne down the current of the river in my boat  if i had wings i would gladly fly yet would prefer to be wafted along by a breeze sometimes alighting on a patch of green grass then gently whirled away to a still sunnier spot    o how blest should i be were there nothing to do  then i would watch every inch and hairsbreadth of the progress of the season and not a leaf should put itself forth in the vicinity of our old mansion without my noting it but now with the burden of a continual task upon me i have not freedom of mind to make such observations  i merely see what is going on in a very general way  the snow which two or three weeks ago covered hill and valley is now diminished to one or two solitary specks in the visible landscape though doubtless there are still heaps of it in the shady places in the woods  there have been no violent rains to carry it off it has diminished gradually inch by inch and day after day and i observed along the roadside that the green blades of grass had sometimes sprouted on the very edge of the snowdrift the moment that the earth was uncovered  the pastures and grassfields have not yet a general effect of green nor have they that cheerless brown tint which they wear in later autumn when vegetation has entirely ceased  there is now a suspicion of verdure the faint shadow of itbut not the warm reality  sometimes in a happy exposurethere is one such tract across the river the carefully cultivated mowingfield in front of an old red homesteadsuch patches of land wear a beautiful and tender green which no other season will equal because let the grass be green as it may hereafter it will not be so set off by surrounding barrenness  the trees in our orchard and elsewhere have as yet no leaves yet to the most careless eye they appear full of life and vegetable blood  it seems as if by one magic touch they might instantaneously put forth all their foliage and the wind which now sighs through their naked branches might all at once find itself impeded by innumerable leaves  this sudden development would be scarcely more wonderful than the gleam of verdure which often brightens in a moment as it were along the slope of a bank or roadside  it is like a gleam of sunlight  just now it was brown like the rest of the scenery look again and there is an apparition of green grass  the spring no doubt comes onward with fleeter footsteps because winter has lingered so long that at best she can hardly retrieve half the allotted term of her reign  the river this season has encroached farther on the land than it has been known to do for twenty years past  it has formed along its course a succession of lakes with a current through the midst  my boat has lain at the bottom of the orchard in very convenient proximity to the house it has borne me over stone fences and a few days ago ellery channing and i passed through two rails into the great northern road along which we paddled for some distance  the trees have a singular appearance in the midst of waters  the curtailment of their trunks quite destroys the proportions of the whole tree and we become conscious of a regularity and propriety in the forms of nature by the effect of this abbreviation the waters are now subsiding but gradually  islands become annexed to the mainland and other islands emerge from the flood and will soon likewise be connected with the continent  we have seen on a small scale the process of the deluge and can now witness that of the reappearance of the earth  crows visited us long before the snow was off  they seem mostly to have departed now or else to have betaken themselves to remote depths of the woods which they haunt all summer long  ducks came in great numbers and many sportsmen went in pursuit of them along the river but they also have disappeared  gulls come up from seaward and soar high overhead flapping their broad wings in the upper sunshine  they are among the most picturesque birds that i am acquainted with indeed quite the most so because the manner of their flight makes them almost stationary parts of the landscape  the imagination has time to rest upon them they have not flitted away in a moment  you go up among the clouds and lay hold of these soaring gulls and repose with them upon the sustaining atmosphere  the smaller birdsthe birds that build their nests in our trees and sing for us at morningredi will not describe    but i must mention the great companies of blackbirds more than the famous fourandtwenty who were baked in a piethat congregate on the tops of contiguous trees and vociferate with all the clamor of a turbulent political meeting  politics must certainly be the subject of such a tumultuous debate but still there is a melody in each individual utterance and a harmony in the general effect  mr thoreau tells me that these noisy assemblages consist of three different species of blackbirds but i forget the other two  robins have been long among us and swallows have more recently arrived   april 26thhere is another misty day muffling the sun  the lilacshrubs under my study window are almost in leaf  in two or three days more i may put forth my hand and pluck a green bough  these lilacs appear to be very aged and have lost the luxuriant foliage of their prime  old age has a singular aspect in lilacs rosebushes and other ornamental shrubs  it seems as if such things as they grow only for beauty ought to flourish in immortal youth or at least to die before their decrepitude  they are trees of paradise and therefore not naturally subject to decay but have lost their birthright by being transplanted hither  there is a kind of ludicrous unfitness in the idea of a venerable rosebush and there is something analogous to this in human life  persons who can only be graceful and ornamentalwho can give the world nothing but flowersshould die young and never be seen with gray hairs and wrinkles any more than the flowershrubs with mossy bark and scanty foliage like the lilacs under my window  not that beauty is not worthy of immortality  nothing else indeed is worthy of it and thence perhaps the sense of impropriety when we see it triumphed over by time  appletrees on the other hand grow old without reproach  let them live as long as they may and contort themselves in whatever fashion they please they are still respectable even if they afford us only an apple or two in a season or none at all  human flowershrubs if they will grow old on earth should beside their lovely blossoms bear some kind of fruit that will satisfy earthly appetites else men will not be satisfied that the moss should gather on them  winter and spring are now struggling for the mastery in my study and i yield somewhat to each and wholly to neither  the window is open and there is a fire in the stove  the day when the window is first thrown open should be an epoch in the year but i have forgotten to record it seventy or eighty springs have visited this old house and sixty of them found old dr ripley herenot always old it is true but gradually getting wrinkles and gray hairs and looking more and more the picture of winter  but he was no flowershrub but one of those fruittrees or timbertrees that acquire a grace with their old age  last spring found this house solitary for the first time since it was built and now again she peeps into our open windows and finds new faces here     it is remarkable how much uncleanness winter brings with it or leaves behind it    the yard garden and avenue which should be my department require a great amount of labor  the avenue is strewed with withered leavesthe whole crop apparently of last yearsome of which are now raked into heaps and we intend to make a bonfire of them    there are quantities of decayed branches which one tempest after another has flung down black and rotten  in the garden are the old cabbages which we did not think worth gathering last autumn and the dry beanvines and the withered stalks of the asparagusbed in short all the wrecks of the departed yearits mouldering relics its dry bones  it is a pity that the world cannot be made over anew every spring  then in the yard there are the piles of firewood which i ought to have sawed and thrown into the shed long since but which will cumber the earth i fear till june at least  quantities of chips are strewn about and on removing them we find the yellow stalks of grass sprouting underneath  nature does her best to beautify this disarray the grass springs up most industriously especially in sheltered and sunny angles of the buildings or round the doorstepsa locality which seems particularly favorable to its growth for it is already high enough to bend over and wave in the wind  i was surprised to observe that some weeds especially a plant that stains the fingers with its yellow juice had lived and retained their freshness and sap as perfectly as in summer through all the frosts and snows of last winter  i saw them the last green thing in the autumn and here they are again the first in the spring   thursday april 27thi took a walk into the fields and round our opposite hill yesterday noon but made no very remarkable observation the frogs have begun their concerts though not as yet with a full choir i found no violets nor anemones nor anything in the likeness of a flower though i looked carefully along the shelter of the stonewalls and in all spots apparently propitious  i ascended the hill and had a wide prospect of a swollen river extending around me in a semicircle of three or four miles and rendering the view much finer than in summer had there only been foliage  it seemed like the formation of a new world for islands were everywhere emerging and capes extending forth into the flood and these tracts which were thus won from the watery empire were among the greenest in the landscape  the moment the deluge leaves them nature asserts them to be her property by covering them with verdure or perhaps the grass had been growing under the water  on the hilltop where i stood the grass had scarcely begun to sprout and i observed that even those places which looked greenest in the distance were but scantily grasscovered when i actually reached them  it was hope that painted them so bright  last evening we saw a bright light on the river betokening that a boats party were engaged in spearing fish  it looked like a descended star like red marsand as the water was perfectly smooth its gleam was reflected downward into the depths  it is a very picturesque sight  in the deep quiet of the night i suddenly heard the light and lively note of a bird from a neighboring treea real song such as those which greet the purple dawn or mingle with the yellow sunshine  what could the little bird mean by pouring it forth at midnight  probably the note gushed out from the midst of a dream in which he fancied himself in paradise with his mate and suddenly awaking he found he was on a cold leafless bough with a new england mist penetrating through his feathers that was a sad exchange of imagination for reality but if he found his mate beside him all was well  this is another misty morning ungenial in aspect but kinder than it looks for it paints the hills and valleys with a richer brush than the sunshine could  there is more verdure now than when i looked out of the window an hour ago  the willowtree opposite my study window is ready to put forth its leaves  there are some objections to willows  it is not a dry and cleanly tree it impresses me with an association of sliminess and no trees i think are perfectly satisfactory which have not a firm and hard texture of trunk and branches  but the willow is almost the earliest to put forth its leaves and the last to scatter them on the ground and during the whole winter its yellow twigs give it a sunny aspect which is not without a cheering influence in a proper point of view  our old house would lose much were this willow to be cut down with its golden crown over the roof in winter and its heap of summer verdure  the present mr ripley planted it fifty years ago or thereabouts   friday june 2dlast night there came a frost which has done great damage to my garden  the beans have suffered very much although luckily not more than half that i planted have come up  the squashes both summer and winter appear to be almost killed  as to the other vegetables there is little mischief donethe potatoes not being yet above ground except two or three and the peas and corn are of a hardier nature  it is sad that nature will so sport with us poor mortals inviting us with sunny smiles to confide in her and then when we are entirely in her power striking us to the heart  our summer commences at the latter end of june and terminates somewhere about the first of august  there are certainly not more than six weeks of the whole year when a frost may be deemed anything remarkable   friday june 23dsummer has come at lastthe longest days with blazing sunshine and fervid heat  yesterday glowed like molten brass last night was the most uncomfortably and unsleepably sultry that we have experienced since our residence in concord and today it scorches again i have a sort of enjoyment in these seventimesheated furnaces of midsummer even though they make me droop like a thirsty plant  the sunshine can scarcely be too burning for my taste but i am no enemy to summer showers  could i only have the freedom to be perfectly idle now no duty to fulfil no mental or physical labor to performi should be as happy as a squash and much in the same mode but the necessity of keeping my brain at work eats into my comfort as the squashbugs do into the heart of the vines  i keep myself uneasy and produce little and almost nothing that is worth producing  the garden looks well now the potatoes flourish the early corn waves in the wind the squashes both for summer and winter use are more forward i suspect than those of any of my neighbors  i am forced however to carry on a continual warfare with the squashbugs who were i to let them alone for a day would perhaps quite destroy the prospects of the whole summer  it is impossible not to feel angry with these unconscionable insects who scruple not to do such excessive mischief to me with only the profit of a meal or two to themselves  for their own sakes they ought at least to wait till the squashes are better grown why is it i wonder that nature has provided such a host of enemies for every useful esculent while the weeds are suffered to grow unmolested and are provided with such tenacity of life and such methods of propagation that the gardener must maintain a continual struggle or they will hopelessly overwhelm him  what hidden virtue is in these things that it is granted them to sow themselves with the wind and to grapple the earth with this immitigable stubbornness and to flourish in spite of obstacles and never to suffer blight beneath any sun or shade but always to mock their enemies with the same wicked luxuriance  it is truly a mystery and also a symbol  there is a sort of sacredness about them  perhaps if we could penetrate natures secrets we should find that what we call weeds are more essential to the wellbeing of the world than the most precious fruit or grain  this may be doubted however for there is an unmistakable analogy between these wicked weeds and the bad habits and sinful propensities which have overrun the moral world and we may as well imagine that there is good in one as in the other  our peas are in such forwardness that i should not wonder if we had some of them on the table within a week  the beans have come up ill and i planted a fresh supply only the day before yesterday  we have watermelons in good advancement and muskmelons also within three or four days  i set out some tomatoes last night also some capers  it is my purpose to plant some more corn at the end of the month or sooner there ought to be a record of the flowergarden and of the procession of the wildflowers as minute at least as of the kitchen vegetables and potherbs  above all the noting of the appearance of the first roses should not be omitted nor of the arethusa one of the delicatest gracefullest and in every manner sweetest of the whole race of flowers for a fortnight past i have found it in the swampy meadows growing up to its chin in heaps of wet moss  its hue is a delicate pink of various depths of shade and somewhat in the form of a grecian helmet  to describe it is a feat beyond my power  also the visit of two friends who may fitly enough be mentioned among flowers ought to have been described  mrs f s and miss a s  also i have neglected to mention the birth of a little white dove  i never observed until the present season how long and late the twilight lingers in these longest days  the orange line of the western horizon remains till ten oclock at least and how much later i am unable to say  the night before last i could distinguish letters by this lingering gleam between nine and ten oclock  the dawn i suppose shows itself as early as two oclock so that the absolute dominion of night has dwindled to almost nothing  there seems to be also a diminished necessity or at all events a much less possibility of sleep than at other periods of the year  i get scarcely any sound repose just now  it is summer and not winter that steals away mortal life well we get the value of what is taken from us   saturday july 1stwe had our first dish of green peas a very small one yesterday  every day for the last week has been tremendously hot and our garden flourishes like eden itself only adam could hardly have been doomed to contend with such a ferocious banditti of weeds   sunday july 9thi know not what to say and yet cannot be satisfied without marking with a word or two this anniversary    but life now swells and heaves beneath me like a brimfull ocean and the endeavor to comprise any portion of it in words is like trying to dip up the ocean in a goblet    god bless and keep us for there is something more awful in happiness than in sorrowthe latter being earthly and finite the former composed of the substance and texture of eternity so that spirits still embodied may well tremble at it   july 18ththis morning i gathered our first summersquashes  we should have had them some days earlier but for the loss of two of the vines either by a disease of the roots or by those infernal bugs  we have had turnips and carrots several times  currants are now ripe and we are in the full enjoyment of cherries which turn out much more delectable than i anticipated  george hillard and mrs hillard paid us a visit on saturday last  on monday afternoon he left us and mrs hillard still remains here   friday july 28thwe had green corn for dinner yesterday and shall have some more today not quite full grown but sufficiently so to be palatable  there has been no rain except one moderate shower for many weeks and the earth appears to be wasting away in a slow fever  this weather i think affects the spirits very unfavorably  there is an irksomeness a restlessness a pervading dissatisfaction together with an absolute incapacity to bend the mind to any serious effort  with me as regards literary production the summer has been unprofitable and i only hope that my forces are recruiting themselves for the autumn and winter  for the future i shall endeavor to be so diligent nine months of the year that i may allow myself a full and free vacation of the other three   monday july 31stwe had our first cucumber yesterday  there were symptoms of rain on saturday and the weather has since been as moist as the thirstiest soul could desire   wednesday september 13ththere was a frost the night before last according to george prescott but no effects of it were visible in our garden  last night however there was another which has nipped the leaves of the wintersquashes and cucumbers but seems to have done no other damage  this is a beautiful morning and promises to be one of those heavenly days that render autumn after all the most delightful season of the year  we mean to make a voyage on the river this afternoon   sunday september 23di have gathered the two last of our summersquashes today  they have lasted ever since the 18th of july and have numbered fiftyeight edible ones of excellent quality  last wednesday i think i harvested our wintersquashes sixtythree in number and mostly of fine size  our last series of green corn planted about the 1st of july was good for eating two or three days ago  we still have beans and our tomatoes though backward supply us with a dish every day or two  my potatocrop promises well and on the whole my first independent experiment of agriculture is quite a successful one  this is a glorious daybright very warm yet with an unspeakable gentleness both in its warmth and brightness  on such days it is impossible not to love nature for she evidently loves us  at other seasons she does not give me this impression or only at very rare intervals but in these happy autumnal days when she has perfected the harvests and accomplished every necessary thing that she had to do she overflows with a blessed superfluity of love  it is good to be alive now  thank god for breathyes for mere breath when it is made up of such a heavenly breeze as this  it comes to the cheek with a real kiss it would linger fondly around us if it might but since it must be gone it caresses us with its whole kindly heart and passes onward to caress likewise the next thing that it meets  there is a pervading blessing diffused over all the world  i look out of the window and think o perfect day  o beautiful world  o good god  and such a day is the promise of a blissful eternity  our creator would never have made such weather and given us the deep heart to enjoy it above and beyond all thought if he had not meant us to be immortal  it opens the gates of heaven and gives us glimpses far inward  bless me this flight has carried me a great way so now let me come back to our old abbey  our orchard is fast ripening and the apples and great thumping pears strew the grass in such abundance that it becomes almost a troublethough a pleasant oneto gather them  this happy breeze too shakes them down as if it flung fruit to us out of the sky and often when the air is perfectly still i hear the quiet fall of a great apple well we are rich in blessings though poor in money      friday october 6thyesterday afternoon i took a solitary walk to walden pond  it was a cool windy day with heavy clouds rolling and tumbling about the sky but still a prevalence of genial autumn sunshine the fields are still green and the great masses of the woods have not yet assumed their manycolored garments but here and there are solitary oaks of deep substantial red or maples of a more brilliant hue or chestnuts either yellow or of a tenderer green than in summer  some trees seem to return to their hue of may or early june before they put on the brighter autumnal tints  in some places along the borders of low and moist land a whole range of trees were clothed in the perfect gorgeousness of autumn of all shades of brilliant color looking like the palette on which nature was arranging the tints wherewith to paint a picture  these hues appeared to be thrown together without design and yet there was perfect harmony among them and a softness and a delicacy made up of a thousand different brightnesses  there is not i think so much contrast among these colors as might at first appear  the more you consider them the more they seem to have one element among them all which is the reason that the most brilliant display of them soothes the observer instead of exciting him  and i know not whether it be more a moral effect or a physical one operating merely on the eye but it is a pensive gayety which causes a sigh often and never a smile  we never fancy for instance that these gayly clad trees might be changed into young damsels in holiday attire and betake themselves to dancing on the plain  if they were to undergo such a transformation they would surely arrange themselves in funeral procession and go sadly along with their purple and scarlet and golden garments trailing over the withering grass when the sunshine falls upon them they seem to smile but it is as if they were heartbroken  but it is in vain for me to attempt to describe these autumnal brilliancies or to convey the impression which they make on me  i have tried a thousand times and always without the slightest selfsatisfaction  fortunately there is no need of such a record for nature renews the picture year after year and even when we shall have passed away from the world we can spiritually create these scenes so that we may dispense with all efforts to put them into words  walden pond was clear and beautiful as usual  it tempted me to bathe and though the water was thrillingly cold it was like the thrill of a happy death  never was there such transparent water as this  i threw sticks into it and saw them float suspended on an almost invisible medium  it seemed as if the pure air were beneath them as well as above  it is fit for baptisms but one would not wish it to be polluted by having sins washed into it  none but angels should bathe in it but blessed babies might be dipped into its bosom  in a small and secluded dell that opens upon the most beautiful cove of the whole lake there is a little hamlet of huts or shanties inhabited by the irish people who are at work upon the railroad  there are three or four of these habitations the very rudest i should imagine that civilized men ever made for themselvesconstructed of rough boards with the protruding ends  against some of them the earth is heaped up to the roof or nearly so and when the grass has had time to sprout upon them they will look like small natural hillocks or a species of anthillssomething in which nature has a larger share than man  these huts are placed beneath the trees oaks walnuts and whitepines wherever the trunks give them space to stand and by thus adapting themselves to natural interstices instead of making new ones they do not break or disturb the solitude and seclusion of the place  voices are heard and the shouts and laughter of children who play about like the sunbeams that come down through the branches  women are washing in open spaces and long lines of whitened clothes are extended from tree to tree fluttering and gambolling in the breeze  a pig in a sty even more extemporary than the shanties is grunting and poking his snout through the clefts of his habitation  the household pots and kettles are seen at the doors and a glance within shows the rough benches that serve for chairs and the bed upon the floor  the visitors nose takes note of the fragrance of a pipe  and yet with all these homely items the repose and sanctity of the old wood do not seem to be destroyed or profaned  it overshadows these poor people and assimilates them somehow or other to the character of its natural inhabitants  their presence did not shock me any more than if i had merely discovered a squirrels nest in a tree to be sure it is a torment to see the great high ugly embankment of the railroad which is here thrusting itself into the lake or along its margin in close vicinity to this picturesque little hamlet  i have seldom seen anything more beautiful than the cove on the border of which the huts are situated and the more i looked the lovelier it grew  the trees overshadowed it deeply but on one side there was some brilliant shrubbery which seemed to light up the whole picture with the effect of a sweet and melancholy smile  i felt as if spirits were thereor as if these shrubs had a spiritual life  in short the impression was indefinable and after gazing and musing a good while i retraced my steps through the irish hamlet and plodded on along a woodpath  according to my invariable custom i mistook my way and emerging upon the road i turned my back instead of my face towards concord and walked on very diligently till a guideboard informed me of my mistake  i then turned about and was shortly overtaken by an old yeoman in a chaise who kindly offered me a drive and soon set me down in the village    extracts from letters   salem april 14th 1844    i went to george hillards office and he spoke with immitigable resolution of the necessity of my going to dine with longfellow before returning to concord but i have an almost miraculous power of escaping from necessities of this kind  destiny itself has often been worsted in the attempt to get me out to dinner possibly however i may go  afterwards i called on colonel hall who held me long in talk about politics and other sweetmeats  then i stepped into a book auction not to buy but merely to observe and after a few moments who should come in with a smile as sweet as sugar though savoring rather of molasses but to my horror and petrifaction    i anticipated a great deal of bore and botheration but through heavens mercy he merely spoke a few words and left me  this is so unlike his deportment in times past that i suspect the celestial railroad must have given him a pique and if so i shall feel as if providence had sufficiently rewarded me for that pious labor  in the course of the forenoon i encountered mr howes in the street  he looked most exceedingly depressed and pressing my hand with peculiar emphasis said that he was in great affliction having just heard of his son georges death in cuba  he seemed encompassed and overwhelmed by this misfortune and walks the street as in a heavy cloud of his own grief forth from which he extended his hand to meet my grasp  i expressed my sympathy which i told him i was now the more capable of feeling in a fathers suffering as being myself the father of a little girland indeed the being a parent does give one the freedom of a wider range of sorrow as well as of happiness  he again pressed my hand and left me     when i got to salem there was great joy as you may suppose    mother hinted an apprehension that poor baby would be spoilt whereupon i irreverently observed that having spoiled her own three children it was natural for her to suppose that all other parents would do the same when she averred that it was impossible to spoil such children as e and i because she had never been able to do anything with us    i could hardly convince them that una had begun to smile so soon  it surprised my mother though her own children appear to have been bright specimens of babyhood  e could walk and talk at nine months old  i do not understand that i was quite such a miracle of precocity but should think it not impossible inasmuch as precocious boys are said to make stupid men   may 27th 1844    my cook fills his office admirably  he prepared what i must acknowledge to be the best dish of fried fish and potatoes for dinner today that i ever tasted in this house  i scarcely recognized the fish of our own river  i make him get all the dinners while i confine myself to the much lighter task of breakfast and tea  he also takes his turn in washing the dishes  we had a very pleasant dinner at longfellows and i liked mrs longfellow very much  the dinner was late and we sat long so that c and i did not get to concord till half past nine oclock and truly the old manse seemed somewhat dark and desolate  the next morning george prescott came with unas lion who greeted me very affectionately but whined and moaned as if he missed somebody who should have been here  i am not quite so strict as i should be in keeping him out of the house but i commiserate him and myself for are we not both of us bereaved c whom i can no more keep from smoking than i could the kitchen chimney has just come into the study with a cigar which might perfume this letter and make you think it came from my own enormity so i may as well stop here   may 29thc is leaving me to my unspeakable relief for he has had a bad cold which caused him to be much more troublesome and less amusing than might otherwise have been the case   may 31st    i get along admirably and am at this moment superintending the corned beef which has been on the fire as it appears to me ever since the beginning of time and shows no symptom of being done before the crack of doom  mrs hale says it must boil till it becomes tender and so it shall if i can find wood to keep the fire agoing  meantime i keep my station in the diningroom and read or write as composedly as in my own study  just now there came a very important rap at the front door and i threw down a smoked herring which i had begun to eat as there is no hope of the corned beef today and went to admit the visitor  who should it be but ben b with a very peculiar and mysterious grin upon his face  he put into my hand a missive directed to mr and mrs hawthorne  it contained a little bit of card signifying that dr l f and miss c b receive their friends thursday eve june 6  i am afraid i shall be too busy washing my dishes to pay many visits  the washing of dishes does seem to me the most absurd and unsatisfactory business that i ever undertook  if when once washed they would remain clean for ever and ever which they ought in all reason to do considering how much trouble it is there would be less occasion to grumble but no sooner is it done than it requires to be done again on the whole i have come to the resolution not to use more than one dish at each meal  however i moralize deeply on this and other matters and have discovered that all the trouble and affliction in the world come from the necessity of cleansing away our earthly stains  i ate the last morsel of bread yesterday and congratulate myself on being now reduced to the fagend of necessity  nothing worse can happen according to ordinary modes of thinking than to want bread but like most afflictions it is more in prospect than reality  i found one cracker in the tureen and exulted over it as if it had been so much gold  however i have sent a petition to mrs p stating my destitute condition and imploring her succor and till it arrive i shall keep myself alive on herrings and apples together with part of a pint of milk which i share with leo  he is my great trouble now though an excellent companion too  but it is not easy to find food for him unless i give him what is fit for christiansthough for that matter he appears to be as good a christian as most laymen or even as some of the clergy  i fried some pouts and eels yesterday on purpose for him for he does not like raw fish  they were very good but i should hardly have taken the trouble on my own account  george p has just come to say that mrs p has no bread at present and is gone away this afternoon but that she will send me some tomorrow  i mean to have a regular supply from the same source    you cannot imagine how much the presence of leo relieves the feeling of perfect loneliness  he insists upon being in the room with me all the time except at night when he sleeps in the shed and i do not find myself severe enough to drive him out  he accompanies me likewise in all my walks to the village and elsewhere and in short keeps at my heels all the time except when i go down cellar  then he stands at the head of the stairs and howls as if he never expected to see me again  he is evidently impressed with the present solitude of our old abbey both on his own account and mine and feels that he may assume a greater degree of intimacy than would be otherwise allowable  he will be easily brought within the old regulations after your return  p s  3 oclockthe beef is done   concord  the old manse  june 2d    everything goes on well with me  at the time of writing my last letter i was without bread  well just at suppertime came mrs b with a large covered dish which proved to contain a quantity of specially good flapjacks piping hot prepared i suppose by the fair hands of miss martha or miss abby for mrs p was not at home  they served me both for supper and breakfast and i thanked providence and the young ladies and compared myself to the prophet fed by ravensthough the simile does rather more than justice to myself and not enough to the generous donors of the flapjacks  the next morning mrs p herself brought two big loaves of bread which will last me a week unless i have some guests to provide for  i have likewise found a hoard of crackers in one of the covered dishes so that the old castle is sufficiently provisioned to stand a long siege  the corned beef is exquisitely done and as tender as a young ladys heart all owing to my skilful cookery for i consulted mrs hale at every step and precisely followed her directions  to say the truth i look upon it as such a masterpiece in its way that it seems irreverential to eat it  things on which so much thought and labor are bestowed should surely be immortal    leo and i attended divine services this morning in a temple not made with hands  we went to the farthest extremity of peters path and there lay together under an oak on the verge of the broad meadow   concord june 6th    mr f arrived yesterday and appeared to be in most excellent health and as happy as the sunshine  about the first thing he did was to wash the dishes and he is really indefatigable in the kitchen so that i am quite a gentleman of leisure  previous to his arrival i had kindled no fire for four entire days and had lived all that time on the corned beef except one day when ellery and i went down the river on a fishing excursion  yesterday we boiled some lamb which we shall have cold for dinner today  this morning mr f fried a sumptuous dish of eels for breakfast  mrs p continues to be the instrument of providence and yesterday sent us a very nice plum pudding  i have told mr f that i shall be engaged in the forenoons and he is to manage his own occupations and amusements during that time     leo i regret to say has fallen under suspicion of a very great crime nothing less than murdera fowl crime it may well be called for it is the slaughter of one of mr haywards hens  he has been seen to chase the hens several times and the other day one of them was found dead possibly he may be innocent and as there is nothing but circumstantial evidence it must be left with his own conscience  meantime mr hayward or somebody else seems to have given him such a whipping that he is absolutely stiff and walks about like a rheumatic old gentleman  i am afraid too that he is an incorrigible thief ellery says he has seen him coming up the avenue with a calfs whole head in his mouth  how he came by it is best known to leo himself  if he were a dog of fair character it would be no more than charity to conclude that he had either bought it or had it given to him but with the other charges against him it inclines me to great distrust of his moral principles  be that as it may he managed his stock of provisions very thriftilyburying it in the earth and eating a portion of it whenever he felt an appetite  if he insists upon living by highway robbery it would be well to make him share his booty with us      june 10th    mr f is in perfect health and absolutely in the seventh heaven and he talks and talks and talks and talks and i listen and listen and listen with a patience for which in spite of all my sins i firmly expect to be admitted to the mansions of the blessed and there is really a contentment in being able to make this poor worldworn hopeless halfcrazy man so entirely comfortable as he seems to be here  he is an admirable cook  we had some roast veal and a baked ricepudding on sunday really a fine dinner and cooked in better style than mary can equal and george curtis came to dine with us  like all male cooks he is rather expensive and has a tendency to the consumption of eggs in his various concoctions    i have had my dreams of splendor but never expected to arrive at the dignity of keeping a mancook  at first we had three meals a day but now only two                                          we dined at mr emersons the other day in company with mr hedge  mr bradford has been to see us two or three times    he looks thinner than ever    passages from notebooks   may 5th 1850i left portsmouth last wednesday at the quarter past twelve by the concord railroad which at new market unites with the boston and maine railroad about ten miles from portsmouth  the station at new market is a small wooden building with one railroad passing on one side and another on another and the two crossing each other at right angles  at a little distance stands a black large old wooden church with a square tower and broken windows and a great rift through the middle of the roof all in a stage of dismal ruin and decay  a farmhouse of the old style with a long sloping roof and as black as the church stands on the opposite side of the road with its barns and these are all the buildings in sight of the railroad station  on the concord rail in the train of cars with the locomotive puffing and blowing off its steam and making a great bluster in that lonely place while along the other railroad stretches the desolate track with the withered weeds growing up betwixt the two lines of iron all so desolate and anon you hear a low thunder running along these iron rails it grows louder an object is seen afar off it approaches rapidly and comes down upon you like fate swift and inevitable  in a moment it dashes along in front of the stationhouse and comes to a pause the locomotive hissing and fuming in its eagerness to go on  how much life has come at once into this lonely place  four or five long cars each perhaps with fifty people in it reading newspapers reading pamphlet novels chattering sleeping all this vision of passing life  a moment passes while the luggagemen are putting on the trunks and packages then the bell strikes a few times and away goes the train again quickly out of sight of those who remain behind while a solitude of hours again broods over the stationhouse which for an instant has thus been put in communication with faroff cities and then remains by itself with the old black ruinous church and the black old farmhouse both built years and years ago before railroads were ever dreamed of  meantime the passenger stepping from the solitary station into the train finds himself in the midst of a new world all in a moment  he rushes out of the solitude into a village thence through woods and hills into a large inland town beside the merrimack which has overflowed its banks and eddies along turbid as a vast mudpuddle sometimes almost laving the doorstep of a house and with trees standing in the flood halfway up their trunks  boys with newspapers to sell or apples and lozenges many passengers departing and entering at each new station the more permanent passenger with his check or ticket stuck in his hatband where the conductor may see it  a party of girls playing at ball with a young man  altogether it is a scene of stirring life with which a person who had been waiting long for the train to come might find it difficult at once to amalgamate himself  it is a sombre brooding day and begins to rain as the cars pass onward in a little more than two hours we find ourselves in boston surrounded by eager hackmen  yesterday i went to the athenaeum and being received with great courtesy by mr folsom was shown all over the edifice from the very bottom to the very top whence i looked out over boston  it is an admirable point of view but it being an overcast and misty day i did not get the full advantage of it  the library is in a noble hall and looks splendidly with its vista of alcoves  the most remarkable sight however was mr hildreth writing his history of the united states  he sits at a table at the entrance of one of the alcoves with his books and papers before him as quiet and absorbed as he would be in the loneliest study now consulting an authority now penning a sentence or a paragraph without seeming conscious of anything but his subject  it is very curious thus to have a glimpse of a book in process of creation under ones eye  i know not how many hours he sits there but while i saw him he was a pattern of diligence and unwandering thought  he had taken himself out of the age and put himself i suppose into that about which he was writing  being deaf he finds it much the easier to abstract himself  nevertheless it is a miracle  he is a thin middleaged man in black with an intelligent face rather sensible than scholarlike  mr folsom accompanied me to call upon mr ticknor the historian of spanish literature  he has a fine house at the corner of park and beacon streets perhaps the very best position in boston  a marble hall a wide and easy staircase a respectable old manservant evidently long at home in the mansion to admit us  we entered the library mr folsom considerably in advance as being familiar with the house and i heard mr ticknor greet him in friendly tones their scholarlike and bibliographical pursuits i suppose bringing them into frequent conjunction  then i was introduced and received with great distinction but yet without any ostentatious flourish of courtesy  mr ticknor has a great head and his hair is gray or grayish  you recognize in him at once the man who knows the world the scholar too which probably is his more distinctive character though a little more under the surface  he was in his slippers a volume of his book was open on a table and apparently he had been engaged in revising or annotating it  his library is a stately and beautiful room for a private dwelling and itself looks large and rich  the fireplace has a white marble frame about it sculptured with figures and reliefs  over it hung a portrait of sir walter scott a copy i think of the one that represents him in melrose abbey  mr ticknor was most kind in his alacrity to solve the point on which mr folsom in my behalf had consulted him as to whether there had been any english translation of the tales of cervantes and most liberal in his offers of books from his library  certainly he is a fine example of a generousprincipled scholar anxious to assist the human intellect in its efforts and researches  methinks he must have spent a happy life as happiness goes among mortals writing his great threevolumed book for twenty years writing it not for bread nor with any uneasy desire of fame but only with a purpose to achieve something true and enduring  he is i apprehend a man of great cultivation and refinement and with quite substance enough to be polished and refined without being worn too thin in the processa man of society  he related a singular story of an attempt of his to become acquainted with me years ago when he mistook my kinsman eben for me  at half past four i went to mr thompsons the artist who has requested to paint my picture  this was the second sitting  the portrait looked dimly out from the canvas as from a cloud with something that i could recognize as my outline but no strong resemblance as yet  i have had three portraits taken before thisan oil picture a miniature and a crayon sketchneither of them satisfactory to those most familiar with my physiognomy  in fact there is no such thing as a true portrait they are all delusions and i never saw any two alike nor hardly any two that i would recognize merely by the portraits themselves as being of the same man  a bust has more reality  this artist is a man of thought and with no mean idea of his art a swedenborgian or as he prefers to call it a member of the new church and i have generally found something marked in men who adopt that faith  he had painted a good picture of bryant  he seems to me to possess truth in himself and to aim at it in his artistic endeavors   may 6ththis morning it is an easterly rain southeasterly i should say just now at twelve oclock and i went at nine by appointment to sit for my picture  the artist painted awhile but soon found that he had not so much light as was desirable and complained that his tints were as muddy as the weather  further sitting was therefore postponed till tomorrow at eleven  it will be a good picture but i see no assurance as yet of the likeness  an artists apartment is always very interesting to me with its pictures finished and unfinished its little fancies in the pictorial wayas here two sketches of children among flowers and foliage representing spring and summer winter and autumn being yet to come out of the artists mild the portraits of his wife and children here a clergyman there a poet here a woman with the stamp of reality upon her there a feminine conception which we feel not to have existed  there was an infant christ or rather a child christ not unbeautiful but scarcely divine  i love the odor of paint in an artists room his palette and all his other tools have a mysterious charm for me  the pursuit has always interested my imagination more than any other and i remember before having my first portrait taken there was a great bewitchery in the idea as if it were a magic process  even now it is not without interest to me  i left mr thompson before ten and took my way through the sloppy streets to the athenaeum where i looked over the newspapers and periodicals and found two of my old stories peter goldthwaite and the shaker bridal published as original in the last london metropolitan the english are much more unscrupulous and dishonest pirates than ourselves  however if they are poor enough to perk themselves in such false feathers as these heaven help them  i glanced over the stories and they seemed painfully cold and dull  it is the more singular that these should be so published inasmuch as the whole book was republished in london only a few months ago  mr fields tells me that two publishers in london had advertised the scarlet letter as in press each book at a shilling                                       certainly life is made much more tolerable and man respects himself far more when he takes his meals with a certain degree of order and state there should be a sacred law in these matters and as consecrating the whole business the preliminary prayer is a good and real ordinance  the advance of man from a savage and animal state may be as well measured by his mode and morality of dining as by any other circumstance  at mr fieldss soon after entering the house i heard the brisk and cheerful notes of a canarybird singing with great vivacity and making its voice echo through the large rooms  it was very pleasant at the close of the rainy eastwindy day and seemed to fling sunshine through the dwelling   may 7thi did not go out yesterday afternoon but after tea i went to parkers  the drinking and smoking shop is no bad place to see one kind of life  the front apartment is for drinking  the door opens into court square and is denoted usually by some choice specimens of dainties exhibited in the windows or hanging beside the doorpost as for instance a pair of canvasback ducks distinguishable by their delicately mottled feathers an admirable cut of raw beefsteak a ham ready boiled and with curious figures traced in spices on its outward fat a half or perchance the whole of a large salmon when in season a bunch of partridges etc etc  a screen stands directly before the door so as to conceal the interior from an outside barbarian  at the counter stand at almost all hourscertainly at all hours when i have chanced to observetipplers either taking a solitary glass or treating all round veteran topers flashy young men visitors from the country the various petty officers connected with the law whom the vicinity of the courthouse brings hither  chiefly they drink plain liquors gin brandy or whiskey sometimes a tom and jerry a gin cocktail which the bartender makes artistically tossing it in a large parabola from one tumbler to another until fit for drinking a brandysmash and numerous other concoctions  all this toping goes forward with little or no apparent exhilaration of spirits nor does this seem to be the object soughtit being rather i imagine to create a titillation of the coats of the stomach and a general sense of invigoration without affecting the brain  very seldom does a man grow wild and unruly  the inner room is hung round with pictures and engravings of various kindsa painting of a premium ox a lithograph of a turk and of a turkish lady     and various showily engraved tailors advertisements and other shopbills among them all a small painting of a drunken toper sleeping on a bench beside the grogshopa ragged halfhatless bloated rednosed jolly miserablelooking devil very well done and strangely suitable to the room in which it hangs  round the walls are placed some half a dozen marbletopped tables and a centretable in the midst most of them strewn with theatrical and other showbills and the large theatrebills with their type of gigantic solidity and blackness hung against the walls  last evening when i entered there was one guest somewhat overcome with liquor and slumbering with his chair tipped against one of the marble tables  in the course of a quarter of an hour he roused himself a plain middleaged man and went out with rather an unsteady step and a hot red face  one or two others were smoking and looking over the papers or glancing at a playbill  from the centre of the ceiling descended a branch with two gasburners which sufficiently illuminated every corner of the room  nothing is so remarkable in these barrooms and drinkingplaces as the perfect order that prevails if a man gets drunk it is no otherwise perceptible than by his going to sleep or his inability to walk  pacing the sidewalk in front of this grogshop of parkers or sometimes on cold and rainy days taking his station inside there is generally to be observed an elderly ragamuffin in a dingy and battered hat an old surtout and a more than shabby general aspect a thin face and red nose a patch over one eye and the other half drowned in moisture  he leans in a slightly stooping posture on a stick forlorn and silent addressing nobody but fixing his one moist eye on you with a certain intentness he is a man who has been in decent circumstances at some former period of his life but falling into decay perhaps by dint of too frequent visits at parkers bar he now haunts about the place as a ghost haunts the spot where he was murdered to collect his rents as parker saysthat is to catch an occasional ninepence from some charitable acquaintances or a glass of liquor at the bar  the word ragamuffin which i have used above does not accurately express the man because there is a sort of shadow or delusion of respectability about him and a sobriety too and a kind of decency in his groggy and rednosed destitution  underground beneath the drinking and smoking rooms is parkers eatinghall extending all the way to court street  all sorts of good eating may be had there and a gourmand may feast at what expense he will  i take an interest in all the nooks and crannies and every development of cities so here i try to make a description of the view from the back windows of a house in the centre of boston at which i now glance in the intervals of writing  the view is bounded at perhaps thirty yards distance by a row of opposite brick dwellings standing i think on temple place houses of the better order with tokens of genteel families visible in all the rooms betwixt the basements and the attic windows in the roof plateglass in the rear drawingrooms flowerpots in some of the windows of the upper stories  occasionally a ladys figure either seated or appearing with a flitting grace or dimly manifest farther within the obscurity of the room  a balcony with a wroughtiron fence running along under the row of drawingroom windows above the basement in the space betwixt the opposite row of dwellings and that in which i am situated are the low outhouses of the abovedescribed houses with flat roofs or solid brick walls with walks on them and high railings for the convenience of the washerwomen in hanging out their clothes  in the intervals are grassplots already green because so sheltered and fruittrees now beginning to put forth their leaves and one of them a cherrytree almost in full blossom  birds flutter and sing among these trees  i should judge it a good site for the growth of delicate fruit for quite enclosed on all sides by houses the blighting winds cannot molest the trees  they have sunshine on them a good part of the day though the shadow must come early and i suppose there is a rich soil about the roots  i see grapevines clambering against one wall and also peeping over another where the main body of the vine is invisible to me in another place a frame is erected for a grapevine and probably it will produce as rich clusters as the vines of madeira here in the heart of the city in this little spot of fructifying earth while the thunder of wheels rolls about it on every side  the trees are not all fruittrees  one pretty wellgrown buttonwoodtree aspires upward above the roofs of the houses  in the full verdure of summer there will be quite a mass or curtain of foliage between the hither and the thither row of houses   afternoonat eleven i went to give mr thompson a sitting for my picture  i like the painter  he seems to reverence his art and to aim at truth in it as i said before a man of gentle disposition too and simplicity of life and character  i seated myself in the pictorial chair with the only light in the room descending upon me from a high opening almost at the ceiling the rest of the sole window being shuttered  he began to work and we talked in an idle and desultory wayneither of us feeling very conversablewhich he attributed to the atmosphere it being a bright westwindy bracing day  we talked about the pictures of christ and how inadequate and untrue they are  he said he thought artists should attempt only to paint childchrists human powers being inadequate to the task of painting such purity and holiness in a manly development  then he said that an idea of a picture had occurred to him that morning while reading a chapter in the new testamenthow they parted his garments among them and for his vesture did cast lots  his picture was to represent the soldier to whom the garment without a seam had fallen after taking it home and examining it and becoming impressed with a sense of the former wearers holiness  i do not quite see how he would make such a picture tell its own story but i find the idea suggestive to my own mind and i think i could make something of it  we talked of physiognomy and impressions of character first impressionsand how apt they are to come aright in the face of the closest subsequent observation  there were several visitors in the course of the sitting one a gentleman a connection from the country with whom the artist talked about family matters and personal affairsobserving on the poorness of his own business and that he had thoughts of returning to new york  i wish he would meet with better success  two or three ladies also looked in  meanwhile mr thompson had been painting with more and more eagerness casting quick keen glances at me and then making hasty touches on the picture as if to secure with his brush what he had caught with his eye  he observed that he was just getting interested in the work and i could recognize the feeling that was in him as akin to what i have experienced myself in the glow of composition  nevertheless he seemed able to talk about foreign matters through it all  he continued to paint in this rapid way up to the moment of closing the sitting when he took the canvas from the easel without giving me time to mark what progress he had made as he did the last time  the artist is middlesized thin a little stooping with a quick nervous movement  he has black hair not thick a beard under his chin a small head but welldeveloped forehead black eyebrows eyes keen but kindly and a dark face not indicating robust health but agreeable in its expression  his voice is gentle and sweet and such as comes out from amidst refined feelings  he dresses very simply and unpictorially in a gray frock or sack and does not seem to think of making a picture of himself in his own person  at dinner today there was a young frenchman whom  befriended a year or so ago when he had not another friend in america and obtained employment for him in a large drygoods establishment  he is a young man of eighteen or thereabouts with smooth black hair neatly dressed his face showing a good disposition but with nothing of intellect or character  it is funny to think of this poor little frenchman a parisian too eating our most unfrench victualsour beefsteaks and roasts and various homely puddings and hams and all things most incongruent to his hereditary stomach but nevertheless he eats most cheerfully and uncomplainingly  he has not a large measure of french vivacity never rattles never dances nor breaks into ebullitions of mirth and song on the contrary i have never known a youth of his age more orderly and decorous  he is kindhearted and grateful and evinces his gratitude to the mother of the family and to his benefactress by occasional presents not trifling when measured by his small emolument of five dollars per week  just at this time he is confined to his room by indisposition caused it is suspected by a spree on sunday last  our gross saxon orgies would soon be the ruin of his french constitution  a thought today  great men need to be lifted upon the shoulders of the whole world in order to conceive their great ideas or perform their great deeds  that is there must be an atmosphere of greatness round about them  a hero cannot be a hero unless in an heroic world   may 8thi went last evening to the national theatre to see a pantomime it was jack the giantkiller and somewhat heavy and tedious  the audience was more noteworthy than the play  the theatre itself is for the middling and lower classes and i had not taken my seat in the most aristocratic part of the house so that i found myself surrounded chiefly by young sailors hanover street shopmen mechanics and other people of that class  it is wonderful the difference that exists in the personal aspect and dress and no less in the manners of people in this quarter of the city as compared with other parts of it  one would think that oak hall should give a common garb and air to the great mass of the boston population but it seems not to be so and perhaps what is most singular is that the natural make of the men has a conformity and suitableness to the dress  glazed caps and palo alto hats were much worn  it is a pity that this picturesque and comparatively graceful hat should not have been generally adopted instead of falling to the exclusive use of a rowdy class  in the next box to me were two young women with an infant but to which of them appertaining i could not at first discover  one was a large plump girl with a heavy face a snub nose coarselooking but goodnatured and with no traits of evilsave indeed that she had on the vilest gown of dirty white cotton so pervadingly dingy that it was white no longer as it seemed to me  the sleeves were short and ragged at the borders and her shawl which she took off on account of the heat was old and fadedthe shabbiest and dirtiest dress that i ever saw a woman wear  yet she was plump and looked comfortable in body and mind i imagine that she must have had a better dress at home but had come to the theatre extemporaneously and not going to the dress circle considered her ordinary gown good enough for the occasion  the other girl seemed as young or younger than herself  she was small with a particularly intelligent and pleasant face not handsome perhaps but as good or better than if it were  it was mobile with whatever sentiment chanced to be in her mind as quick and vivacious a face in its movements as i have ever seen cheerful too and indicative of a sunny though i should think it might be a hasty temper  she was dressed in a dark gown chintz i suppose the women call it a good homely dress proper enough for the fireside but a strange one to appear in at a theatre both these girls appeared to enjoy themselves very muchthe large and heavy one in her own duller mode the smaller manifesting her interest by gestures pointing at the stage and with so vivid a talk of countenance that it was precisely as if she had spoken  she was not a brunette and this made the vivacity of her expression the more agreeable  her companion on the other hand was so dark that i rather suspected her to have a tinge of african blood  there were two men who seemed to have some connection with these girls one an elderly grayheaded personage wellstricken in liquor talking loudly and foolishly but goodhumoredly the other a young man sober and doing his best to keep his elder friend quiet  the girls seemed to give themselves no uneasiness about the matterboth the men wore palo alto hats  i could not make out whether either of the men were the father of the child though i was inclined to set it down as a family party  as the play went on the house became crowded and oppressively warm and the poor little baby grew dark red or purple almost with the uncomfortable heat in its small body  it must have been accustomed to discomfort and have concluded it to be the condition of mortal life else it never would have remained so quiet  perhaps it had been quieted with a sleepingpotion  the two young women were not negligent of it but passed it to and fro between them each willingly putting herself to inconvenience for the sake of tending it  but i really feared it might die in some kind of a fit so hot was the theatre so purple with heat yet strangely quiet was the child  i was glad to hear it cry at last but it did not cry with any great rage and vigor as it should but in a stupid kind of way  hereupon the smaller of the two girls after a little inefficacious dandling at once settled the question of maternity by nursing her baby  children must be hard to kill however injudicious the treatment  the two girls and their cavaliers remained till nearly the close of the play  i should like well to know who they areof what condition in life and whether reputable as members of the class to which they belong  my own judgment is that they are so  throughout the evening drunken young sailors kept stumbling into and out of the boxes calling to one another from different parts of the house shouting to the performers and singing the burden of songs  it was a scene of life in the rough   may 14tha stable opposite the housean old wooden construction low in three distinct parts the centre being the stable proper where the horses are kept and with a chamber over it for the hay  on one side is the department for chaises and carriages on the other the little office where the books are kept  in the interior region of the stable everything is dim and undefinedhalftraceable outlines of stalls sometimes the shadowy aspect of a horse  generally a groom is dressing a horse at the stable door with a care and accuracy that leave no part of the animal unvisited by the currycomb and brush the horse meanwhile evidently enjoying it but sometimes when the more sensitive parts are touched giving a halfplayful kick with his hind legs and a little neigh  if the men bestowed half as much care on their own personal cleanliness they would be all the better and healthier men therefor they appear to be busy men these stablers yet have a lounging way with them as if indolence were somehow diffused through their natures  the apparent head of the establishment is a sensible thoughtfullooking largefeatured and homely man past the middle age clad rather shabbily in gray stooping somewhat and without any smartness about him  there is a groom who seems to be a very comfortable kind of personagea man of fortyfive or thereabouts r w emerson says he was one of his schoolmates but not looking so old corpulent not to say fat with a white frock which his goodly bulk almost fills enveloping him from neck nearly to ankles  on his head he wears a cloth cap of a jockey shape his pantaloons are turned up an inch or two at bottom and he wears brogans on his feet  his hair as may be seen when he takes off his cap to wipe his brow is black and in perfect preservation with not exactly a curl yet a vivacious and elastic kind of twist in it  his face is freshcolored comfortable sufficiently vivid in expression not at all dimmed by his fleshly exuberance because the man possesses vigor enough to carry it off  his bodily health seems perfect so indeed does his moral and intellectual  he is very active and assiduous in his duties currycombing and rubbing down the horses with alacrity and skill and when not otherwise occupied you may see him talking jovially with chance acquaintances or observing what is going forward in the street  if a female acquaintance happens to pass he touches his jockey cap and bows accomplishing this courtesy with a certain smartness that proves him a man of the world  whether it be his greater readiness to talk or the wisdom of what he says he seems usually to be the centre talker of the group  it is very pleasant to see such an image of earthly comfort as this  a fat man who feels his flesh as a disease and encumbrance and on whom it presses so as to make him melancholy with dread of apoplexy and who moves heavily under the burden of himselfsuch a man is a doleful and disagreeable object  but if he have vivacity enough to pervade all his earthiness and bodily force enough to move lightly under it and if it be not too unmeasured to have a trimness and briskness in it then it is good and wholesome to look at him  in the background of the house a cat occasionally stealing along on the roofs of the low outhouses descending a flight of wooden steps into the brick area investigating the shed and entering all dark and secret places cautious circumspect as if in search of something noiseless attentive to every noise  moss grows on spots of the roof there are little boxes of earth here and there with plants in them  the grassplots appertaining to each of the houses whose rears are opposite ours standing in temple place are perhaps ten or twelve feet broad and three times as long  here and there is a large painted gardenpot half buried in earth  besides the large trees in blossom there are little ones probably of last years setting out  early in the day chambermaids are seen hanging the bedclothes out of the upper windows at the window of the basement of the same house i see a woman ironing  were i a solitary prisoner i should not doubt to find occupation of deep interest for my whole day in watching only one of the houses  one house seems to be quite shut up all the blinds in the three windows of each of the four stories being closed although in the roofwindows of the attic story the curtains are hung carelessly upward instead of being drawn  i thick the house is empty perhaps for the summer  the visible side of the whole row of houses is now in the shadethey looking towards i should say the southwest  later in the day they are wholly covered with sunshine and continue so through the afternoon and at evening the sunshine slowly withdraws upward gleams aslant upon the windows perches on the chimneys and so disappears  the upper part of the spire and the weathercock of the park street church appear over one of the houses looking as if it were close behind  it shows the wind to be cast now at one of the windows of the third story sits a woman in a colored dress diligently sewing on something white  she sews not like a lady but with an occupational air  her dress i observe on closer observation is a kind of loose morning sack

decaying a kind of soil had quite covered them although the softened outline of the woodpile was perceptible in the green mound  it was perhaps fifty yearsperhaps moresince the woodman had cut and piled those logs and sticks intending them for his winter fires  but he probably needs no fire now there was something strangely interesting in this simple circumstance imagine the longdead woodman

days ago has melted a good deal of the snow on the intervening descent between our house and the lake but many drifts depths and levels yet remain and there is a frozen crust sufficient to bear a mans weight and very slippery  adown the slopes there are tiny rivulets which exist only for the winter  bare brown spaces of grass here and there but still so infrequent as only to diversify the scene a little  in the woods rocks emerging and where there is a slope immediately towards the lake the snow is pretty much gone and we see partridgeberries frozen and outer shells of walnuts and chestnutburrs heaped or scattered among the roots of the trees  the walnuthusks mark the place where the boys after nutting sat down to clear the walnuts of their outer shell  the various species of pine look exceedingly brown just nowless beautiful than those trees which shed their leaves  an oaktree with almost all its brown foliage still rustling on it  we clamber down the bank and step upon the frozen lake it was snowcovered for a considerable time but the rain overspread it with a surface of water or imperfectly melted snow which is now hard frozen again and the thermometer having been frequently below zero i suppose the ice may be four or five feet thick  frequently there are great cracks across it caused i suppose by the air beneath and giving an idea of greater firmness than if there were no cracks round holes which have been hewn in the marble pavement by fishermen and are now frozen over again looking darker than the rest of the surface spaces where the snow was more imperfectly dissolved than elsewhere little crackling spots where a thin surface of ice over the real mass crumples beneath ones foot the track of a line of footsteps most of them vaguely formed but some quite perfectly where a person passed across the lake while its surface was in a state of slush but which are now as hard as adamant and remind one of the traces discovered by geologists in rocks that hardened thousands of ages ago  it seems as if the person passed when the lake was in an intermediate state between ice and water  in one spot some pine boughs which somebody had cut and heaped there for an unknown purpose  in the centre of the lake we see the surrounding hills in a new attitude this being a basin in the midst of them  where they are covered with wood the aspect is gray or black then there are bare slopes of unbroken snow the outlines and indentations being much more hardly and firmly defined than in summer we went southward across the lake directly towards monument mountain which reposes as i said like a headless sphinx  its prominences projections and roughnesses are very evident and it does not present a smooth and placid front as when the grass is green and the trees in leaf  at one end too we are sensible of precipitous descents black and shaggy with the forest that is likely always to grow there and in one streak a headlong sweep downward of snow  we just set our feet on the farther shore and then immediately returned facing the northwestwind which blew very sharply against us  after landing we came homeward tracing up the little brook so far as it lay in our course  it was considerably swollen and rushed fleetly on its course between overhanging banks of snow and ice from which depended adamantine icicles  the little waterfalls with which we had impeded it in the summer and autumn could do no more than form a large ripple so much greater was the volume of water  in some places the crust of frozen snow made a bridge quite over the brook so that you only knew it was there by its brawling sound beneath  the sunsets of winter are incomparably splendid and when the ground is covered with snow no brilliancy of tint expressible by words can come within an infinite distance of the effect  our southern view at that time with the clouds and atmospherical hues is quite indescribable and unimaginable and the various distances of the hills which lie between us and the remote dome of taconic are brought out with an accuracy unattainable in summer  the transparency of the air at this season has the effect of a telescope in bringing objects apparently near while it leaves the scene all its breadth  the sunset sky amidst its splendor has a softness and delicacy that impart themselves to a white marble world  february 18tha walk yesterday afternoon with the children a bright and rather cold day breezy from the north and westward  there has been a good deal of soaking rain lately and it has in great measure cleared hills and plains of snow only it may be seen lying in spots and on each side of stonewalls in a pretty broad streak  the grass is brown and withered and yet scattered all amongst it on close inspection one finds a greennesslittle shrubs that have kept green under all the severity of winter and seem to need no change to fit them for midsummer in the woods we see stones covered with moss that retains likewise a most lively green  where the trees are dense the snow still lies under them on the sides of the mountains some miles off the black pines and the white snow among them together produce a gray effect  the little streams are the most interesting objects at this time some that have an existence only at this seasonmississippis of the momentyet glide and tumble along as if they were perennial  the familiar ones seem strange by their breadth and volume their little waterfalls set off by glaciers on a small scale  the sun has by this time force enough to make sheltered nooks in the angles of woods or on banks warm and comfortable  the lake is still of adamantine substance but all round the borders there is a watery margin altogether strewed or covered with thin and broken ice so that i could not venture on it with the children a chickadee was calling in the woods yesterdaythe only small bird i have taken note of yet but crows have been cawing in the woods for a week past though not in very great numbers   february 22dfor the last two or three days there has been a warm soaking southeasterly rain with a spongy moisture diffused through the atmosphere  the snow has disappeared except in spots which are the ruins of high drifts and patches far up on the hillsides  the mists rest all day long on the brows of the hills that shut in our valley  the road over which i walk every day to and from the village is in the worst state of mud and mire soft slippery nasty to tread upon while the grass beside it is scarcely better being so oozy and so overflowed with little streams and sometimes an absolute bog  the rivulets race along the road adown the hills and wherever there is a permanent brooklet however generally insignificant it is now swollen into importance and the rumble and tumble of its waterfalls may be heard a long way off  the general effect of the day and scenery is black black black  the streams are all as turbid as mudpuddles  imitators of original authors might be compared to plaster casts of marble statues or the imitative book to a cast of the original marble   march 11thafter the ground had been completely freed of snow there has been a snowstorm for the two days preceding yesterday which made the earth all white again  this morning at sunrise the thermometer stood at about 18 degrees above zero  monument mountain stands out in great prominence with its dark forestcovered sides and here and there a large white patch indicating tillage or pasture land but making a generally dark contrast with the white expanse of the frozen and snowcovered lake at its base and the more undulating white of the surrounding country  yesterday under the sunshine of midday and with many voluminous clouds hanging over it and a mist of wintry warmth in the air it had a kind of visionary aspect although still it was brought out in striking relief  but though one could see all its bulgings round swells and precipitous abruptnesses it looked as much akin to the clouds as to solid earth and rock substance  in the early sunshine of the morning the atmosphere being very clear i saw the dome of taconic with more distinctness than ever before the snowpatches and brown uncovered soil on its round head being fully visible  generally it is but a dark blue unvaried mountaintop  all the ruggedness of the intervening hillcountry was likewise effectively brought out  there seems to be a sort of illuminating quality in new snow which it loses after being exposed for a day or two to the suit and atmosphere  for a childs storythe voyage of a little boat made of a chip with a birchbark sail down a river   march 31sta walk with the children yesterday forenoon  we went through the wood where we found partridgeberries half hidden among the dry fallen leaves thence down to the brook  this little brook has not cleansed itself from the disarray of the past autumn and winter and is much embarrassed and choked up with brown leaves twigs and bits of branches  it rushes along merrily and rapidly gurgling cheerfully and tumbling over the impediments of stones with which the children and i made little waterfalls last year  at many spots there are small basins or pools of calmer and smoother depththree feet perhaps in diameter and a foot or two deepin which little fish are already sporting about all elsewhere is tumble and gurgle and mimic turbulence  i sat on the withered leaves at the foot of a tree while the children played a little brook being the most fascinating plaything that a child can have una jumped to and fro across it julian stood beside a pool fishing with a stick without hook or line and wondering that he caught nothing then he made new waterfalls with mighty labor pulling big stones out of the earth and flinging them into the current  then they sent branches of trees or the outer shells of walnuts sailing down the stream and watched their passages through the intricacies of the wayhow they were hurried over in a cascade hurried dizzily round in a whirlpool or brought quite to a standstill amongst the collected rubbish  at last julian tumbled into the brook and was wetted through and through so that we were obliged to come home he squelching along all the way with his indiarubber shoes full of water  there are still patches of snow on the hills also in the woods especially on the northern margins  the lake is not yet what we may call thawed out although there is a large space of blue water and the ice is separated from the shore everywhere and is soft watersoaked and crumbly  on favorable slopes and exposures the earth begins to look green and almost anywhere if one looks closely one sees the greenness of the grass or of little herbage amidst the brown  under the nuttrees are scattered some of the nuts of last year the walnuts have lost their virtue the chestnuts do not seem to have much taste but the butternuts are in no manner deteriorated  the warmth of these days has a mistiness and in many respects resembles the indian summer and is not at all provocative of physical exertion  nevertheless the general impression is of life not death  one feels that a new season has begun   wednesday april 9ththere was a great rain yesterdaywind from the southeast and the last visible vestige of snow disappeared  it was a small patch near the summit of bald mountain just on the upper verge of a grove of trees  i saw a slight remnant of it yesterday afternoon but today it is quite gone  the grass comes up along the roadside and on favorable exposures with a sort of green blush  frogs have been melodious for a fortnight and the birds sing pleasantly   april 20ththe children found houstonias more than a week ago  there have been easterly wind continual cloudiness and occasional rain for a week  this morning opened with a great snowstorm from the northeast one of the most earnest snowstorms of the year though rather more moist than in midwinter  the earth is entirely covered  now as the day advances towards noon it shows some symptoms of turning to rain   april 28thfor a week we have found the trailing arbutus pretty abundant in the woods  a day or two since una found a few purple violets and yesterday a dandelion in bloom  the fragrance of the arbutus is spicy and exquisite   may 16thin our walks now the children and i find blue white and golden violets the former especially of great size and richness houstonias are very abundant bluewhitening some of the pastures  they are a very sociable little flower and dwell close together in

23di think the face of nature can never look more beautiful than now with this so fresh and youthful greenthe trees not being fully in leaf yet enough so to give airy shade to the woods  the sunshine fills them with green light  monument mountain and its brethren are green and the lightness of the tint takes away something from their massiveness and ponderosity and they respond with livelier effect to the shine and shade of the sky  each tree now within sight stands out in its own individuality of line  this is a very windy day and the light shifts with magical alternation  in a walk to the lake just now with the children we found abundance of flowerswild geranium violets of all families red columbines and many others known and unknown besides innumerable blossoms of the wild strawberry which has been in bloom for the past fortnight  the houstonias seem quite to overspread some pastures when viewed from a distance  not merely the flowers but the various shrubs which one

21stgoing to the village yesterday afternoon i saw the face of a beautiful woman gazing at me from a cloud  it was the full face not the bust  it had a sort of mantle on the head and a pleasant expression of countenance  the vision lasted while i took a few steps and then vanished  i never before saw nearly so distinct a cloudpicture or rather sculpture for it came out in altorilievo on the body of the cloud   october 27ththe ground this morning is white with a thin covering of snow  the foliage has still some variety of hue  the dome of taconic looks dark and seems to have no snow on it though i dont understand how that can be  i saw a moment ago on the lake a very singular spectacle  there is a high northwestwind ruffling the lakes surface and making it blue leadcolored or bright in stripes or at intervals but what i saw was a boiling up of foam which began at the right bank of the lake and passed quite across it and the mist flew before it like the cloud out of a steamengine  a fierce and narrow blast of wind must have ploughed the water in a straight line from side to side of the lake  as fast as it went on the foam subsided behind it so that it looked somewhat like a seaserpent or other monster swimming very rapidly   october 29thon a walk to scotts pond with ellery channing we found a wild strawberry in the woods not quite ripe but beginning to redden for a week

wayside brook is made to pour itself into the bunghole of a barrel in order to cleanse it for the new cider   november 3dthe face of the country is dreary now in a cloudy day like the present  the

rankness   the isles of shoals monday august 30thleft concord at a quarter of nine a m  friday september 3 set sail at about half past ten to the isles of shoals  the passengers were an old master of a vessel a young rather genteel man from greenland n h two yankees from hamilton and danvers and a country trader i should judge from some inland town of new hampshire  the old seacaptain preparatory to sailing bought a bunch of cigars they cost ten cents and occasionally puffed one  the two yankees had brought guns on board and asked questions about the fishing of the shoals  they were young men brothers the youngest a shopkeeper in danvers the other a farmer i imagine at hamilton and both specimens of the least polished kind of yankee and therefore proper to those localities  they were at first full of questions and greatly interested in whatever was going forward but anon the shopkeeper began to grow first a little then very sick till he lay along the boat longing as he afterwards said for a little fresh water to be drowned in  his brother attended him in a very kindly way but became sick himself before he reached the end of the voyage  the young greenlander talked politics or rather discussed the personal character of pierce  the new hampshire trader said not a word or hardly one all the way  a portsmouth youth whom i forgot to mention sat in the stern of the boat looking very white  the skipper of the boat is a norwegian a goodnatured fellow not particularly intelligent and speaking in a dialect somewhat like irish  he had a man with him a silent and rather sulky fellow who at the captains bidding grimly made himself useful  the wind not being favorable we had to make several tacks before reaching the islands where we arrived at about two oclock  we landed at appledore on which is laightons hotela large building with a piazza or promenade before it about an hundred and twenty feet in length or moreyes it must be more  it is an edifice with a centre and two wings the central part upwards of seventy feet  at one end of the promenade is a covered veranda thirty or forty feet square so situated that the breeze draws across it from the sea on one side of the island to the sea on the other and it is the breeziest and comfortablest place in the world on a hot day  there are two swings beneath it and here one may sit or walk and enjoy life while all other mortals are suffering  as i entered the door of the hotel there met me a short corpulent round and fullfaced man rather elderly if not old  he was a little lame  he addressed me in a hearty hospitable tone and judging that it must be my landlord i delivered a letter of introduction from pierce of course it was fully efficient in obtaining the best accommodations that were to be had  i found that we were expected a man having brought the news of our intention the day before  here ensued great inquiries after the general and wherefore he had not come  i was looked at with considerable curiosity on my own account especially by the ladies of whom there were several agreeable and pretty enough  there were four or five gentlemen most of whom had not much that was noteworthy  after dinner which was good and abundant though somewhat rude in its style i was introduced by mr laighton to mr thaxter his soninlaw and mr weiss a clergyman of new bedford who is staying here for his health  they showed me some of the remarkable features of the island such as a deep chasm in the cliffs of the shore towards the southwest also a monument of rude stones on the highest point of the island said to have been erected by captain john smith before the settlement at plymouth  the tradition is just as good as truth  also some ancient cellars with thistles and other weeds growing in them and old fragmentary bricks scattered about  the date of these habitations is not known but they may well be the remains of the settlement that cotton mather speaks about or perhaps one of them was the house where sir william pepperell was born and where he went when he and somebody else set up a stick and travelled to seek their fortunes in the direction in which it fell  in the evening the company at the hotel made up two whist parties at one of which i sat downmy partner being an agreeable young lady from portsmouth  we played till i at least was quite weary  it had been the beautifullest of weather all day very hot on the mainland but a delicious climate under our veranda   saturday september 4thanother beautiful day rather cooler than the preceding but not too cool  i can bear this coolness better than that of the interior  in the forenoon i took passage for star island in a boat that crosses daily whenever there are passengers  my companions were the two yankees who had quite recovered from yesterdays sickness and were in the best of spirits and the utmost activity of mind of which they were capable  never was there such a string of questions as they directed to the boatmanquestions that seemed to have no gist so far as related to any use that could be made of the answers  they appear to be very good young men however wellmeaning and with manners not disagreeable because their hearts are not amiss  star island is less than a mile from appledore  it is the most populous island of the grouphas been for three or four years an incorporated township and sends a representative to the new hampshire legislature  the number of voters is variously represented as from eighteen to twentyeight  the inhabitants are all i presume fishermen  their houses stand in pretty close neighborhood to one another scattered about without the slightest regularity or pretence of a street there being no wheelcarriages on the island  some of the houses are very comfortable twostory dwellings  i saw two or three i think with flowers  there are also one or two trees on the island  there is a strong odor of fishiness and the little cove is full of mackerelboats and other small craft for fishing in some of which little boys of no growth at all were paddling about  nearly in the centre of this insular metropolis is a twostory house with a flagstaff in the yard  this is the hotel  on the highest point of star island stands the churcha small wooden structure and sitting in its shadow i found a redbaizeskirted fisherman who seemed quite willing to converse  he said that there was a minister here who was also the schoolmaster but that he did not keep school just now because his wife was very much out of health  the schoolhouse stood but a little way from the meetinghouse and near it was the ministers dwelling and by and by i had a glimpse of the good man himself in his suit of black which looked in very decent condition at the distance from which i viewed it  his clerical air was quite distinguishable and it was rather curious to see it when everybody else wore redbaize shirts and fishingboots and looked of the scaly genus he did not approach me and i saw him no nearer  i soon grew weary of gosport and was glad to reembark although i intend to revisit the island with mr thaxter and see more of its peculiarities and inhabitants  i saw one old witchlooking woman creeping about with a cane and stooping down seemingly to gather herbs  on mentioning her to mr thaxter after my return he said that it was probably the bearded woman  i did not observe her beard but very likely she may have had one  the larger part of the company at the hotel returned to the mainland today  there remained behind however a mr t from newburyport a man of natural refinement and a taste for reading that seems to point towards the writings of emerson thoreau and men of that class  i have had a good deal of talk with him and at first doubted whether he might not be a clergyman but mr thaxter tells me that he has made his own way in the worldwas once a sailor before the mast and is now engaged in mercantile pursuits  he looks like nothing of this kind being tall and slender with very quiet manners not beautiful though pleasing from the refinement that they indicate  he has rather a precise and careful pronunciation but yet a natural way of talking  in the afternoon i walked round a portion of the island that i had not previously visited and in the evening went with mr titcomb to mr thaxters to drink appletoddy  we found mrs thaxter sitting in a neat little parlor very simply furnished but in good taste  she is not now i believe more than eighteen years old very pretty and with the manners of a ladynot prim and precise but with enough of freedom and ease  the books on the table were preraphaelitism a tract on spiritual mediums etc  there were several shelves of books on one side of the room and engravings on the walls  mr weiss was there and i do not know but he is an inmate of mr thaxters  by and by came in mr thaxters brother with a young lady whose position i do not know either a sister or the brothers wife  anon too came in the appletoddy a very rich and spicy compound after which we had some glees and negro melodies in which mr thaxter sang a noble bass and mrs thaxter sang like a bird and mr weiss sang i suppose tenor and the brother took some other part and all were very mirthful and jolly at about ten oclock mr titcomb and myself took leave and emerging into the open air out of that room of song and pretty youthfulness of woman and gay young men there was the sky and the threequarters waning moon and the old sea moaning all round about the island   sunday september 5thtoday i have done little or nothing except to roam along the shore of the island and to sit under the piazza talking with mr laighton or some of his halfdozen guests and about an hour before dinner i came up to my room and took a brief nap  since dinner i have been writing the foregoing journal  i observe that the fanny ellsler our passenger and mail boat has arrived from portsmouth and now lies in a little cove moored to the rocky shore with a flag flying at her mainmast  we have been watching her for some hours but she stopped to fish and then went to some other island before putting in here  i must go and see what news she has brought  what did you fire at asked one of the yankees just now of a boy who had been firing a gun  nothing said the boy  did you hit it rejoined the yankee  the farmer is of a much ruder and rougher mould than his brother heavier in frame and mind and far less cultivated  it was on this account probably that he labored as a farmer instead of setting up a shop  when it is warm as yesterday he takes off his coat and not minding whether or no his shirtsleeves be soiled goes in this guise to meals or wherever elsenot resuming his coat as long as he is more comfortable without it  his shoulders have a stoop and altogether his air is that of a farmer in repose  his brother is handsome and might have quite the aspect of a smart comely young man if well dressed  this island is said to be haunted by a spectre called old bab  he was one of captain kidds men and was slain for the protection of the treasure  mr laighton said that before he built his house nothing would have induced the inhabitant of another island to come to this after nightfall  the ghost especially haunts the space between the hotel and the cove in front  there has in times past been great search for the treasure  mr thaxter tells me that the women on the island are very timid as to venturing on the seamore so than the women of the mainlandand that they are easily frightened about their husbands  very few accidents happen to the boats or mennone i think since mr thaxter has been here  they are not an enterprising set of people never liking to make long voyages  sometimes one of them will ship on a voyage to the west indies but generally only on coastwise trips or fishing or mackerel voyages  they have a very strong local attachment and return to die they are now generally temperate formerly very much the contrary   september 5tha large part of the guests took their departure after an early breakfast this morning including mr titcomb mr weiss the two yankees and mr thaxterwho however went as skipper or supercargo and will return with the boat  i have been fishing for cunners off the rocks but with intolerably poor success  there is nothing so dispiriting as poor fishing and i spend most of the time with my head on my hands looking at the sea breaking against the rocks shagged around the bases with seaweed  it is a sunny forenoon with a cool breeze from the southwest  the mackerel craft are in the offing  mr laighton says that the spy the boat which went to the mainland this morning is now on her return with all her colors set and he thinks that pierce is on board he having sent mr thaxter to invite him to come in this boat  pierce arrived before dinner in the spy accompanied by judge upham and his brother and their wives his own wife mr furness and three young ladies  after dinner some of the gentlemen crossed over to gosport where we visited the old graveyard in which were monuments to rev mr tucke died 1773 after forty years settlement and to another and later minister of the island  they were of red freestone lying horizontally on piles of the granite fragments such as are scattered all about there were other graves marked by the rudest shapes of stones at head and foot  and so many stones protruded from the ground that it was wonderful how space and depth enough was found between them to cover the dead  we went to the house of the town clerk of gosport a drunken fisherman joe caswell by name and there found the town records commencing in 1732 in a beautiful style of penmanship  they are imperfect the township having been broken up probably at the time of the revolution  caswell being very drunk immediately put in a petition to pierce to build a seamole for the protection of the navigation of the island when he should be president  he was dressed in the ordinary fishermans styleredbaize shirt trousers tucked into large boots which as he had just come ashore were wet with salt water  he led us down to the shore of the island towards the east and showed us betty moodys hole  this betty moody was a woman of the island in old times  the indians came off on a depredating excursion and she fled from them with a child and hid herself in this hole which is formed by several great rocks being lodged so as to cover one of the fissures which are common along these shores  i crept into the hole which is somewhat difficult of access long low and narrow and might well enough be a hidingplace  the child or children began to cry and betty fearful of discovery murdered them to save herself  joe caswell did not tell the latter part of the story but mr thaxter did  not far from the spot there is a point of rocks extending out farther into the ocean than the rest of the island  some four or five years ago there was a young woman residing at gosport in the capacity of schoolteacher  she was of a romantic turn and used to go and sit on this point of rock to view the waves  one day when the wind was high and the surf raging against the rocks a great wave struck her as she sat on the edge and seemed to deprive her of sense another wave or the reflex of the same one carried her off into the sea and she was seen no more  this happened i think in 1846  passing a rock near the centre of the island which rose from the soil about breasthigh and appeared to have been split asunder with an incalculably aged and mossgrown fissure the surfaces of which however precisely suited each other mr hatch mentioned that there was an idea among the people with regard to rocks thus split that they were rent asunder at the time of the crucifixion  judge upham observed that this superstition was common in all parts of the country  mr hatch said that he was professionally consulted the other day by a man who had been digging for buried treasure at dover point up the piscataqua river and while he and his companions were thus engaged the owner of the land came upon them and compelled hatchs client to give him a note for a sum of money  the object was to inquire whether this note was obligatory  hatch says that there are a hundred people now resident in portsmouth who at one time or another have dug for treasure  the process is in the first place to find out the site of the treasure by the diviningrod  a circle is then described with the steel rod about the spot and a man walks around within its verge reading the bible to keep off the evil spirit while his companions dig if a word is spoken the whole business is a failure  once the person who told him the story reached the lid of the chest so that the spades plainly scraped upon it when one of the men spoke and the chest immediately moved sideways into the earth  another time when he was reading the bible within the circle a creature like a white horse but immoderately large came from a distance towards the circle looked at him and then began to graze about the spot  he saw the motion of the jaws but heard no sound of champing  his companions saw the gigantic horse precisely as he did only to them it appeared bay instead of white  the islanders stared with great curiosity at pierce  one pretty young woman appeared inclined to engross him entirely to herself  there is a bowlingalley on the island at which some of the young fishermen were rolling   september 7th    i have made no exploration today except a walk with the guests in the morning but have lounged about the piazza and veranda  it has been a calm warm sunny day the sea slumbering against the shores and now and then breaking into white foam  the surface of the island is plentifully overgrown with whortleberry and bayberry bushes  the sheep cut down the former so that few berries are produced the latter gives a pleasant fragrance when pressed in the hand the island is one great ledge of rock four hundred acres in extent with a little soil thrown scantily over it but the bare rock everywhere emerging not only in points but still more in flat surfaces  the only trees i think are two that mr laighton has been trying to raise in front of the hotel the taller of which looks scarcely so much as ten feet high  it is now about sunset and the fanny with the mail is just arrived at the moorings  so still is it that the sounds on board as of throwing oars into a small boat are distinctly heard though a quarter of a mile off  she has the stars and stripes flying at the mainmast there appear to be no passengers  the only reptile on the island is a very vivid and beautiful green snake which is exceedingly abundant  yesterday while catching grasshoppers for fishbait i nearly griped one in my hand indeed i rather think i did gripe it  the snake was as much startled as myself and in its fright stood an instant on its tail before it recovered presence of mind to glide away  these snakes are quite harmless   september 8thlast evening we could hear the roaring of the beaches at hampton and rye nine miles off  the surf likewise swelled against the rocky shores of the island though there was little or no wind and except for the swell the surface was smooth  the sheep bleated loudly and all these tokens according to mr laighton foreboded a storm to windward  this morning nevertheless there were no further signs of it it is sunny and calm or only the slightest breeze from the westward a haze sleeping along the shore betokening a warm day the surface of the sea streaked with smoothness and gentle ruffles of wind  it has been the hottest day that i have known here and probably one of the hottest of the season ashore and the land is now imperceptible in the haze  smiths monument is about seven feet high and probably ten or twelve in diameter at its base  it is a cairn or mere heap of stones thrown together as they came to hand though with some selection of large and flat ones towards the base and with smaller ones thrown in  at the foundation there are large rocks naturally imbedded in the earth  i see no reason to disbelieve that a part of this monument may have been erected by captain smith although subsequent visitors may have added to it  laighton says it is known to have stood upwards of a hundred years it is a work of considerable labor and would more likely have been erected by one who supposed himself the first discoverer of the island than by anybody afterwards for mere amusement  i observed in some places towards the base that the lichens had grown from one stone to another and there is nothing in the appearance of the monument that controverts the supposition of its antiquity  it is an irregular circle somewhat decreasing towards the top  few of the stones except at the base are bigger than a man could easily liftmany of them are not more than a foot across  it stands towards the southern part of the island and all the other islands are visible from itsmutty nose star island and white islandon which is the lighthousemuch of laightons island the proper name of which is hog though latterly called appledore and duck island which looks like a mere reef of rocks and about a mile farther into the ocean easterly of hog island  laightons hotel together with the house in which his soninlaw resides which was likewise built by laighton and stands about fifty yards from the hotel occupies the middle of a shallow valley which passes through the island from east to west  looking from the veranda you have the ocean opening towards the east and the bay towards rye beach and portsmouth on the west  in the same storm that overthrew minots light a year or two ago a great wave passed entirely through this valley and laighton describes it when it came in from the sea as toppling over to the height of the cupola of his hotel  it roared and whitened through from sea to sea twenty feet abreast rolling along huge rocks in its passage  it passed beneath his veranda which stands on posts and probably filled the valley completely  would i had been here to see  the day has been exceedingly hot  since dinner the spy has arrived from portsmouth with a party of half a dozen or more men and women and children apparently from the interior of new hampshire  i am rather sorry to receive these strangers into the quiet life that we are leading here for we had grown quite to feel ourselves at home and the two young ladies mr thaxter his wife and sister and myself met at mealtimes like one family  the young ladies gathered shells arranged them laughed gently sang and did other pretty things in a youngladylike way  these newcomers are people of uncouth voices and loud laughter and behave themselves as if they were trying to turn their expedition to as much account as possible in the way of enjoyment  johns boat the regular passengerboat is now coming in and probably brings the mail  in the afternoon while some of the newcomers were fishing off the rocks west of the hotel a shark came close in shore  hearing their outcries i looked out of my chamber window and saw the dorsal fin and the fluke of his tail stuck up out of the water as he moved to and fro he must have been eight or ten feet long  he had probably followed the small fish into the bay and got bewildered and at one time he was almost aground  oscar mr laightons son ran down with a gun and fired at the shark which was then not more than ten yards from the shore  he aimed according to his fathers directions just below the junction of the dorsal fin with the body but the gun was loaded only with shot and seemed to produce no effect  oscar had another shot at him afterwards the shark floundered a little in the water but finally got off and disappeared probably without very serious damage  he came so near the shore that he might have been touched with a boathook   september 9thmr thaxter rowed me this morning in his dory to white island on which is the lighthouse  there was scarcely a breath of air and a perfectly calm sea an intensely hot sunshine with a little haze so that the horizon was indistinct  here and there sailboats sleeping on the water or moving almost imperceptibly over it  the lighthouse island would be difficult of access in a rough sea the shore being so rocky  on landing we found the keeper peeling his harvest of onions which he had gathered prematurely because the insects were eating them his little patch of garden seemed to be a strange kind of soil as like marine mud as anything but he had a fair crop of marrow squashes though injured as he said by the last storm and there were cabbages and a few turnips  i recollect no other garden vegetables  the grass grows pretty luxuriantly and looked very green where there was any soil but he kept no cow nor even a pig nor a hen  his house stands close by the garden a small stone building with peaked roof and whitewashed  the lighthouse stands on a ledge of rock with a galley between and there is a long covered way triangular in shape connecting his residence with it  we ascended into the lantern which is eightyseven feet high  it is a revolving light with several great illuminators of copper silvered and colored lampglasses  looking downward we had the island displayed as on a chart with its little bays its isthmus of shingly beach connecting two parts of the island and overflowed at high tide its sunken rocks about it indicated by the swell or slightly breaking surf the keeper of the lighthouse was formerly a writingmaster  he has a sneaking kind of look and does not bear a very high character among his neighbors  since he kept the light he has lost two wivesthe first a young creature whom he used to leave alone upon this desolate rock and the gloom and terror of the situation were probably the cause of her death  the second wife experiencing the same kind of treatment ran away from him and returned to her friends  he pretends to be religious but drinks  about a year ago he attempted to row out alone from portsmouth  there was a head wind and head tide and he would have inevitably drifted out to sea if mr thaxter had not saved him  while we were standing in his gardenpatch i heard a womans voice inside the dwelling but know not whose it was  a lighthouse nine miles from shore would be a delightful place for a newmarried couple to spend their honeymoon or their whole first year  on our way back we landed at another island called londoners rock or some such name  it has but little soil  as we approached it a large bird flew away  mr thaxter took it to be a gannet and while walking over the island an owl started up from among the rocks near us and flew away apparently uncertain of its course  it was a brown owl but mr thaxter says that there are beautiful white owls which spend the winter here and feed upon rats  these are very abundant and live amidst the rocksprobably having been brought hither by vessels  the water today was not so transparent as sometimes but had a slight haze diffused through it somewhat like that of the atmosphere  the passengers brought by the spy yesterday still remain with us  they consist of country traders a country doctor and such sorts of people rude shrewd and simple and wellbehaved enough wondering at sharks and equally at lobsters sitting down to table with their coats off helping themselves out of the dish with their own forks taking pudding on the plates off which they have eaten meat  people at just this stage of manners are more disagreeable than at any other stage  they are aware of some decencies but not so deeply aware as to make them a matter of conscience  they may be heard talking of the financial affairs of the expedition reckoning what money each has paid  one offers to pay another three or four cents which the latter has overpaid  its of no consequence sir says his friend with a tone of conscious liberality thats near enough  this is a most tremendously hot day  there is a young lady staying at the hotel afflicted with what her friends call erysipelas but which is probably scrofula  she seems unable to walk or sit up but every pleasant day about the middle of the forenoon she is dragged out beneath the veranda on a sofa  today she has been there until late in the decline of the afternoon  it is a delightful place where the breezes stir if any are in motion  the young girls her sisters or cousins and mr thaxters sister sat round her babbling cheerfully and singing and they were so merry that it did not seem as if there could be an incurably sick one in the midst of them  the spy came today with more passengers of no particular character she still remains off the landing moored with her sails in the wind  the mail arrived today but nothing for me  close by the veranda at the end of the hotel is drawn up a large boat of ten or twelve tons which got injured in some gale and probably will remain there for years to decay and be a picturesque and characteristic object  the spy has been lying in the broad track of golden light thrown by the sun far down towards the horizon over the rippling water her sails throwing distinct dark shadows over the brightness  she has now got under way and set sail on a northwest course for portsmouth carrying off i believe all the passengers she brought today   september 10thhere is another beautiful morning with the sun dimpling in the early sunshine  four sailboats are in sight motionless on the sea with the whiteness of their sails reflected in it  the heathaze sleeps along the shore though not so as quite to hide it and there is the promise of another very warm day  as yet however the air is cool and refreshing  around the island there is the little ruffle of a breeze but where the sailboats are a mile or more off the sea is perfectly calm  the crickets sing and i hear the chirping of birds besides  at the base of the lighthouse yesterday we saw the wings and feathers of a decayed little bird and mr thaxter said they often flew against the lantern with such force as to kill themselves and that large quantities of them might be picked up  how came these little birds out of their nests at night  why should they meet destruction from the radiance that proves the salvation of other beings  mr thaxter had once a man living with him who had seen old bab the ghost  he met him between the hotel and the sea and describes him as dressed in a sort of frock and with a very dreadful countenance  two or three years ago the crew of a wrecked vessel a brigantine wrecked near boon island landed on hog island of a winter night and found shelter in the hotel  it was from the eastward  there were six or seven men with the mate and captain  it was midnight when they got ashore  the common sailors as soon as they were physically comfortable seemed to be perfectly at ease  the captain walked the floor bemoaning himself for a silver watch which he had lost the mate being the only married man talked about his eunice  they all told their dreams of the preceding night and saw in them prognostics of the misfortune  there is now a breeze the blue ruffle of which seems to reach almost across to the mainland yet with streaks of calm and in one place the glassy surface of a lake of calmness amidst the surrounding commotion  the wind in the early morning was from the west and the aspect of the sky seemed to promise a warm and sunny day  but all at once soon after breakfast the wind shifted round to the eastward and great volumes of fog almost as dense as cannonsmoke came sweeping from the eastern ocean through the valley and past the house  it soon covered the whole sea and the whole island beyond a verge of a few hundred yards  the chilliness was not so great as accompanies a change of wind on the mainland  we had been watching a large ship that was slowly making her way between us and the land towards portsmouth  this was now hidden the breeze is still very moderate but the boat moored near the shore rides with a considerable motion as if the sea were getting up  mr laighton says that the artist who adorned trinity church in new york with sculpture wanted some real wings from which to imitate the wings of cherubim  mr thaxter carried him the wings of the white owl that winters here at the shoals together with those of some other bird and the artist gave his cherubim the wings of an owl  this morning there have been two boatloads of visitors from rye  they merely made a flying call and took to their boats againa disagreeable and impertinent kind of people  the spy arrived before dinner with several passengers  after dinner came the fanny bringing among other freight a large basket of delicious pears to me together with a note from mr b b titcomb  he is certainly a man of excellent taste and admirable behavior  i sent a plateful of pears to the room of each guest now in the hotel kept a dozen for myself and gave the balance to mr laighton  the two portsmouth young ladies returned in the spy  i had grown accustomed to their presence and rather liked them one of them being gay and rather noisy and the other quiet and gentle  as to newcomers i feel rather a distaste to them and so i find does mr laightona rather singular sentiment for a hotelkeeper to entertain towards his guests  however he treats them very hospitably when once within his doors  the sky is overcast and about the time of the spy and the fanny sailed there were a few drops of rain  the wind at that time was strong enough to raise whitecaps to the eastward of the island and there was good hope of a storm  now however the wind has subsided and the weatherseers know not what to forebode   september 11ththe wind shifted and veered about towards the close of yesterday and later it was almost calm after blowing gently from the northwestnotwithstanding which it rained  there being a mistiness in the air we could see the gleam of the lighthouse itself by the highest point of this island or by our being in a valley  as we sat in the piazza in the evening we saw the light from on board some vessel move slowly through the distant obscurityso slowly that we were only sensible of its progress by forgetting it and looking again  the plash and murmur of the waves around the island were soothingly audible  it was not unpleasantly cold and mr laighton mr thaxter and myself sat under the piazza till long after dark the former at a little distance occasionally smoking his pipe and mr thaxter and i talking about poets and the stage  the latter is an odd subject to be discussed in this stern and wild scene which has precisely the same characteristics now as two hundred years ago  the mosquitoes were very abundant last night and they are certainly a hardier race than their inland brethren  this morning there is a sullen sky with scarcely any breeze  the clouds throw shadows of varied darkness upon the sea  i know not which way the wind is but the aspect of things seems to portend a calm drizzle as much as anything else  about eleven oclock mr thaxter took me over to smutty nose in his dory  a sloop from the eastward laden with laths bark and other lumber and a few barrels of mackerel filled yesterday and was left by her skipper and crew  all the morning we have seen boats picking up her deckload which was scattered over the sea and along the shores of the islands  the skipper and his three men got into smutty nose in the boat and the sloop was afterwards boarded by the smutty noses and brought into that island  we saw her lying at the piera black ugly rotten old thing with the water halfway over her decks  the wonder was how she swam so long  the skipper a man of about thirtyfive or forty in a blue pilotcloth overcoat and a rusty highcrowned hat jammed down over his brow looked very forlorn while the islanders were grouped about indolently enjoying the matter  i walked with mr thaxter over the island and saw first the graves of the spaniards  they were wrecked on this island a hundred years ago and lie buried in a range about thirty feet in length to the number of sixteen with rough mossgrown pieces of granite on each side of this common grave  near this spot yet somewhat removed so as not to be confounded with it are other individual graves chiefly of the haley family who were once possessors of the island  these have slate gravestones  there is also within a small enclosure of rough pine boards a white marble gravestone in memory of a young man named bekker son of the person who now keeps the hotel on smutty nose  he was buried mr thaxter says notwithstanding his marble monument in a rude pine box which he himself helped to make  we walked to the farthest point of the island and i have never seen a more dismal place than it was on this sunless and eastwindy day being the farthest point out into the melancholy sea which was in no very agreeable mood and roared sullenly against the wilderness of rocks  one mass of rock more than twelve feet square was thrown up out of the sea in a storm not many years since and now lies athwartwise never to be moved unless another omnipotent wave shall give it another toss  on shore such a rock would be a landmark for centuries  it is inconceivable how a sufficient mass of water could be brought to bear on this ponderous mass but not improbably all the fragments piled upon one another round these islands have thus been flung to and fro at one time or another  there is considerable land that would serve tolerably for pasture on smutty nose and here and there a little enclosure of richer grass built round with a strong stonewall  the same kind of enclosure is prevalent on star islandeach small proprietor fencing off his little bit of tillage or grass  wildflowers are abundant and various on these islands the bayberrybush is plentiful on smutty nose and makes the hand that crushes it fragrant  the hotel is kept by a prussian an old soldier who fought at the battle of waterloo  we saw him in the barna gray heavy roundskulled old fellow troubled with deafness  the skipper of the wrecked sloop had apparently just been taking a drop of comfort but still seemed downcast  he took passage in a fishingvessel the wave of kittery for portsmouth and i know not why but there was something that made me smile in his grim and gloomy look his rusty jammed hat his rough and grisly beard and in his mode of chewing tobacco with much action of the jaws getting out the juice as largely as possible as men always do when disturbed in mind  i looked at him earnestly and was conscious of something that marked him out from among the careless islanders around him  being as much discomposed as it was possible for him to be his feelings individualized the man and magnetized the observer  when he got aboard the fishingvessel he seemed not entirely at his ease being accustomed to command and work amongst his own little crew and now having nothing to do  nevertheless unconsciously perhaps he lent a hand to whatever was going on and yet had a kind of strangeness about him  as the wave set sail we were just starting in our dory and a young fellow an acquaintance of mr thaxter proposed to take us in tow so we were dragged along at her stern very rapidly and with a whitening wake until we came off hog island  then the dory was cast loose and mr thaxter rowed ashore against a head sea  the day is still overcast and the wind is from the eastward but it does not increase and the sun appears occasionally on the point of shining out  a boatthe fanny i suppose from portsmouthhas just come to her moorings in front of the hotel  a sailboat has put off from her with a passenger in the stern  pray god she bring me a letter with good news from home for i begin to feel as if i had been long enough away  there is a bowlingalley on smutty nose at which some of the starislanders were playing when we were there  i saw only two dwellinghouses besides the hotel  connected with smutty nose by a stonewall there is another little bit of island called malaga  both are the property of mr laighton  mr laighton says that the spanish wreck occurred fortyseven years ago instead of a hundred  some of the dead bodies were found on malaga others on various parts of the next island  one or two had crept to a stonewall that traverses smutty nose but were unable to get over it one was found among the bushes the next summer  mr haley had them buried at his own expense  the skipper of the wrecked sloop yesterday was unwilling to go to portsmouth until he was shavedhis beard being of several days growth it seems to be the impulse of people under misfortune to put on their best clothes and attend to the decencies of life  the fanny brought a passengera thin stiff blackhaired young man who enters his name as mr tufts from charlestown  he and a country trader his wife sister and two children all of whom have been here several days are now the only guests besides myself   september 12ththe night set in sullen and gloomy and morning has dawned in pretty much the same way  the wind however seems rising somewhat and grumbles past the angle of the house  perhaps we shall see a storm yet from the eastward and having the whole sweep of the broad atlantic between here and ireland i do not see why it should not be fully equal to a storm at sea  it has been raining more or less all the forenoon and now at twelve oclock blows as mr laighton says half a gale from the southeast through the opening of our shallow valley towards the east there is the prospect of a tumbling sea with hundreds of whitecaps chasing one another over it  in front of the hotel being to leeward the water near the shore is but slightly ruffled but farther the sea is agitated and the surf breaks over square rock  all round the horizon landward as well as seaward the view is shut in by a mist  sometimes i have a dim sense of the continent beyond but no more distinct than the thought of the other world to the unenlightened soul  the sheep bleat in their desolate pasture  the wind shakes the house  a loon seeking i suppose some quieter restingplace than on the troubled waves was seen swimming just now in the cove not more than a hundred yards from the hotel  judging by the pother which this half a gale makes with the sea it must have been a terrific time indeed when that great wave rushed and roared across the islands  since dinner i have been to the eastern shore to look at the sea  it is a wild spectacle but still i suppose lacks an infinite deal of being a storm  outside of this island there is a long and low one or two in a line looking more like a reef of rocks than an island and at the distance of a mile or more  there the surf and spray break gallantly whitesheeted forms rising up all at once and hovering a moment in the air  spots which in calm times are not discernible from the rest of the ocean now are converted into white foamy breakers  the swell of the waves against our shore makes a snowy depth tinged with green for many feet back from the shore  the longer waves swell overtop and rush upon the rocks and when they return the waters pour back in a cascade against the outer points of smutty nose and star island there is a higher surf than here because the wind being from the southeast these islands receive it first and form a partial barrier in respect to this while i looked there was moisture in the air and occasional spats of rain  the uneven places in the rocks were full of the fallen rain  it is quite impossible to give an idea of these rocky shoreshow confusedly they are tossed together lying in all directions what solid ledges what great fragments thrown out from the rest  often the rocks are broken square and angular so as to form a kind of staircase though for the most part such as would require a giant stride to ascend them  sometimes a black traprock runs through the bed of granite sometimes the sea has eaten this away leaving a long irregular fissure  in some places owing to the same cause perhaps there is a great hollow place excavated into the ledge and forming a harbor into which the sea flows and while there is foam and fury at the entrance it is comparatively calm within  some parts of the crag are as much as fifty feet of perpendicular height down which you look over a bare and smooth descent at the base of which is a shaggy margin of seaweed  but it is vain to try to express this confusion  as much as anything else it seems as if some of the massive materials of the world remained superfluous after the creator had finished and were carelessly thrown down here where the millionth part of them emerge from the sea and in the course of thousands of years have become partially bestrewn with a little soil  the wind has changed to southwest and blows pretty freshly  the sun shone before it set and the mist which all day has overhung the land now takes the aspect of a clouddrawing a thin veil between us and the shore and rising above it  in our own atmosphere there is no fog nor mist   september 13thi spent last evening as well as part of the evening before at mr thaxters  it is certainly a romantic incident to find such a young man on this lonely island his marriage with the pretty miranda is true romance  in our talk we have glanced over many matters and among the rest that of the stage to prepare himself for which was his first motive in coming hither  he appears quite to have given up any dreams of that kind now  what he will do on returning to the world as his purpose is i cannot imagine but no doubt through all their remaining life both he and she will look back to this rocky ledge with its handful of soil as to a paradise  last evening we mr mrs and miss thaxter sat and talked of ghosts and kindred subjects and they told me of the appearance of a little old woman in a striped gown that had come into that house a few months ago she was seen by nobody but an irish nurse who spoke to her but received no answer  the little woman drew her chair up towards the fire and stretched out her feet to warm them  by and by the nurse who suspected nothing of her ghostly character went to get a pail of water and when she came back the little woman was not there  it being known precisely how many and what people were on the island and that no such little woman was among them the fact of her being a ghost is incontestable  i taught them how to discover the hidden sentiments of letters by suspending a gold ring over them  ordinarily since i have been here we have spent the evening under the piazza where mr laighton sits to take the air  he seems to avoid the withindoors whenever he can  so there he sits in the seabreezes when inland people are probably drawing their chairs to the fireside and there i sit with himnot keeping up a continual flow of talk but each speaking as any wisdom happens to come into his mind  the wind this morning is from the northwestward rather brisk but not very strong  there is a scattering of clouds about the sky but the atmosphere is singularly clear and we can see several hills of the interior the cloudlike white mountains and along the shore the long white beaches and the dotted dwellings with great distinctness  many small vessels spread their wings and go seaward  i have been rambling over the southern part of the island and looking at the traces of habitations there  there are several enclosuresthe largest perhaps thirty yards squaresurrounded with a rough stonewall of very mossy antiquity built originally broad and strong two or three large stones in width and piled up breasthigh or more and taking advantage of the extending ledge to make it higher  within this enclosure there is almost a clear space of soil which was formerly no doubt cultivated as a garden but is now close cropt by the sheep and cattle except where it produces thistles or the poisonous weed called mercury which seems to love these old walls and to root itself in or near them  these walls are truly venerable gray and mossy and you see at once that the hands that piled the stones must have been long ago turned to dust  close by the enclosure is the hollow of an old cellar with rocks tumbled into it but the layers of stone at the side still to be traced and bricks broken or with rounded edges scattered about and perhaps pieces of lime and weeds and grass growing about the whole several such sites of former human homes may be seen there none of which can possibly be later than the revolution and probably they are as old as the settlement of the island  the site has smutty nose and star opposite with a road that is a waterroad between varying from half a mile to a mile  duck island is also seen on the left and on the right the shore of the mainland  behind the rising ground intercepts the view  smiths monument is visible  i do not see where the inhabitants could have kept their boats unless in the chasms worn by the sea into the rocks  one of these chasms has a spring of fresh water in the gravelly base down to which the sea has worn out  the chasm has perpendicular though irregular sides which the waves have chiselled out very square  its width varies from ten to twenty feet widest towards the sea and on the shelves up and down the sides some soil has been here and there accumulated on which grow grass and wildflowerssuch as goldenrod now in bloom and raspberrybushes the fruit of which i found ripethe whole making large parts of the sides of the chasm green its verdure overhanging the strip of sea that dashes and foams into the hollow seaweed besides what grows upon and shags the submerged rocks is tossed into the harbor together with stray pieces of wood chips barrelstaves or as today an entire barrel or whatever else the sea happens to have on hand  the water rakes to and fro over the pebbles at the bottom of the chasm drawing back and leaving much of it bare then rushing up with more or less of foam and fury according to the force and direction of the wind though owing to the protection of the adjacent islands it can never have a gale blowing right into its mouth the spring is situated so far down the chasm that at half or twothirds tide it is covered by the sea  twenty minutes after the retiring of the tide suffices to restore to it its wonted freshness  in another chasm very much like the one here described i saw a niche in the rock about tall enough for a person of moderate stature to stand upright  it had a triangular floor and a top and was just the place to hold the rudest statue that ever a savage made  many of the ledges on the island have yellow moss or lichens spread on them in large patches  the moss of those stone walls does really look very old  old bab the ghost has a ring round his neck and is supposed either to have been hung or to have had his throat cut but he steadfastly declines telling the mode of his death  there is a luminous appearance about him as he walks and his face is pale and very dreadful  the fanny arrived this forenoon and sailed again before dinner  she brought as passenger a mr balch brother to the country trader who has been spending a few days here  on her return she has swept the islands of all the nonresidents except myself  the wind being ahead and pretty strong she will have to beat up and the voyage will be anything but agreeable  the spray flew before her bows and doubtless gave the passengers all a thorough wetting within the first halfhour  the view of star island or gosport from the north is picturesquethe village or group of houses being gathered pretty closely together in the centre of the island with some green about them and above all the other edifices wholly displayed stands the little stone church with its tower and belfry  on the right is white island with the lighthouse to the right of that and a little to the northward londoners rock where perhaps of old some london ship was wrecked  to the left of star island and nearer hog or appledore is smutty nose  pour the blue sea about these islets and let the surf whiten and steal up from their points and from the reefs about them which latter whiten for an instant and then are lost in the whelming and eddying depths the northwestwind the while raising thousands of whitecaps and the evening sun shining solemnly over the expanseand it is a stern and lovely scene  the valleys that intersect or partially intersect the island are a remarkable feature  they appear to be of the same formation as the fissures in the rocks but as they extend farther from the sea they accumulate a little soil along the irregular sides and so become green and shagged with bushes though with the rock everywhere thrusting itself through  the old people of the isles say that their fathers could remember when the sea at high tide flowed quite through the valley in which the hotel stands and that boats used to pass  afterwards it was a standing pond then a morass with cattail flags growing in it  it has filled up so far as it is filled by the soil being washed down from the higher ground on each side  the storms meanwhile have tossed up the shingle and pavingstones at each end of the valley so as to form a barrier against the passage of any but such mighty waves as that which thundered through a year or two ago  the old inhabitants lived in the centre or towards the south of the island and avoided the north and east because the latter were so much bleaker in winter  they could moor their boats in the road between smutty nose and hog but could not draw them up  mr laighton found traces of old dwellings in the vicinity of the hotel and it is supposed that the principal part of the population was on this island  i spent the evening at mr thaxters and we drank a glass of his 1820 scheidam the northwestwind was high at ten oclock when i came home the tide full and the murmur of the waves broad and deep   september 14thanother of the brightest of sunny mornings  the wind is not nearly so high as last night but it is apparently still from the northwest and serves to make the sea look very blue and cold  the atmosphere is so transparent that objects seem perfectly distinct along the mainland  today i must be in portsmouth tomorrow at home  a brisk west or northwest wind making the sea so blue gives a very distinct outline in its junction with the sky   september 16thon tuesday the 14th there was no opportunity to get to the mainland  yesterday morning opened with a southeast rain which continued all day  the fanny arrived in the forenoon with some coal for mr laighton and sailed again before dinner taking two of the maids of the house but as it rained pouring and as i could not at any rate have got home tonight there would have been no sense in my going  it began to clear up in the decline of the day the sun shot forth some golden arrows a little before his setting and the sky was perfectly clear when i went to bed after spending the evening at mr thaxters this morning is clear and bright but the wind is northwest making the sea look blue and cold with little breaks of white foam  it is unfavorable for a trip to the mainland but doubtless i shall find an opportunity of getting ashore before night  the highest part of appledore is about eighty feet above the sea  mr laighton has seen whales off the islandboth on the eastern side and between it and the mainland once a great crowd of them as many as fifty  they were drawn in by pursuing their fooda small fish called herringbait which came ashore in such abundance that mr laighton dipped up basketfuls of them  no attempt was made to take the whales  there are vague traditions of trees on these islands  one of them cedar island is said to have been named from the trees that grew on it  the matter appears improbable though mr thaxter says large quantities of soil are annually washed into the sea so that the islands may have been better clad with earth and its productions than now  mrs thaxter tells me that there are several burialplaces on this island but nobody has been buried here since the revolution  her own marriage was the first one since that epoch and her little karl now three months old the firstborn child in all those eighty years  then follow extracts from the church records of gosport  this book of the church records of gosport is a small folio well bound in dark calf and about an inch thick the paper very stout with a watermark of an armed man in a sitting posture holding

expressions of one sort or another are necessary to the life of the affections as leaves are to the life of a tree  if they are wholly restrained love will die at the roots   june 9thcleaning the attic today here at the wayside the woman found an immense snake flat and outrageously fierce thrusting out its tongue  ellen the cook killed it  she called it an adder but it appears to have been a striped snake  it seems a fiend haunting the house  on further inquiry the snake is described as plaided with brown and black  cupid in these latter times has probably laid aside his bow and arrows
