 chapter i  how it began   we can do nothing about it except show our displeasure in some proper manner said portia in her most dignified tone  i should like to cut them all dead for a year to come and im not sure that i wont cried pauline fiercely  we ought to make it impossible for such a thing to happen again and i think we might added priscilla so decidedly that the others looked at her in surprise  the three friends sat by the fire talking things over as girls love to do pretty creatures all of them as they nestled together on the lounge in dressinggowns and slippers with unbound hair eyes still bright with excitement and tongues that still wagged briskly  usually the chat was of dresses compliments and all the little adventures that befall gay girls at a merrymaking but tonight something of uncommon interest absorbed the three and kept them talking earnestly long after they should have been asleep  handsome portia looked out from her blonde locks with a disgusted expression as she sipped the chocolate thoughtful mamma had left inside the fender rosyfaced pauline sat staring indignantly at the fire while in gentle priscillas soft eyes the shadow of a real sorrow seemed to mingle with the light of a strong determination  yes something had happened at this thanksgiving festival which much offended the three friends and demanded grave consideration on their part for the sweet ps as portia pris and polly were called were the belles of the town one ruled by right of beauty and position one by the power of a character so sweet and strong that its influence was widely felt and one by the wit and winsomeness of a high yet generous spirit  it had been an unusually pleasant evening for after the quilting bee in the afternoon good squire allen had given a bountiful supper and all the young folks of the town had joined in the oldfashioned games which made the roof ring with hearty merriment  all would have gone well if some one had not privately introduced something stronger than the cider provided by the squirea mysterious and potent something which caused several of the young men to betray that they were decidedly the worse for their libations  that was serious enough but the crowning iniquity was the putting of brandy into the coffee which it was considered decorous for the young girls to prefer instead of cider  who the reprobates were remained a dead secret for the young men laughed off the dreadful deed as a joke and the squire apologized in the handsomest manner  but the girls felt much aggrieved and would not be appeased though the elders indulgently said young men will be young men even while they shook their heads over the pranks played and the nonsense spoken under the influence of the wine that had been so slyly drank  now what should be done about it the sweet ps knew that their mates would look to them for guidance at this crisis for they were the leaders in all things so they must decide on some line of conduct for all to adopt as the best way of showing their disapproval of such practical jokes  when pris spoke the others looked at her with surprise for there was a new expression in her face and both asked wonderingly how  there are several ways and we must decide which is the best one is to refuse invitations to the sociable next week  but ive just got a lovely new dress expressly for it cried portia tragically  then we might decline providing any supper began pris  that wouldnt prevent the boys from providing it and i never could get through the night without a morsel of something exclaimed polly who loved to see devoted beings bending before her with offerings of ice or struggling manfully to steer a glass of lemonade through a tumultuous sea of silk and broadcloth feeling well repaid by a word or smile from her when they landed safely  true and it would be rather rude and resentful for i am sure they will be models of deportment next time and gentle pris showed signs of relenting though that foolish joke bad cost her more than either of the others  for a moment all sat gazing thoughtfully at the fire trying to devise some awful retribution for the sinners no part of which should fall upon themselves suddenly polly clapped her hands crying with a triumphant air  ive got it girls ive got it  what how tell us quick  we will refuse to go to the first sociable and that will make a tremendous impression for half the nice girls will follow our lead and the boys will be in despair every one will ask why we are not there and what can those poor wretches say but the truth wont that be a bitter pill for my lords and gentlemen  it will certainly be one to us said portia thinking of the heavenly blue dress with a pang  wait a bit our turn will come at the next sociable to this we can go with escorts of our own choosing or none at all for they are free and easy affairs you know so we need be under no obligation to any of those sinners and can trample upon them as much as we please  but how about the games the walks home and all the pleasant little services the young men of our set like to offer and we to receive asked portia who had grown up with these boys as polly called them and found it hard to turn her back on the playmates who had now become friends or lovers  bless me i forgot that the feud might last more than one evening give me an idea pris and pollys triumph ended suddenly  i will answered pris soberly for at this informal sociable we can institute a new order of things it will make a talk but i think we have a right to do it and im sure it will have a good effect if we only hold out and dont mind being laughed at let us refuse to associate with the young men whom we know to be what is called gay and accept as friends those of whose good habits we are sure if they complain as of course they will we can say their own misconduct made it necessary and there we have them  but pris who ever heard of such an idea people will say all sorts of things about us said portia rather startled at the proposition  let them i say its a grand plan and ill stand by you pris through thick and thin cried polly who enjoyed the revolutionary spirit of the thing  we can but try it and give the young men a lesson for girls matters are coming to a pass when it is our duty to do something i cannot think it is right for us to sit silent and see these fine fellows getting into bad habits because no one dares or cares to speak out though we gossip and complain in private  do you want us to begin a crusade asked portia uneasily  yes in the only way we girls can do it we cant preach and pray in streets and barrooms but we may at home and in our own little world show that we want to use our influence for good i know that you two can do any thing you choose with the young people in this town and it is just that set who most need the sort of help you can give if you will  you have more influence than both of us put together so dont be modest pris but tell us what to do and ill do it even if im hooted at cried warmhearted polly won at once  you must do as you think right but i have made up my mind to protest against winedrinking in every way i can i know it will cost me much for i have nothing to depend upon but the good opinion of my friends nevertheless i shall do what seems my duty and i may be able to save some other girl from the heartaches i have known  you wont lose our good opinion you dear little saint just tell us how to begin and we will follow our leader cried both portia and polly fired with emulation by their friends quiet resolution  pris looked from one to the other and seeing real love and confidence in their faces was moved to deepen the impression she had made by telling them the sad secret of her life pressing her hands tightly together and drooping her head she answered in words that were the more pathetic for their brevity  dear girls dont think me rash or sentimental for i know what i am trying to do and you will understand my earnestness better when i tell you that a terrible experience taught me to dread this appetite more than death it killed my father broke mothers heart and left me all alone  as she paused poor pris hid her face and shrank away as if by this confession she had forfeited her place in the respect of her mates but the girlish hearts only clung the closer to her and proved the sincerity of their affection by sympathetic tears and tender words as portia and polly held her fast making a prettier group than the marble nymphs on the mantelpiece for the christian graces quite outdid the heathen ones  polly spoke first and spoke cheerfully feeling with the instinct of a fine nature that priscillas grief was too sacred to be talked about and that they could best show their appreciation of her confidence by proving themselves ready to save others from a sorrow like hers  let us be a little society of three and do what we can i shall begin at home and watch over brother ned for lately he has been growing away from me somehow and im afraid he is beginning to be gay i shall get teased unmercifully but i wont mind if i keep him safe  i have no one at home to watch over but papa and he is in no danger of course so i shall show charley lord that i am not pleased with him said portia little dreaming where her work was to be done  and you will set about reforming that delightful scapegrace phil butler added polly peeping archly into the still drooping face of pris  i have lost my right to do it for i told him tonight that love and respect must go together in my heart and pris wiped her wet eyes with a hand that no longer wore a ring  portia and polly looked at one another in dismay for by this act pris proved how thoroughly in earnest she was  neither had any words of comfort for so great a trouble and sat silently caressing her till pris looked up with her own serene smile again and said as if to change the current of their thoughts  we must have a badge for the members of our new society so let us each wear one of these tiny silver pitchers ive lost the mate to mine but portia has a pair just like them you can divide then we are all provided for  portia ran to her jewelcase caught up a pair of delicate filigree earrings hastily divided a narrow velvet ribbon into three parts attached to each a silver pitcher and as the friends smilingly put on these badges they pledged their loyalty to the new league by a silent goodnight kiss     chapter ii  a declaration of independence   great was the astonishment of their set when it was known that the sweet ps had refused all invitations to the opening sociable  the young men were in despair the gossips talked themselves hoarse discussing the affair and the girls exulted for as polly predicted the effect of their first step was tremendous  when the evening came however by one accord they met in portias room to support each other through that trying period they affected to be quite firm and cheerful but one after the other broke down and sadly confessed that the sacrifice to principle was harder than they expected what added to their anguish was the fact that the judges house stood just opposite the townhall and every attempt to keep away from certain windows proved a dead failure  it is so trying to see those girls go in with their dresses bundled up and not even know what they wear mourned portia watching shrouded figures trip up the steps that led to the paradise from which she had exiled herself  they must be having a capital time for every one seems to have gone i wonder who phil took sighed pris when at length the carriages ceased to roll  girls i wish to be true to my vow but if you dont hold me i shall certainly rush over there and join in the fun for that music is too much for me cried polly desperately as the singing began  it was an endless evening to the three pretty pioneers though they went early to bed and heroically tried to sleep with that distracting music in their ears slumber came at last but as the clocks were striking twelve a little ghost emerged from portias room and gliding to the hall window vanished among the heavy damask curtains  presently another little ghost appeared from the same quarter and stealing softly to the same window was about to vanish in the same capacious draperies when a stifled cry was heard and portia the second sprite exclaimed in an astonished whisper  why pris are you here too i saw polly creep away from me and came to take her back how dare you go wandering about and startling me out of my wits in this way  i was only looking to see if it was all over quavered pris meekly emerging from the righthand curtain  so was i laughed polly bouncing out from the lefthand one  there was a sound of soft merriment in that shadowy hall for a moment and then the spirits took a look at the world outside for the moon was shining brightly yes the fun was evidently over for the lamps were being extinguished and several young men stood on the steps exchanging last words one wore a cloak theatrically thrown over the shoulder and polly knew him at once  thats ned i must hear what they are saying keep quiet and ill listen she whispered rolling herself in the dark folds of the curtain and opening the window a crack so that a frosty breeze could blow freely into her left ear  youll get your death murmured portia shivering in her quilted wrapper  o never mind cried pris who recognized the tallest man in the group and was wild to catch a word from poor phil  they think theyve done a fine thing but bless their little hearts well show that we can do without them by not asking them to the next sociable or taking notice of them if they go that will bring them round without fail said one masculine voice with a jolly laugh  many thanks for letting us know your plots mr lord now we can arrange a nice little surprise for you and portia made a scornful courtesy in the dark  faith i dont blame the girls much for that was a confoundedly ungentlemanly trick of yours and ill thank you not to lay any of the blame of it on me ive got as much as i can carry without that said the tall figure stalking away alone  im so glad to know that phil had nothing to do with it breathed pris gratefully  come on charley i must get home as soon as possible or polly will be down on me for she has taken a new tack lately and holds forth on the error of my ways like a granny  wont i give ned an extra lecture for that speech the rascal and polly shook a small fist at him as her brother passed under the window blissfully unconscious of the avenging angels up aloft  tis well let us away and take sweet counsel how we may annihilate them added polly melodramatically as the three ghosts vanished from the glimpses of the moon  every one turned out to the sociables for they were town affairs and early hours simple suppers and games of all sorts made it possible for old and young to enjoy them together  on the night of the second one there was a goodly gathering for the public rebuke administered to the young men had made a stir and everybody was curious to see what the consequences would be when the parties met  there was a sensation therefore when a whisper went round that the sweet ps had come and a general smile of wonder and amusement appeared when the girls entered portia on the arm of her father polly gallantly escorted by her twelveyearold brother will and pris beside belinda chamberlain whose five feet seven made her a capital cavalier  outwitted laughed charley lord taking the joke at once as he saw portias grayheaded squire  i knew polly was plotting mischief she has been so quiet lately muttered ned eying his little brother with lofty scorn  phil said nothing but he gave a sigh of relief on seeing that pris had chosen an escort of whom it was impossible to be jealous  the judge seldom honored these gatherings but portia ruled papa and when she explained the peculiar state of things he had heroically left his easy chair to cast himself into the breach  master will was in high feather at his sudden promotion and bore himself gallantly though almost as much absorbed by his wristbands as mr toots for polly had got him up regardless of expense with a gay tie new gloves and o crowning splendor a red carnation in his buttonhole  buxom belinda was delighted with the chance to play cavalier and so get her fair share of all the fun going for usually she stood in a corner smiling at an unappreciative world like a patient sunflower  the faces of the young men were a study as the games began and the three girls joined in them with the partners they had chosen  the judge is evidently on his mettle but he cant stand that sort of thing long even to please portia and then her majesty will have to give in or condescend to some one out of our set thought charley lord longing already to be taken into favor again  polly will have to come and ask me to lead if she wants to sing her favorite songs for ill be hanged if i do it till she has humbled herself by asking said ned feeling sure that his sister would soon relent  if it was any one but belinda i dont think i could stand it exclaimed phil as he watched his lost sweetheart with wistful eyes for though he submitted to the sentence which he knew he deserved he could not relinquish so much excellence without deep regret  but the young men underrated the spirit of the girls and overrated their own strength the sweet ps went on enjoying themselves apparently quite indifferent to the neglect of their once devoted friends but to the outcasts it was perfectly maddening to see stately portia promenading with stout major quackenboss who put his best foot foremost with the air of a conquering hero also to behold sweet pris playing games with her little pupils in a way that filled their small souls with rapture but the most aggravating spectacle of all was captivating polly chatting gayly with young farmer brown who was evidently losing both head and heart in the light of her smiles  its no use boys i must have one turn with portia and you may hang me for a traitor immediately afterward cried charley at last recklessly casting both pride and promise to the winds  o very well if you are going to give in we may as well all eat humble pie together and ned imitated his weakminded friend glad of an excuse to claim the leadership of the little choir who led off the weekly sing  phil dared not follow their example as far as pris was concerned but made his most elegant bow to belinda and begged to have the honor of seeing her home his chagrin may be imagined when the lofty wallflower replied with a significant emphasis that made his face burn  no thank you i need a very steady escort for i shouldnt take a fall into a snowbank as lightly as pris did not long ago  charley met with a like fate at portias hands for she outraged established etiquette by coldly declining his meek invitation to promenade and two minutes later graciously accepting that of an unfashionable young man who was known to belong to a temperance lodge  but neds repulse was the most crushing of all for in reply to his condescending hint  i suppose people wont be satisfied unless we give them our favorites hey polly he received a verbal box on the ear in the sharp answer  we dont want you for i intend to lead myself and introduce a new set of songs which wont be at all to your taste  then to his utter amazement and confusion miss polly began to sing one of the good old temperance songs the burden whereof was      o that will be joyful joyful joyful           o that will be joyful     when young men drink no more  it was taken up all over the hall and the chorus rang out with an energy that caused sundry young men to turn red and dodge behind any capacious back they could find for every one understood pollys motive and looked approvingly upon her as she stood singing with an occasional quiver in the voice that usually was as clear and sweet as a blackbirds  this unexpected manoeuvre on the part of the fair enemy produced direful perplexity and dismay in the opposing camp whither the discomfited trio fled with tidings of their defeat none of them dared try again in that quarter but endeavored to console themselves by flirting wildly with such girls as still remained available for sad to relate many of the most eligible took courage and followed the example of the sweet ps this fact cast added gloom over the hapless gentlemen of the offending set and caused them to fear that a social revolution would follow what they had considered merely a girlish freak  shouldnt wonder if they got up a prayingband after this groaned ned preparing himself for the strongest measures  portia had better lead off then for the first time i indulged too freely in the rosy was at her fathers house added charley laying all the blame of his expulsion from eden upon eve like a true adam  look here boys we ought to thank not blame them for they want to help us im sure and some of us need help god knows sighed phil with a look and tone that made his comrades forget their pique in sudden selfreproach for not one of them could deny his words or help feeling that the prayers of such innocent souls would avail much     chapter iii  what portia did   i know your head aches mamma so lie here and rest while i sit in my little chair and amuse you till papa comes in  as portia bent to arrange the sofacushions comfortably the tiny silver pitcher hanging at her neck swung forward and caught her mothers eye  is it the latest fashion to wear odd earrings instead of lockets she asked touching the delicate trinket with an amused smile  no mamma it is something better than a fashion it is the badge of a temperance league that pris polly and i have lately made answered portia wondering how her mother would take it  dear little girls god bless and help you in your good work was the quick reply that both surprised and touched her by its fervency  then you dont mind or think us silly to try and do even a very little towards curing this great evil she asked with a sweet seriousness that was new and most becoming to her  my child i feel as if it was a special providence began her mother then checked herself and added more quietly tell me all about this league dear unless it is a secret  i have no secrets from you mother and nestling into her low chair portia told her story ending with an earnestness that showed how much she had the new plan at heart  so you see polly is trying to keep ned safe and pris prays for phil not in vain i think for he has been very good lately they tell me but i have neither brother nor lover to help and i cannot go out to find any one because i am only a girl now what can i do mamma for i truly want to do my share  the mother lay silent for a moment then as if yielding to an irresistible impulse drew her daughter nearer and whispered with lips that trembled as they spoke  you can help your father dear  mamma what can you mean cried portia in a tone of indignant surprise  listen patiently child or i shall regret that your confidence inspired me with courage to give you mine never think for one moment that i accuse my husband of any thing like drunkenness he has always taken his wine like a gentleman and never more than was good for him till of late for this there are many excuses he is growing old his life is less active than it was many of the pleasures he once enjoyed fail now and he has fallen into ways that harm his health  i know mamma he doesnt care for company as he used to or business either but seems quite contented to sit among his papers half the morning and doze over the fire half the evening ive wondered at it for he is not really old and looks as hale and handsome as ever said portia feeling that something hovered on her mothers lips which she found it hard to utter  you are right it is not age alone that makes him so unlike his once cheerful active self it isbend lower dear and never breathe to any one what i tell you now only that you may help me save your fathers life perhaps  startled by the almost solemn earnestness of these words portia laid her head upon the pillow and twilight wrapt the room in its soft gloom as if to shut out all the world while the mother told the daughter the danger that threatened him whom they both so loved and honored  papa has fallen into the way of taking more wine after dinner than is good for him he does not know how the habit is growing upon him and is hurt if i hint at such a thing but dr hall warned me of the danger after papas last ill turn saying that at his age and with his temperament apoplexy would be sure to follow overindulgence of this sort  o mamma what can i do whispered portia with a thrill as the words of pris returned to her with sudden force it killed my father broke mothers heart and left me all alone  watch over him dear amuse him as you only can and wean him from this unsuspected harm by all the innocent arts your daughterly love can devise i have kept this to myself because it is hard for a wife to see any fault in her husband still harder for her to speak of it even to so good a child as mine but my anxiety unfits me to do all i might so i need help and of whom can i ask it but of you my darling make a little league with mother and let us watch and pray in secret for this dear man who is all in all to us  what portia answered what comfort she gave and what further confidences she received may not be told for this household covenant was too sacred for report no visible badge was assumed no audible vow taken but in the wifes face as it smiled on her husband that night there was a tenderer light than ever and the kiss that welcomed papa was the seal upon a purpose as strong as the daughters love  usually the ladies left the judge to read his paper and take his wine in the oldfashioned way while they had coffee in the drawingroom as they rose portia saw the shadow fall upon her mothers face which she had often seen before but never understood till now for this was the dangerous hour this the moment when the child must stand between temptation and her father if she could  that evening very soon after the servant had cleared the table of all but the decanters a fresh young voice singing blithely in the parlor made the judge put down his glass to listen in pleased surprise  presently he stepped across the hall to set both doors open saying in a half reproachful tone  sing away my lark and let papa hear you for he seldom gets a chance nowadays  then he must stay and applaud me else i shall think that speech only an empty compliment answered portia as she beckoned with her most winsome smile  the judge never dreamed that his good angel spoke but he saw his handsome girl beaming at him from the music stool and strolled in meaning to go back when the song ended  but the blue charmer in the parlor proved more potent than the red one in the diningroom and he sat on placidly sipping the excellent coffee artfully supplied by his wife quite unconscious of the little plot to rob him of the harmful indulgence which too often made his evenings a blank and his mornings a vain attempt to revive the spirits that once kept increasing years from seeming burdensome  that was the beginning of portias home mission and from that hour she devoted herself to it thinking of no reward for such secret service could receive neither public sympathy nor praise  it was not an easy task as she soon found in spite of the stanch and skilful ally who planned the attacks she dutifully made upon the enemy threatening their domestic peace  when music ceased to have charms and the judge declared he must get his forty winks after dinner portia boldly declared that she would stay and see that he had them comfortably so papa laughed and submitted took a brief nap and woke in such goodhumor that he made no complaint on finding the daughter replacing the decanter  this answered for a while and when its effacacy seemed about to fail unexpected help appeared for mammas eyes began to trouble her and portia proposed that her father should entertain the invalid in the evening while she served her through the day  this plan worked capitally for the judge loved his good wife almost as much as she deserved and devoted himself to her so faithfully that the effort proved a better stimulant than any his wellstocked cellar could supply  dr hall prescribed exercise and cheerful society for his new patient and in seeing that these instructions were obeyed the judge got the benefit of them and found no time for solitary winebibbing  i do believe im growing young again for the old dulness is quite gone and all this work and play does not seem to tire me a bit he said after an unusually lively evening with the congenial guests portia took care to bring about him  but it must be very stupid for you my dear as we old folks have all the fun why dont you invite the young people here oftener he added as his eye fell on portia gazing thoughtfully into the fire  i wish i dared tell you why she answered wistfully  afraid of your old papa and he looked both surprised and grieved  i wont be for you are the kindest father that ever a girl had and i know youll help me as you always do papa i dont dare ask my young friends here because im not willing to expose some of them to temptation began portia bravely  what temptation this asked her father turning her halfaverted face to the light with a smile full of paternal pride  no sir a far more dangerous one than ever i can be  then i should like to see it and the old gentleman looked about him for this rival of his lovely daughter  it is these she said pointing to the bottles and glasses on the sideboard  the judge understood her then and knit his brows but before he could reply portia went steadily on though her cheeks burned and her eyes were bent upon the fire again  father i belong to a society of three and we have promised to do all we can for temperance as yet i can only show bravely the faith that is in me therefore i can never offer any friend of mine a drop of wine and so i do not ask them here where it would seem most uncourteous to refuse  i trust no gentleman ever had cause to reproach me for the hospitality i was taught to show my guests began the judge in his most stately manner  but he got no further for a soft hand touched his lips and portia answered sorrowfully  one man has sir charley lord says the first time he took too much was in this house and it has grieved me to the heart for it is true o papa never let any one have the right to say that again of us forgive me if i seem undutiful but i must speak out for i want my dear father to stand on my side and set an example which will make me even fonder and prouder of him than i am now  as portia paused half frightened at her own frankness she put her arms about his neck and hid her face on his breast still pleading her cause with the silent eloquence so hard to resist  the judge made no reply for several minutes and in that pause many thoughts passed through his mind and a vague suspicion that had haunted him of late became a firm conviction for suddenly he seemed to see his own weakness in its true light to understand the meaning of the watchful love the patient care that had so silently and helpfully surrounded him and in portias appeal for younger men he read a tender warning to himself  he was a proud man but a very just one and though a flush of anger swept across his face at first he acknowledged the truth of the words that were so hard to speak  with his hand laid fondly on the head that was halfhidden lest a look should seem to reproach him this brave old gentleman proved that he loved his neighbor better than himself and honestly confessed his own shortcomings  no man shall ever say again that i tempted him  then as portia lifted up a happy face he looked straight into the grateful eyes that dimmed with sudden tears and added tenderly  my daughter i am not too proud to own a fault nor please god too old to mend it     chapter iv  what polly did   since their mothers death polly had tried to fill her place and take good care of the boys but the poor little damsel had a hard time of it sometimes for ned being a year or two older thought it his duty to emancipate himself from petticoat government as rapidly as possible and do as he pleased regardless of her warnings or advice  yet at heart he was very fond of his pretty sister at times he felt strongly tempted to confide his troubles and perplexities to her for since the loss of his mother he often longed for a tender helpful creature to cheer and strengthen him  unfortunately he had reached the age when boys consider it the thing to repress every sign of regard for their own womenfolk sisters especially so ned barricaded himself behind the manly superiority of his twenty years and snubbed polly  will had not yet developed this unpleasant trait but his sister expected it and often exclaimed despairingly to her bosom friends  when he follows neds example and begins to rampage what will become of me  the fathera learned and busy manwas so occupied by the duties of his large parish or so absorbed in the abstruse studies to which his brief leisure was devoted that he had no time left for his children polly took good care of him and the house and the boys seemed to be doing well so he went his way in peace quite unconscious that his eldest son needed all a fathers care to keep him from the temptations to which a social nature not evil propensities exposed him  polly saw the danger and spoke of it but mr snow only answered absently  tut tut my dear you are overanxious and forget that young men all have a few wild oats to sow  while ned silenced her with that other familiar and harmful phrase im only seeing life a bit so dont you fret child little dreaming that such seeing life too often ends in seeing death  so polly labored in vain till something happened which taught them all a lesson ned went on a sleighing frolic with the comrades whom of all others his sister dreaded most  do be careful and not come home as you did last time for father will be in and it would shock him dreadfully if i shouldnt be able to keep you quiet she said anxiously  you little granny i wasnt tipsy only cheerful and that scared you out of your wits ive got my key so dont sit up i hate to have a woman glowering at me when i come in was neds ungracious reply for the memory of that occasion was not a pleasant one  if a woman had not been sitting up youd have frozen on the doormat you ungrateful boy cried polly angrily  ned began to whistle and was going off without a word when pollys loving heart got the better of her quick temper and catching up a splendid tippet she had made for him she ran after her brother she caught him just as he opened the front door and throwing both her arms and her gift about his neck said with a kiss that produced a sensation in the sleighfull of gentlemen at the gate  ah do be friends for i cant bear to part so  now if no one had been by ned would have found that pleasant mingling of soft arms and worsted a genuine comforter but masculine pride would not permit him to relent before witnesses and the fear of being laughed at by those fellows made him put both sister and gift roughly aside with a stern  i wont be mollycoddled let me alone and shut the door  polly did let him alone with a look that haunted him and shut the door with a spirited bang that much amused the gentlemen  ill never try to do any thing for ned again its no use and he may go to the bad for all i care said polly to herself after a good cry  but she bitterly repented that speech a few hours later when her brother was brought back apparently dead by such of the cheerful party as escaped unhurt from a dangerous upset  there was no concealing this sad homecoming from her father though poor ned was quiet enough now being stunned by the fall which had wounded his head and broken his right arm  it was a shock both to the man and the minister and when the worst was over he left polly to watch her brother with eyes full of penitential tears and went away to reproach himself in private for devoting to ancient fathers the time and thought he should have given to modern sons  ned was very ill and when at last he began to mend his helplessness taught him to see and love the sweetest side of pollys character for she was in truth his right hand and waited on him with a zeal that touched his heart  not one reproach did she utter not even by a look did she recall past warnings or exult in the present humiliation which proved how needful they had been every thing was forgotten except the fact that she had the happy privilege of caring for him almost as tenderly as a mother  not quite though and the memory of her whose place it was impossible to fill seemed to draw them closer together as if the silent voice repeated its last injunctions to both son and daughter take care of the boys dear be good to your sister ned  ive been a regular brute to her and the dear little soul is heaping coals of fire on my head by slaving over me like an angel thought the remorseful invalid one day as he lay on the sofa with a black patch adorning his brow and his arm neatly done up in splints  polly thought he was asleep and sat quietly rolling bandages till a head popped in at the door and will asked in a sepulchral whisper  ive got the book ned wanted can i come and give it to you  polly nodded and he tiptoed in to her side with a face so full of goodwill and spirits that it was as refreshing as a breath of fresh air in that sick room  nice boy he never forgets to do a kindness and be a comfort to his polly she said leaning her tired head on his buttony jacket as he stood beside her  will wasnt ashamed to show affection for his polly so he patted the pale cheeks with a hand as red as his mittens and smiled down at her with his honest blue eyes full of the protecting affection it was so pleasant to receive  yes im going to be a tiptop boy and never make you and father ashamed of me as you were once of somebody we know now dont you laugh and ill show you something its the best i could do and i wanted to prove that i mean what i say truly truly wish i may die if i dont  as he spoke will pulled out of his vestpocket a little pewter creampot tied to a shoestring and holding it up said with a funny mixture of boyish dignity and defiance  i bought it of nelly hunt because her teaset was halfsmashed up folks may laugh at my badge but i dont care and if you wont have me in your society ill set up all alone for im going into the temperance business any way  polly hugged him on the spot and made his youthful countenance glow with honest pride by saying solemnly  william g snow i consider our league honored by the addition of so valuable a member for a boy who can bear to be laughed at and yet stick to his principles is a treasure  the fellows do laugh at me and call me little pitcher but id rather be that than champagne charlie as ned called mr lord said will stoutly  bless the little pitchers cried polly enthusiastically surveying both the pewter pot and its wearer  a great tear was lying on her cheek checked in its fall by the dimple that came as she looked at her brothers droll badge will caught it dexterously in the tiny cup saying with a stifled laugh  now youve baptized it polly and its as good as silver for your tear shines in there like a great big diamond wonder how many it would take to fill it  youll never make me cry enough to find out now go and get my little silver chain for that dear pewter pot deserves a better one than an old shoestring said polly looking after him with a happy face as the small youth gave one ecstatic skip and was off  im afraid weve waked you up she added as ned stirred  i was only daydreaming but i mean this one shall come true and ned rose straight up with an energy that surprised his sister  come and have your lunch for its time which will you take mrs neals winejelly or my custard asked polly settling him in his big chair  to her astonishment ned pitched the little mould of amber jelly into the fire and tried to eat the custard with his left hand  my dear boy have you lost your senses she ejaculated  no ive just found them he answered with a flash of the eye that seemed to enlighten polly without more words  taking her usual seat on the arm of the chair she fed her big nursling in silence till a sigh made her ask tenderly  isnt it right i put in lots of sugar because you like it sweet  all the sugar in the world wont sweeten it to me polly for theres a bitter drop at the bottom of all my cups will said your tear shone like a diamond in his little pitcher and well it might but you cant cry happy tears over me though ive made you shed enough sad ones to fill the big punchbowl  ned tried to laugh but somehow the custard choked him and polly laid the poor cropped head on her shoulder for a minute saying softly  never mind dear i wouldnt think about the old troubles now  she got no farther for with a lefthanded thump that made all the cups dance wildly on the table ned cried out  but i will think about the old troubles for i dont intend to have any new ones of that sort do you suppose ill see that snip of a boy standing up for what is right and not have the pluck to do the same do you suppose ill make my own father ashamed of me more than once or let the dearest little girl in the world wear herself out over me and i not try to thank her in the way she likes best polly my dear you cant be as proud of your elder brother as you are of the younger but you shall never have cause to blush for him again never sir never  ned lifted his hand for another emphatic thump but changed his mind and embraced his sister as closely as one arm could do it  i ought to have a badge if im going to belong to your select society but i dont know any lady who will give me an earring or a creampot said ned when the conversation got round again to the cheerful side of the question  ill give you something better than either answered polly as she transferred a plain locket from her watchguard to the one lying on the table  ned knew that a beloved face and a lock of gray hair were inside and when his sister added with a look full of sweet significance for her sake dear he answered manfully  ill try polly     chapter v  what pris did   priscilla meantime was racking her brain to discover how she could help philip for since she had broken off her engagement no one spoke of him to her and she could only judge of how things were going with him by what she saw and heard as she went about her daily task  pris kept school and the road which she must take twice a day led directly by the office where phil was studying medicine with old dr buffum formerly she always smiled and nodded as she passed or stopped to chat a moment with the student who usually chanced to be taking a whiff of fresh air at that instant little notes flew in and out and often her homeward walk was cheered by a companion who taught the pretty teacher lessons she found it very easy to learn  a happy time but it was all over now and brief glimpses of a brown head bent above a desk near that window was the only solace poor pris had the head never turned as she went by but she felt sure that phil knew her step and found that moment as she did the hardest of the day  she longed to relent but dared not yet he longed to show that he repented but found it difficult without a sign of encouragement so they went their separate ways seldom meeting for phil stuck to his books with dogged resolution and pris had no heart for society  of course the affair was discussed with all the exasperating freedom of a country town some blaming pris for undue severity some praising her spirit and some friendsnot gossipspredicting that both would be the better for the trial which would not separate them long of this latter class were portia and polly who felt it their duty to lend a hand when matters reached a certain point  pris dear may i tell you something that i think youd be glad to know began polly joining her friend one afternoon as she went home weary and alone  you may tell me any thing and pris took her arm as if she felt the need of sympathy  you know dr buffum let phil help with ned so we have seen a good deal of him and that is how i found out what ive got to tell you  he spoke of me then whispered pris eagerly  not a word till ned made him my boy is fond of your boy and they had confidences which seem to have done them both good of course ned didnt tell me all about it as we tell things men never do they are so proud and queer but he said this  look here polly you must be very kind to phil and stand by him all you can or he will go down he is doing his best and will hold on as long as he can but a fellow must have comfort and encouragement of some sort and if he dont get the right kind hell try the wrong  o polly you will stand by him  i have for i just took phil in a weakish moment and found out all i wanted to know ned is right and you are wrong prisnot in giving back the ring but in seeming to cast him off entirely he does not deserve that for he was not to blame half so much as you think but he wont excuse himself for he feels that you are unjust yet he loves you dearly and you could do any thing with him if you chose  i do choose polly but how can i marry a man whom i cannot trust began pris sadly  now my child im going to talk to you like a mother for ive had experience with boys and i know how to manage them interrupted polly with such a charmingly maternal air that pris laughed in spite of her trouble be quiet and listen to the words of wisdom continued her friend seriously  since ive taken care of ned ive learned a great deal for the poor lad was so sick and sorry he couldnt shut his heart against me any more so now i understand how to help and comfort him for hearts are very much alike pris and all need lots of love and patience to keep them good and happy ned told me his troubles and i made up my mind that as we dont have so many temptations as boys we should do all we can to help them and make them the sort of men we can both love and trust  you are right polly ive often thought how wrong it is for us to sit safe and silent while we know things are going wrong just because it isnt considered proper for us to speak out then when the harm is done we are expected to turn virtuously away from the poor soul we might perhaps have saved if we had dared god does not do so to us and we ought not to do so to those over whom we have so much power said pris with a heart full of sad and tender memories  we wont cried polly firmly we began in play but we will go on in earnest and use our youth our beauty our influence for something nobler than merely pleasing mens eyes or playing with their hearts well help them to be good and brave and true and in doing this we shall become better women and worthier to be loved i know  why polly you are quite inspired and pris stopped in the snowy road to look at her  it isnt all my wisdom ive talked with father as well as ned and phil and they have done me good ive discovered that confidence is better than compliments and friendship much nicer than flirting so im going to turn over a new leaf and use my good gifts for higher ends  dear thing what a comfort you are said pris pressing pollys hands and looking into her bright face with grateful eyes you have given me courage to do my duty and ill follow your example as fast as i can dont come any farther please id better be alone when i pass phils window for im going to nod and smile as i used to in the happy time then he will see that i dont cast him off and leave him to go down for want of help but am still his friend until i dare be more  now pris thats just lovely of you and i know it will work wonders smile and nod away dear and try to do your part as im trying to do mine  for an instant the little gray hat and the jaunty one with the scarlet feather were bent close together but what went on under the brims who can say then polly trotted off as fast as she could go and pris turned into a certain street with a quicker step and a brighter color than she had known for weeks  she was late for she had lingered with polly and she feared that patient watcher at the window would be gone no the brown head was there but it lay wearily on the arms folded over a big book and the eyes that stared out at the wintry sky had something tragic in them  poor phil did need encouragement and was in the mood to take the worst sort if the best failed him for life looked very dark just then and solitude was growing unbearable  suddenly between him and the ruddy sunset a face appearedthe dearest and the loveliest in the world to him not half averted now nor set straightforward cold and quiet as a marble countenance but bent towards him with a smile on the lips and a wistful look in the tender eyes that made his heart leap up with sudden hope then it vanished and when he sprung to the window nothing could be seen but the last wave of a wellknown cloak fluttering round the corner  but priscillas first effort was a great success for the magic of a kind look glorified the dingy office and every bottle on the shelves might have been filled with the elixir of life so radiant did phils face become the almost uncontrollable desire to rush away and recklessly forget his loneliness in the first companionship that offered was gone now for a happy hope peopled his solitude with helpful thoughts and resolutions the tragic look left the eyes that still saw a good angel instead of a tempting demon between them and the evening sky and when phil shut up the big book he had been vainly trying to study he felt that he had discovered a new cure for one of the sharpest pains the heart can suffer  next morning pris unconsciously started for school too soon so when she passed that window the room was empty resolved that phil should not share her disappointment she lifted the sash and dropped a white azalea on his desk she smiled as she did it and then whisked away as if she had taken instead of left a treasure but the smile remained with the flower i think and phil found it there when he hurried in to discover this sweet goodmorning waiting for him  he put it in the wineglass which he had sworn never should be filled again with any thing but water and sitting down before it listened to the little sermon the flower preached for the delicate white azalea was pris to him and the eloquence of a pure and tender heart flowed from it working miracles one of them was that when sunset came it shone on two faces at the window and the little snowbirds heard two voices breaking a long silence  god bless you pris  god help you phil  that was all but from that hour the girl felt her power for good and used it faithfully and from that hour the young man worked bravely to earn the respect and confidence without which no love is safe and happy  we are friends now they said when they were seen together again and friends they remained in spite of shrugs and smiles illnatured speeches and more than one attempt to sow discord between them for people did not understand the new order of things  i trust him was the only answer pris gave to all warnings and criticisms  i will be worthy of her the vow that kept phil steady in spite of the ridicule that is so hard to bear and gave him courage to flee from the temptation he was not yet strong enough to meet face to face  portia and polly stood by them stanchly for having made her fathers house a safe refuge portia offered phil all the helpful influences of a happy home polly with ned to lend a hand gave his comrade many a friendly lift and when it was understood that the judge the minister and the sweet ps indorsed the young m d no one dared cast a stone at him  all this took time of course but phil got his reward at last for one night a little thing happened which showed him his own progress and made pris feel that she might venture to wear the ring again  at a party phil was graciously invited to take wine with a lady and refused it was a very hard thing to do for the lady was his hostess a handsome woman and the mother of a flock of little children who all preferred the young doctor to the old one and greatest trial of all several of his most dreaded comrades stood by to laugh at him if he dared to let principle outweigh courtesy  but he did it though he grew pale with the effort to say steadily  will mrs ward pardon me if i decline the honor i am  there he stopped and turned scarlet for a lie was on his lipsa lie so much easier to tell than the honest truth that many would have forgiven its utterance at that minute  his hostess naturally thought ill health was his excuse and pitying his embarrassment said smiling  ah you doctors dont prescribe wine for your own ailments as readily as for those of your patients  but phil angry at his own weakness spoke out frankly with a look that said more than his words  i cannot even accept the kind excuse you offer me for i am not ill it may be my duty to order wine sometimes for my patients but it is also my duty to prescribe water for myself  a dreadful little pause followed that speech but mrs ward understood now and though she thought the scruple a foolish one she accepted the apology like a wellbred woman and with a silent bow that ended the matter turned to other guests leaving poor phil to his fate  not a pleasant one but he bore it as well as he could and when his mates left him stranded in a corner he said half aloud with a long breath as if the battle had been a hard one  yes i suppose i have lost my best patient but ive kept my own respect and that ought to satisfy me  let me add mine and wish you health and happiness dear phil said a voice behind him and turning quickly he saw pris standing there with two goblets of water and a smile full of love and pride  you know what that toast means for me he whispered with sudden sunshine in his face as he took the offered glass  yes and i drink it with all my heart she answered with her hand in his     chapter vi  how it ended   the leaven dropped by three girls in that little town worked so slowly that they hardly expected to do more than raise their own pattycakes as polly merrily expressed it but no honest purpose is ever wasted and byandby the fermentation began  several things helped it amazingly the first of these was a temperance sermon preached by parson snow which produced a deep impression because in doing this he had the courage like brutus to condemn his own son the brave sincerity the tender earnestness of that sermon touched the hearts of his people as no learned discourse had ever done and bore fruit that well repaid him for the effort it cost  it waked up the old people set the young ones to thinking and showed them all that they had a work to do for those who were down felt that they might be lifted up again those who were trifling ignorantly or recklessly with temptation saw their danger and those who had longed to speak out now dared to do it because he led the way  so warned by the wolf in his own fold this shepherd of souls tried to keep his flock from harm and in doing it found that his christianity was the stronger wiser and purer for his humanity  another thing was the fact that the judge was the first to follow his pastors example and prove by deeds that he indorsed his words it was hard for the hospitable old gentleman to banish wine from his table and forego the pleasant customs which long usage and many associations endeared to him but he made his sacrifice handsomely and his daughter helped him  she kept the sideboard from looking bare by filling the silver tankards with flowers offered water to his guests with a grace that made a cordial of it and showed such love and honor for her father that he was a very proud and happy man  what the judge did was considered all right by his neighbors for he was not only the bestborn but the richest man in town and with a certain class these facts had great weight portia knew this and counted on it when she said she wanted him on her side so she exulted when others followed the new fashion some from principle but many simply because he set it  at first the young reformers were disappointed that every one was not as enthusiastic as themselves and as ready to dare and do for the cause they had espoused but wiser heads than those on their pretty shoulders curbed their impetuosity and suggested various ways of gently insinuating the new idea and making it so attractive that others would find it impossible to resist for sunshine often wins when bluster makes us wrap our prejudices closer around us like the traveller in the fable  portia baited her trap with roman partiesfor she had been abroadand made them so delightful that no one complained when only cake and tea was served that being the style in the eternal city but went and did likewise  artful polly set up a comic newspaper to amuse ned who was an invalid nearly all winter and in it freed her mind on many subjects in such a witty way that the pollyanthus as her brother named it circulated through their set merrily sowing good seed for young folks will remember a joke longer than a sermon and this editor made all hers tell  pris was not behindhand in her efforts but worked in a different way and got up a branch society among her little pupils called the water babies that captivated the mothers at once and even the fathers found it difficult to enjoy their wine with blue eyes watching them wistfully over the rims of silver mugs while the few topers of the town hid themselves like nightbirds flying from the sun when led by their gentle general that little army of innocents marched through the streets with banners flying blithe voices singing rosy faces shining and childish hearts full of the sweet delusion that they could save the world  of course the matrons discussed these events at the sewingcircle and much talk went on of a more useful sort than the usual gossip about servants sickness dress and scandal  mrs judge waxed eloquent upon the subject and being president every one listened with due respect mrs ward seconded all her motions for this lady had much surprised the town not only by installing phil as family physician but by coming out strong for temperance somebody had told her all about the girls labor of love and she had felt ashamed to be outdone by them so like a conscientious woman she decided to throw her influence into the right scale take time by the forelock and help to make the town a safer place for her five sons to grow up in than it was then  these two leading ladies kept the ball rolling so briskly that others were soon converted and fell into rank till a dozen or so were heartily in earnest and then the job was half done for in a great measure women make society what they choose to have it  we are told that home is our sphere and advised to keep in it so let us see that it is what it should be and then we shall have proved our fitness for larger fields of labor if we care to claim them said mrs judge cutting out red flannel with charitable energy on one occasion  most of us will find that quite as much as we can accomplish i fancy answered mrs ward thinking of her own riotous lads who were probably pulling the house about their ears while she made hoods for mrs flanagans bareheaded lasses  pears to me we haint no call to interfere in other folkss affairs this never was a drinkin town and things is kep in fustrate order so i dont see the use of sech a talk about temperance remarked miss simmons an acid spinster whose principal earthly wealth consisted of a choice collection of cats  if your tabbies took to drinking you would see the use im sure laughed polly from the corner which was a perfect posybed of girls  thank goodness ive no men folks to pester myself about began miss simmons with asperity  ah but you should for if you refuse to make them happy you ought at least to see that they console themselves in ways which can work them no further woe continued polly gravely though her black eyes danced with fun  well that wouldnt be no more than fair im free to confess but sakes alive i couldnt attend to em all said miss simmons bridling with a simper that nearly upset the whole bevy of girls  do make the effort and help us poor things who havent had your experience added pris in her most persuasive voice  i declare i will ill have hiram stebbins in to tea and when hes as goodnatured as muffins and pie can make him ill set to and see if i cant talk him out of his attachment to that brandy bottle cried miss simmons with a sudden yearning towards the early sweetheart who had won but never claimed her virgin affections  i think youll do it and if so you will have accomplished what no one else could and you shall have any prize you choose cried portia smiling so hopefully that the faded old face grew almost young again as miss simmons went home with something better to do than tend her tabbies  weve bagged that bird said polly with real satisfaction  thats the way we set people to work added portia smiling  she will do what we cant for her heart is in it said pris softly and it was pleasant to see the blooming girls rejoice that poor old hiram was in a fair way to be saved  so the year went round and thanksgiving came again with the home jollity that makes a festival throughout the land the day would not be perfect if it did not finish with a frolic of some sort and for reasons of their own the young gentlemen decided to have the first sociable of the year an unusually pleasant one  everybody is going and ned says the supper is to be waterice and icewater said polly taking a last look at herself in the long mirror when the three friends were ready on that happy evening  i neednt sigh now over other girls pretty dresses as i did last year and portia plumed herself like a swan as she settled charleys roses in her bosom  and i neednt wonder who phil will take added pris stopping with her glove half on to look at the little ring back again from its long banishment in somebodys waistcoat pocket  never had the hall looked so elegant and gay for it was charmingly decorated couches were provided for the elders mirrors for the beauties and music of the best sounded from behind a thicket of shrubs and flowers every one seemed in unusually good spirits the girls looked their loveliest and the young men were models of propriety though a close observer might have detected a suspicious twinkle in the eyes of the most audacious as if they plotted some new joke  the girls saw it were on the watch and thought the secret was out when they discovered that the gentlemen of their set all wore tiny pitchers hanging like orders from the knots of sweetpeas in their buttonholes but bless their innocent hearts that was only a ruse and they were taken entirely by surprise when just before supper the band struck up       drink to me only with thine eyes  and every one looked smilingly at the three girls who were standing together near the middle of the hall  they looked about them in pretty confusion but in a moment beheld a spectacle that made them forget themselves for the judge in an impressive white waistcoat marched into the circle gathered about them made a splendid bow and said with a smile that put the gas to shame  young ladies i am desired by the gentlemen now present to beg your acceptance of a slight token of their gratitude respect and penitence as the first man who joined the society which has proved a blessing to our town mr william snow will now have the honor of presenting the gift  then appeared mr william snow looking as proud as a peacock and well he might for on the salver which he bore stood a stately silver pitcher a graceful little hebe danced upon the handle three names shone along the fretted brim and three white lilies rose from the slender vasefit emblems of the maiden founders of the league  arriving before them master will nearly upset the equilibrium of his precious burden in attempting to make a bow equal to the judges but recovered himself gallantly and delivered the following remarkable poem which the public was expected to believe an emanation of his own genius      hebe poured the nectar forth         when gods of old were jolly     but graces three our goblets fill         fair portia pris and polly     their draughts make every man who tastes         happier better richer     so here we vow ourselves henceforth         knights of the silver pitcher     annas whim   now just look at that cried a young lady pausing suddenly in her restless march to and fro on one of the wide piazzas of a seaside hotel  at what asked her companion lazily swinging in a hammock  the difference in those two greetings its perfectly disgraceful was the petulant reply  i didnt see any thing do tell me about it said clara opening her drowsy eyes with sudden interest  why young barlow was lounging up the walk and met pretty miss ellery off went his hat he gave her a fine bow a gracious smile a wornout compliment and then dawdled on again the next minute joe king came along instantly barlow woke up laughed out like a pleased boy gave him a hearty grip of the hand a cordial how are you old fellow im no end glad to see you and linking arms the two tramped off quite beaming with satisfaction  but child king is barlows best friend kitty ellery only an acquaintance besides it wouldnt do to greet a woman like a man  yes it would especially in this case for barlow adores kate and might at least treat her to something better than the nonsense he gives other girls but no its proper to simper and compliment and hell do it till his love gets the better of prunes and prisms and makes him sincere and earnest  this is a new whim of yours you surely wouldnt like to have any man call out how are you anna slap you on the shoulder and nearly shake your hand off as barlow did kings just now said clara laughing at her friend  yes i would answered anna perversely if he really meant it to express affection or pleasure a good grip of the hand and a plain hearty word would please me infinitely better than all the servile bowing down and sweet nonsense ive had lately im not a fool then why am i treated like one she continued knitting her handsome brows and pacing to and fro like an angry leopardess why dont men treat me like a reasonable beingtalk sense to me give me their best ideas tell me their plans and ambitions let me enjoy the real man in them and know what they honestly are i dont want to be a goddess stuck up on a pedestal i want to be a woman down among them to help and be helped by our acquaintance  it wouldnt do i fancy they wouldnt like it and would tell you to keep to your own sex  but my own sex dont interest or help me one bit women have no hope but to be married and that is soon told no ideas but dress and show and im tired to death of both no ambition but to outshine their neighbors and i despise that  thank you love blandly murmured clara  it is true and you know it there are sensible women but not in my set and i dont seem to find them ive tried the life set down for girls like me and for three years ive lived and enjoyed it now im tired of it i want something better and i mean to have it men will follow admire flatter and love me for i please them and they enjoy my society very well then its fair that i should enjoy theirs and i should if they would let me its perfectly maddening to have flocks of brave bright fellows round me full of every thing that is attractive strong and helpful yet not be able to get at it because society ordains twaddle between us instead of sensible conversation and sincere manners  what shall we do about it love asked clara enjoying her friends tirade  you will submit to it and get a mental dyspepsia like all the other fashionable girls i wont submit if i can help it even if i shock mrs grundy by my efforts to get plain bread and beef instead of confectionery  anna walked in silence for a moment and then burst out again more energetically than ever  oh i do wish i could find one sensible man who would treat me as he treats his male friendseven roughly if he is honest and true who would think me worthy of his confidence ask my advice let me give him whatever i have that is wise and excellent and be my friend in all good faith  ahem said clara with a significant laugh that angered anna  you need not try to abash me with your jeers i know what i mean and i stand by my guns in spite of your hems i do not want lovers ive had dozens and am tired of them i will not marry till i know the man thoroughly and how can i know him with this veil between us they dont guess what i really am and i want to prove to them and to myself that i possess brains and a heart as well as heavenly eyes a queenly figure and a mouth made for kissing  the scorn with which anna uttered the last words amused her friend immensely for the petulant beauty had never looked handsomer than at that moment  if any man saw you now hed promise whatever you ask no matter how absurd but dont excite yourself dear child it is too warm for heroics  anna leaned on the wide baluster a moment looking thoughtfully out upon the sea and as she gazed a new expression stole over her charming face changing its disdainful warmth to soft regret  this is not all a whim i know what i covet because i had it once she said with a sigh i had a boy friend when i was a girl and for several years we were like brother and sister ah what happy times we had together frank and i we played and studied quarrelled and made up dreamed splendid dreams and loved one another in our simple child fashion never thinking of sex rivalry or any of the forms and follies that spoil maturer friendships  what became of him did he die angelically in his early bloom or outgrow his platonics with round jackets asked clara  he went to college i went abroad to be finished off and when we met a year ago the old charm was all gone for we were in society and had our masks on  so the boy and girl friendship did not ripen into love and end the romance properly  no thank heaven no flirtation spoilt the pretty story frank was too wise and i too busy yet i remember how glad i was to see him though i hid it properly and pretended to be quite unconscious that i was any thing but a belle i got paid for my deceit though for in spite of his admiration i saw he was disappointed in me i should not have cared if i had been disappointed in him but i was quick to see that he was growing one of the strong superior men who command respect i wanted to keep his regard at least and i seemed to have nothing but beauty to give in return i think i never was so hurt in my life as i was by his not coming to see me after a week or two and hearing him say to a friend one night when i thought i was at my very best she is spoilt like all the rest  i do believe you loved him and that is why you wont love any one else cried clara who had seen her friend in her moods before but never understood them and thought she had found a clew now  no said anna with a quiet shake of the head no i only wanted my boy friend back and could not find him the fence between us was too high and i could not climb over as i used to do when i leaped the gardenwall to sit in a tree and help frank with his lessons  has the uncivil wretch never come back asked clara interested in the affair  never he is too busy shaping his life bravely and successfully to waste his time on a frivolous butterfly like anna west  an eloquent little gesture of humility made the words almost pathetic kindhearted clara was touched by the sight of tears in the heavenly eyes and tumbling out of the hammock she embraced the queenly figure and warmly pressed the lips that were made for kissing thereby driving several approaching gentlemen to the verge of distraction  now dont be tragical darling you have nothing to cry for im sure young lovely rich and adored what more can any girl want said clara gushingly  something besides admiration to live for answered anna adding with a shrug as she saw several hats fly off and several manly countenances beam upon her never mind my fit is over now let us go and dress for tea  miss west usually took a brisk pull in her own boat before breakfast a habit which lured many indolent young gentlemen out of their beds at unaccustomed hours in the hope that they might have the honor of splashing their legs helping her off the privilege of wishing her bon voyage or the crowning rapture of accompanying her  on the morning after her fit as she called the discontent of a really fine nature with the empty life she led she was up and out unusually early for she had kept her room with a headache all the evening and now longed for fresh air and exercise  as she prepared the gull for a start she was idly wondering what early bird would appear eager to secure the coveted worm when a loud and cheerful voice was heard calling  hullo anna and a nautically attired gentleman hove in sight waving his hat as he hailed her  she started at the unceremonious salute and looked back then her whole face brightened beautifully as she sprang up the bank saying with a pretty mixture of hesitation and pleasure  why frank is that you  do you doubt it  and the newcomer shook both her hands so vigorously that she winced a little as she said laughing  no i dont that is the old squeeze with extra power in it  how are you going for a pull take me along and show me the lions theres a good soul  with pleasure when did you come asked anna settling the black ribbon under the sailor collar which set off her white throat charmingly  last night i caught a glimpse of you at tea but you were surrounded then and vanished immediately afterward so when i saw you skipping over the rocks just now i gave chase and here i am shall i take an oar asked frank as she motioned him to get in  no thank you i prefer to row myself and dont need any help she answered with an imperious little wave of the hand for she was glad to show him she could do something besides dance dress and flirt  all right then ill do the luxurious and enjoy myself and without offering to help her in frank seated himself folded his arms stretched out his long legs and placidly remarked  pull away skipper  anna was pleased with his frank and friendly greeting and feeling as if old times had come again sprang in prepared to astonish him with her skill  might i suggest that youbegan frank as she pushed off  no suggestions or advice allowed aboard this ship i know what im about though i am a woman was the severe answer as the boat glided from the wharf  ay ay sir and frank meekly subsided with a twinkle of amusement in the eyes that rested approvingly on the slender figure in a blue boating suit and the charming face under the sailor hat  anna paddled her way dexterously out from among the fleet of boats riding at anchor in the little bay then she seated herself adjusted one oar and looked about for the other rowlock it was nowhere visible and after a silent search she deigned to ask  have you seen the thing anywhere  i saw it on the bank  why didnt you tell me before  i began to but was quenched so i obeyed orders  you havent forgotten how to tease said anna petulantly  nor you to be wilful  she gave him a look that would have desolated most men but only made frank smile affably as she paddled laboriously back recovered the rowlock and then her temper as with a fine display of muscle she pulled out to sea  getting into the current she let the boat drift and soon forgot time and space in the bewildering conversation that followed  what have you been doing since i saw you last she asked looking as rosy as a milkmaid as she stopped rowing and tied up her windtossed hair  working like a beaver you seeand then to her utter amazement frank entered into an elaborate statement of his affairs quite as if she understood all about it and her opinion was valuable it was all greek to anna but she was immensely gratified for it was just the way the boy used to tell her his small concerns in the days when each had firm faith in the others wisdom she tried to look as if she understood all about investments percentage and long credit but she was out of her depth in five minutes and dared say nothing lest she should betray her lamentable ignorance on all matters of business she got out of the scrape by cleverly turning the conversation to old times and youthful reminiscences soon absorbed them both  the faint faroff sound of a gong recalled her to the fact that breakfast was nearly ready and turning the boat she was dismayed to see how far they had floated she stopped talking and rowed her best but wind and tide were against her she was faint with hunger and her stalwart passenger made her task doubly hard he offered no help however but did the luxurious to the life leaning back with his hat off and dabbling his hands in the way that most impedes the progress of a boat  pride kept anna silent till her face was scarlet her palms blistered and her breath most gone then and not till then did she condescend to say with a gasp poorly concealed by an amiable smile  do you care to row i ought to have asked you before  im very comfortable thank you answered frank then as an expression of despair flitted over poor annas face he added bluntly im getting desperately hungry so i dont care if i do shorten the voyage a bit  with a sigh of relief she rose to change seats and expecting him to help her she involuntarily put out her hands as she passed but frank was busy turning back his cuffs and never stirred a finger so that she would have lost her balance and gone overboard if she had not caught his arm  whats the matter skipper he asked standing the sudden grip as steadily as a mast  why didnt you help me you have no more manners than a turtle cried anna dropping into the seat with the frown of a spoiled beauty accustomed to be gallantly served and supported at every step  frank only added to his offence by laughing as he said carelessly  you seemed so independent i didnt like to interfere  so if i had gone overboard you would not have fished me out unless i asked you to do it i suppose  in that case im afraid i shouldnt have waited for orders we cant spare you to the mermen yet  something in the look he gave her appeased annas resentment and she sat silently admiring the strong swift strokes that sent the gull skimming over the water  not too late for breakfast after all she said graciously as they reached the wharf where several early strollers stood watching their approach  poor thing you look as if you needed it answered frank but he let her get out alone to the horror of messrs barlow king  co and while she fastened the boat frank stood settling his hatband with the most exasperating unconsciousness of his duty  what are you going to do with yourself this morning she asked as she walked up the rocky path with no arm to lean upon  fish will you come along  no thank you one gets so burnt i shall go to my hammock under the pine was the graciously suggestive reply of the lady who liked a slave to fan or swing her and seldom lacked several to choose from  see you at dinner then my room is in the cottage so byby for the present and with a nod frank strolled away leaving the lovely miss west to mount the steps and cross the hall unescorted  the dear fellows manners need polish i must take him in hand i see and yet he is very nice in spite of his brusque ways thought anna indulgently and more than once that morning she recalled his bluff hullo anna as she swung languidly in her hammock with a devoted being softly reading tennyson to her inattentive ears  at dinner she appeared in unusual spirits and kept her end of the table in a ripple of merriment by her witty and satirical sallies privately hoping that her opposite neighbor would discover that she could talk well when she chose to do so but frank was deep in politics discussing some new measure with such earnestness and eloquence that anna pausing to listen for a moment forgot her lively gossip in one of the great questions of the hour  she was listening with silent interest when frank suddenly appealed to her to confirm some statement he had just made and she was ignominiously obliged to confess she knew too little about the matter to give any opinion no compliment ever paid her was more flattering than his way of turning to her now and then as if including her in the discussion as a matter of course and never had she regretted any thing more keenly than she did her ignorance on a subject that every man and woman should understand and espouse  she did her best to look intelligent racked her brain to remember facts which she had heard discussed for weeks without paying any attention to them and thanks to her quick wit and womanly sympathy she managed to hold her own saying little but looking much  the instant dinner was over she sent a servant to the readingroom for a file of late papers and retiring to a secluded corner read up with a diligence that not only left her with clearer ideas on one subject but also a sense of despair at her own deficiencies in the knowledge of many others  i really must have a course of solid reading i do believe that is what i need and ill ask frank where to begin he always was an intelligent boy but i was surprised to hear how well he talked i was actually proud of him i wonder where he is by the way clara wants to be introduced and i want to see how he strikes her  leaving her hidingplace anna walked forth in search of her friends looking unusually bright and beautiful for her secret studies had waked her up and lent her face the higher charm it needed clara appeared first the newcomer had already been presented to her and she professed herself perfectly fascinated such a personable man quite distinguished you know and so elegant in his manners devoted graceful and altogether charming  you like his manners do you and anna smiled at claras enthusiasm  of course i do for they have all the polish of foreign travel with the indescribable something which a really fine character lends to every little act and word  frank has never been abroad and if i judged his character by his manners i should say he was rather a rough customer said anna finding fault because clara praised  you are so fastidious nothing ever suits you dear i didnt expect to like this old friend of yours but i frankly confess i do immensely so if you are tired of him ill take him off your hands  thank you love you are welcome to poor frank if you can win him men are apt to be more loyal to friendship than women and i rather fancy from what i saw this morning that he is in no haste to change old friends for new  anna spoke sweetly but at heart was ill pleased with claras admiration of her private property as she considered poor frank and inwardly resolved to have no poaching on her preserves  just then the gentleman in question came up saying to anna in his abrupt way  every one is going to ride so i cannot get the best horses but ive secured two and now i want a companion will you come for a good oldtime gallop  anna thought of her blistered hands and hesitated till a look at claras hopeful face decided her to accept she did so and rode like an amazon for several hours in spite of heat dust and a hardmouthed horse who nearly pulled her arms out of the sockets  she hoped to find a chance to consult frank about her course of useful reading but he seemed intent on the oldtime gallop and she kept up gallantly till the ride was over when she retired to her room quite exhausted but protesting with heroic smiles that she had had a delightful time  she did not appear at tea but later in the evening when an informal dance was well under way she sailed in on the arm of a distinguished old gentleman evidently prepared to slay her thousands as young barlow said observing the unusual brilliancy of her eyes and the elaborate toilette she had made  she means mischief tonight who is to be the victim i wonder said another man putting up his glass for a survey of the charmer  not the party who came last evening he is only an old friend she says  he might be her brother or her husband judging by the cavalier way in which he treats her i could have punched his head this morning when he let her pull up that boat alone cried a youthful adorer glaring irefully at the delinquent lounging in a distant doorway  if she said he was an old friend you may be sure he is an accepted lover the dear creatures all fib in these matters so ill lay wagers to an enormous amount that all this splendor is for the lord and master not for our destruction answered barlow who was wise in the ways of women and wary as a moth should be who had burnt his wings more than once at the same candle  clara happened to overhear these pleasing remarks and five minutes after they were uttered she breathed them tenderly into annas ear a scornful smile was all the answer she received but the beauty was both pleased and annoyed and awaited with redoubled interest the approach of the old friend who was regarded in the light of a successful lover but he seemed in no haste to claim his privileges and dance after dance went by while he sat talking with the old general or absently watching the human teetotums that spun about before him  i cant stand this another moment said anna to herself at last and beckoned the recreant knight to approach with a commanding gesture  why dont you dance sir  ive forgotten how maam  after all the pains i took with you when we had lessons together years ago  ive been too busy to attend to trifles of that sort  elegant accomplishments are not trifles and no one should neglect them who cares to make himself agreeable  well i dont know that i do care as a general thing  you ought to care and as a penance for that rude speech you must dance this dance with me i cannot let you forget all your accomplishments for the sake of business so i shall do my duty as a friend and take you in hand said anna severely  you are very kind but is it worth the trouble  now frank dont be provoking and ungrateful you know you like to give pleasure to be cared for and to do credit to your friends so just rub up your manners a bit and be as wellbred as you are sensible and brave and good  thank you ill try may i have the honor miss west and he bowed low before her with a smile on his lips that both pleased and puzzled anna  they danced the dance and frank acquitted himself respectably but relapsed into his objectionable ways as soon as the trial ended for the first thing he said with a sigh of relief was  come out and talk for upon my life i cant stand this oven any longer  anna obediently followed and seating herself in a breezy corner waited to be entertained but frank seemed to have forgotten that pleasing duty for perching himself on the wide baluster of the piazza he not only proceeded to light a cigarette without even saying by your leave but coolly offered her one also  how dare you she said much offended at this proceeding i am not one of the fast girls who do such things and i dislike it exceedingly  you used to smoke sweetfern in corncob pipes you remember and these are not much stronger he said placidly restoring the rejected offering to his pocket  i did many foolish things then which i desire to forget now  and some very sweet and sensible ones also ah well it cant be helped i suppose  anna sat silent a moment wondering what he meant and when she looked up she found him pensively staring at her through a fragrant cloud of smoke  what is it she asked for his eyes seemed seeking something  i was trying to see some trace of the little anna i used to know i thought id found her again this morning in the girl in the round hat but i dont find her anywhere tonight  indeed frank im not so much changed as i seem at least to you i am the same as far as i can be do believe it and be friends for i want one very much cried anna forgetting every thing but the desire to reestablish herself in his good opinion as she spoke she turned her face toward the light and half extended her hand as if to claim and hold the old regard that seemed about to be withdrawn from her  frank bent a little and scanned the upturned face with a keen glance it flushed in the moonlight and the lips trembled like an anxious childs but the eyes met his with a look both proud and wistful candid and sweeta look few saw in those lovely eyes or once seeing ever forgot frank gave a little nod as if satisfied and said with that perplexing smile of his  most people would see only the beautiful miss west in a remarkably pretty gown but i think i catch a glimpse of little anna and i am very glad of it you want a friend very good ill do my best for you but you must take me as i am thorns and all  i will and not mind if they wound sometimes ive had roses till im tired of them in spite of their sweetness  as he spoke frank had taken the hand she offered and having gravely shaken it held the white wonder for an instant glancing from the little blisters on the delicate palm to the rings that shone on several fingers  are you reading my fortune asked anna wondering if he was going to be sentimental and kiss it  after a fashion for i am looking to see if there is a suspicious diamond anywhere about isnt it time there was one  that is not a question for you to ask and anna caught away her hand as if one of the thorns he spoke of had suddenly pricked  why not we always used to tell each other every thing and if we are to go on in the old friendly way we must be confidential and comfortable you know  you can begin yourself then and ill see how i like it said anna aroused and interested in spite of her maidenly scruples about the new arrangement  i will with all my heart to own the truth ive been longing to tell you something but i wasnt sure that youd take any interest in it began frank eating roseleaves with interesting embarrassment  i can imagine what it is said anna quickly while her heart began to flutter curiously for these confidences were becoming exciting you have found your fate and are dying to let everybody know how happy you are  i think i have but im not happy yet im desperately anxious for i cannot decide whether it is a wise or foolish choice  who is it  never mind the name i havent spoken yet and perhaps never shall so i may as well keep that to myselffor the present at least  tell me what you like then and i will ask no more questions said anna coldly for this masculine discretion annoyed her  well you see this dear girl is pretty rich accomplished and admired a little spoilt in fact but very captivating in spite of it now the doubt in my mind is whether it is wise to woo a wife of this sort for i know i shall want a companion in all things not only a pretty sweetheart or a graceful mistress for my house  i should say it was not wise began anna decidedly then hastened to add more quietly but perhaps you only see one side of this girls character she may have much strength and sweetness hidden away under her gay manner waiting to be called out when the right mate comes  i often think so myself and long to learn if i am the man but some frivolous act thoughtless word or fashionable folly on her part dampens my ardor and makes me feel as if i had better go elsewhere before it is too late  you are not madly in love then  not yet but i should be if i saw much of her for when i do i rather lose my head and am tempted to fall upon my knees regardless of time place and consequences  frank spoke with sudden love and longing in his voice and stretched out his arms so suggestively that anna started but he contented himself with gathering a rose from the clusters that hung all about and anna slapped an imaginary mosquito as energetically as if it had been the unknown lady for whom she felt a sudden and inexplicable dislike  so you think id better not say to my love like the mad gentleman to mrs nickleby be mine be mine was franks next question as he sat with his nose luxuriously buried in the fragrant heart of the rose  decidedly not im sure from the way you speak of her that she is not worthy of you and your passion cannot be very deep if you can quote dickenss nonsense at such a moment said anna more cheerfully  it grows rapidly i find and i give you my word if i should pass a week in the society of that lovely butterfly it would be all over with me by saturday night  then dont do it  ah but i want to desperately do say that i may just for a last nibble at temptation before i take your advice and go back to my bachelor life again he prayed beseechingly  dont go back love somebody else and be happy there are plenty of superior women in the world who would be just the thing for you i am sure you are going to be a man of mark and you must have a good wifenot a silly little creature who will be a clog upon you all your life so do take my advice and let me help you if i can  anna spoke earnestly and her face quite shone with friendly zeal while her eyes were full of unspoken admiration and regard for this friend who seemed tottering on the verge of a precipice she expected a serious replythanks at least for her interest and great was her surprise to see frank lean back against the vinewreathed pillar behind him and laugh till a shower of roseleaves came fluttering down on both their heads  i dont see any cause for such unseemly merriment was her dignified reproof of this new impropriety  i beg your pardon i really couldnt help it for the comical contrast between your sage counsels and your blooming face upset me your manner was quite maternal and most impressive till i looked at you in your french finery and then it was all up with me said frank penitently though his eyes still danced with mirth  the compliment appeased annas anger and folding her round white arms on the railing in front of her she looked up at him with a laugh as blithe as his own  i dare say i was absurdly sober and important but you see it is so long since i have had a really serious thought in my head or felt a really sincere interest in any ones affairs but my own that i overdid the matter if you dont care for my advice ill take it all back and you can go and marry your butterfly as soon as you like  i rather think i shall said frank slowly for i fancy she has got a hidden self as you suggested and id rather like to find it out one judges people so much by externals that it is not fair now you for instance if you wont mind my saying it dont show half your good points and a casual observer would consider you merely a fashionable womanlovely but shallow  as you did the last time we met put in anna sharply  if she expected him to deny it she was mistaken for he answered with provoking candor  exactly and i quite grieved about it for i used to be very fond of my little playmate and thought shed make a fine woman im glad ive seen you again for i find i was unjust in my first judgment and this discovery gives me hope that i may have been mistaken in the same way about mywell well say sweetheart its a pretty old word and i like it  if he only would forget that creature a minute and talk about something more interesting sighed anna to herself but she answered meekly enough i knew you were disappointed in me and i did not wonder for i am not good for much thanks to my foolish education and the life i have led these last few years but i do sincerely wish to be more of a woman only i have no one to tell me how everybody flatters me and  i dont cried frank promptly  thats true and anna could not help laughing in the middle of her confessions at the tone of virtuous satisfaction with which he repelled the accusation no she continued you are honest enough for any one and i like it though it startles me now and then it is so new  i hope im not disrespectful said frank busily removing the thorns from the stem of his flower  oh no not that exactly but you treat me very much as if i was a sister or amasculine friend anna meant to quote the expression clara had reported but somehow the word wife was hard to utter and she finished the sentence differently  and you dont like it asked frank lifting the rose to hide the mischievous smile that lurked about his mouth  yes i doinfinitely better than the sentimental homage other men pay me or the hackneyed rubbish they talk it does me good to be a little neglected and i dont mind it from you because you more than atone for it by talking to me as if i could understand a mans mind and had one of my own  then you dont quite detest me for my rough ways and egotistical confidences asked frank as if suddenly smitten with remorse for the small sins of the day  no i rather fancy it for it seems like old times when you and i played together only then i could help you in many ways as you helped me but now i dont seem to know any thing and can be of no use to you or any one else i should like to be and i think if you would kindly tell me what books to read what people to know and what faculties to cultivate i might become something besides a fashionable woman lovely but shallow  there was a little quiver of emotion in annas voice as she uttered the last words that did not escape her companions quick ear but he only smiled a look of heartfelt satisfaction to the rose and answered soberly  now that is a capital idea and ill do it with pleasure i have often wondered how you bright girls could be contented with such an empty sort of life we fellows are just as foolish for a time i knowfar worse in the crops of wild oats we sow but we have to pull up and go to work and that makes men of us marriage ought to do that for women i suppose but it doesnt seem to nowadays and i do pity you poor little things from the bottom of my heart  im ready now to pull up and go to work show me how frank and ill change your pity into respect said anna casting off her lace shawl as if preparing for immediate action for his tone of masculine superiority rather nettled her  come ill make a bargain with you ill give you something strong and solid to brace up your mind and in return you shall polish my manners see to my morals and keep my heart from wasting itself on false idols shall we do this for one another anna  yes frank she answered heartily then as clara was seen approaching she added playfully all this is sub rosa you understand  he handed her the flower without a word as if the emblem of silence was the best gage he could offer many flowers had been presented to the beauty but none were kept so long and carefully as the thornless rose her old friend gave her with a cordial smile that warmed her heart  a great deal can happen in a week and the seven days that followed that moonlight têteàtête seemed to anna the fullest and the happiest she had ever known she had never worked so hard in her life for her new tutor gave her plenty to do and she studied in secret to supply sundry deficiencies which she was too proud to confess no more novels now no more sentimental poetry lounging in a hammock she sat erect upon a hard rock and read buckle mill and social science reports with a diligence that appalled the banished dawdlers who usually helped her kill time there was early boating vigorous horse exercise and tramps over hill and dale from which she returned dusty brown and tired but as happy as if she had discovered something fairer and grander than wild flowers or the ocean in its changeful moods there were afternoon concerts in the breezy drawingrooms when others were enjoying siestas and anna sang to her one listener as she had never sung before but best of all were the moonlight séances among the roses for there they interchanged interesting confidences and hovered about those dangerous but delightful topics that need the magic of a midsummer night to make the charm quite perfect  anna intended to do her part honorably but soon forgot to correct her pupils manners she was so busy taking care of his heart she presently discovered that he treated other women in the usual way and at first it annoyed her that she was the only one whom he allowed to pick up her own fan walk without an arm row ride and take care of herself as if she was a man but she also discovered that she was the only woman to whom he talked as to an equal in whom he seemed to find sympathy inspiration and help and for whom he frankly showed not admiration alone but respect confidence and affection  this made the loss of a little surface courtesy too trifling for complaint or reproof this stimulated and delighted her and in striving to deserve and secure it she forgot every thing else prouder to be one mans true friend than the idol of a dozen lovers  what the effect of this new league was upon the other party was less evident for being of the undemonstrative sex he kept his observations discoveries and satisfaction to himself with no sign of especial interest except now and then a rapturous allusion to his sweetheart as if absence was increasing his passion  anna tried to quench his ardor feeling sure she said that it was a mistake to lavish so much love upon a person who was so entirely unworthy of it but frank seemed blind on this one point and anna suffered many a pang as day after day showed her some new virtue grace or talent in this perverse man who seemed bent on throwing his valuable self away she endeavored to forget it avoided the subject as much as possible and ignored the existence of this inconvenient being entirely but as the week drew to an end a secret trouble looked out at her eyes a secret unrest possessed her and every moment seemed to grow more precious as it passed each full of a bitter sweet delight never known before  i must be off tomorrow said frank on the saturday evening as they strolled together on the beach while the sun set gloriously and the great waves broke musically on the sands  such a short holiday after all those months of work answered anna looking away lest he should see how wistful her telltale eyes were  i may take a longer holiday the happiest a man can have if somebody will go with me anna ive made up my mind to try my fate he added impetuously  i have warned you i can do no more which was quite true for the poor girls heart sunk at his words and for a moment all the golden sky was a blur before her eyes  i wont be warned thank you for im quite sure now that i love her nothing like absence to settle that point ive tried it and i cant get on without her so im going to put my fortune to the touch and win or lose it all  if you truly love her i hope you will win and find her the wife you deserve but think well before you put your happiness into any womans hands said anna bravely trying to forget herself  bless you ive hardly thought of any thing else this week ive enjoyed myself though and am very grateful to you for making my visit so pleasant frank added warmly  have i im so glad said anna as simply as a pleased child for real love had banished all her small coquetries vanities and affectations as sunshine absorbs the mists that hide a lovely landscape  indeed you have all the teaching has not been on my side i assure you and im not too proud to own my obligation to a woman we lonely fellows who have neither mother sister nor wife need some gentle soul to keep us from getting selfish hard and worldly and few are so fortunate as i in having a friend like little anna  oh frank what have i done for you i havent dared to teach one so much wiser and stronger than myself ive only wanted to and grieved because i was so ignorant so weak and silly cried anna glowing beautifully with surprise and pleasure at this unexpected revelation  your humility blinded you yet your unconsciousness was half the charm ill tell you what you did dear a mans moral sense gets blunted knocking about this roughandtumble world where the favorite maxim is every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost it is so with me and in many of our conversations on various subjects while i seemed to be teaching you your innocent integrity was rebuking my worldly wisdom your subtle instincts were pointing out the right which is above all policy your womanly charity softening my hard judgments and your simple faith in the good the beautiful the truly brave was waking up the high and happy beliefs that lay not dead but sleeping in my soul all this you did for me anna and even more for in showing me the hidden side of your nature i found it so sweet and deep and worshipful that it restores my faith in womankind and shows me all the lovely possibilities that may lie folded up under the frivolous exterior of a fashionable woman  annas heart was so full she could not speak for a moment then like a dash of cold water came the thought and all this that i have done has only put him further from me since it has given him courage to love and trust that woman she tried to show only pleasure at his praise but for the life of her she could not keep a tone of bitterness out of her voice as she answered gratefully  you are too kind frank i can hardly believe that i have so many virtues but if i have and they like yours have been asleep remember you helped wake them up and so you owe me nothing keep your sweet speeches for the lady you go to woo i am contented with honest words that do not flatter  you shall have them and a quick smile passed over franks face as if he knew what thorn pricked her just then and was not ill pleased at the discovery only if i lose my sweetheart i may be sure that my old friend wont desert me he asked with a sincere anxiety that was a balm to annas sore heart  she did not speak but offered him her hand with a look which said much he took it as silently and holding it in a firm warm grasp led her up to a cleft in the rocks where they often sat to watch the great breakers thunder in as she took her seat he folded his plaid about her so tenderly that it felt like a friendly arm shielding her from the fresh gale that blew up from the sea it was an unusual attention on his part and coming just then it affected her so curiously that when he lounged down beside her she felt a strong desire to lay her head on his shoulder and sob out  dont go and leave me no one loves you half as well as i or needs you half so much  of course she did nothing of the sort but began to sing as she covertly whisked away a rebellious tear frank soon interrupted her music however by a heavy sigh and followed up that demonstration with the tragical announcement  anna ive got something awful to tell you  what is it she asked with the resignation of one who has already heard the worst  it is so bad that i cant look you in the face while i tell it listen calmly till i am done and then pitch me overboard if you like for i deserve it was his cheerful beginning  go on and anna prepared herself to receive some tremendous shock with masculine firmness  frank pulled his hat over his eyes and looking away from her said rapidly with an odd sound in his voice  the night i came i was put in a room opening on the back piazza and lying there to rest and cool after my journey i heard two ladies talking i knocked my boots about to let them know i was near but they took no notice so i listened most womens gabble would have sent me to sleep in five minutes but this was rather original and interested me especially when i found by the names mentioned that i knew one of the parties ive been trying your experiment all the week anna how do you like it  she did not answer for a moment being absorbed in swift retrospection then she colored to her hatbrim looked angry hurt amused gratified and ashamed all in a minute and said slowly as she met his laughing eyes  better than i thought i should  thats good then you forgive me for my eavesdropping my rudeness and manifold iniquities it was abominable but i could not resist the temptation of testing your sincerity it was great fun but im not sure that i shall not get the worst of it after all said frank sobering suddenly  you have played so many jokes upon me in old times that i dont find it hard to forgive this one though i think it rather base in you to deceive me so still as i have enjoyed and got a good deal out of it i dont complain and wont send you overboard yet said anna generously  you always were a forgiving angel and frank settled the plaid again more tenderly than before  it was this then that made you so brusque to me alone so odd and careless i could not understand it and it hurt me at first but i thought it was because we had been children together and soon forgot it you were so kind and confidential so helpful and straightforward it was great fun for i always knew you meant what you said and that was an unspeakable comfort to me in this world of flattery and falsehood yes you may laugh at me frank and leave me to myself again i can bear it for ive proved that my whim was a possibility i see my way now and can go on alone to a truer happier life than that in which you found me  she spoke out bravely and looked above the level sands and beyond the restless sea as if she had found something worth living for and did not fear the future frank watched her an instant for her face had never worn so noble an expression before sorrow as well as strength had come into the lovely features and pain as well as patience touched them with new beauty his own face changed as he looked as if he let loose some deep and tender sentiment long held in check now ready to rise and claim its own  anna he said penitently ive got one other terrible confession to make and then my conscience will be clear i want to tell you who my sweetheart is heres her picture will you look at it  she gave a little shiver turned steadily and looked where he pointed but all she saw was her own astonished face reflected in the shallow pool behind them one glance at frank made any explanation needless indeed there was no time for her to speak before something closer than the plaid enfolded her something warmer than tears touched her cheek and a voice sweeter to her than wind or wave whispered tenderly in her ear  all this week i have been studying and enjoying far more than you for i have read a womans heart and learned to trust and honor what i have loved ever since i was a boy absence proved this to me so i came to look for little anna and found her better and dearer than ever may i ask her to keep on teaching me will she share my work as well as holiday and be the truest friend a man can have  and anna straightway answered yes     transcendental wild oats  a chapter from an unwritten romance   on the first day of june 184 a large wagon drawn by a small horse and containing a motley load went lumbering over certain new england hills with the pleasing accompaniments of wind rain and hail a serene man with a serene child upon his knee was driving or rather being driven for the small horse had it all his own way a brown boy with a william penn style of countenance sat beside him firmly embracing a bust of socrates behind them was an energeticlooking woman with a benevolent brow satirical mouth and eyes brimful of hope and courage a baby reposed upon her lap a mirror leaned against her knee and a basket of provisions danced about at her feet as she struggled with a large unruly umbrella two blueeyed little girls with hands full of childish treasures sat under one old shawl chatting happily together  in front of this lively party stalked a tall sharpfeatured man in a long blue cloak and a fourth small girl trudged along beside him through the mud as if she rather enjoyed it  the wind whistled over the bleak hills the rain fell in a despondent drizzle and twilight began to fall but the calm man gazed as tranquilly into the fog as if he beheld a radiant bow of promise spanning the gray sky the cheery woman tried to cover every one but herself with the big umbrella the brown boy pillowed his head on the bald pate of socrates and slumbered peacefully the little girls sang lullabies to their dolls in soft maternal murmurs the sharpnosed pedestrian marched steadily on with the blue cloak streaming out behind him like a banner and the lively infant splashed through the puddles with a ducklike satisfaction pleasant to behold  thus these modern pilgrims journeyed hopefully out of the old world to found a new one in the wilderness  the editors of the transcendental tripod had received from messrs lion  lamb two of the aforesaid pilgrims a communication from which the following statement is an extract  we have made arrangements with the proprietor of an estate of about a hundred acres which liberates this tract from human ownership here we shall prosecute our effort to initiate a family in harmony with the primitive instincts of man  ordinary secular farming is not our object fruit grain pulse herbs flax and other vegetable products receiving assiduous attention will afford ample manual occupation and chaste supplies for the bodily needs it is intended to adorn the pastures with orchards and to supersede the labor of cattle by the spade and the pruningknife  consecrated to human freedom the land awaits the sober culture of devoted men beginning with small pecuniary means this enterprise must be rooted in a reliance on the succors of an everbounteous providence whose vital affinities being secured by this union with uncorrupted field and unworldly persons the cares and injuries of a life of gain are avoided  the inner nature of each member of the family is at no time neglected our plan contemplates all such disciplines cultures and habits as evidently conduce to the purifying of the inmates  pledged to the spirit alone the founders anticipate no hasty or numerous addition to their numbers the kingdom of peace is entered only through the gates of selfdenial and felicity is the test and the reward of loyalty to the unswerving law of love  this prospective eden at present consisted of an old red farmhouse a dilapidated barn many acres of meadowland and a grove ten ancient appletrees were all the chaste supply which the place offered as yet but in the firm belief that plenteous orchards were soon to be evoked from their inner consciousness these sanguine founders had christened their domain fruitlands  here timon lion intended to found a colony of latter day saints who under his patriarchal sway should regenerate the world and glorify his name for ever here abel lamb with the devoutest faith in the high ideal which was to him a living truth desired to plant a paradise where beauty virtue justice and love might live happily together without the possibility of a serpent entering in and here his wife unconverted but faithful to the end hoped after many wanderings over the face of the earth to find rest for herself and a home for her children  there is our new abode announced the enthusiast smiling with a satisfaction quite undamped by the drops dripping from his hatbrim as they turned at length into a cartpath that wound along a steep hillside into a barrenlooking valley  a little difficult of access observed his practical wife as she endeavored to keep her various household gods from going overboard with every lurch of the laden ark  like all good things but those who earnestly desire and patiently seek will soon find us placidly responded the philosopher from the mud through which he was now endeavoring to pilot the muchenduring horse  truth lies at the bottom of a well sister hope said brother timon pausing to detach his small comrade from a gate whereon she was perched for a clearer gaze into futurity  thats the reason we so seldom get at it i suppose replied mrs hope making a vain clutch at the mirror which a sudden jolt sent flying out of her hands  we want no false reflections here said timon with a grim smile as he crunched the fragments under foot in his onward march  sister hope held her peace and looked wistfully through the mist at her promised home the old red house with a hospitable glimmer at its windows cheered her eyes and considering the weather was a fitter refuge than the sylvan bowers some of the more ardent souls might have preferred  the newcomers were welcomed by one of the elect preciousa regenerate farmer whose idea of reform consisted chiefly in wearing white cotton raiment and shoes of untanned leather this costume with a snowy beard gave him a venerable and at the same time a somewhat bridal appearance  the goods and chattels of the society not having arrived the weary family reposed before the fire on blocks of wood while brother moses white regaled them with roasted potatoes brown bread and water in two plates a tin pan and one mug his table service being limited but having cast the forms and vanities of a depraved world behind them the elders welcomed hardship with the enthusiasm of new pioneers and the children heartily enjoyed this foretaste of what they believed was to be a sort of perpetual picnic  during the progress of this frugal meal two more brothers appeared one a dark melancholy man clad in homespun whose peculiar mission was to turn his name hind part before and use as few words as possible the other was a bland bearded englishman who expected to be saved by eating uncooked food and going without clothes he had not yet adopted the primitive costume however but contented himself with meditatively chewing dry beans out of a basket  every meal should be a sacrament and the vessels used should be beautiful and symbolical observed brother lamb mildly righting the tin pan slipping about on his knees i priced a silver service when in town but it was too costly so i got some graceful cups and vases of britannia ware  hardest things in the world to keep bright will whiting be allowed in the community inquired sister hope with a housewifes interest in laborsaving institutions  such trivial questions will be discussed at a more fitting time answered brother timon sharply as he burnt his fingers with a very hot potato neither sugar molasses milk butter cheese nor flesh are to be used among us for nothing is to be admitted which has caused wrong or death to man or beast  our garments are to be linen till we learn to raise our own cotton or some substitute for woollen fabrics added brother abel blissfully basking in an imaginary future as warm and brilliant as the generous fire before him  haou abaout shoes asked brother moses surveying his own with interest  we must yield that point till we can manufacture an innocent substitute for leather bark wood or some durable fabric will be invented in time meanwhile those who desire to carry out our idea to the fullest extent can go barefooted said lion who liked extreme measures  i never will nor let my girls murmured rebellious sister hope under her breath  haou do you cattleate to treat the tenacre lot ef things aint tended to right smart we shant hev no crops observed the practical patriarch in cotton  we shall spade it replied abel in such perfect good faith that moses said no more though he indulged in a shake of the head as he glanced at hands that had held nothing heavier than a pen for years he was a paternal old soul and regarded the younger men as promising boys on a new sort of lark  what shall we do for lamps if we cannot use any animal substance i do hope light of some sort is to be thrown upon the enterprise said mrs lamb with anxiety for in those days kerosene and camphene were not and gas unknown in the wilderness  we shall go without till we have discovered some vegetable oil or wax to serve us replied brother timon in a decided tone which caused sister hope to resolve that her private lamp should be always trimmed if not burning  each member is to perform the work for which experience strength and taste best fit him continued dictator lion thus drudgery and disorder will be avoided and harmony prevail we shall rise at dawn begin the day by bathing followed by music and then a chaste repast of fruit and bread each one finds congenial occupation till the meridian meal when some deepsearching conversation gives rest to the body and development to the mind healthful labor again engages us till the last meal when we assemble in social communion prolonged till sunset when we retire to sweet repose ready for the next days activity  what part of the work do you incline to yourself asked sister hope with a humorous glimmer in her keen eyes  i shall wait till it is made clear to me being in preference to doing is the great aim and this comes to us rather by a resigned willingness than a wilful activity which is a check to all divine growth responded brother timon  i thought so and mrs lamb sighed audibly for during the year he had spent in her family brother timon had so faithfully carried out his idea of being not doing that she had found his divine growth both an expensive and unsatisfactory process  here her husband struck into the conversation his face shining with the light and joy of the splendid dreams and high ideals hovering before him  in these steps of reform we do not rely so much on scientific reasoning or physiological skill as on the spirits dictates the greater part of mans duty consists in leaving alone much that he now does shall i stimulate with tea coffee or wine no shall i consume flesh not if i value health shall i subjugate cattle shall i claim property in any created thing shall i trade shall i adopt a form of religion shall i interest myself in politics to how many of these questionscould we ask them deeply enough and could they be heard as having relation to our eternal welfarewould the response be abstain  a mild snore seemed to echo the last word of abels rhapsody for brother moses had succumbed to mundane slumber and sat nodding like a massive ghost forest absalom the silent man and john pease the english member now departed to the barn and mrs lamb led her flock to a temporary fold leaving the founders of the consociate family to build castles in the air till the fire went out and the symposium ended in smoke  the furniture arrived next day and was soon bestowed for the principal property of the community consisted in books to this rare library was devoted the best room in the house and the few busts and pictures that still survived many flittings were added to beautify the sanctuary for here the family was to meet for amusement instruction and worship  any housewife can imagine the emotions of sister hope when she took possession of a large dilapidated kitchen containing an old stove and the peculiar stores out of which food was to be evolved for her little family of eleven cakes of maple sugar dried peas and beans barley and hominy meal of all sorts potatoes and dried fruit no milk butter cheese tea or meat appeared even salt was considered a useless luxury and spice entirely forbidden by these lovers of spartan simplicity a ten years experience of vegetarian vagaries had been good training for this new freak and her sense of the ludicrous supported her through many trying scenes  unleavened bread porridge and water for breakfast bread vegetables and water for dinner bread fruit and water for supper was the bill of fare ordained by the elders no teapot profaned that sacred stove no gory steak cried aloud for vengeance from her chaste gridiron and only a brave womans taste time and temper were sacrificed on that domestic altar  the vexed question of light was settled by buying a quantity of bayberry wax for candles and on discovering that no one knew how to make them pineknots were introduced to be used when absolutely necessary being summer the evenings were not long and the weary fraternity found it no great hardship to retire with the birds the inner light was sufficient for most of them but mrs lamb rebelled evening was the only time she had to herself and while the tired feet rested the skilful hands mended torn frocks and little stockings or anxious heart forgot its burden in a book  so mothers lamp burned steadily while the philosophers built a new heaven and earth by moonlight and through all the metaphysical mists and philanthropic pyrotechnics of that period sister hope played her own little game of throwing light and none but the moths were the worse for it  such farming probably was never seen before since adam delved the band of brothers began by spading garden and field but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly blistered hands and aching backs suggested the expediency of permitting the use of cattle till the workers were better fitted for noble toil by a summer of the new life  brother moses brought a yoke of oxen from his farmat least the philosophers thought so till it was discovered that one of the animals was a cow and moses confessed that he must be let down easy for he couldnt live on garden sarse entirely  great was dictator lions indignation at this lapse from virtue but time pressed the work must be done so the meek cow was permitted to wear the yoke and the recreant brother continued to enjoy forbidden draughts in the barn which dark proceeding caused the children to regard him as one set apart for destruction  the sowing was equally peculiar for owing to some mistake the three brethren who devoted themselves to this graceful task found when about half through the job that each had been sowing a different sort of grain in the same field a mistake which caused much perplexity as it could not be remedied but after a long consultation and a good deal of laughter it was decided to say nothing and see what would come of it  the garden was planted with a generous supply of useful roots and herbs but as manure was not allowed to profane the virgin soil few of these vegetable treasures ever came up purslane reigned supreme and the disappointed planters ate it philosophically deciding that nature knew what was best for them and would generously supply their needs if they could only learn to digest her sallets and wild roots  the orchard was laid out a little grafting done new trees and vines set regardless of the unfit season and entire ignorance of the husbandmen who honestly believed that in the autumn they would reap a bounteous harvest  slowly things got into order and rapidly rumors of the new experiment went abroad causing many strange spirits to flock thither for in those days communities were the fashion and transcendentalism raged wildly some came to look on and laugh some to be supported in poetic idleness a few to believe sincerely and work heartily each member was allowed to mount his favorite hobby and ride it to his hearts content very queer were some of the riders and very rampant some of the hobbies  one youth believing that language was of little consequence if the spirit was only right startled newcomers by blandly greeting them with goodmorning damn you and other remarks of an equally mixed order a second irrepressible being held that all the emotions of the soul should be freely expressed and illustrated his theory by antics that would have sent him to a lunatic asylum if as an unregenerate wag said he had not already been in one when his spirit soared he climbed trees and shouted when doubt assailed him he lay upon the floor and groaned lamentably at joyful periods he raced leaped and sang when sad he wept aloud and when a great thought burst upon him in the watches of the night he crowed like a jocund cockerel to the great delight of the children and the great annoyance of the elders one musical brother fiddled whenever so moved sang sentimentally to the four little girls and put a musicbox on the wall when he hoed corn  brother pease ground away at his uncooked food or browsed over the farm on sorrel mint green fruit and new vegetables occasionally he took his walks abroad airily attired in an unbleached cotton poncho which was the nearest approach to the primeval costume he was allowed to indulge in at midsummer he retired to the wilderness to try his plan where the woodchucks were without prejudices and huckleberrybushes were hospitably full a sunstroke unfortunately spoilt his plan and he returned to semicivilization a sadder and wiser man  forest absalom preserved his pythagorean silence cultivated his fine dark locks and worked like a beaver setting an excellent example of brotherly love justice and fidelity by his upright life he it was who helped overworked sister hope with her heavy washes kneaded the endless succession of batches of bread watched over the children and did the many tasks left undone by the brethren who were so busy discussing and defining great duties that they forgot to perform the small ones  moses white placidly plodded about chorin raound as he called it looking like an oldtime patriarch with his silver hair and flowing beard and saving the community from many a mishap by his thrift and yankee shrewdness  brother lion domineered over the whole concern for having put the most money into the speculation he was resolved to make it payas if any thing founded on an ideal basis could be expected to do so by any but enthusiasts  abel lamb simply revelled in the newness firmly believing that his dream was to be beautifully realized and in time not only little fruitlands but the whole earth be turned into a happy valley he worked with every muscle of his body for he was in deadly earnest he taught with his whole head and heart planned and sacrificed preached and prophesied with a soul full of the purest aspirations most unselfish purposes and desires for a life devoted to god and man too high and tender to bear the rough usage of this world  it was a little remarkable that only one woman ever joined this community mrs lamb merely followed wheresoever her husband ledas ballast for his balloon as she said in her bright way  miss jane gage was a stout lady of mature years sentimental amiable and lazy she wrote verses copiously and had vague yearnings and graspings after the unknown which led her to believe herself fitted for a higher sphere than any she had yet adorned  having been a teacher she was set to instructing the children in the common branches each adult member took a turn at the infants and as each taught in his own way the result was a chronic state of chaos in the minds of these muchafflicted innocents  sleep food and poetic musings were the desires of dear janes life and she shirked all duties as clogs upon her spirits wings any thought of lending a hand with the domestic drudgery never occurred to her and when to the question are there any beasts of burden on the place mrs lamb answered with a face that told its own tale only one woman the buxom jane took no shame to herself but laughed at the joke and let the stouthearted sister tug on alone  unfortunately the poor lady hankered after the fleshpots and endeavored to stay herself with private sips of milk crackers and cheese and on one dire occasion she partook of fish at a neighbors table  one of the children reported this sad lapse from virtue and poor jane was publicly reprimanded by timon  i only took a little bit of the tail sobbed the penitent poetess  yes but the whole fish had to be tortured and slain that you might tempt your carnal appetite with that one taste of the tail know ye not consumers of flesh meat that ye are nourishing the wolf and tiger in your bosoms  at this awful question and the peal of laughter which arose from some of the younger brethren tickled by the ludicrous contrast between the stout sinner the stern judge and the naughty satisfaction of the young detective poor jane fled from the room to pack her trunk and return to a world where fishes tails were not forbidden fruit  transcendental wild oats were sown broadcast that year and the fame thereof has not yet ceased in the land for futile as this crop seemed to outsiders it bore an invisible harvest worth much to those who planted in earnest as none of the members of this particular community have ever recounted their experiences before a few of them may not be amiss since the interest in these attempts has never died out and fruitlands was the most ideal of all these castles in spain  a new dress was invented since cotton silk and wool were forbidden as the product of slavelabor wormslaughter and sheeprobbery tunics and trowsers of brown linen were the only wear the womens skirts were longer and their straw hatbrims wider than the mens and this was the only difference some persecution lent a charm to the costume and the longhaired linenclad reformers quite enjoyed the mild martyrdom they endured when they left home  money was abjured as the root of all evil the produce of the land was to supply most of their wants or be exchanged for the few things they could not grow this idea had its inconveniences but selfdenial was the fashion and it was surprising how many things one can do without when they desired to travel they walked if possible begged the loan of a vehicle or boldly entered car or coach and stating their principles to the officials took the consequences usually their dress their earnest frankness and gentle resolution won them a passage but now and then they met with hard usage and had the satisfaction of suffering for their principles  on one of these penniless pilgrimages they took passage on a boat and when fare was demanded artlessly offered to talk instead of pay as the boat was well under way and they actually had not a cent there was no help for it so brothers lion and lamb held forth to the assembled passengers in their most eloquent style there must have been something effective in this conversation for the listeners were moved to take up a contribution for these inspired lunatics who preached peace on earth and goodwill to man so earnestly with empty pockets a goodly sum was collected but when the captain presented it the reformers proved that they were consistent even in their madness for not a penny would they accept saying with a look at the group about them whose indifference or contempt had changed to interest and respect you see how well we get on without money and so went serenely on their way with their linen blouses flapping airily in the cold october wind  they preached vegetarianism everywhere and resisted all temptations of the flesh contentedly eating apples and bread at wellspread tables and much afflicting hospitable hostesses by denouncing their food and taking away their appetites discussing the horrors of shambles the incorporation of the brute in man and on elegant abstinence the sign of a pure soul but when the perplexed or offended ladies asked what they should eat they got in reply a bill of fare consisting of bowls of sunrise for breakfast solar seeds of the sphere dishes from plutarchs chaste table and other viands equally hard to find in any modern market  reform conventions of all sorts were haunted by these brethren who said many wise things and did many foolish ones unfortunately these wanderings interfered with their harvest at home but the rule was to do what the spirit moved so they left their crops to providence and went areaping in wider and let us hope more fruitful fields than their own  luckily the earthly providence who watched over abel lamb was at hand to glean the scanty crop yielded by the uncorrupted land which consecrated to human freedom had received the sober culture of devout men  about the time the grain was ready to house some call of the oversoul wafted all the men away an easterly storm was coming up and the yellow stacks were sure to be ruined then sister hope gathered her forces three little girls one boy timons son and herself harnessed to clothesbaskets and russialinen sheets were the only teams she could command but with these poor appliances the indomitable woman got in the grain and saved food for her young with the instinct and energy of a motherbird with a brood of hungry nestlings to feed  this attempt at regeneration had its tragic as well as comic side though the world only saw the former  with the first frosts the butterflies who had sunned themselves in the new light through the summer took flight leaving the few bees to see what honey they had stored for winter use precious little appeared beyond the satisfaction of a few months of holy living  at first it seemed as if a chance to try holy dying also was to be offered them timon much disgusted with the failure of the scheme decided to retire to the shakers who seemed to be the only successful community going  what is to become of us asked mrs hope for abel was heartbroken at the bursting of his lovely bubble  you can stay here if you like till a tenant is found no more wood must be cut however and no more corn ground all i have must be sold to pay the debts of the concern as the responsibility rests with me was the cheering reply  who is to pay us for what we have lost i gave all i hadfurniture time strength six months of my childrens livesand all are wasted abel gave himself body and soul and is almost wrecked by hard work and disappointment are we to have no return for this but leave to starve and freeze in an old house with winter at hand no money and hardly a friend left for this wild scheme has alienated nearly all we had you talk much about justice let us have a little since there is nothing else left  but the womans appeal met with no reply but the old one it was an experiment we all risked something and must bear our losses as we can  with this cold comfort timon departed with his son and was absorbed into the shaker brotherhood where he soon found that the order of things was reversed and it was all work and no play  then the tragedy began for the forsaken little family desolation and despair fell upon abel as his wife said his new beliefs had alienated many friends some thought him mad some unprincipled even the most kindly thought him a visionary whom it was useless to help till he took more practical views of life all stood aloof saying let him work out his own ideas and see what they are worth  he had tried but it was a failure the world was not ready for utopia yet and those who attempted to found it only got laughed at for their pains in other days men could sell all and give to the poor lead lives devoted to holiness and high thought and after the persecution was over find themselves honored as saints or martyrs but in modern times these things are out of fashion to live for ones principles at all costs is a dangerous speculation and the failure of an ideal no matter how humane and noble is harder for the world to forgive and forget than bank robbery or the grand swindles of corrupt politicians  deep waters now for abel and for a time there seemed no passage through strength and spirits were exhausted by hard work and too much thought courage failed when looking about for help he saw no sympathizing face no hand outstretched to help him no voice to say cheerily  we all make mistakes and it takes many experiences to shape a life try again and let us help you  every door was closed every eye averted every heart cold and no way open whereby he might earn bread for his children his principles would not permit him to do many things that others did and in the few fields where conscience would allow him to work who would employ a man who had flown in the face of society as he had done  then this dreamer whose dream was the life of his life resolved to carry out his idea to the bitter end there seemed no place for him hereno work no friend to go begging conditions was as ignoble as to go begging money better perish of want than sell ones soul for the sustenance of his body silently he lay down upon his bed turned his face to the wall and waited with pathetic patience for death to cut the knot which he could not untie days and nights went by and neither food nor water passed his lips soul and body were dumbly struggling together and no word of complaint betrayed what either suffered  his wife when tears and prayers were unavailing sat down to wait the end with a mysterious awe and submission for in this entire resignation of all things there was an eloquent significance to her who knew him as no other human being did  leave all to god was his belief and in this crisis the loving soul clung to this faith sure that the allwise father would not desert this child who tried to live so near to him gathering her children about her she waited the issue of the tragedy that was being enacted in that solitary room while the first snow fell outside untrodden by the footprints of a single friend  but the strong angels who sustain and teach perplexed and troubled souls came and went leaving no trace without but working miracles within for when all other sentiments had faded into dimness all other hopes died utterly when the bitterness of death was nearly over when body was past any pang of hunger or thirst and soul stood ready to depart the love that outlives all else refused to die head had bowed to defeat hand had grown weary with too heavy tasks but heart could not grow cold to those who lived in its tender depths even when death touched it  my faithful wife my little girlsthey have not forsaken me they are mine by ties that none can break what right have i to leave them alone what right to escape from the burden and the sorrow i have helped to bring this duty remains to me and i must do it manfully for their sakes the world will forgive me in time for their sakes god will sustain me now  too feeble to rise abel groped for the food that always lay within his reach and in the darkness and solitude of that memorable night ate and drank what was to him the bread and wine of a new communion a new dedication of heart and life to the duties that were left him when the dreams fled  in the early dawn when that sad wife crept fearfully to see what change had come to the patient face on the pillow she found it smiling at her saw a wasted hand outstretched to her and heard a feeble voice cry bravely hope  what passed in that little room is not to be recorded except in the hearts of those who suffered and endured much for loves sake enough for us to know that soon the wan shadow of a man came forth leaning on the arm that never failed him to be welcomed and cherished by the children who never forgot the experiences of that time  hope was the watchword now and while the last logs blazed on the hearth the last bread and apples covered the table the new commander with recovered courage said to her husband  leave all to godand me he has done his part now i will do mine  but we have no money dear  yes we have i sold all we could spare and have enough to take us away from this snowbank  where can we go  i have engaged four rooms at our good neighbor lovejoys there we can live cheaply till spring then for new plans and a home of our own please god  but hope your little store wont last long and we have no friends  i can sew and you can chop wood lovejoy offers you the same pay as he gives his other men my old friend mrs truman will send me all the work i want and my blessed brother stands by us to the end cheer up dear heart for while there is work and love in the world we shall not suffer  and while i have my good angel hope i shall not despair even if i wait another thirty years before i step beyond the circle of the sacred little world in which i still have a place to fill  so one bleak december day with their few possessions piled on an oxsled the rosy children perched atop and the parents trudging arm in arm behind the exiles left their eden and faced the world again  ah me my happy dream how much i leave behind that never can be mine again said abel looking back at the lost paradise lying white and chill in its shroud of snow  yes dear but how much we bring away answered bravehearted hope glancing from husband to children  poor fruitlands the name was as great a failure as the rest continued abel with a sigh as a frostbitten apple fell from a leafless bough at his feet  but the sigh changed to a smile as his wife added in a halftender halfsatirical tone  dont you think apple slump would be a better name for it dear     the romance of a summer day   what shall we do about rose we have tried saratoga and that failed to cheer her up we tried the seashore and that failed now we have tried the mountains and they are going to fail like the rest see if your womans wit cant devise something to help the child milly  time and tenderness will work the cure and she will be all the better for this experience i hope  so do i but i dont pretend to understand these nervous ailments so if air exercise and change of scene dont cure the vapors i give it up girls didnt have such worries in my day  and the old gentleman shook his head as if modern ills perplexed him very much  but milly smiled the slow wise smile of one who had learned much from experience among other things the wisdom of leaving certain troubles to cure themselves  has the child expressed a wish for any thing if so out with it and she shall be gratified if it can be done began uncle ben after a moment of silence as they sat watching the moonlight that glorified the summer night  the last wish is one that we can easily gratify if you dont mind the fatigue the restless spirit that possesses her keeps suggesting new things much exercise does her good and is an excellent way to work off this unrest she likes to tire herself out for then she sleeps poor dear  well well what does the poor dear want to do asked uncle ben quickly  she said today that instead of going off on excursions as we have been doing she would like to stroll away some pleasant morning and follow the road wherever it led finding and enjoying any little adventures that might come alongas richters heroes do  yes i see white butterflies morning red disguised counts philosophic plowmen and all the rest of the romantic rubbish bless the child does she expect to find things of that sort anywhere out of a german novel  plenty of butterflies and morningglories uncle and a girls imagination will supply the romance perhaps we can get up some little surprise to add flavor to our days adventures said milly who rather favored the plan for much romance still lay hidden in that quiet heart of hers  where shall we go what shall we do i dont know how this sort of thing is managed  do nothing but follow us let her choose her road and we will merely see that she has food and rest protection and as much pleasure as we can make for her out of such simple materials having her own way will gratify her and a day in the open air do her good shall we try it sir  with all my heart if the fancy lasts till morning ill have some lunch put up and order jim to dawdle after us with the wagon full of waterproofs and so on in case we break down i rather like the idea now i fairly take it in and uncle ben quite beamed with interest and goodwill for a kinderhearted man never breathed and in spite of his fifty years he was as fond of adventures as any boy  then as we must be up and away very early ill say goodnight sir and milly rose to go looking well satisfied with the success of her suggestion  goodnight my dear and uncle ben rose also flung away his cigar and offered his hand with the oldfashioned courtesy which he always showed his nieces friend for milly only called him uncle to please him  you are sure this wild whim wont be too much for you you are such a selfsacrificing soul im afraid my girl will wear you out he said looking down at her with a fatherly expression very becoming to his comely countenance  not a bit sir i like it and would gladly do any thing to please and help rose im very fond of her and love to pet and care for her im so alone in the world i cling to my few friends and feel as if i couldnt do enough for them  something in millys face made uncle ben hold her hand close in both of his a moment and look as if he was going to stoop and kiss her but he seemed to think better of it for he only shook the soft hand warmly and said in his hearty tone  i dont know what we should do without you my dear you are one of the women born to help and comfort others and ask no reward but love  as the first streaks of dawn touched the eastern sky three faces appeared at three different windows of the great hotel one was a masculine face a ruddy benevolent countenance with kind eyes grayish hair cheerfully erect upon the head and a smile on the lips that softly whistled the old air of      a southerly wind and a cloudy sky     proclaim a hunting morning  the second was one of those serene sweet faces possessing an attraction more subtle than beauty eyes always full of silent sympathy a little wistful sometimes but never sad and an expression of peace and patience that told of battles fought and victories won a happy helpful soul shone from that face and made it lovely though its first bloom was past and a solitary future lay before it  the third was rich in the charms that youth and health lend any countenance but in spite of the bloom on the rounded cheeks the freshness of the lips and the soft beauty of the eyes the face that looked out from the bonny brown hair blowing in the wind was not a happy one discontent unrest and a secret hunger seemed to sadden and sharpen all its outlines making it pathetic to those who could read the language of an unsatisfied heart  poor little rose was waiting as all women must wait for the good gift that brightens life and while she waited patience and passion were having a hard fight in the proud silence of her heart  it will be a capital day girls called uncle ben in his cheery voice  i thought it would be answered milly nodding back with a smile  i know it will pour before night added rose who saw every thing just then through blue spectacles  breakfast is ready for us come on girls or youll miss your morning red called uncle ben retiring with a laugh  i lost mine six months ago sighed rose as she listlessly gathered up the brown curls that were once her pride  hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings sounded from millys room in her blithe voice  tiresome little bird why dont he stay in his nest and cheer his mate muttered rose refusing to be cheered  now lead on my dear well follow till we drop said uncle ben stoutly as they stood on the piazza half an hour later with no one but a sleepy waiter to watch and wonder at the early start  i have always wondered where that lonely road went to and now i shall find out answered rose with an imperious little gesture as she led the way the others followed so slowly that she felt alone and enjoyed it in spite of herself  it was the most eloquent hour of the day for all was beautiful all was fresh nothing was out of order nothing disturbed eye or ear and the world seemed to welcome her with its morning face the road wound between forests full of the green gloom no artist can ever paint pines whispered birches quivered maples dropped grateful shadows and a little river foamed and sparkled by carrying its melodious message from the mountains to the sea glimpses of hoary peaks broke on her now and then dappled with shadows or halfveiled in mists floating and fading like incense from altars fit for a cathedral not built with hands leafy vistas opened temptingly on either side berries blushed ripely in the grass cowbells tinkled pleasantly along the hillsides and that busy little farmer the peabody bird cried from tree to tree sow your wheat peabody peabody peabody with such musical energy one ceased to wonder that fields were wrested from the forest to wave like green and golden breastknots on the bosoms of the hills  the fresh beauty and the healthful peace of the hour refreshed the girl like dew the human rose lifted up her drooping head and smiled back at the blithe sunshine as if she found the world a pleasant place in spite of her own thorns presently a yellow butterfly came wandering by and she watched it as she walked pleasing herself with the girlish fancy that it was a symbol of herself  at first it fluttered idly from side to side now lighting on a purple thistletop then away to swing on a dewy fern now vanishing among the lowhanging boughs overhead then settling in the dust of the road where a ray of light glorified its golden wings unmindful of its lowly seat  little psyche is looking for her cupid everywhere as i have looked for mine i wonder if she ever found and lost him as i did if she does find him again ill accept it as a good omen  full of this fancy rose walked quickly after her airy guide leaving her comrades far behind some tenderhearted spirit surely led that butterfly for it never wandered far away but floated steadily before the girl till it came at last to a wild rosebush full of delicate blossoms above it a cloud of yellow butterflies were dancing in the sun and from among them one flew to meet and welcome the newcomer together they fluttered round the rosy flowers for a moment then rose in graceful circles till they vanished in the wood  rose followed them with eyes that slowly dimmed with happy tears for the innocent soul accepted the omen and believed it gratefully  he will come she said softly to herself as she fastened a knot of wild roses in her bosom and sat down to rest and wait  tired out little girl asked uncle ben coming up at a great pace rather amazed at this sudden burst of energy but glad to see it  no indeed it was lovely and rose looked up with a brighter face than she had worn for weeks  upon my word i think we have hit upon the right thing at last said uncle ben aside to milly what have you been doing to get such a look as that he added aloud  chasing butterflies was all the answer rose gave for she could not tell the foolish little fancy that had comforted her so much  then my dear i beg you will devote yourself to that amusement i never heard it recommended but it seems to be immensely beneficial so keep it up rosy keep it up  i will sir and on went rose as if in search of another one  for an hour or two she strolled along the woody road gathering red raspberries with the dew still on them garlanding her hat with fragrant linnæea wreaths watching the brown brooks go singing away into the forest and wishing the little wood creatures goodmorrow as they went fearlessly to and fro busy with their sylvan housekeeping at every turn of the road roses wistful eyes looked forward as if hoping to see some muchdesired figure approaching at every sound of steps she lifted her head like a deer listening and watching till the stranger had gone by and down every green vista she sent longing looks as if memory recalled happy hours in green nooks like those  presently the road wound over a bridge below which flowed a wide smooth river flecked with alternate sun and shadow  how beautiful it is i must float down this stream a little way it is getting warm and i am tired yet dont want to stop or turn back yet said rose adding as her quick eye roved to and fro i see a boat down there and a lazy man reading ill hire or borrow it so come on  away she went into the meadow and accosting the countryman who lay in the shade she made her request  i get my livin in summer by rowin folks down to the falls it aint fur will you go miss he said smiling all over his brown face as he regarded the pretty vision that so suddenly appeared beside him  rose accepted the proposition at once but half regretted it a minute after for as the man rose she saw that he had a wooden leg  im afraid we shall be too heavy a load for you she began as he stumped about preparing his boat  the young fellow laughed and squared his broad shoulders with a quick look that thanked her for the pitiful glance she gave him as he answered in a bluff goodnatured tone  dont be afraid i could row a dozen of you i look rather the worse for wear but my old mother thinks im about the strongest man in the state now then give us your hand miss and there you are  with that he helped her in the others obediently followed their capricious leader and in a moment they were floating down the river with a fresh wind cooling their hot faces  you have been in the army i take it began uncle ben in his social way as he watched the man pulling with long easy strokes  pretty nigh through the war sir with a nod and a glance at the wooden leg  uncle ben lifted his hat and rose turned with a sudden interest from the faroff bend of the river to the honest face before her  oh tell us about it i love to hear brave men fight their battles over she cried with a look half pleading half commanding and wholly charming  sho it aint much to tell no more than the rest of em not so much as some i done my best lost my leg got a few bullets here and there and aint much use any way now  a shadow passed over the mans face as he spoke and well it might for it was hard to be disabled at twentyfive with a long life of partial helplessness before him uncle ben who was steering forgot his duty in his sympathy and regarded the wooden leg with silent interest  milly showed hers by keeping the mosquitoes off him by gently waving a green bough as she sat behind him but roses soft eyes shone upon him full of persuasive interest and a new tone of respect was in her voice as she said with a martial salute  please tell about your last battle i had a cousin in the war and feel as if every soldier was my friend and comrade since then  thanky miss ill tell you that with pleasure though it aint much any way and pushing back his hat the young man rested on his oars as he rapidly told his little tale  my last battle was naming one of the latest and bloodiest of the war we were doing our best when there came a shell and scattered halfadozen of us pretty lively i was knocked flat but i didnt feel hurt only mad and jumped up to hit em agin but just dropped with an awful wrench and the feeling that both my legs was gone  did no one stop to help you cried rose  too busy for that miss the boys cant stop to pick up their mates when there are rebs ahead to be knocked down i knew there was no more fighting for me and just laid still with the balls singing round me and wondering where theyd hit next  how did you feel questioned the girl eagerly  dreadful busy at first for every thing id ever said seen or done seemed to go spinning through my head till i got so dizzy trying to keep my wits stiddy that i lost em altogether i didnt find em again till some one laid hold of me two of our boys were luggin me along back but they had to dodge behind walls and cut up and down for the scrimmage was going on all round us one of the fellers was hit in the shoulder and the other in the face but not bad and they managed to get me into a sort of a ravine out of danger there i begged em to leave me i thought i was bleeding to death rapid and just wanted to die in peace  but they didnt leave you and roses face was all alive with interest now  guess they didnt answered the man giving a stroke or two and looking as if he found it pleasant to tell his story to so winsome a listener just as they were at their wits end what to do with me we come upon a young surgeon lurking there to watch the fight or to hidedont know which there he was any way looking scared half to death tom hunt my mate made him stop and look at me my leg was smashed and ought to come off right away he said do it then says tom he was one of your roughandreadys tom was but at heart as kind as awell as a woman  and the boatman gave a smile and a nod at the one opposite him  thanks but do tell on it is so interesting  and rose let all her flowers stray down into the bottom of the boat as she clasped her hands and leaned forward to listen  dont know as id better tell this part it aint pleasant began the man  you must i want it all dreadful things do me good and other peoples sufferings teach me how to bear my own said rose in her imperious way  you dont look as if you ought to have any  and the mans eyes rested on the delicate face opposite full of a pleasant blending of admiration pity and protection  i have but not like yours go on please  well if you say so here goes the surgeon was worried and said he couldnt do nothinghadnt got his instruments and so on yes you have out with em says tom rapping on a case he sees in the chaps breastpocket cant do it without bandages he says next here they are and more where they came from says tom and off came his shirtsleeves and was stripped up in a jiffy i must have help says that confounded surgeon dawdling round and me groaning my life out at his feet heres helplots of it says tom taking my head on his arm while parkes tied up his wounded face and stood ready to lend a hand seeing no way out of it the surgeon went to work good lord but that was awful  the mere memory of it made the speaker shut his eyes with a shiver as if he felt again the sharp agony of shattered bones rent flesh and pitiless knife  never mind that tell how you got comfortable again said milly shaking her head at rose  i wasnt comfortable for three months maam dont mind telling about it cause tom done so well and im proud of him said the rower with kindling eyes things of that sort are hard enough done well with chloroform and every thing handy but laying on the bare ground with nothing right and a scared boy of a surgeon hacking away at you its torment and no mistake i never could have stood it if it hadnt been for tom he held me close and as steady as a rock but he cried like a baby the whole time and that did me good dont know why but it did as for parkes he gave out at once and went off for help ill never forget that place if i live to be a hundred seems as if i could see the very grass i tore up the muddy brook they laid me by the steep bank with parkes creeping up toms face wet and white but so full of pity the surgeon with his red hands and all the while such a roar of guns i could hardly hear myself groaning for some one to shoot me and put me out of my misery  how did you get to the hospital asked uncle ben anxious to get over this part of the story for rose was now as pale as if she actually saw the scene described  dont know sir there come a time when i couldnt bear any more and what happened then ive never been very clear about i didnt know much for a day or two then i was brought round by being put in a transport i was packed with a lot of poor fellows and was beginning to wish id stayed queer till i heard toms voice saying never mind boys put me down anywheres and tend to the others i can wait that set me up i sung out and they stowed him alongside it was so dark down there i could hardly see his face but his voice and ways were just as hearty and comforting as ever and he kept up my spirits wonderful that day i was pretty weak and kept dozing off but whenever i woke i felt for tom and he was always there he told me when parkes came with help he saw me off and then went back for another go at the rebs but got a ball in the breast and was in rather a bad way he guessed he couldnt lay down but sat by me leaning back with his hand on my pillow where i could find it easy he talked to me all he could till his voice give out for he got very weak and there was a dreadful groaning all around us  i know i know i went aboard one of those transports to help but couldnt stay it was so terrible said uncle ben with a groan at the mere memory of it  that was a long day and i thought it was my last for when night came i felt so gone i reckoned i was most over jordan i gave my watch to tom as a keepsake and told him to say goodby to the boys for me i hadnt any folks of my own so it wasnt hard to go tom had a sweetheart an old mother and lots of friends but he didnt repine a wordonly said if you do pull through joel just tell mother i done my best and give hetty my love i promised and dropped asleep holding on to tom as if he was my sheetanchor so he was but i cant tell all he done for me in different ways  for a minute joel rowed in silence and no one asked a question then he pushed up his old hat again and went on as if anxious to be done  soons ever i woke next morning i looked round to thank tom for his blanket was over me he was sitting as i left him his hand on my pillow his face toward me so quiet and happylooking i couldnt believe he was gone but he was and i have had no mate since  where did he live asked rose as softly as if speaking of one she had known and loved  over yonder and joel pointed to a little brown house on the hillside  are his mother and hetty there  hetty married a number of years ago but the old lady is there  and you are visiting her  i live with her you see tom was all she had and when hetty left it was only natural that i tried to take toms place cant never fill it of course but i do what i can and shes comfortable  so she is the old mother who thinks so much of you well she may said rose giving him her brightest smile  yes shes all ive got now couldnt do no less could i seein how much tom done for me answered the man with a momentary quiver of emotion in his rough voice  youre a trump said uncle ben emphatically  thanky sir starboard if you please i dont care to get into the rapids just here  joel seemed to dislike telling this part of the story but the three listeners beamed upon him with such approving faces that he took to his oars in selfdefence rowing with all his might till the roar of the fall was faintly heard  now where shall i land you sir  let us lunch on the island proposed rose  i see a tent and fancy some one is camping there said milly  a lot of young fellows have been there this three days said joel  then we will go on and take to the grove above the fall ordered uncle ben  alas alas for rose that decision delayed her happiness a whole half day for on that island luxuriously reading the lotus eaters as he lay in the long grass was the gabriel this modern evangeline was waiting for she never dreamed he was so near and the brownbearded student never lifted up his head as the boat floated by carrying the lady of his love  i want to give him more than his fare so i shall slip my cigarcase into the pocket of this coat whispered uncle ben as joel was busy drawing up the boat and getting a stone or two to facilitate the ladies landing dryshod  i shall leave my book for him he was poring over an old newspaper as if hungry for reading the dash and daring of john brent will charm him and the sketch of winthrops life in the beginning will add to its value i know and hastily scribbling his name in it rose slipped the book under the coat  but milly seeing how old that coat was guessed that joel gave his earnings to the old woman to whom he dutifully played a sons part writing on a card for toms mother and mate she folded a fivedollar bill round it fastened it with a little pearl cross from her own throat and laid it in the book  then all landed and with a cordial handshake and many thanks left joel to row away quite unconscious that he was a hero in the pretty girls eyes till he found the tokens of his passengers regard and respect  now that is an adventure after my own heart said rose as they rustled along the grassy path toward the misty cloud that hung over the fall  we have nothing but sandwiches and sherry for lunch unless we find a house and add to our stores said uncle ben beginning to feel hungry and wondering how far his provisions would go  there is a little girl picking berries call her and buy some suggested milly who had her doubts about the state of the sandwiches as the knapsack had been sat upon  a shout from uncle ben caused the little girl to approachtimidly at first but being joined by a boy her courage rose and when the idea of a trade was impressed upon their minds fear was forgotten and the yankee appeared  how much a quart  eight cents sir  but that birchbark thing is not full  now it is and the barefooted towheaded lad filled the girls pannier from his own  heres chivalry for you said rose watching the children with interest for the girl was pretty and the boy evidently not her brother  you dont pick as fast as she does said milly while uncle ben hunted up the money  hes done his stent and was helpin me ill have to pick a lot before i git my quarter said the girl defending her friend in spite of her bashfulness  must you each make a quarter  yesm we dont have to but we wanter so we can go to the circus thats comin tomorrer he made hisn ketchin trout so hes helpin me explained the girl  where do you get your trout asked uncle ben sniffing the air as if he already smelt them cooking  in the brook i aint sold mine yet want to buy em six big ones for a quarter said the boy seeing hunger in the good mans eye and many greenbacks in the corpulent purse  yes if youll clean them  but uncle we cant cook them began milly  i can let an old campaigner alone for getting up a gipsy lunch you wanted a surprise so ill give you one now billy bring on your fish  my name is daniel webster butterfield brown returned the boy with dignity adding with a comical change of tone them fish is cleaned or youd a got em cheaper  very well hand them over  off ran the boy to the brook and the girl was shyly following when rose said  will you sell me that pretty bark pannier of yours i want one for my flowers  nom i guess id ruther not  ill give you a quarter for it then you can go to the circus without working any more  dan made this for me real careful and i couldnt sell it no way he wouldnt go without me and ill pick stiddy all day and git my money see if i dont answered the child hugging her treasure close  heres your romance in the bud said uncle ben trying not to laugh  its beautiful said rose with energy what is your name dear  gusty medders pleasem  dan isnt your brother  nom he lives to the poorhouse but hes real smart and we play together and him and me is going to the show he always takes care o me and my mother thinks a sight of him and so do i returned the child in a burst of confidence  happy little gusty said rose to herself  thrice happy dan added uncle ben producing the fat pocketbook again with the evident intention of bestowing a fortune on the small couple  dont spoil the pretty little romance dont rob it of its selfsacrifice and simplicity let them earn their money then they will enjoy it more cried milly holding his hand  uncle ben submitted and paid dan his price without adding a penny  the lady wanted to buy my basket but i didnt sell it danny cause you give it as a keepsake they heard gusty say as the children turned away  good for you gus but ill sell mine and back came dan to dispose of his for the desired quarter now were fixed complete and you neednt pick a darned berry weve got fifty cents for the show and eight over for peanuts and candy wont we have a good time though  with which joyful remark dan turned a somersault and then the little pair vanished in the wood with shining faces to revel in visions of the splendors to come  now you have got your elephant what are you going to do with him asked rose as they went on againshe with her pretty basket of fruit and he with a string of fish wrapped in leaves  come on a bit and you will see  uncle ben led them to the shade of a great maple on a green slope in sight of the noisy fall leaping from rock to rock till the stream went singing away through wide green meadows below  now rest and cool yourselves while i cook the dinner and away bustled the good man on hospitable thoughts intent  plenty of dry driftwood lay about the watercourse and soon a brisk fire burned on the rocks not far away shingles for plates with pointed sticks for forks seemed quite in keeping with the rustic feast and when the edibles were set forth on leaves the girls were charmed and praised the trout as it came hot from the coals till even the flushed cook was satisfied  id like to live so always it is so interesting to pick up your food as you go and eat it when and where you like i think i could be quite happy leading a wild life like this said rose as she lay in the grass dropping berries one by one into her mouth  you would soon tire of it miss caprice but if it amuses for a single day i am satisfied answered milly with her motherly smile as she stroked the bright head in her lap feeling sure that happiness was in store for so much youth and beauty  lulled by the soft caress and the song of the waterfall rose fell asleep and for an hour dreamed blissfully while the maple dropped its shadows on her placid face and all the wholesome influences of the place worked their healing spell on soul and body  a thundershower is rolling up in the west my dears we must be getting toward some shelter unless we are to take a drenching as part of the days pleasure said uncle ben rising briskly after his own nap  i see no house anywhere but a big barn down in the intervale and a crowd of people getting in their hay let us make for that and lie on the sweet haycocks till the shower comes proposed milly  as they went down the steep path rose began to sing and at the unwonted sound her uncle and friend exchanged glances of satisfaction for not a note had she sung for weeks a happy mood seemed to have taken possession of her and when they reached the intervale she won the old farmers heart by catching up a rake and working stoutly till the first heavy drops began to fall then she rode up to the barn on a fragrant load and was so charmed with the place that she declined his invitation to come up and see the old woman and set a spell and declared that she depended on enjoying the thunderstorm where she was  the farmer and his men went their way and rose was just settling herself at the upper window where the hay had been pitched in when a long line of gay red vans came rattling down the road followed by carriages and gilded cars elephants and camels fine horses and frisky ponies all more or less excited by the coming storm  its the circus how i wish gusty and dan could see it cried rose clapping her hands like a child i do believe they are coming here now that will be charming and the best adventure of all she added as a carriage and several vans turned into the grassy road leading to the barn  a pair of elephants slowly lumbered after with a camel or two and the finest gilded car the rest rattled on hoping to reach the town in time in a moment the quiet country scene was changed and the big barn transformed into a theatrical babel  our party retreated to a loft and sat looking down on the show enjoying it heartily especially rose who felt as if suddenly translated into an eastern tale the storm came on dark and wild rain poured thunder rolled and lightning gave lurid glimpses of the strange surroundings  the elephants placidly ate hay the tired camels lay down with gusty sighs and queer groanings but the lion in his lonely van roared royally at intervals and the tigers snarled and tore about their cage like restless demons  the great golden car lit up the gloom and in it sat or lay the occupants of the carriagea big dark man and a little blonde creature with a pretty tired painted face rose soon found herself curiously attracted to this pair for they were evidently lovers and there was a certain frank melodramatic air about them that took her fancy the dark man lay on the red cushion smoking tranquilly while the girl hovered about him with all manner of small attentions presently he seemed to drop asleep undisturbed by the thunder without or the clamor within then the small creature smoothed her gay yet shabby dress and braided up her hair as composedly as if in her own room that done she looked about her for amusement and spying roses interested face peering down at her from above she nodded and called out in a saucy voice  how do you like us shall i come up and make you a visit  i beg you will answered rose in spite of a warning touch from milly  up sprang the little circusrider and disdaining the ladder skipped to the gilded dome of the car and then took a daring leap on to the loft landing near them with a laugh  for a minute she eyed the others with a curious mixture of coolness and hesitation as if it suddenly struck her that they were not country girls to be dazzled by her audacity milly saw and understood the pause liked the girl for it and said as courteously as if to a lady in her own parlor  there is plenty of room for us all pray sit down and enjoy this fine view with us the storm is passing over now and it will soon be fair  thank you said the girl dropping on to the hay with her bold bright eyes full of admiration fixed on rose who smiled and said quickly  you belong to the troop i suppose  first lady rider replied the girl with a toss of the head  it must be very romantic to lead such a life and go driving from place to place in this way  its a hard life any way and not much romance youd better believe  not even for you and rose glanced at the sleeper below  the girl smiled her bold eyes turned to him with a softened look and the natural color deepened on her painted cheeks as she said in a lower voice  yes joe does make a difference for me weve only been married three weeks  what does he do  hes the liontamer and the girl gave them a glance of wifely pride in her husbands prowess  oh tell me about it cried rose i admire courage so much  you ought to see him do daniel in the lions den then or his great tiger act where he piles four of em up and lays on top its just splendid  but very dangerous does he never fear them and do they never hurt him  he dont fear any thing in the world said the girl entirely forgetting herself in enthusiastic praise of her husband  cæsar the lion loves him like a dog and joe trusts him as he does me but them tigers are deceitful beasts and cant be trusted a minute judas went at joe once and half killed him he seems tame enough now but i hate him for they say that if a tiger once tastes a mans blood hes sure to kill him sooner or later so i dont have a minutes peace when joe is in that cage and the little woman shivered with very genuine anxiety at the thought of her husbands danger  and knowing this he runs the risk every day what a life said uncle ben looking down at the unconscious joe  a brave life uncle and full of excitement the minutes in that cage must be splendid i wish i could see him once cried rose with the restless look in her eyes again  hed do it if he had his things here hell do any thing i ask him said the girl evidently proud of her power over the liontamer  we will come and see him tomorrow cant you tell us how he manages to subdue these wild animals i always wanted to know about it said rose wondering if she could not get some hints for the taming of men  joell tell you and calling from her perch the girl waked the sleeper and ordered him up to amuse the gentlefolk  the big man came with comical meekness and lounging on the hay readily answered the questions showered upon him rose enjoyed that hour intensely for the tales joe told were full of wild adventure hairbreadth escapes and feats of strength or skill that kept his listeners half breathless with interest the presence of the little wife gave an added charm to these stories for it was evident that the tamer of lions was completely subdued by the small woman his brown scarred face softened as it turned to her while he talked the strong hands that clutched lions by the throat were softly stroking the blonde head at his side and when he told of the fierce struggle with judas he grew so eloquent over the account of kittys nursing him that it was plain to see he was prouder of the conquest of her girls heart than of his hardwon victory over the treacherous tiger  the mans courage lent romance to his vulgar life and his love ennobled his whole nature for a time kitty ate peanuts while he thrilled his hearers with his feats but her face was so full of pride and affection all the while that no one minded what she did and even milly forgave the painted cheeks and cotton velvet dress for the sake of the womanly heart underneath  the storm passed the circus people bestirred themselves and in a few minutes were on their way again joe and kitty said goodby as heartily as if that halfhour had made them friends and packing themselves into the little carriage drawn by the calico tandem dashed away as gayly as if their queer honeymoon journey had just begun like parts of a stage pageant the gilded car the elephants and camels frisky ponies and gay red vans vanished along the winding road leaving the old barn to silence and the scandalized swallows twittering among the rafters  i feel as if id been to an arabian nights entertainment said rose as they descended and turned toward home  it was very interesting and i do hope that brave joe wont get eaten up by the tigers what would poor kitty do returned milly warmly  it would be sad and dreadful but she would have the comfort of knowing how much he loved her some women dont even have that added rose under her breath  a capital fellow and a nice little woman well go and see them tomorrow though i fancy i shall not like mrs kitty half so well in gauze and spangles jumping through hoops and over banners on horseback as i did on the hayloft and i shall be desperately anxious till joe is safely out of the tigers cage said uncle ben who had been as interested as a boy in the wild tales told them  for an hour they walked back along the riverside enjoying the wood odors brought out by the shower the glories of the sunset sky and the lovely rainbow that arched overheada bow of promise to those who seemed passing under it from the old life to a new one full of tender promise  i see a nice old woman in that kitchen and i want to stop and ask for some new milk perhaps she will give us our supper and then we can go on by moonlight said rose as they came to a weatherbeaten farmhouse standing under an ancient elm with its door hospitably open and a grandmotherly figure going to and fro within  roses request was most graciously received for the old woman seemed to regard them as most welcome cheerers of her solitude and bustled about with an infectious cordiality that set them at their ease directly  do tell caught in the shower it come so suddin i mistrusted some folks would get a duckin you kin hev supper jest as wal as not taint a mite o trouble ef you dont mind plain vittles enos and me lives alone and he aint no gret of an eater but i allers catleate to hev a good store of pervision on hand this time a year theres such a sight of strangers round the mountains the tables all set and ill jest add a pinch of tea and a couple of pies and there we be now draw right up and do the best you kin  the cheery old soul was so hospitable that her presence gave a grace to her homely table and added flavor to her plain fare uncle bens eyes twinkled when he saw dainty rose eating brownbread and milk out of a yellow bowl with the appetite of a dairymaid and milly rejoiced over the happy face opposite wishing that it might always wear that selfforgetful look  enos was a feeble bedridden old man who lay in a small room opening from the kitchen a fretful invalid he seemed to be hard to suit and much given to complaint but the tender old wife never lost patience with him and it was beautiful to see how cheerfully she trotted to and fro trying to gratify every whim without a reproachful word or thought of weariness  after tea as rose wanted to wait till moonrise uncle ben went in to chat with the invalid while milly insisted on wiping the cups for the old lady and rose sat on the doorstep listening to their chat and watching twilight steal softly up the valley presently her attention was fixed by something the old lady said in answer to millys praises of the quaint kitchen  yes dear ive lived here all my days was born in that bedroom and dont ask no better than to die there when my time comes  most people are not fortunate enough to keep their old home when they marry it must be very dear to you having spent both your maiden and married life here said milly interested in her hostess  wal you see my maiden life lasted sixty year and my married life aint but jest begun answered the old lady with a laugh as gay as a girls  seeing curiosity in the quick glance rose involuntarily gave her the chatty old soul went on as if gossip was dear to her heart and her latecoming happiness still so new that she loved to tell it  i spose that sounds singlar to you young things but you see though me and enos was engaged at twenty or so we warnt married till two year ago things was dreadful contry and we kep a waitin and a waitin till i declare fort i really did think i should die an old maid and she laughed again as if her escape was the best joke in the world  and you waited forty years cried rose with her great eyes full of wonder  yes dear i had other chances but somehow they didnt none of them suit and the more unfortnate enos was the more i kinder held on to him he was one of them thats allers tryin new things and didnt never seem to make a fortin out of any on em he kept a tryin because he had nothin and wouldnt marry till he was wal off my mother was dead and left a family to

enoss luck would turn but it didnt them cups goes in the righthand corner dear and so i waited and waited and hoped and hoped  oh how could you sighed rose from the soft gloom of the doorway  pears to me strength is give us most wonderful to bear trials if we take em meek i used to think i couldnt bear it no way when i was left here alone while enos was in californy and i didnt know for seven year whether he was dead or alive his folks give him up but i never did and kept on hopin and prayin for him till he come back  how happy you were then cried rose as if she could sympathize heartily with that joy  no i warnt dear that was the hardest part ont for enos was married to a poor shiftless thing that was a burden to him for ten year  that was hard and rose gave a groan as if a new trouble had suddenly come upon her  i done my best for em in their ups and downs till they went west then i settled down to end my days here alone my folks was all dead or fur away and it was uncommon lonesome but i kinder clung to the old place and had it borne in upon me strong that enos would turn up agin in time i wanted him to find me here ready to give him a helpin hand whenever and however he come  and he did at last asked rose with a sympathetic quiver in her voice that went to the old womans heart  yes my deary he did come at last she said in a voice full of a satisfaction that was almost solemn in its intensity ruther morn two years ago he knocked at that door a poor brokendown old man without wife or child or money or homenothin in the wide world but me he didnt think id take him in he was so misable but lord love him what else had i been a waitin for them forty year it warnt the enos that i loved fust but that didnt matter one mite and when he sat sobbin in that chair and sayin he had no friend but me why i just answered back my home is yourn enos and i give it jest as hearty as i did when you fust pupposed under the laylock bushes in the back gardin rest here my poor dear and let becky take care on you till she dies  so he stayed said milly with tears in her voice for roses head was down on her knees so eloquent had been the pathos of that old voice telling its little tale of faithful love  certin and we was married so no one need make no talk folks said it was a dreadful poor match and took on about my doin ont for im wal off and enos hadnt a cent but we was satisfied and i aint never repented of that days work for he took to his bed soon after and wont quit it the doctor says till hes took to his grave  you dear soul i must kiss you for that lovely deed of yours and thank you from my heart for this lesson in fidelity and obeying an irresistible impulse rose threw her arms round the old ladys neck kissing the wrinkled cheek with real reverence and tenderness  sakes alive wal i never did see sech a softhearted little creter why child what i done warnt nothin but a pleasure we women are such queer things we dont care how long we wait ef we only hev our way at last  as she spoke the old woman hugged the blooming girl with a motherly warmth most sweet and comfortable to see yet the longing look the lingering touch betrayed how much the tender old heart would have loved to pillow there a child of its own  just then uncle ben appeared and the early moon peeped over the mountaintop plainly hinting that it was time for the wanderers to turn homeward bidding their hospitable hostess good night they came again into the woody road now haunted with soft shadows and silvery with falling dew the brown brooks were singing lullabies the pines whispering musically in the wind the mellow moonlight was falling everywhere and the world was full of the magical beauty of a midsummers night  go on please and let me follow alone i want to think over my pleasant day and finish it with waking dreams as i go through this enchanted wood said rose whose mind was full of sweet yet sober thoughts for she had gathered herbs of grace while carelessly pulling wayside flowers and from the simple adventures of the day had unconsciously received lessons that never were forgotten  the other walked on and the girl followed living over again the happy winter during which she had learned to know and love the young neighbor who had become the hero of her dreams she had felt sure he loved her though the modest youth had never told her so except with eloquent glances and tender devotion she believed in him loved him truly and waited with maidenly patience to hear the words that would unseal her lips they did not come and he had left her with no hope but such as she could find in the lingering pressure of his hand and the warmly uttered i shall see you again  since then no line no word and all through the lovely spring she had looked and waited for the brownbearded studentlooked and waited in vain then unrest took possession of her anxiety tormented her and despair made her young face pathetic only the sad simple old story but as bitter to live through now as in poor didos day more bitter perhaps because we cannot erect funeral pyres and consume the body with a flame less fierce than that which burns away the soul unseen  now in the silence of that summer night a blessed peace seemed to fall on the girls unquiet heart as she trod thoughtfully along the shadowy road courage and patience seemed to spring up within her to wait and hope and love without return became a possibility and though a few hot tears rolled down the cheeks that had lost their roses the eyes that shed them were more tender for the tears and the heart that echoed the old wifes wordsstrength is given us to bear our trials if we take them meeklywas worthier of lifes best blessing love because of its submission  as she paused a moment to wipe away the telltale drops before she joined the others the sound of faroff music came on the wings of the winda mans voice singing one of the lovelays that are never old as if spellbound rose stood motionless in the broad streak of light that fell athwart the road she knew the voice the sweet old song seemed answering her prayer and now it needed no golden butterfly to guide her to her lover  nearer and nearer came the singer pouring out his lay as if his heart was in it brighter and brighter glowed the human rose as the featherless nightingale told his tale in music unconsciously approaching the happy sequel with each step  out from the gloom he came at last saw her waiting for him in the light seemed to read the glad truth in her face and stretched both hands to her without a word she took them and what followed who shall say for the moon best friend of lovers discreetly slipped behind a cloud and the pines whispered their congratulations as they wrapped the twain in deepest shadow  when half an hour later they joined the other pair who strange to say had quite forgotten their charge uncle ben exclaimed as he welcomed the newcomer with unusual cordiality why rose you look quite glorified in this light and as well as ever we must try this cure again  no need sir i have done with the heartache and here is my physician answered rose with a look at her lover which told the story better than the best chosen words  and here is mine echoed milly leaning on uncle bens arm as if it belonged to her as it did for the moonlight had been too much for the old bachelor and in spite of his fifty years he had wooed and won milly as ardently as any boy so the lonely future she had accepted so cheerfully suddenly bloomed with happy hopes and the older couple looked as blissfully content as the young pair who greeted with the blithest laughter that ever woke the echoes of the wood this fit ending to the romance of a summer day     my rococo watch   all three of us were inspired with an intense desire to possess one of these quaint watches the moment we saw one hanging at the side of a certain lovely woman at a party where it created a great sensation  imitations we would not have and the genuine article could not be found even in geneva the paradise of timepieces my sisters soon ceased to pine for the impossible and contented themselves with other antique gauds fan rejoiced in a very ugly cinquecento ring like a tiny coffin and mary was the proud possessor of a roman necklace composed of gods and goddesses  i however remained true to my first love and refused to be satisfied with any thing but a veritable rococo watch for that i maintained united the useful and the beautiful resisting the temptations of rome paris and geneva i skilfully lured my unsuspecting party into all sorts of outoftheway places under pretence of studying up the old french cathedrals  the girls did the churches faithfully but i shirked them and spent my shining hours poking about dirty streets and staring in at the windows of ancient jewelry shops patiently seeking for the watch of my dreams i was rallied unmercifully upon my mania and many jokes were played upon me by the frolicksome girls who more than once sent me posting off by reports of some remarkable trinket in some almost unattainable place  but nothing daunted i continued my vain search all through france and never relinquished my hope till we left st malo on our way to brest whence we were to sail for home then i despaired and having nothing more to toil for began to enjoy myself with a free mind and then it was that capricious fortune chose to smile upon me and reward my long quest  finding that we had a day before us we explored the queer old town and as our tastes varied each went a different way i roamed about the narrow streets seeking some odd souvenir to carry away and was peering into a dark lane attracted by some fine shells when suddenly i was arrested by a sight which caused me to pause in the middle of a puddle exclaiming dramatically at last at last  yes there in the dusty window of a pawnbrokers shop hung the most enchanting watch crystal ball silver chains enamelled medallions and cluster of charms all encrusted with pearls garnets and turquoises set in the genuine antique style one long gaze one rapturous exclamation and i skipped from the puddle to the doorstep bent on securing the prize at all costs  bouncing in upon a withered little man who was taking coffee in a shadowy recess i demanded the price of the watch of course the little man was on the alert at once and began by protesting that it was not for sale but i saw the fib in his eye and sweetly insisted that i must have it then he improvised a mournful tale about a family of rank reduced by misfortune and forced to dispose of their cherished relics in some private manner i affected to believe the touching romance and offered a handsome sum for the watch which on closer inspection struck me as rather more antique than even i desired  instantly the little man clasped his hands and protested that it was an insult to propose such a paltry price for so beautiful and perfect a treasure double the sum might be a temptation but not a sou less  this was so absurd that i tried to haggle a little but i never succeeded in that line so my attempt ended in both of us getting angry when the little man tore the watch from my hands and i left the shop as precipitately as i entered it  retiring to the square to cool my indignation i was reposing on a bench when i beheld the little man approaching with the blandest expression and bowing profoundly he resumed the subject as if we had parted amicably  if madame would allow him to consult the owner of this so charming watch the affair might yet be arranged in a satisfactory manner if madame would leave her address he would report to her in a few hours and have the happiness of obliging the dear lady  i consented but preferred to return to his shop later in the day for i wished to astonish the girls by producing my prize at some opportune moment and i much feared if i told them of my discovery that the bargain would never be made  i suffered agonies of suspense for hours but basely attributed my restlessness to the heat and weariness five oclock and dinner but i declined going down and slipped away to my tryst with the little old man he was ready for me with another romance of the noble owners reluctance to part with an heirloom for less than the price he had named in vain i talked wheedled and protested the crafty little man saw that i meant to have that watch and was firm at last i pretended to give it up and thanking him for his trouble retired mournfully hoping he would follow me again for i had told him that i should leave in the steamer expected next day  but the evening passed and no little man appeared although i sat on the balcony till the moon rose morning came and with it the steamer but still no watch arrived as other coveted articles had often done when we firmly refused to be imposed upon  my secret agitation increased and my temptation waxed stronger and stronger as the hour of departure approached the girls thought me nervous about the voyage but were too busy to heed my preoccupation while i was too much ashamed of my infatuation to confess it and ask advice  fifteen minutes before we started for the wharf i gave in and muttering something about looking up the carriage i flew round the corner demanded the watch paid an abominable price for it and sneaked back knowing i had been cheated by the sly old fellow who had evidently expected me and whom i left chuckling over his bargain as well he might the rascal  the moment the deed was done my spirits returned and i beamed upon my sisters as benignly as if i carried a boundless supply of good humor in my pocket instead of that costly watch packed up in a shabby little box  we sailed and for several days i forgot every thing but my own woe then came a calm and then choosing a moment when the girls were comparing their treasures with those of other returning voyagers i proudly produced my watch the effect was superb cries of admiration greeted it from all but my sisters who looked at one another in comic dismay and burst into fits of laughter  we saw it and tried to get it but it cost so much we gave it up and never told lest penelope should be tempted beyond her strength we might have spared our pains for it was to be and it is vain to fight against fate only do tell us if you paid that shylock what he asked us said mary naming a smaller sum than my first handsome offer  i did not pay that and i shall never tell what it cost for you wouldnt believe me if i did it was a good bargain i assure youfor shylock i added to myself and kept my secret jealously knowing i never should hear the last of it if the awful truth was known  my treasure was so much admired that i was afraid it would be ravished from me and i hid it in all sorts of places like a magpie with a stolen spoon i never went on deck without taking it with me for safe keeping i never woke in the morning without burrowing under my mattress to see if it was safe and never turned in for the night without seeing that i was prepared for shipwreck by having my lifepreserver handy and halfadozen ship biscuits a bottle of water and the precious box lashed firmly together for with that dearly bought watch i was resolved to sink or swim live or die  being permitted to reach land in safety i prepared to eclipse fans ring and marys necklace with my rich and rare rococo watch but i found it impossible to set it going though i tried all the keys in the house so i took it to an experienced watchmaker and left it to be regulated every one knows what that means and can imagine my impatience as week after week went by and still that blessed thing was not done it came at last however and with it a bill that startled me but i could not dispute it for the job was a difficult one owing to the antiquity of the works and the skill required to set a watch going that probably had not been wound up for half a century  it went for a week and then stopped for ever for the general verdict was that no modern tinkering would restore its tone since the springs of life were broken and the venerable wheels at a dead lock  well it is ornamental if not useful only i am sorry i gave away my good old watch thinking this would be all i needed i said making the best of what i alone knew to be a desperately bad bargain  so i hung the silent thing to my girdle and went forth to awaken the envy and admiration of all beholders but alas the second time i wore it one of the medallions was lost could not be found and its place had to be filled with a modern one entirely out of keeping with the others bill the second was paid with much lamentation and again i tried to enjoy my watch but the fates seemed to be against me for presently it was stolen by a maid who admired mediæval jewelry as well as her mistress  what a state of excitement we were in then to be sure cousin dick took the matter in hand and searched for the lost watch with the patience if not the skill of a detective mysterious men came to examine the servants dreadful questions as to its value were put to me and worst of all i knew that this sort of hideandgoseek was a fearfully expensive game and of course i wasnt going to let dick pay for it  it was found at last and restored to me somewhat the worse for the rough handling of curious admirers bill the third was paid with the calmness of despair for i really began to think some evil spell was hidden in that crystal ball a spell which attracted then infatuated and now controlled me leading me slowly and surely through tribulation after tribulation to the poorhouse in the end  the accidents that befell that fatal watch would fill a chapter and the narrow escapes it had would make a thrilling tale babies half choked themselves with the charms little tommy was discovered trying to divest it of all incumbrances that he might use it as a jolly big marble it was always falling off catching in buttons or bobbing wildly about when i danced and more than once i was cut to the soul by hearing benighted people wonder at miss pens bad taste in wearing salom jewelry salom be it known to the ignorant is an excellent man who deals in mock ornaments of great brilliancy and cheapness  soon the jewels began to fall out and i scattered pearls about me like the young lady in the fairy tale then the chain broke and the charms were lost in one of the many falls the crystal got cracked the silver tarnished till it looked like dingy lead and at last no beauty remained to reconcile me to its utter uselessness my poor watch was the standing joke of the family and kept every one merry but its owner to me it was a disgrace and i suffered endless disappointments and delays by having no trusty timekeeper at hand pride prevented my applying to others and bitterly i mourned in secret for the true old friend i had deserted when the false new one came  i ceased to wear the hollow mockery and hoped people would forget it but the girls still displayed their more successful ornaments and i was forced to tell the sad tale of my mortifying failure in reply to the natural question  and what charming old trinket did pen get  but this was not the worst of it like little rosamond in the moral tale i had to wear my old shoes when the purple jar proved a delusion and a snare i had overrun my allowance by that rash purchase and had to economize just when i most wished to be fine beauty unadorned and that sort of thing is all nonsense when a woman burns to look her loveliest in the eyes of certain persons and the anguish i endured when i looked at that rubbishy old watch and thought what sweet things could have been bought with the money recklessly lavished upon it can better be imagined than described  fain would i have sold my treasure for a quarter what i gave for it but who would buy the ruined relic now and the mere idea of having it even partially repaired made my blood run cold so i laid it away as a warning example of womans folly and began to save up that i might replace it by a modern watch with all the improvements procurable for money  i was effectually cured of my passion for antiquities and hated the sound of the word rococo nothing could be too new for me now and i privately studied up on watches being bound never to buy another which though it might last to all eternity yet had no connection with time  slowly the memory of that temptation and fall seemed to fade from all minds but my own slowly my little hoard increased at the expense of many an ungratified whim inviting bargain or girlish vanity and slowly i decided what sort of watch would most entirely combine the solid virtues and modest graces i desired to possess in the new one i intended to choose so wisely and well  but just as my hundred dollars was nearly completed i discovered that dicks younger brother geordie had got himself into a boyish scrape and was planning to run away to sea as the best means of settling the difficulty i was immediately possessed with an intense desire to help the poor lad and having won his confidence in a desponding moment i offered my little hoard as a loan to be paid in time if he would accept it on no other condition  i really dont think i could have done it for any one but dicks brother and i did not desire any praise for it since i made the boy take a solemn vow that it should be a secret between us for ever it was reward enough to know that i had spared dear dick another care and done something to be more worthy of him though it was only a little sacrifice like this  so geordie was a free man again and my devoted slave from that day forth causing much merry wonderment in the family and actually making dick jealous by his grateful gallantry  my sacrifice cost me something more than the loss of my watch however for with a part of the money i had planned to get a fine christmas gift for some one and now i was obliged to content myself with such a poor little offering that the girls called me mean and nearly broke my heart by insisting that i did not care for somebody who cared a great deal for me i bore it all and kept geordies secret faithfully but i will confess that in a paroxysm of anger with myself i clashed that hateful rococo watch upon the floor and trampled on it as the only adequate vent for the conflicting emotions which possessed me  but the good fairies who fly about at christmas time set every thing right and broke the evil spell cast over me by the breton magician in his gloomy cell as we sat about the breakfasttable talking over our gifts on the morning of that happy day dick and geordie came in to see how we were after the fatigues of a grand family frolic the night before  heres a new conundrum guess it girls said geordie who had the dundreary fever upon him just at that time i was sent to india and stopped there i came back because i did not go there now what was it  we puzzled over it but gave it up at last and when geordie answered a watch there was a general laugh for since my ruinous speculation that word always produced a sensation among us  the place mentioned should have been brittany not india hey pen said dick with a wicked twinkle of the eye  dont i began pathetically as the girls giggled and mary added with mock sympathy hush boys and let that sacred sorrow be for ever hidden in pens own breast  watch and pray dear watch and pray for im sure you have need of both cried fan seeing my rising wrath  put your hands before your face but dont strike i beg of you cut in geordie trying to be witty  it is a sad case but i think i have a key that will wind up the affair and set all going right began dick still twinkling with fun  to have him join the enemy was too much for me because he had always been very careful to avoid that tender point  if you say another word ill throw the horrid thing into the fire for im sick to death of hearing bad jokes made on it i cried feeling a strong desire to shake them all round  no doubt give it to me and you shall never see or hear of it again i like old trinkets and ill never tell the story of that one on my honor as a gentleman said dick in a tone that appeased my wrath at once  do you really want it i asked pleased and surprised yet still a little suspicious of some new joke  i do because although it will never go again it will always remind me of some of the happiest hours and minutes of my life pen  there was no fun in dicks eyes as he said that and i was glad to hide the sudden color in my cheeks by running away to get the poor old watch but i found there was a surprise and a very pleasant one in store for me for as i thrust the shabby box into dicks pocket he handed me a little parcel prettily tied up with white ribbons saying in his most captivating way fair exchange is no robbery you know so you must take this and then we shall be square  it looks like wedding cake i said surveying it with curiosity and wondering why geordie and the girls did not stop to see the mystery unfolded  no that comes later dear answered dick in a tone that made me devote myself to the white ribbons with sudden zeal  a blue velvet case appeared and i could not resist saying in a voice more tender than reproachful you extravagant man i know it is something costly and beautiful in return for the disgracefully mean gift i gave you  bless your innocent heart did you think you could hide any thing from me geordie couldnt keep a secret and im only paying his debt pen dear with the sort of interest women like dick answered with an audacious arm around my waist and a brown beard close to my cheek  as i did not refuse the offered interest he added in a softer tone my own debt i never can settle unless with all my worldly goods i thee endow my heart you have had for years say yes dear and be my little châtelaine  never mind what i said but i assure you if it had not been for dicks arm i should have gone under the table when a few minutes later i lifted the blue velvet lid and saw a dainty watch luxuriously lying on its white satin bed     by the river  a legend of the assabet     chapter i   in the shadow of the bridge a boy lay reading on the grassa slender lad broadbrowed and cleareyed barefooted and clad in homespun yet happy as a king for health sat on his sunburned cheeks a magic book lay open before him and sixteen years of innocence gave him a passport to the freshest pleasures life can offer  nat nat come here and see cried a shrill voice from among the alders by the riverside  but nat only shook his head as if a winged namesake had buzzed about his ears and still read on presently a twelveyears child came scrambling up the bank dragging a long rod behind her with a discontented air  i wish youd come and help me the fish wont bite and my line is in a grievous snarl dont read any more im tired of playing all alone  i forgot you ruthy and it was ill done of me sit here and rest while i undo the tangle and nat looked up goodnaturedly at the small figure before him with its quaint pinafore checked linen gown and buckled shoes for this little maid lived nearly a hundred years ago and this lad had seen washington face to face  now tell me a story while i wait not out of that stupid playbook you are always reading but about something that really happened with naughty children and nice folks in it and have it end good said ruth beginning a dandelion chain for surely it is safe to believe that our honored grandmothers enjoyed that pretty pastime in their childhood  nat lay in the grass dreamily regarding the small personage who ruled him like a queen and whom he served with the devotion of a loyal heart now the royal command was for a story and stifling a sigh this rustic gentleman closed the book whose magic had changed the spring morning to a midsummer nights dream for an hour and set himself to gratify the little damsels whim  you liked the last tale about the children who were lost shall i tell one about a child who was found it really happened and you never heard it before he asked  yes but first put your head in my lap for there are ants in the grass and i like to see your eyes shine when you spin stories tell away  once upon a time there was a great snowstorm began nat obediently pillowing his head on the blue pinafore  whereabouts demanded ruth  dont spoil the story by interrupting it was in this town and i can show you the very house im going to tell about  i like to know things straight along and not bounce into a snowstorm all in a minute ill be good go on  well it snowed so hard that people stayed indoors till the storm had beat and blown itself away right in the worst of it as a farmer and his wife sat by the fire that night they heard a cry at the door you see they were sitting very still the man smoking his pipe and the woman knitting both thinking sorrowfully of their only son who had just died  dont have it doleful nat briskly suggested ruth working busily while the narrators hands lay idle and his eyes looked as if they actually saw the little scene his fancy conjured up  no i wont only it really was like that apologized nat seeing that sentiment was not likely to suit his matteroffact auditor when the cry came a second time both of these people ran to the door no one was to be seen but on the wide step they saw a little mound not there an hour before brushing off the snow they found a basket and when they opened it there lay a little baby who put out its arms with a pitiful cry that went to their hearts the woman hugged it close fed it and hushed it to sleep as if it had been her own her husband let her do as she liked while he tried to find where it came from but no trace appeared and there was no name or mark on the poor things clothes  did they keep it asked ruth tickling nats nose with a curly dandelion stem to goad him on as he lay silent for a moment  yes they kept it for their hearts were sore and empty and the forlorn baby seemed to fill them comfortably the townsfolk gossiped awhile but soon forgot it and it grew up as if it had been born in the farmers house ive often wondered if it wasnt the soul of the little son who died come back in another shape to comfort those good people  now dont go wandering off nat but tell me if he was a pretty nice smart child said ruth with an eye to the heros future capabilities  not a bit pretty laughed nat for he grew up tall and thin with big eyes and a queer brow he wasnt nice either if you mean good for he got angry sometimes and was lazy but he triedoh yes he truly tried to be a dutiful lad he wasnt smart ruth for he hated to study and only loved story books ballads and plays and liked to wander round alone in the woods better than to be with other boys people laughed at him because of his queersome ways but he couldnt help ithe was born so and it would come out  he was what aunt becky calls shiftless i guess she says you are but i dont mind as long as you take care of me and tell me stories  the boy sighed and shook his head as if a whole swarm of gnats were annoying him now he was grateful anyhow this fellow im telling about for he loved the good folks and worked on the farm with all his might to pay them for their pity he never complained but he hated it for delving day after day in the dirt made him feel as if he was nothing but a worm  we are all worms deacon hurd says so the boy neednt have minded said ruth trying to assume a primly pious expression that sat very ill upon her blooming little face  but some worms can turn into butterflies if they get a chance so the boy did mind ruthy and nat looked out into the summer world with a longing glance which proved that he already felt conscious of the folded wings and was eager to try them  was he a godfearing boy asked ruth with a tweak of the ear for her friend showed signs of wandering off again into a world where her prosaic little mind could not follow him  he didnt fear god he loved him perhaps it was wrong but somehow he couldnt believe in a god of wrath when he saw how good and beautiful the world was and how kind folks were to him he felt as if the lord was his father for he had no other and when he was lonesomest that thought was right comfortable and helpful to him was it wrong asked nat of the child  im afraid aunt becky would think so shes awful pious and boxed my ears with a psalmbook last sabbath when i said i wished the lions would bite daniel in the den i was so tired of seeing them stare and roar at him she wouldnt let me look at the pictures in the big bible another minute and gave me a long hymn to learn shut up in the back bedroom shes a godly woman deacon hurd says but i think shes uncommon strict  shall i tell any more or are you tired of this stupid boy said nat modestly  yes you may as well finish but do have something happen make him grow a great man like whittington or some of the storybook folks its so nice to read about answered ruth rather impatiently  i hope he did something better than trade cats and be lord mayor of london but that part of the story hasnt come yet so ill tell you of two things that happened one sad and one merry when the boy was fourteen the good woman died and that nearly broke his heart for she had made things easy for him and he loved her dearly the farmer sent for his sister to keep house and then the boy found it harder than ever to bear his life for the sister was a notable woman wellmeaning but as strict as aunt becky and she pestered the lad as aunt pesters me you see ruthy it grew harder every year for him to work on the farm for he longed to be away somewhere quiet among books and learned folk he was not like those about him and grew more unlike all the time and people often said hes come of gentle blood thats plain to see he loved to think it was truenot because he wanted to be rich and fine but to find his own place and live the life the lord meant him to this feeling made him so unhappy that he was often tempted to run away and would have done it but for the gratitude that kept him  lackadaisy what a bad boy when he had good clothes and victuals and folks were clever to him but did he ever find his grand relations asked ruth curiosity getting the better of the reproof she thought it her duty to administer  i dont know yet but he did find something that made him happier and more contented listen now for youll like this part i know one night as he came home with the cows watching the pretty red in the sky hearing the crickets chirp and picking flowers along the way because he liked to have em in his room he felt uncommon lonesome and kept wishing hed meet a fairy whod give him all he wanted when he got to the house he thought the fairy had really come for there on the doorstone stood a little lass looking at him a right splendid little lass ruth with brown hair long upon her shoulders blue eyes full of smiles and a face like one of the pink roses in madam barretts garden  did she have good clothes demanded ruth eagerly for this part of the tale did interest her as nat foretold  let me see yes nice clothes but sadcolored for the ridingcloak that hung over her white dimity frock was black yet she stood on a pair of the trimmest feet ever seen wearing hose with fine clocks and silver buckles in the little shoes you may believe the boy stared well for he had never seen so pretty a sight in all his days and before he knew it he had given her his nosegay of sheepsbane fern and honeysuckle she took it looking pleased and made him as fine a courtesy as any lady whereat he turned red and foolish being shy and hurried off into the barn but she came skipping after and peeped at him as he milked watched how he did it for a bit and then said like a little queen boy get up and let me try that pleased him mightily so taking little madam on his knee he let her try but something went amiss for all at once brindle kicked over the pail away went the threelegged stool and both the milkers lay in the dirt  why nat why nat that was you and i cried ruth clapping her hands delightedly as this catastrophe confirmed the suspicions which had been growing in her mind since the appearance of the child  hush or ill never tell how they got up said nat hurrying on with a mirthful face the boy thought the little maid would cry over her bruised arm or go off in a pet at sight of the spoilt frock but no she only laughed patted old brindle and sat down saying stoutly i shall try again and do it right so she did and while she milked she told how she was an orphan and had come to be uncle dans girl all her life that was a pleasant hearing for the lad and he felt as if the fairy had done better by him than he had hoped they were friends at once and played cats cradle on the kitchen settle all the evening but when the child was put to bed in a strange room her little heart failed her and she fell asobbing for her mother nothing would comfort her till the boy went up and sang her to sleep with her pretty hand in his and all her tears quite gone that was nigh upon two years ago but from that night they were fast friends and happier times began for the boy because he had something to love and live for besides work she was very good to him and nowhere in all the world was there a dearer sweeter lass than nat snows little maid  during the latter part of this tale founded upon fact ruth had been hugging her playmates head in both her chubby arms and when he ended by drawing down the rosy face to kiss it softly on the lips it grew a very april countenance as she exclaimed with a childish burst of affection curiosity and wonder  dear nat how good you were to me that night and ever since did you really come in a basket and dont you know any thing about your folks good lack and to think you may turn out a lords son after all  how could i help being good to you dear yes ill show you the very basket if aunt becky has not burnt it up as rubbish i know nought about my folk and have no name but snow uncle dan gave me that because i came in the storm and the dear mother added nathaniel her own boys name since i was sent to take his place she said as for being a lords son id rather be a greater man than that  and nat rose up with sudden energy in his voice a sudden kindling of the eyes that pleased ruth and made her ask with firm faith in the possibility of his being any thing he chose  you mean a king  no a poet  but thats not fine at all and ruth looked much disappointed  it is the grandest thing in the world look now the man who wrote this play was a poet and though long dead he is still loved and honored when the kings and queens he told about would be forgotten but for him who cares for them with all their splendor who does not worship william shakespeare whose genius made him greater than the whole of them cried nat hugging the dingy book his face all aglow with the beautiful enthusiasm of a true believer  was master shakespeare rich and great asked ruth staring at him with round eyes  never rich or great in the way you mean or even famous till after he was dead  then id rather have you like major wild for he owns much land lives in a grand house and wears the finestlaced coat in all the town will you be like him please nat  no i wont answered the lad with emphatic brevity as the image of the redfaced roystering major passed before his minds eye  his bluntness ruffled his little sovereigns temper for a moment and she asked with a frown  what do you think aunt becky said yesterday when we found ever so many of your verses hidden in the clothespress where we went to put lavender among the linen  something sharp and burnt the papers ill warrant replied nat with the resignation of one used to such trials  no she kept em to cover jampots with and she said you were either a fool or a genus is a genus very bad nat added ruth relenting as she saw his dreamy eyes light up with what she fancied was a spark of anger  aunt becky thinks so but i dont and though i may not be one sooner or later folks shall see that im no fool for i feel i know i was not born to hoe corn and feed pigs all my life  what will you do cried ruth startled by the almost passionate energy with which he spoke  till im twentyone ill stay to do my duty when the time comes ill break away and try my own life for i shall have a right to do it then  and leave me nay ill not let you go and ruth threw her dandelion chain about his neck claiming her bondsman with the childish tyranny he found so sweet  he laughed and let her hold him seeing how frail the green links were little dreaming how true a symbol it was of the stronger tie by which she would hold him when the time came to choose between liberty and love  five years is a long time ruthy you will get tired of my odd ways and be glad to have me go but never fret about it for whatever happens ill not forget you  quite satisfied with this promise the little maid fell to sticking buttercups in the band of the straw hat her own nimble fingers had braided as if bent on securing one crown for her friend but nat leaning his head upon his hand sat watching the sunshine glitter on the placid stream that rippled at his feet with such intentness that ruth presently disturbed him by demanding curiously  what is it a kingfisher or a turtle  its the river dear it seems to sing to me as it goes by i always hear it yet i never understand what it says do you  ruth fixed her blue eyes on the bluer water listened for an instant then laughed out blithely and sprung up saying  it sings come and fish nat come and fish  the boys face fell the dreamy look faded and with a patient sort of sigh he rose and followed her leaving his broken dream with his beloved book among the buttercups but though he sat by ruth in the shadow of the alderbushes his rod hung idly from his hand for he was drawing bright fancies from a stream she never saw was dimly feeling that he had a harder knot to disentangle than his little friends and faintly hearing a higher call than hers in the ripple of the river     chapter ii   five years later ruth was in the dairy making up butter surrounded by tier above tier of shining pans whence proceeded a breath as fresh and fragrant as if the ghosts of departed kingcups and clover still haunted the spot standing before a window where morningglories rung their colored bells in the balmy air she was as pleasant a sight as any eye need wish to see upon a summers day for the merry child had bloomed into a sprightly girl rich in rustic health and beauty all practical virtues were hers and while they wore so comely a shape they possessed a grace that hid the lack of those finer attributes which give to womanhood its highest charm the present was all in all to ruth its homely duties were her world its petty griefs and joys her life and her ambition was bounded by her desire to show her mates the finest yarn the sweetest butter the gayest cardinal and the handsomest sweetheart in the town an essentially domestic character cheery as the blaze upon the hearth contented as the little kettle singing there and so affectionate discreet and diligent that she was the model damsel of the town the comfort of uncle daniels age the pride of aunt beckys heart the joy of nats life and the desire of his eyes  unlike as ever the pair were still fast friends nay more for the past year had been imperceptibly transforming that mild sentiment into a much warmer one by the magic of beauty youth and time year after year nat had patiently toiled on for gratitude controlled ambition and ruths presence made his life endurable but nature was stronger than duty or love and as the boy ripened into the man he looked wistfully beyond the narrow present into the great future which allures such as he with vague sweet prophecies hard to be resisted silently the struggle went on steadily the inborn longing strengthened and slowly the resolution was fixed to put his one gift to the test and learn if it was a vain delusion or a lovely possibility each year proved to himself and those about him that their world was not his world their life his life for like andersens young swan the barnyard was no home to him and when the other fowls cackled hissed and scolded he could only put his head under his wing and sigh for the time when he should join the beautiful white birds among the rushes of the stream that flowed through the poets garden where the sun shone and the little children played  ruth knew his dreams and desires but as she could not understand them she tried to cure them by every innocent art in her power and nursed him through many a fit of the heartsickness of hope deferred as patiently as she would have done through any less occult disease that flesh is heir to she was thinking of him as she worked that day and wishing she could mould his life as easily as she did the yellow lumps before her stamping them with her own mark and setting them away for her own use she felt that some change was about to befall nat for she had listened to the murmur of voices as the old man and the young sat talking far into the night what the result had been was as yet unknown for uncle daniel was unusually taciturn that morning and nat had been shut up in his room since breakfast though spring work waited for him all about the farm  an unwonted sobriety sat on ruths usually cheerful face and she was not singing as she worked but listening intently for a wellknown step to descend the creaking stairs presently it came paused a moment in the big kitchen where aunt becky was flying about like a domestic whirlwind and ruth heard nat ask for her with a ring in his voice that made her heart begin to flutter  shes in the dairy but for landsake where are you agoing boy i declare fort you look so fine and chirk i scursely knew yer answered the old lady pausing in her work to stare at the astonishing spectacle of nat in his sunday best upon a week day  im going to seek my fortune aunty wont you wish me luck replied nat cheerily  aunt becky had a proverb for every occasion and could not lose this opportunity for enriching the malcontent with a few suited to his case  yes child the best of lucks but its my opinion that if we get spindle and distaff ready the lord will send the flax without our goin to look fort every road has its puddle and he that prieth into a cloud may get struck by lightenin god bless you my dear and remember that a handful of good life is wuth a bushel of learnin  i will maam and also bear in mind that he who would have eggs must bear the cackling of hens with which return shot nat vanished leaving the old lady to expend her energies and proverbs upon the bread she was kneading with a vigor that set the trough rocking like a cradle  why ruth began to sing just then and why she became so absorbed in her oleaginous sculpture as to seem entirely unconscious of the appearance of a young man at the dairy door are questions which every woman will find no difficulty in answering actuated by one of the whims which often rule the simplest of the sex she worked and sang as if no anxiety had ruffled her quiet heart while nat stood and watched her with an expression which would have silenced her had she chosen to look up and meet it  the years that had done much for ruth had been equally kind to nat in giving him a generous growth for the figure leaning in the doorway seemed full of the vigor of wholesome country life but the head that crowned it was such as one seldom sees on a farmers shoulders for the brown locks gathered back into a ribbon after the fashion of the time showed a forehead of harmonious outline overarching eyes full of the pathos and the passion that betray the presence of that gift which is divine when young the mouth was sensitive as any womans and the lips were often folded close as if pride controlled the varying emotions that swayed a nature ardent and aspiring as a flame of fire few could read the language of this face yet many felt the beauty that it owed to a finer source than any grace of shape or color and wondered where the subtle secret lay  ruth may i tell you something  of course you may only dont upset the saltbox or sit down upon the churn  nat did neither but still leaned in the doorway and still watched the trim figure before him as if it was very pleasant to his eyes while ruth after a brief glance over her shoulder a nod and a smile spatted away as busily as ever  you know i was oneandtwenty yesterday  im not like to forget it after sewing my eyes out to work a smart waistcoat as a keepsake  nor i for theres not such another in the town and every rosebud is as perfect as if just pulled from our bush yonder see ive put it on as knights put on their armor when they went to fight for fortune and their ladies love  as he spoke nat smilingly thrust his hands into the pockets of a longflapped garment which was a masterpiece of the needlework in vogue a century ago ruth glanced up at him with eyes full of hearty admiration for the waistcoat and its wearer but something in those last words of his filled her with a trouble both sweet and bitter as she asked anxiously  are you going away nat  for a week only uncle has been very kind and given me a chance to prove which road its best for me to take since the time has come when i must choose i ride to boston this afternoon ruth carrying my poems with me that i may submit them to the criticism of certain learned gentlemen who can tell me if i deceive myself or not i have agreed to abide by their decision and if it is in my favoras god grant it beuncle leaves me free to live the life i love among my books and all that makes this world glorious think rutha poet in good truth to sing when i will and delve no more will you be pleased and proud if i come back and tell you this  indeed i will if it makes you happy and yetshe paused there looking wistfully into his face now all aglow with the hope and faith that are so blissful and so brief  what is it lass speak out and tell me all thats in your heart for i mean to show you mine he said in a commanding tone seldom heard before for he seemed already to have claimed the fair inheritance that makes the poet the equal of the prince  ruth felt the change with a thrill of pride yet dared suggest the possibility of failure as a finer nature would have shrunk from doing in such a happy hopeful hour as that  if the learned gentlemen decide that the poems have no worth what then  he looked at her an instant like one fallen from the clouds then squared his shoulders as if resettling the burden put off for a day and answered bravely though a sudden shadow crossed his face then i give up my dream and fall to work againno poet but a man who will do his best to be an honest one i have promised uncle to abide by this decision and ill keep my word  will it be very hard nat and ruths eyes grew pitiful for in his she read how much the sacrifice would cost him  ay lass very hard he said briefly then added with an eloquent change in voice and face unless you help me bear it sweetheart whichever road i take i had no thought to go alone will you walk with me ruth god knows ill make the way as smooth and pleasant as a faithful husband can  the busy hands stopped working there for nat held them fast in his and all her downcast eyes could see were the gay flowers her needle wrought agitated by the beating of the mans heart underneath her color deepened beautifully and her lips trembled in spite of the arch smile they wore as she said halftenderly halfwilfully  but i should be afeared to marry a poet if they are such strange and delicate creatures as ive heard tell twould be like keeping house for a butterfly i tried to cage one once but the poor thing spoilt its pretty wings beating against the bars and when i let it go it just dropped down and died among the roses there  but if i be no poet only a plain farmer with no ambition except how i may prosper and make my wife a happy woman what answer then ruth he asked feeling as the morningglories might have felt if a cold wind had blown over them  dear lad its this and throwing both arms about his neck the honest little creature kissed his brown cheek heartily  after that no wonder if ruth forgot her work never saw an audacious sunbeam withering the yellow roses she had caused to bloom never heard the buzz of an invading fly nor thought to praise the labor of her hands though her plump cheek was taking off impressions of the buttons on the noble waistcoat while to nat the little dairy had suddenly become a paradise life for a moment was all poetry and nothing in the wide world seemed impossible  ruth ruth the cats fell into the porkkag and my hands is in the dough for massy sake run down suller and fish her out  that shrill cry from aunt becky broke the spell dissolved the blissful dream for true to her instincts ruth forgot the lover in the housewife and vanished leaving nat alone with his loveand the butterpats     chapter iii   he rode gallantly away to boston that afternoon and ten days later came riding slowly home again with the precious manuscript still in his saddlebag  what luck boy asked uncle dan with a keen glance from under his shaggy brows as the young man came into the big kitchen where they all sat together when the days work was done  pretty much what you foretold sir answered nat trying to smile bravely as he took his place beside ruth on the settle where she sat making up cherrycolored breastknots by the light of one candle  fools go out to shear and come home shorn muttered aunt becky from the chimneycorner where she sat reeling yarn and brooding over some delectable mess that simmered on the coals  nat did not hear the flattering remark for he was fingering a little packet that silently told the story of failure in its dogeared leaves torn wrappers and carelessly knotted string  yes he said rapidly as if anxious to have a hard task over i showed my poems to sundry gentlemen as i proposed one liked them much and said they showed good promise of better things but added that it was no time for such matters now and advised me to lay them by till i was older a very courteous and friendly man this was and i felt much beholden to him for his gracious speeches the second criticized my work sharply and showed me how i should mend it but when he was done i found all the poetry had gone out of my poor lines and nothing was left but fine words so i thanked him and went away thinking better of my poems than when i entered the third wise man gave me his opinion very briefly saying as he handed back the book put it in the fire  nay but that was too harsh they are very pretty verses nat though most of them are far beyond my poor wits said ruth trying to lighten the disappointment that she saw weighed heavily on her lovers spirit  in the good gentlemans study i had a sight of some of the great poets of the world and while he read my verses i got a taste of milton spenser and my own shakespeares noble sonnets i saw what mine lacked yet some of them rang true so i took heart and trimmed them up in the fashion my masters set me let me read you one or two ruth while you tie your true lovers knots  and eagerly opening the beloved book nat began to read by the dim light of the tallow candle blind to the resigned expression ruths face assumed deaf to aunt beckys muttered opinion that an idle brain is the devils workshop and quite unconscious that uncle dan spread a checked handkerchief over his bald pate ready for a nap absorbed in his delightful task the young poet went on reading his most perfect lines with a face that brightened blissfully till just as he was giving a lovelay in his tenderest tone a mild snore checked his heavenward flight and brought him back to earth with a rude shock he started paused and looked about him like one suddenly wakened from a happy dream uncle dan was sound asleep aunt becky busily counting her tidy skeins and ruth making a mirror of one of the wellscoured pewter platters on the dresser was so absorbed in studying the effect of the gay breastknots that she innocently betrayed her inattention by exclaiming with a pretty air of regret  and thats the end  that is the end he answered gently closing the book which no one cared to hear and hiding his reproachful eyes behind his hand he sat silent till uncle dan roused by the cessation of the melodious murmur that had soothed his ear demanded with kindly bluntness  well boy which is it to be moonshine or money i want you to be spry about decidin for things is gittin behindhand and i cattleate to hire if you mean to quit work  sakes alive no man in his senses would set long on the fence when theres a good farm and a smart wife awaitin on one side and nothin but poetry and starvation on the other ejaculated aunt becky briskly clattering the saucepanlid as if to add the savory temptations of the flesh to those of filthy lucre  ruth said nothing but looked up at nat with the one poetic sentiment of her nature shining in her eyes and touching her with its tender magic till it seemed an easy thing to give up liberty for love the dandelion chain the child wove round the boy had changed to a flowery garland now but the man never saw the thorns among the roses and let the woman fetter him again for as he looked at her nat flung the cherished book into the fire with one hand and with the other took possession of the only bribe that could win him from that other love  i decide as you would have me sir not for the sake of the farm you promise me but for love of her who shall one day be its happy mistress please god  now thats sensible and hearty and im waal pleased my boy you jest buckle to for a year stiddy and let your inkhorn dry and well have as harnsome a weddin as man could wishalways providin ruth dont change her mind said uncle dan beaming benignantly at the young pair through a cloud of tobacco smoke while aunt becky poked the condemned manuscript deeper into the coals as if anxious to exorcise its witchcraft by fire in the good old fashion  but even in ruths arms nat cast one longing loving glance at his firstborn darling on its funeralpyre then turned his head resolutely away and whispered to the girl  never doubt that i love you sweetheart since for your sake i have given up the ambition of my life i dont regret it but be patient with me till i learn to live without my moonshine as you call it  sunshine is better and ill make it for you if i can so cheer up dear lad fall to work like a man and youll soon forget your pretty nonsense answered ruth with firm faith in the cure she proposed  ill try  and folding his wings pegasus bent his neck to the yoke and fell to ploughing  nat kept his word and did try manfully working early and late with an energy that delighted uncle dan made aunt becky bestir herself to bleach her finest webs for the wedding outfit and caused ruth to believe that he had forgotten the pretty nonsense for the pen lay idle and he gave all his leisure to her discussing housegear and stock with as deep an interest as herself apparently all summer long he toiled like one intent only on his crops all winter he cut wood and tended cattle as if he had no higher hope than to sell so many cords and raise likely calves for market  outwardly he was a promising young farmer with a prosperous future and a notable wife awaiting him but deep in the mans heart a spark of the divine fire still burned unquenched by duty love or time the spirit that made light in miltons darkness walked with burns beside the plough and lifted shakespeare higher than the royal virgins hand sang to nat in the airy whisper of the pines as he labored in the wintry wood smiled back at him in every oxeyed daisy his scythe laid low along the summer fields and solaced him with visions of a fairer future than any buxom ruth could paint it would not leave him and he learned too late that it was the life of his life a gift that could not be returned a blessing turned into a curse for though he had burned the little book from its ashes rose a flame that consumed him since it could find no vent even the affection for which he had made a costlier sacrifice than he knew looked pale and poor beside the loftier loveliness that dawned upon him in the passionate struggle ripening heart and soul to sudden manhood and the life that lay before him seemed very bleak and barren when he returned from playing truant in the enchanted world imagination opens to her gifted children  ruth vaguely felt the presence of this dumb despair dimly saw its shadow in the eyes that sometimes wore a tragic look and fancied that the hand working so faithfully for her was slipping from her hold it grew so thin and hot with the inward fever which no herb in all her garden could allay she vainly tried to rise to his level but the busy sparrow could not follow the aspiring lark singing at heavens gate it could only chirp its little lay and build its nest with no thought beyond a straw a worm and the mate that was to come  nat never spoke of the past and ruth dared not for she grew to feel that he did regret it bitterly though too generous for a word of reproach or complaint  ill make it up to him when we are married and he will learn to love the farm when he has little lads and lasses of his own to work for she often said to herself as she watched her lover sit among them after his days work listening to their gossip with a pathetic sort of patience or pleading a weariness there was no need to feign lie on the old settle lost in thoughts that made his face shine like one who talked with angels  so the year rolled round and may came again uncle dan was well satisfied aunt beckys preparations were completed and ruth had not changed her mind  settle about the weddin as soon as you like my girl and ill see that it is a merry one said the old man coming in from work as ruth blew the horn from the back porch one night at sunset  nat must decide that where is he uncle asked the girl looking out upon the quiet landscape touched with springs tenderest green  down in the medder ploughin its a toughish bit and hell be late i reckon for he took a long noonspell and i give him a piece of my mind about it so ill venter to say he wont touch a bit of victuals till the last furrow is laid answered uncle dan plodding away to wash his hands at the horsetrough  nay uncle it is his birthday and surely he had a right to a little rest for he works like a slave to please us though far from well im thinking and waiting for no reply ruth hurried in filled a tankard with cider and tripped away to bring her lover home singing as she went for nat loved to hear her voice  down the green lane toward the river the happy singer stepped thinking in what sweet words she could give the old mans message but the song died on her lips and the smiling eyes grew wistful suddenly for passing by the willowtrees she saw the patient oxen standing in the field alone  nat is hunting violets for me she thought with a throb of pleasure for she was jealous of a viewless rival and valued every token of fidelity her lover gave her  but as she drew nearer ruth frowned for nat lay beside the river evidently quite forgetful of scolding supper and sweetheart no not of the latter for a little nosegay of violets lay ready near the paper on which he seemed to be writing a song or sonnet to accompany the gift  seeing this the frown faded as the girl stole noiselessly across the grass to peep over his shoulder with a soft rebuke for his imprudence and delay  alas for ruth one glance at the placid face pillowed on his arm told her that this birthday was nats last for the violets were less white than the cheek they touched the pencil had fallen from nerveless fingers and deaths hand had written finis to both life and lay with a bitter cry she gathered the weary head into her arms fearing she had come too late to say goodby but the eyes that opened were so tranquil and the pale lips that answered wore such a happy smile she felt that tears would mar his peace and hushed her sobs to listen as he whispered brokenly with a glance that brightened as it turned from the wide field where his last hard days work lay finished to the quiet river whose lullaby was soothing him to sleep  tell uncle i did not stop till the job was done nor break my promise for the year is over now and it was so sweet to write again that i forgot to go home till it was too late  o nat not too late you shall work no more but write all day without a care we have been too hard upon you and you too patient with our blindness dear lad forgive us and come home to live a happier year than this has been cried ruth trying with remorseful tenderness to keep the delicate spirit that was escaping from her hold like the butterfly that died among her roses with broken wings  but nat had no desire to stay for he was going home to feel hunger thirst and weariness no more to find a love ruth could not give and to change earths prose to heavens immortal poetry yet he lingered on the threshold to look back and whisper gently it is better so sweetheart there was no place for me here and i was homesick for my own friends and country im going to find them and im quite content forget me and be happy or remember me only in the springtime when the world is loveliest and my birthday comes see this is all i had to give you but my heart was in it  he tried to lift the unfinished song and give it to her but it fluttered down upon his breast and the violets dropped after lying there unstirred by any breath for with the words a shadow deeper than that twilight laid upon the fields stole over the face on ruths bosom and all the glory of the sunset sky could only touch it with a pathetic peace as the poet lay asleep beside the river  he lies there still the legend says under the low green mound where violets bloom earliest where the old willows drop their golden tassels in the spring and blackbirds fill the air with their melodious ecstasy no song of his lived after him no trace of him remains except that nameless grave and few ever heard of one who came and went like the snow for which they christened him yet it seems as if his gentle ghost still haunted those sunny meadows still listened to the enchanted river and touched with some mysterious charm the places that knew him once for strangers find a soft attraction in the quiet landscape lovers seek those green solitudes to tell the story that is always new and poets muse beside the shadowy stream hearing as he heard a call to live the life that lifts them highest by unwavering fidelity to the gift heaven sends     lettys tramp   letty sat on the doorstep one breezy summer day looking down the road and wishing with all her heart that something pleasant would happen she often did this and one of her earliest delights when a lonely child was to sit there with a fairy book upon her knee waiting and watching in all good faith for something wonderful to happen  in those days cinderellas golden coach dashing round the corner to carry her away was the favorite dream but at eighteen one thinks more of the prince than either golden coach or splendid ball but no prince as yet had cut his way through the grove of laylocks round the gate and the little beauty still dreamed waking dreams on the doorstep with her work forgotten in her lap  behind her in the quaint quiet room aunt liddy dozed in her easy chair the clock ticked the bird chirped old bran snapped lazily at the flies and nothing else broke the hush that brooded over the place it was always so and letty often felt as if an earthquake would be a blessed relief to the dreadful monotony of her life  today it was peculiarly trying for a slight incident had ruffled the calm and though it lasted but a moment it had given letty a glimpse into that lovely new world which is the old a carriage containing a gay young couple on their honeymoon trip had stopped at the gate for the bride had a fancy for a draught from the mossy well and the bridegroom blandly demanded that her whim be gratified  letty served them and while one pretty girl slaked her thirst the other watched her with admiring eyes and a tender interest touched by envy it was all over in a minute then bonny bride and enamoured bridegroom rolled away on that enchanted journey which is taken but once in a lifetime leaving a cloud of dust behind and a deeper discontent in lettys heart  with a long sigh she had gone back to her seat and closing her eyes upon a world that could offer her so little fell adreaming again till a rough voice startled her wide awake  i say miss can you give a poor fellow a bite and a sup  opening her eyes she saw a sturdy tramp leaning over the low gate so ragged dusty worn and weary that she forgave the look of admiration in the bold black eyes which had been fixed on her longer than she knew before she could answer however aunt liddy a hospitable old soul called out from within  certin certin set right down on the doorstep and rest a spell while we see what we can do about vittles  letty vanished into the pantry and the man threw himself down in the shady porch regardless of brans suspicious growl he pulled off his hat stretched out his tired limbs and leaned his rough head back among the woodbine leaves with a long breath as if nearly spent  when letty brought him a plate of bread and meat he took it from her so eagerly and with such a ravenous look that she shrank back involuntarily seeing which he said with a poor attempt at a laugh  you neednt be afraid i look like a rough customer but i wont hurt you  lawful sakes we aint no call to be afraid of no one though we be lone women for bran is bettern a dozen men a lamb to them he knows but let any one try to pester letty and i never see a fercer beast said aunt liddy as the girl went back for more food seeing the strangers need  he knows im all right and makes friends at once you see answered the tramp with a satisfied nod as bran after a brief investigation sat down beside him with a pacific wag of the tail  well i never he dont often do that to strangers guess youre fond of dumb critters said aunt liddy much impressed by brans unusual condescension  theyve been my best friends and i dont forget it returned the man giving the dog a bone though halfstarved himself  something in the tone the act touched lettys tender heart and made her own voice very sweet and cordial as she said  please have some milk its nice and cold  the tramp put up both hands to take the bowl and as he did so looked into a face so full of compassion that it seemed like an angels leaning down to comfort a lost and weary soul hard as life had been to the poor fellow it had not spoiled him yet as was plainly proved by the change that softened his whole face like magic and trembled in the voice that said as if it were a sort of grace god bless you miss as he bent his head and drank  only a look of human sympathy and human gratitude yet in the drawing of a breath it cast out lettys fear and made the stranger feel as if he had found friends for it was the touch of nature that makes the whole world kin every one seemed to feel its influence bran turned his benevolent eyes approvingly from his mistress to his new friend the girl sat down confidingly and the old lady began to talk for being fond of chat she considered a stranger as a special providence  where be you travellin  nowhere in particular  where did you come from then continued aunt liddy undaunted by the short answer  california  do tell guess youve been one of the rovin sort aint you  havent done much else  it dont appear to have agreed with you remarkable well said the blunt old lady peering at him over her spectacles  if i hadnt had the devils own luck id have been a rich man instead of a beggar answered the tramp with a grim look and an ireful knitting of his black brows  been unfortnate have you im sorry for that but it pears to me them as stays to home and works stiddy does better than them that goes huntin after luck observed aunt liddy feeling it her duty to give a word of advice  shouldnt wonder if you were right maam but some folks havent got any home to stay in and fellows of my sort have to hunt after luck for it wont come to em  aint you got no friends young man  not one lost the last yesterday  took suddin i suppose and the old ladys face was full of interest as she put the question  drowned  merciful sakes how did it happen  got hurt couldnt be cured so i drowned him and  what shrieked aunt liddy upsetting her footstool with a horrified start  only a dog maam i couldnt carry him wouldnt leave him to suffer so put him out of pain and came on alone  the tramp had ceased eating and sat with his head on his hand in a despondent attitude that told his story better than words his voice was gruffer than ever as he spoke of his dog but the last word was husky and he put his hand on brans head with a touch that won the good creatures heart entirely and made him lick the downcast face with a little whine of sympathy and satisfaction  lettys eyes were full and aunt liddy took snuff and settled her footstool feeling that something must be done for one who showed signs of being worth the saving  poor creter and you was fond of him she said in a motherly tone for the man of five or six and twenty was but a boy to her  id have been a brute if i wasnt fond of him for he stuck to me when all the other fellows cut me and tried to drag himself along with a broken leg rather than leave me talk about friends give me a dumb animal if you want one worth having  a bitter tone was in the mans voice and a wrathful spark kindled in his eyes as if wrong as well as want had made him what he was  rest a little and tell us about california a neighbor went there and we like to hear news of that great splendid place  letty spoke and the halfeager halftimid voice was very winning especially to one who seldom heard such now seeing her kindly interest and glad to pay for his meal in the only way he could the man told some of his adventures in brief but graphic words while the old woman plied him with questions and the young one listened with a face so full of pretty wonder that the storyteller was inspired to do his best  aunt liddys capfrills stood erect with horror at some of the hairbreadth escapes recounted but to letty it was better than any romance she had ever read to listen to tales full of danger and hardship told by a living voice and face to face with the chief actor in them all who unconsciously betrayed that he possessed many of the manly attributes women most admire  after adventures like these i dont wonder it seems hard to settle down as other folks do she said warmly when the man stopped short as if ashamed of talking so much of his own affairs  i wouldnt mind trying it though he answered as he glanced about the sunny little room so homelike and reposeful and so haunted by all the sweet influences that touch mens hearts when most forlorn  youd better said aunt liddy decidedly git work and stick to it and if luck dont come bread and butter will and in a world of woe mebby thats about as much as any one on us ought to expect  i have tried to get it but im such a hardlooking chap no one wants me and i dont blame em look at that hat now aint that enough to spoil a mans chance let alone his looks the young fellow held up a battered object with such a comical mixture of disgust and indignation that letty could not help laughing and the blithe sound was so contagious that the wanderer joined in it cheered already by rest and food and kindly words  its singular what store menfolks do set by their hats my moses couldnt never read his paper till hed put on hisn and as for drivin a nail bareheaded in doors or out hed never think of such a thing said aunt liddy with the air of one well versed in the mysterious ways of menfolks  but letty clapped her hands as if a brilliant idea had flashed upon her and running to the back entry returned with a straw hat brown and dusty but shady whole and far more appropriate to the season than the ragged felt the man was eying hopelessly  it isnt very good but it might do for a time we only keep it to scare folks and i dont feel afraid now would you mind if i gave it to you stammered letty coloring up as she tried to offer her poor gift courteously  mind i guess id be glad to get it fit or no fit and dropping the old hat the tramp clapped on the new one making his mirror of the bright eyes before him  it does nicely and youre very welcome said the girl getting rosier still for there was something beside gratitude in the brown face that had lost the dogged dangerous look it wore at first  now if you was to wash up and smooth that hair of yourn a trifle youd be a likelylooking young man and if youre civilspoken and willin to lend a hand anywheres youll git work i aint a doubt observed aunt liddy feeling a growing interest in the wayfarer and womanlike acknowledging the necessity of putting the best foot foremost  letty ran for basin and towel and pointing to the well modestly retired into the kitchen while aunt liddy watched the vigorous scrubbing that went on in the yard for the tramp splashed the water about like a newfoundland dog and bran assisted at the brief toilet with hospitable zeal  it seemed as if a different man came out from that simple baptism for the haggard cheek had a glow upon it the eyes had lost their hopelessness and something like courage and selfrespect shone in the face that looked in at the door as the stranger gave back basin and towel saying with a wave of the old straw hat  im heartily obliged maam would you kindly tell me how far it is to the next big town  twenty miles the cars will take you right there and the deepo aint fur answered aunt liddy showing the way  the man glanced at his ragged shoes then squared his broad shoulders as if bracing himself for the twenty long hot miles that his weary feet must carry him since his pockets were empty and he could not bring himself to ask for any thing but food enough to keep life in him  goodby maam and god bless you and slouching the hat over his eyes he limped away escorted to the gate by bran  at the turn of the road he stopped and looked back as wistfully as ever letty had done along the shadowy road and as he looked it seemed as if he saw a younger self setting off with courage hope and energy upon the journey which alas had ended here his eye went to the old well as if there had been some healing in its water then turned to the porch where he had been fed and comforted and lingered there as if some kindly memory warmed his solitary heart  just then a little figure in blue gingham ran out and came fluttering after him accompanied by bran in a state of riotous delight rosy and breathless letty hurried to him and looking up with a face full of the innocent compassion that never can offend she said offering a parcel neatly folded up  aunt liddy sends you some dinner and this so that you neednt walk unless you like you are so lame  as if more touched than he cared to show the man took the food but gently put away the little roll of greenbacks saying quickly  thank you for this but i cant take your money  we aint rich but we love to help folks so you neednt be proud about it and letty looked ruffled at his refusal  ill take something else if you dont mind said the tramp pulling off his hat with a sudden smile that made his face look young and comely  what is it and letty looked up so innocently that it was impossible to resist the impulse of a grateful heart  his answer was to stoop and kiss the blooming cheek that instantly grew scarlet with girlish shame and anger as she turned to fly catching her by the hand he said penitently  i couldnt help it youre so good to me dont begrudge me a kiss for luck i need it god knows  the mans real destitution and despair broke out in these words and he grasped the little hand as if it was the only thing that kept him from the manifold temptations of a desperate mood  it thrilled the girl like a cry for help and made her forget everything except that a fellowcreature suffered she shook the big hand warmly and said with all her heart  youre welcome if it helps you goodby and good luck to you and ran away as fast as she had come  the man stood motionless and watched her till she vanished then turned and tramped sturdily on muttering to himself with a suspicious gruffness in his voice  if i had a little mate like that alongside i know my luck would turn     chapter ii   a wild december night with bitter wind and blinding snow reigned outside the long rude building lighted only by furnace fires that went roaring up the tall chimneys whence poured clouds of smoke and showers of sparks like beacons through the storm no living thing appeared in that shadowy place except a matronly gray cat sitting bolt upright upon an old rug spread over a heap of sand near one of the fires a newspaper and a tin pail were beside her and she seemed to have mounted guard while the watchman of the foundry went his rounds  a door stood halfopen upon the sheltered side of the building and suddenly as if blown thither like a stormdriven bird a little figure came fluttering in breathless halffrozen and quite bewildered by a long struggle with the pitiless gale feebly brushing away the snow that blinded her the poor thing looked about her with frightened eyes and seeing no one but the cat seemed to take courage and crept toward the fire as if suffering for the moment conquered fear  oh pussy let me warm myself one minute for im perished with the cold she whispered stretching two benumbed hands to the blaze  the cat opened her yellow eyes and evidently glad to meet one of her own sex began to purr hospitably as she rustled across the newspaper to greet her guest there was something inexpressibly comforting in the sound and reassured by it the girl pushed back her drenched hat shook her snowy garments and drew a long breath like one nearly spent yet even while she basked in the warmth that was salvation her timid eyes glanced about the great gloomy place and her attitude was that of one ready to fly at a moments warning  presently a step sounded on a flight of stairs leading to some loft above the wanderer started like a hare and drawing nearer to the door paused as if to catch a glimpse of the approaching face before she fled away into the storm that howled just then with a violence which might well daunt a stouter heart  a tall man in a rough coat with grizzled hair and beard under an old fur cap came slowly down the steps whistling softly to himself as he swung his lantern to and fro  an old man and the cat is fond of him i guess ill dare to ask my way or ill never get home thought the girl as her eye scanned the newcomer with a womans quickness  an involuntary rustle of her dress caught his ear and lifting the lantern he saw her at once but did not speak as if afraid of frightening her still more for her pale face and the appealing gesture of the outstretched hand told her fear and need better than her hurried words  oh please ive lost my way and am nearly frozen could i warm myself a bit and find out where i am  of course you may why bless your heart i wouldnt turn a dog out such a night as this much less a poor little soul like you answered the man in a hearty tone that rang true on the listening ear of the girl  then he hung up the lantern put a stool nearer the fire and beckoned her to approach but even the kindly words and act failed to win the timid creature for she drew back as he advanced gave a glance at the door and said as if appealing to the best instincts of the man whom she longed yet feared to trust  thank you but its getting late and i ought to be getting on if i knew the way perhaps youve got some girls of your own so you can understand how scared i am to be lost at night and in such a strange place as this  the man stared then laughed and shaking the snow from his curly hair and beard showed himself to be a young and pleasantlooking fellow with a merry eye an honest brown face and a hearty voice  you thought i was an old chap did you wish i was if it would be any comfort to you ive got no little girls neither mores the pity but you neednt be afraid of me though it is late and lonely why lord love you child im not a brute sit down and thaw out while you tell me where you want to go  the halfindignant tone of the man made his guest feel as if she had insulted him and she obeyed with a docility which appeased his anger at once seating herself upon the stool she leaned toward the fire with an irrepressible shiver and tried to keep her teeth from chattering as she told her little story  i want work badly and went a long way hoping to get some but i didnt find it and that discouraged me very much i had no money so had to walk and the storm got so bad i lost my way then i was scared and halffrozen and so bewildered i think id have died if i hadnt seen the light and come in here  i guess you would and the best thing you can do now is to stop till the storm lifts shouldnt wonder if it did about midnight said the man stirring up the red embers as if anxious to do something for her comfort  but that is so late and i must be ever so far away from home for i came over the wrong bridge oh me what shall i do and the poor thing wrung her hands in dismay  wont your folks go to look for you  i havent any one in the world to care for me the woman where i board wont trouble herself or shell think ive run away because i owe her money i might be dead in the river and no one would mind sighed the girl leaning her head on her hands while some bright dishevelled hair fell over her face as if to hide its youth and innocence from a world that seemed to have no shelter for either  thats hard but dont you be downhearted child things often mend when they seem worst i know for ive been through the mill and had friends raised up to me when id about done with living as a bad job i cant leave here till sunrise but ill do the best i can for you till then sam will be along early and hell see to you if you cant trust me for he is as gray as a badger and hes got six girls of his own if thats a recommendation ive got nothing but a cat and she trusts me dont you old sally  as he spoke the man sat down upon the sandheap and sally leaped to his knee rubbing her head against his cheek with a soft sound of confidence and contentment which seemed to afford her friend great satisfaction the girl smiled faintly and said in an apologetic tone for there had been something like reproach in the mans voice as he asked the dumb animal to vouch for his character  i dont believe id have dared to come in here if i hadnt seen pussy but i thought anyone who was good to her would be good to me and now im sure of it  thats right you see im a lonesome sort of a chap and like something to pet so i took old sally and we get on capitally she wont let the other fellows touch her but always comes and sits with me when i am alone here nights and its surprising what good company she is  he laughed as he spoke as if halfashamed of the amiable weakness yet anxious to put his guest at her ease he evidently succeeded for she stretched two shabby little boots toward the fire and leaned her head against a grimy beam saying with a sigh of weariness  it is very comfortable but the heat makes me feel queer and dizzy  youre just about used up and im going to give you a cup of hot coffee thatll bring you round in a jiffy its time for supper hey sally  as he spoke the man set his pail in the hot ashes unfolded a parcel of bread and meat and laying a rude sandwich on a clean bit of paper offered it with a hospitable  have a bit do now youve had a hard pull and need something to set you up  leaning forward to give and take two faces came into the clear red glow of the furnacefire and a look of recognition flashed into each so suddenly that it startled both man and maid into involuntary frankness of expression  why its little letty  and you are my tramp  a change so rapid as to be almost ludicrous came over the pair in the drawing of a breath she smoothed back her hair and hid the shabby boots yet sat more erect upon the stool as if she had a right there and felt no longer any fear he pulled off his cap with a pleasant mixture of respect surprise and satisfaction in his manner as he said in a halfproud halfhumble tone  no miss for thanks to you im a decent man now  then you did find work and get on she exclaimed with a bright wistful look that touched him very much  didnt you get my letter he asked eagerly i sent you the first dollar i earned and told you and the old lady i was all right  letty shook her head and all the light passed out of her face leaving it pathetic in its patient sorrow  aunt liddy died a week after you were there so suddenly that every thing was in confusion and i never got the letter i wish she had known of it because it would have pleased her so we often talked about you and hoped youd do well we led such quiet lives you see that any little thing interested us for a long time  it was a little thing to you i dare say but it was salvation to me not the money or the food only but the kindness of the old lady andand the look in your sweet face miss id got so far down through sickness and bad luck that there didnt seem any thing left for me but deviltry or death that day it was a tossup between any bad job that came along first and drowning like my dog that seemed sort of mean though and i felt more like being revenged somehow on the world that had been so hard on me  he stopped short breathing hard with a sudden spark in his black eyes and a nervous clenching of the strong hands that made letty shrink for he seemed to speak in spite of himself as if the memory of that time had left its impress on his life  but you didnt do any thing bad im sure you didnt for aunt liddy said there was the making of a man in you because you were so quick to feel a little bit of kindness and take good advice  the soft eager voice of the girl seemed to work the miracle anew for a smile broke over his face the angry spark was quenched and the clenched hand opened to offer again all it had to give as he said with a characteristic mingling of fun and feeling in his voice  i dont know much about angels but i felt as if id met a couple that day for they saved me from destruction you cast your bread upon the waters and its come back when maybe you need it most as much as i did then tisnt half as nice as yours but perhaps a blessing will do as well as butter  letty took the brown bread feeling that he had said the best grace over it and while she ate he talked evidently moved to open his heart by the memory of the past and eager to show that he had manfully persisted in the welldoing his angels had advised  that was nearly two years ago you know and ive been hard at it ever since i took any thing that come along and was glad to get it the hat did that i firmly believe and he laughed a short laugh adding soberly but i didnt take to work at first for id been a rover and liked it so it took a long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together before i settled down steady the hat and thehe was going to say kiss but a look at the lonely little creature sitting there so confidingly made him change the word tothe money seemed to bring me luck and i followed the advice of the good old lady and stuck to my work till i got to liking it ive been here more than a year now and am getting on so well i shall be overseer before long im only watchman for a short time old sam has been sick and they wanted some one they could trust so they chose me  it was good to see him square his broad shoulders and throw back his head as he said that and pretty to see letty nod and smile with sincerest pleasure in his success as she said  it looks dark and ugly now but ive seen a foundry when they were casting and it was splendid to watch the men manage the furnaces and do wonderful things with great hammers and moulds and buckets of redhot melted iron i like to know you do such things and now im not afraid it seems sort of romantic and grand to work in this place where every one must be strong and brave and skilful to get on  thats it thats why i like it dont you see he answered brightening with pleasure at her artless praise you just come some casting day and ill show you sights you wont forget in a hurry if there wasnt danger and noise and good hard work wrastling with fire and iron and keeping a rough set of fellows in order i shouldnt stay for the restless fit comes on sometimes and i feel as if i must cut away somewhere born so and cant help it maybe i could if i had something to anchor me but as you say nobody would care much if i was in the river and thats bad for a chap like me  sally would care said the girl quite soberly for she sympathized now with the mans loneliness as she could not have done two years ago  so she would but ill take her with me when i leavenot for the river mind you im in no danger of that nonsense now but if i go on a tramp and i may if the fit gets too strong for me she shall go too and well be dick whittington and his cat over again  he spoke in a devilmaycare tone and patted the plump tabby with a curious mixture of boyish recklessness and a mans sad knowledge of life in his face  dont go pleaded letty feeling that she had a certain responsibility in the matter i should mind as well as sally for if aunt liddy and i helped put you in a good way it would be a disappointment to have you go wrong please stop here and ill try and come to see you work some day if i can get time im likely to have plenty of it im afraid  she began eagerly but ended with a despondent droop of the whole figure that made her new friend forget himself in interest for her  ill stop honor bright and you come and look after me now and then thatll keep me steady see if it dont but tell me how you are getting on little down on your luck just now i guess come ive told my story you tell yours and maybe i can lend a hand i owe you a good turn you know and im one that likes to pay his debts if he can  you did pay yours but i never got the letter for i came away after aunty died you see i wasnt her own nieceonly sort of a distant relation and she took me because my own people were gone her son had all she leftit wasnt much and she told him to be good to me but i soon saw that i was a burden and couldnt bear to stay so i went away to take care of myself i liked it at first but this winter times are so hard and work so scarce i dont get on at all  what do you do miss asked whittington with added respect because in her shabby dress and altered face he read the story of a struggle letty was too proud to tell  i sew she answered briefly smoothing out her wet shawl with a hand so thin and small it was pathetic to see when one remembered that nothing but a needle in those slender fingers kept want and sin at bay  the kindly fellow seemed to feel that and as his eye went from his own strong right arm to the sledgehammer it often swung the instinct of protection so keen in manly men made him long to stand between poor letty and the hard world he knew so well the magnetism of sympathy irresistibly attracted iron to steel while little needle felt assured that big hammer would be able to beat down many of the obstacles which now seemed insurmountable if she only dared to ask for aid but help came without the asking  been after work you say why we could give you heaps of it if you dont mind its being coarse and plain this sort of thing you know touching his red shirt with a businesslike air our men use em altogether and like em strong in the seams some aint and buttons fly off just looking at em that makes a fellow mad and swearing comes easy  but letty shook her head though she couldnt help smiling at his sober way of explaining the case and its sad consequences  ive tried that work and it doesnt pay six cents for a shirt and sometimes only four isnt enough to earn ones board and clothes and fire even if one made half a dozen a day you cant get them for that and somebody grows rich while we starve  hanged if i ever buy another see here you make me enough for a year and well have a fair bargain between us that is if you cant do better and dont mind he added suddenly abating his warmth and looking almost bashful over the wellmeant proposal  id love to do it only you mustnt pay too much said letty glad of any thing to keep her hands and thoughts busy for life was very bare and cold just then  all right ill see to it directly and nobody be the wiser returned her new employer privately resolving to order a bale of red flannel on the morrow and pay fabulous prices for the work of the little friend who had once kept him from worse than starvation  it was not much to offer and red flannel was not a romantic subject of conversation but something in the prompt relief and the hearty goodwill of the man went to lettys heart already full to overflowing with many cares and troubles she tried to thank him but could only cover up her face and sob it was so sweet and comfortable to find any one who cared enough for her to lift her out of the slough of despond which was to her as dangerous a mood as the desperate one he had known there were hands enough to beckon the winsome creature to the wrong side of the quagmire where so many miss the steppingstones but she felt that this was the right side and the hand an honest one though rough and grimy with hard work so the tears were glad and grateful tears and she let them flow melting the fatal frost that had chilled her hope and faith in god and man  but the causer of them could not bear the sight for the contrast between this forlorn girl and the blithe blooming letty of that memorable day was piteous manlike he tried to express his sympathy in deeds as well as words and hastily filling a tin cup from the coffeecan pressed it upon her with a fatherly stroke of the bent head and a soothing  now my dear just take a sip of this and dont cry any more well straighten things out so cheer up and let me lend a hand anywhere anyhow  but hunger and fear weariness and cold had been too much for poor letty and in the act of lifting up her wet face to thank him the light left her eyes and she would have slipped to the ground if he had not caught her  in a minute she was herself again lying on the old rug with snow upon her forehead and some one fanning her with a newspaper  i thought i was going to die she whispered looking about her in a dazed sort of way  not a bit of it youre going to sleep thats what you want and old sallys going to sit by while you do it its a hardish pillow but ive put my handkerchief over it and being monday its spickandspan clean  letty smiled as she turned her cheek to the faded silk handkerchief laid over the rolledup coat under her head for pussy was nestling close beside her as if her presence was both a comfort and defence yet the girls eyes filled even while she smiled for when most desolate a friend had been raised up to her and though the face bending over her was dark and shaggy there was no fear in her own as she said halfappealingly halfconfidingly  i dont believe i could go if i tried im so worn out but youll take care of me and in the morning show me the way home  please god i will he answered as solemnly as if taking an oath adding as he stepped back to the stool she had left i shall stay here and read my paper nothing shall scare you so make yourself comfortable and drop off with an easy mind  sitting there he saw her lay her hands together as if she said some little prayer then turning her face from the light she fell asleep lulled by the drowsy purr of the humble friend to whom she clung even in her dreams he only looked a minute for something that was neither the shimmer of firelight nor the glitter of snowdust made the quiet group dance mistily before his eyes and forgetting his paper he fell to drying lettys hat  it was both comical and pleasant to see how tenderly he touched the battered thing with what interest he surveyed it perched on his big hand and how carefully he smoothed out the ribbons evidently much bewildered as to which was the front and which the back giving up the puzzle he hung it on the handle of the great hammer and leaning his chin on his hand began to build castles in the air and watch the red embers as if he saw in them some vision of the future that was very pleasant  hour after hour struck from the city clocks across the river the lantern burned itself out untrimmed the storm died away and a soft white silence followed the turmoil of the night still letty slept like a tired child still old sally faithful to her trust lay in the circle of the girls arm and still the watchman sat before the fire dreaming waking dreams as he had often done before but never any half so earnest sweet and hopeful as those that seemed to weave a tender romance about the innocent sleeper to whom he was loyally paying a debt of gratitude with such poor hospitality as he could show  dawn came up rosy and clear along the east and the first level ray of wintry sunlight as it struck across the foundry walls fell on lettys placid face with the bright hair shining like a halo round it  feeling very much as if he had entertained an angel unaware the man stood enjoying the pretty picture hesitating to wake her yet fearing that a gruff hallo from old sam might do it too suddenly somehow he hated to have her go for the gloomy foundry seemed an enchanted sort of place this morning with a purer heaven and earth outside and within the little mate whom he felt a strong desire to keep always alongside for something better than lucks sake  he was smiling to himself over the thought yet half ashamed to own how it had grown and strengthened in a night when letty opened wide a pair of eyes full of the peace sleep brings and the soft lustre that comes after tears involuntarily the man drew back and waited silently for her to speak she looked bewildered for a moment then remembered and sprang up full of the relief and fresh gratitude that came with her first waking thought  how long ive slept how very kind you were to me i can go now if you will start me right  you are heartily welcome i can take you home at once unless youd rather wait for sam he answered with a quick look toward the door as if already jealous of the venerable samuel  id rather go before any one comes but perhaps you ought not to leave yet i wouldnt like to take you from your duty began letty looking about her for her hat  duty behanged im going to see you safe home if youll let me heres your hat i dried it but it dont look quite shipshape somehow and taking the shabby little object from the nail where it hung he presented it with such respectful care that a glimmer of the old mirthfulness came into lettys face as she said surveying it with much disfavor  it is almost as bad as the one i gave you but it must do  ive got that old thing up at my place now keep it for luck wish i had one for you hold on heres a tippetnice and warm have it for a hood youll find it cold outside  he was so intent on making her comfortable that letty could not refuse and tied on the tippet while he refilled the cup with hot coffee carefully saved for her  little red riding hood blest if you aint he exclaimed admiringly as he turned to her again and saw the sweet face in its new headgear  but you are not the wolf she answered with a smile like sunshine bending to drink from the cup he held  as she lifted her head the blue eyes and the black exchanged again the subtle glance of sympathy that made them friends before only now the blue ones looked up full of gratitude and the black ones looked down soft with pity neither spoke but letty stooped and gathering old sally in her arms kissed the friendly creature then followed her guide to the door  how beautiful she cried as the sun came dazzling down upon the snow that hid all dark and ugly things with a veil of purity  looks kind of bridal dont it said the man taking a long breath of the frosty air and straightening himself up as if anxious to look his best by daylight  he never had looked better in spite of the old coat and red shirt for the glow of the furnacefire still seemed to touch his brown face the happy visions of the night still shone in his eyes and the protective kindliness of a generous nature gave dignity to the rough figure as he strode into the snow and stretched his hand to letty saying cheerily  pretty deep but hold on to me and ill get you through better take my hand i washed it apurpose  letty did take it in both her little ones and they went away together through the deserted streets feeling as if they were the only pair alive in the still white world that looked so lovely in the early sunshine  the girl was surprised to find how short the way seemed for in spite of drifts she got on bravely with a strong arm to help and a friendly voice to encourage her yet when she reached the last corner she stopped and said with a sudden shyness which he understood and liked  id best go on alone now but im very grateful to you please tell me your name id love to know who my friend is though i never shall forget his kindness  nor i yours joe stone is my name but id rather you called me your tramp till we get something better he answered with a laugh in his eyes as he bent toward her for a hearty shake of the slender hand that had grown warm in his  i will goodby goodby and suddenly remembering how they parted before letty blushed like a rose and ran away as fast as the drifts would let her  and ill call you my letty some day if im not much mistaken joe said to himself with a decided nod as he went back to the foundry feeling that the world looked more sort of bridal than ever  he was not mistaken for when spring budded his dream came true and in the little sewinggirl who bound him with a silken thread so soft and strong it never broke he found an anchor that held him fast to happiness and home to letty something wonderful happened at last the prince came when most she needed him and though even when the beggars rags fell off his only crown was the old hat his royal robes red flannel and fustian his sceptre a sledgehammer she knew and loved him for       the man was a man for a that     scarlet stockings     chapter i  how they walked into lennoxs life   come out for a drive harry  too cold  have a game of billiards  too tired  go and call on the fairchilds  having an unfortunate prejudice against country girls i respectfully decline  what will you do then  nothing thank you  and settling himself more luxuriously upon the couch lennox closed his eyes and appeared to slumber tranquilly kate shook her head and stood regarding her brother despondently till a sudden idea made her turn toward the window exclaiming abruptly  scarlet stockings harry  where and as if the words were a spell to break the deepest daydream lennox hurried to the window with an unusual expression of interest in his listless face  i thought that would succeed she isnt there but ive got you up and you are not to go down again laughed kate taking possession of the sofa  not a bad manoeuvre i dont mind its about time for the one interesting event of the day to occur so ill watch for myself thank you and lennox took the easy chair by the window with a shrug and a yawn  im glad any thing does interest you said kate petulantly i dont think it amounts to much for though you perch yourself at the window every day to see that girl pass you dont care enough about it to ask her name  ive been waiting to be told  its belle morgan the doctors daughter and my dearest friend  then of course she is a bluebelle  dont try to be witty or sarcastic with her for she will beat you at that  not a dumbbelle then  quite the reverse she talks a good deal and very well too when she likes  she is very pretty has anybody the right to call her ma belle  many would be glad to do so but she wont have any thing to say to them  a canterbury belle in every sense of the word then  she might be for all canterbury loves her but she isnt fashionable and has more friends among the poor than among the rich  ah i see a divingbell who knows how to go down into a sea of troubles and bring up the pearls worth having  ill tell her that it will please her you are really waking up harry and kate smiled approvingly upon him  this page of belles life is rather amusing so read away said lennox glancing upthe street as if he awaited the appearance of the next edition with pleasure  there isnt much to tell she is a nice bright energetic warmhearted dear the pride of the doctors heart and a favorite with every one though she is odd  how odd  does and says what she likes is very blunt and honest has ideas and principles of her own goes to parties in high dresses wont dance round dances and wears red stockings though mrs plantagenet says its fast  rather a jolly little person i fancy why havent we met her at some of the teafights and muffinworries weve been to lately  it may make you angry but it will do you good so ill tell she didnt care enough about seeing the distinguished stranger to come thats the truth  sensible girl to spare herself hours of mortal dulness gossip and dyspepsia was the placid reply  she has seen you though at church and dawdling about town and she called you sir charles coldstream on the spot how does that suit asked kate maliciously  not bad i rather like that wish shed call some day and stir us up  she wont i asked her but she said she was very busy and told jessy tudor she wasnt fond of peacocks  i dont exactly see the connection  stupid boy she meant you of course  oh im peacocks am i  i dont wish to be rude but i really do think you are vain of your good looks elegant accomplishments and the impression you make wherever you go when its worth while you exert yourself and are altogether fascinating but the i comeseeandconquer air you put on spoils it all for sensible people  it strikes me that miss morgan has slightly infected you with her oddity as far as bluntness goes fire away its rather amusing to be abused when one is dying of ennui  thats grateful and complimentary to me when i have devoted myself to you ever since you came but every thing bores you and the only sign of interest youve shown is in those absurd red hose i should like to know what the charm is said kate sharply  impossible to say accept the fact calmly as i do and be grateful that there is one glimpse of color life and spirit in this aristocratic tomb of a town  you are not obliged to stay in it fiercely  begging your pardon my dove but i am i promised to give you my enlivening society for a month and a lennox keeps his word even at the cost of his life  im sorry i asked such a sacrifice but i innocently thought that after being away for five long years you might care to see your orphan sister and the dove produced her handkerchief with a plaintive sniff  now my dear creature dont be melodramatic i beg of you cried her brother imploringly i wished to come i pined to embrace you and i give you my word i dont blame you for the stupidity of this confounded place  it never was so gay as since you came for every one has tried to make it pleasant for you cried kate ruffled at his indifference to the hospitable efforts of herself and friends but you dont care for any of our simple amusements because you are spoilt by the flattery gayety and nonsense of foreign society if i didnt know it was half affectation i should be in despair you are so blasé and absurd its always the way with men if one happens to be handsome accomplished and talented he puts on as many airs and is as vain as any silly girl  dont you think if you took breath youd get on faster my dear asked the imperturbable gentleman as kate paused with a gasp  i know its useless for me to talk as you dont care a straw what i say but its true and some day youll wish you had done something worth doing all these years i was so proud of you so fond of you that i cant help being disappointed to find you with no more ambition than to kill time comfortably no interest in any thing but your own pleasures and only energy enough to amuse yourself with a pair of scarlet stockings  pathetic as poor kates face and voice were it was impossible to help laughing at the comical conclusion of her lament lennox tried to hide the smile on his lips by affecting to curl his moustache with care and to gaze pensively out as if touched by her appeal but he wasntoh bless you no she was only his sister and though she might have talked with the wisdom of solomon and the eloquence of demosthenes it wouldnt have done a particle of good sisters do very well to work for one to pet one and play confidante when ones love affairs need feminine wit to conduct them but when they begin to reprove or criticise or moralize it wont do and cant be allowed of course lennox never snubbed anybody but blandly extinguished them by a polite acquiescence in all their affirmations for the time being and then went on in his own way as if nothing had been said  i dare say you are right ill go and think over your very sensible advice and as if roused to unwonted exertion by the stings of an accusing conscience he left the room abruptly  i do believe ive made an impression at last hes actually gone out to think over what ive said dear harry i was sure he had a heart if one only knew how to get at it and with a sigh of satisfaction kate went to the window to behold the dear harry going briskly down the street after a pair of scarlet stockings a spark of anger kindled in her eyes as she watched him and when he vanished she still stood knitting her brows in deep thought for a grand idea was dawning upon her  it was a dull town no one could deny that for everybody was so intensely proper and wellborn that nobody dared to be jolly all the houses were square aristocratic mansions with revolutionary elms in front and spacious coachhouses behind the knockers had a supercilious perk to their bronze or brass noses the dandelions on the lawns had a highly connected air and the very pigs were evidently descended from our first families stately dinnerparties decorous dances moral picnics and much teapot gossiping were the social resources of the place of course the young people flirted for that diversion is apparently irradicable even in the best society but it was done with a propriety which was edifying to behold  one can easily imagine that such a starched state of things would not be particularly attractive to a travelled young gentleman like lennox who as kate very truly said had been spoilt by the flattery luxury and gayety of foreign society he did his best but by the end of the first week ennui claimed him for its own and passive endurance was all that was left him from perfect despair he was rescued by the scarlet stockings which went tripping by one day as he stood at the window planning some means of escape  a brisk blithefaced girl passed in a gray walking suit with a distracting pair of highheeled boots and glimpses of scarlet at the ankle modest perfectly so i assure you were the glimpses but the feet were so decidedly pretty that one forgot to look at the face appertaining thereunto it wasnt a remarkably lovely face but it was a happy wholesome one with all sorts of good little dimples in cheek and chin sunshiny twinkles in the black eyes and a decided yet lovable look about the mouth that was quite satisfactory a busy bustling little body she seemed to be for sackpockets and muff were full of bundles and the trim boots tripped briskly over the ground as if the girls heart were as light as her heels somehow this active pleasant figure seemed to wake up the whole street and leave a streak of sunshine behind it for every one nodded as it passed and the primmest faces relaxed into smiles which lingered when the girl had gone  uncommonly pretty feetshe walks well which american girls seldom doall waddle or prancenice face but the boots are french and it does my heart good to see them  lennox made these observations to himself as the young lady approached nodded to kate at another window gave a quick but comprehensive glance at himself and trotted round the corner leaving the impression on his mind that a whiff of fresh spring air had blown through the street in spite of the december snow he didnt trouble himself to ask who it was but fell into the way of lounging in the baywindow at about three pm and watching the gray and scarlet figure pass with its blooming cheeks bright eyes and elastic step having nothing else to do he took to petting this new whim and quite depended on the daily stirring up which the sight of the energetic damsel gave him kate saw it all but took no notice till the day of the little tiff above recorded after that she was as soft as a summer sea and by some clever stroke had belle morgan to tea that very week  lennox was one of the besttempered fellows in the world but the peacocks did rather nettle him because there was some truth in the insinuation so he took care to put on no airs or try to be fascinating in the presence of miss belle in truth he soon forgot himself entirely and enjoyed her oddities with a relish after the prim proprieties of the other young ladies who had simpered and sighed before him for the first time in his life the crusher as his male friends called him got crushed for belle with the subtle skill of a quickwitted keensighted girl soon saw and condemned the elegant affectations which others called foreign polish a look a word a gesture from a pretty woman is often more eloquent and impressive than moral essays or semioccasional twinges of conscience and in the presence of one satirical little person sir charles coldstream soon ceased to deserve the name  belle seemed to get over her hurry and to find time for occasional relaxation but one never knew in what mood he might find her for the weathercock was not more changeable than she lennox liked that and found the muffinworries quite endurable with this sauce piquante to relieve their insipidity presently he discovered that he was suffering for exercise and formed the wholesome habit of promenading the town about three pm kate said to follow the scarlet stockings     chapter ii  where they led him   whither away miss morgan asked lennox as he overtook her one bitter cold day  im taking my constitutional  so am i  with a difference and belle glanced at the bluenosed muffledup gentleman strolling along beside her with an occasional shiver and shrug  after a winter in the south of france one does not find arctic weather like this easy to bear he said with a disgusted air  i like it and do my five or six miles a day which keeps me in what fine ladies call rude health answered belle walking him on at a pace which soon made his furs a burden  she was a famous pedestrian and a little proud of herpowers but she outdid all former feats that day and got over the ground in gallant style something in her manner put her escort on his mettle and his usual lounge was turned into a brisk march which set his blood dancing face glowing and spirits effervescing as they had not done for many a day  there you look more like your real self now said belle with the first sign of approval she had ever vouchsafed him as he rejoined her after a race to recover her veil which the wind whisked away over hedge and ditch  are you sure you know what my real self is he asked with a touch of the conquering hero air  not a doubt of it i always know a soldier when i see one returned belle decidedly  a soldier thats the last thing i should expect to be accused of and lennox looked both surprised and gratified  theres a flash in your eye and a ring to your voice occasionally which made me suspect that you had fire and energy enough if you only chose to show it and the spirit with which you have just executed the morgan quickstep proves that i was right returned belle laughing  then i am not altogether a peacock said lennox significantly for during the chat which had been as brisk as the walk belle had given his besetting sins several sly hits and he couldnt resist one return shot much as her unexpected compliment pleased him  poor belle blushed up to her forehead tried to look as if she did not understand and gladly hid her confusion behind the recovered veil without a word  there was a decided display both of the flash and the ring as lennox looked at the suddenly subdued young lady and quite satisfied with his retaliation gave the order forward march which brought them to the gardengate breathless but better friends than before  the next time the young people met belle was in such a hurry that she went round the corner with an abstracted expression which was quite a triumph of art just then off tumbled the lid of the basket she carried and lennox rescuing it from a puddle obligingly helped readjust it over a funny collection of bottles dishes and tidy little rolls of all sorts  its very heavy maynt i carry it for you he asked in an insinuating manner  no thank you was on belles lips but observing that he was dressed with unusual elegance to pay calls she couldnt resist the temptation of making a beast of burden of him and took him at his word  you may if you like ive got more bundles to take from the store and another pair of hands wont come amiss  lennox lifted his eyebrows also the basket and they went on again belle very much absorbed in her business and her escort wondering where she was going with all that rubbish filling his unoccupied hand with sundry brown paper parcels much to the detriment of the light glove that covered it belle paraded him down the main street before the windows of the most aristocratic mansions and then dived into a dirty backlane where the want and misery of the town was decorously kept out of sight  you dont mind scarlet fever i suppose observed belle as they approached the unsavory residence of biddy obrien  well im not exactly partial to it said lennox rather taken aback  you neednt go in if you are afraid or speak to me afterwards so no harm will be doneexcept to your gloves  why do you come here if i may ask it isnt the sort of amusement i should recommend he began evidently disapproving of the step  oh im used to it and like to play nurse where father plays doctor im fond of children and mrs obriens are little dears returned belle briskly threading her way between ashheaps and mudpuddles as if bound to a festive scene  judging from the row in there i should infer that mrs obrien had quite a herd of little dears  only nine  and all sick  more or less  by jove its perfectly heroic in you to visit this hole in spite of dirt noise fragrance and infection cried lennox who devoutly wished that the sense of smell if not of hearing were temporarily denied him  bless you its the sort of thing i enjoy for theres no nonsense here the work you do is pleasant if you do it heartily and the thanks you get are worth having i assure you  she put out her hand to relieve him of the basket but he gave it an approving little shake and said briefly  not yet im coming in  its all very well to rhapsodize about the exquisite pleasure of doing good to give carelessly of ones abundance and enjoy the delusion of having remembered the poor but it is a cheap charity and never brings the genuine satisfaction which those know who give their mite with heart as well as hand and truly love their neighbor as themselves lennox had seen much fashionable benevolence and laughed at it even while he imitated it giving generously when it wasnt inconvenient but this was a new sort of thing entirely and in spite of the dirt the noise and the smells he forgot the fever and was glad he came when poor mrs obrien turned from her sick babies exclaiming with irish fervor at sight of belle  the lord love ye darlin for remimberin us when ivery one barrin the doctor and the praste turns the cowld shouldther in our throuble  now if you really want to help just keep this child quiet while i see to the sickest ones said belle dumping a stout infant on to his knee thrusting an orange into his hand and leaving him aghast while she unpacked her little messes and comforted the maternal bird  with the calmness of desperation her aiddecamp put down his best beaver on the rich soil which covered the floor pocketed his gloves and making a bib of his cambric handkerchief gagged young pat deliciously with bits of orange whenever he opened his mouth to roar at her first leisure moment belle glanced at him to see how he was getting on and found him so solemnly absorbed in his task that she went off into a burst of such infectious merriment that the obriens sick and well joined in it to a man  good fun isnt it she asked turning down her cuffs when the last spoonful of gruel was administered  ive no doubt of it when one is used to the thing it comes a little hard at first you know returned lennox wiping his forehead with a long breath and seizing his hat as if quite ready to tear himself away  youve done very well for a beginner so kiss the baby and come home said belle approvingly  no thank you muttered lennox trying to detach the bedaubed innocent but little pat had a grateful heart and falling upon his new nurses neck with a rapturous crow clung there like a burr  take him off let me out of this hes one too many for me cried the wretched young man in comic despair  being freed with much laughter he turned and fled followed by a shower of blessings from mrs obrien  as they came up again into the pleasant highways lennox said awkwardly for him  the thanks of the poor are excellent things to have but i think id rather receive them by proxy will you kindly spend this for me in making that poor soul comfortable  but belle wouldnt take what he offered her she put it back saying earnestly  give it yourself one cant buy blessingsthey must be earned or they are not worth having try it please and if you find it a failure then ill gladly be your almoner  there was a significance in her words which he could not fail to understand he neither shrugged drawled nor sauntered now but gave her a look in which respect and selfreproach were mingled and left her simply saying ill try it miss morgan  now isnt she odd whispered kate to her brother as belle appeared at a little dance at mrs plantagenets in a highnecked dress knitting away on an armysock as she greeted the friends who crowded round her  charmingly so why dont you do that sort of thing when you can answered her brother glancing at her thin bare shoulders and hands rendered nearly useless by the tightness of the gloves  gracious no its natural to her to do so and she carries it off well i couldnt therefore i dont try though i admire it in her go and ask her to dance before she is engaged  she doesnt dance round dances you know  she is dreadfully prim about some things and so free and easy about others i cant understand it do you  well yes i think i do heres forbes coming for you ill go and entertain belle by a quarrel  he found her in a recess out of the way of the rushing and romping busy with her work yet evidently glad to be amused  i admire your adherence to principle miss belle but dont you find it a little hard to sit still while your friends are enjoying themselves he asked sinking luxuriously into the lounging chair beside her  yes very answered belle with characteristic candor but father does not approve of that sort of exercise so i console myself with something useful till my chance comes  your work cant exactly be called ornamental said lennox looking at the big sock  dont laugh at it sir it is for the foot of the brave fellow who is going to fight for me and his country  happy fellow may i ask who he is and lennox sat up with an air of interest  my substitute i dont know his name for father has not got him yet but im making socks and towels and a comfortbag for him so that when found he may be off at once  you really mean it cried lennox  of course i do i cant go myself but i can buy a pair of strong arms to fight for me and i intend to do it i only hope hell have the right sort of courage and be a credit to me  what do you call the right sort of courage asked lennox soberly  that which makes a man ready and glad to live or die for a principle theres a chance for heroes now if there ever was when do you join your regiment she added abruptly  havent the least idea and lennox subsided again  but you intend to do so of course  why should i  belle dropped her work why should you what a question because you have health and strength and courage and money to help on the good cause and every man should give his best and not dare to stay at home when he is needed  you forget that i am an englishman and we rather prefer to be strictly neutral just now  you are only half english and for your mothers sake you should be proud and glad to fight for the north cried belle warmly  i dont remember my mother  thats evident  but i was about to add ive no objection to lend a hand if it isnt too much trouble to get off said lennox indifferently for he liked to see belles color rise and her eyes kindle while he provoked her  do you expect to go south in a bandbox youd better join one of the kidglove regiments they say the dandies fight well when the time comes  ive been away so long the patriotic fever hasnt seized me yet and as the quarrel is none of mine i think perhaps id better take care of kate and let you fight it out among yourselves heres the lancers may i have the honor  but belle being very angry at this lukewarmness answered in her bluntest manner  having reminded me that you are a strictly neutral englishman you must excuse me if i decline i dance only with loyal americans and rolling up her work with a defiant flourish she walked away leaving him to lament his loss and wonder how he could retrieve it she did not speak to him again till he stood in the hall waiting for kate then belle came down in a charming little red hood and going straight up to him with her hand out a repentant look and a friendly smile said frankly  i was very rude i want to beg pardon of the english and shake hands with the american half  so peace was declared and lasted unbroken for the remaining week of his stay when he proposed to take kate to the city for a little gayety miss morgan openly approved the plan but secretly felt as if the town was about to be depopulated and tried to hide her melancholy in her substitutes socks they were not large enough however to absorb it all and when lennox went to make his adieu it was perfectly evident that the doctors belle was out of tune the young gentleman basely exulted over this till she gave him something else to think about by saying gravely  before you go i feel as if i ought to tell you something since kate wont if you are offended about it please dont blame her she meant it kindly and so did i belle paused as if it was not an easy thing to tell and then went on quickly with her eyes upon her work  three weeks ago kate asked me to help her in a little plot and i consented for the fun of the thing she wanted something to amuse and stir you up and finding that my queer ways diverted you she begged me to be neighborly and let you do what you liked i didnt care particularly about amusing you but i did think you needed rousing so for her sake i tried to do it and you very goodnaturedly bore my lecturing i dont like deceit of any kind so i confess but i cant say im sorry for i really think you are none the worse for the teasing and teaching youve had  belle didnt see him flush and frown as she made her confession and when she looked up he only said half gratefully half reproachfully  im a good deal the better for it i dare say and ought to be very thankful for your friendly exertions but two against one was hardly fair now was it  no it was sly and sinful in the highest degree but we did it for your good so i know youll forgive us and as a proof of it sing one or two of my favorites for the last time  you dont deserve any favor but ill do it to show you how much more magnanimous men are than women  not at all loth to improve his advantages lennox warbled his most melting lays con amore watching as he sung for any sign of sentiment in the girlish face opposite but belle wouldnt be sentimental and sat rattling her knittingneedles industriously though the harbor bar was moaning dolefully though douglas was touchingly tender and true and the wind of the summer night sighed romantically through the sittingroom  much obliged must you go she said without a sign of soft confusion as he rose  i must but i shall come again before i leave the country may i he asked holding her hand  if you come in a uniform  good night belle tenderlygoodby sir charles with a wicked twinkle of the eye which lasted till he closed the halldoor growling irefully  i thought id had some experience but one never can understand these women  canterbury did become a desert to belle after her dear friend had gone of course the dear friends brother had nothing to do with the desolation and as the weeks dragged slowly belle took to reading poetry practising plaintive ballads and dawdling over her work at a certain window which commanded a view of the railway station and hotel  youre dull my dear run up to town with me tomorrow and see your young man off said the doctor one evening as belle sat musing with a halfmended red stocking in her hand  my young man she ejaculated turning with a start and a blush  your substitute child stephens attended to the business for me and hes off tomorrow i began to tell you about the fellow last week but you were woolgathering so i stopped  yes i remember it was all very nice goes tomorrow does he id like to see him but do you think we can both leave home at once some one might come you know and i fancy its going to snow said belle putting her face behind the curtain to inspect the weather  youd better go the trip will do you good you can take your things to tom jones and see kate on the way shes got back from philadelphia  has she ill go then it will please her and i do need change you are a dear to think of it and giving her father a hasty glimpse of a suddenly excited countenance belle slipped out of the room to prepare her best array with a most reckless disregard of the impending storm  it did not snow on the morrow and up they went to see the th regiment off belle did not see her young man however for while her father went to carry him her comforts and a patriotic nosegay of red and white flowers tied up with a smart blue ribbon she called on kate but miss lennox was engaged and sent an urgent request that her friend would call in the afternoon much disappointed and a little hurt belle then devoted herself to the departing regiment wishing she was going with it for she felt in a warlike mood it was past noon when a burst of martial music the measured tramp of many feet and enthusiastic cheers announced that the boys were coming from the balcony where she stood with her father belle looked down upon the living stream that flowed by like a broad river with a steely glitter above the blue all her petty troubles vanished at the sight her heart beat high her face glowed her eyes filled and she waved her handkerchief as zealously as if she had a dozen friends and lovers in the ranks below  here comes your man i told him to stick the posy where it would catch my eye so i could point him out to you look its the tall fellow at the end of the front line said the doctor in an excited tone as he pointed and beckoned  belle looked and gave a little cry for there in a privates uniform with her nosegay at his buttonhole and on his face a smile she never forgot was lennox for an instant she stood staring at him as pale and startled as if he were a ghost then the color rushed into her face she kissed both hands to him and cried bravely goodby goodby god bless you harry and immediately laid her head on her fathers shoulder sobbing as if her heart was broken  when she looked up her substitute was lost in the undulating mass below and for her the spectacle was over  was it really he why wasnt i told what does it all mean she demanded looking bewildered grieved and ashamed  hes really gone my dear its a surprise of his and i was bound over to silence here this will explain the joke i suppose and the doctor handed her a cockedhat note done up like a military order       a roland for your oliver mademoiselle i came home for the      express purpose of enlisting and only delayed a month on      kates account if i ever return i will receive my bounty at      your hands till then please comfort kate think as kindly as      you can of sir charles and sometimes pray a little prayer      for       your unworthy       substitute  belle looked very pale and meek when she put the note in her pocket but she only said i must go and comfort kate and the doctor gladly obeyed feeling that the joke was more serious than he had imagined  the moment her friend appeared miss lennox turned on her tears and played away pouring forth lamentations reproaches and regrets in a steady stream  i hope you are satisfied now you cruel girl she began refusing to be kissed youve sent him off with a broken heart to rush into danger and be shot or get his arms and legs spoiled you know he loved you and wanted to tell you so but you wouldnt let him and now youve driven him away and hes gone as an insignificant private with his head shaved and a heavy knapsack breaking his back and a horrid gun that will be sure to explode and he would wear those immense blue socks you sent for he adores you and you only teased and laughed at him my poor deluded deserted brother and quite overwhelmed by the afflicting picture kate lifted up her voice and wept again  i am satisfied for hes done what i hoped he would and hes none the less a gentleman because hes a private and wears my socks i pray they will keep him safe and bring him home to us when he has done his duty like a man as i know he will im proud of my brave substitute and ill try to be worthy of him cried belle kindling beautifully as she looked out into the wintry sunshine with a new softness in the eyes that still seemed watching that bluecoated figure marching away to danger perhaps death  its ill playing with edged tools we meant to amuse him and we may have sent him to destruction ill never forgive you for your part never said kate with the charming inconsistency of her sex  but belle turned away her wrath by a soft answer as she whispered with a tender choke in her voice  we both loved him dear lets comfort one another     chapter iii  what became of them   private lennox certainly had chosen pretty hard work for the th was not a kidglove regiment by any means fighting in midwinter was not exactly festive and camps do not abound in beds of roses even at the best of times but belle was right in saying she knew a soldier when she saw him for now that he was thoroughly waked up he proved that there was plenty of courage energy and endurance in him  it is my private opinion that he might now and then have slightly regretted the step he had taken had it not been for certain recollections of a sarcastic tongue and a pair of keen eyes not to mention the influence of one of the most potent rulers of the human heart namely the desire to prove himself worthy the respect if nothing more of somebody at home belles socks did seem to keep him safe and lead him straight in the narrow path of duty belles comfortbag was such in very truth for not one of the stout needles on the tricolored cushion but what seemed to wink its eye approvingly at him not one of the tidy balls of thread that did not remind him of the little hand he coveted and the impracticable scissors were cherished as a good omen though he felt that the sharpest steel that ever came from sheffield couldnt cut his love in twain and belles lessons short as they had been were not forgotten but seemed to have been taken up by a sterner mistress whose rewards were greater if not so sweet as those the girl could give there was plenty of exercise nowadays and of hard work that left many a tired head asleep for ever under the snow there were many opportunities for diving into the depths and bringing up pearls worth having by acts of kindness among the weak the wicked and the suffering all about him he learned now how to earn not buy the thanks of the poor and unconsciously proved in the truest way that a private could be a gentleman but best of all was the steadfast purpose to live and die for a principle which grew and strengthened with each month of bitter hardship bloody strife and dearly bought success life grew earnest to him time seemed precious self was forgotten and all that was best and bravest rallied round the flag on which his heart inscribed the motto love and liberty  praise and honor he could not fail to win and had he never gone back to claim his bounty he would have earned the great well done for he kept his oath loyally did his duty manfully and loved his lady faithfully like a knight of the chivalrous times he knew nothing of her secret but wore her blue ribbon like an order never went into battle without first like many another poor fellow kissing something which he carried next his heart and with each day of absence felt himself a better man and braver soldier for the fondly foolish romance he had woven about the scarlet stockings  belle and kate did comfort one another not only with tears and kisses but with womanly work which kept hearts happy and hands busy how belle bribed her to silence will always remain the ninth wonder of the world but though reams of paper passed between brother and sister during those twelve months not a hint was dropped on one side in reply to artful inquiries from the other belle never told her love in words but she stowed away an unlimited quantity of the article in the big boxes that went to gladden the eyes andalas for romancethe stomach of private lennox if pickles could typify passion cigars prove constancy and gingerbread reveal the longings of the soul then would the abovementioned gentleman have been the happiest of lovers but camplife had doubtless dulled his finer intuitions for he failed to understand the new language of love and gave away these tender tokens with lavish prodigality concealment preyed a trifle on belles damask cheek it must be confessed and the keen eyes grew softer with the secret tears that sometimes dimmed them the sharp tongue seldom did mischief now but uttered kindly words to every one as if doing penance for the past and a sweet seriousness toned down the lively spirit which was learning many things in the sleepless nights that followed when the little prayer for the beloved substitute was done  ill wait and see if he is all i hope he will be before i let him know i shall read the truth the instant i see him and if he has stood the test ill run into his arms and tell him every thing she said to herself with delicious thrills at the idea but you may be sure she did nothing of the sort when the time came  a rumor flew through the town one day that lennox had arrived upon receipt of which joyful tidings belle had a panic and hid herself in the garret but when she had quaked and cried and peeped and listened for an hour or two finding that no one came to hunt her up she composed her nerves and descended to pass the afternoon in the parlor and a high state of dignity all sorts of reports reached her he was mortally wounded he had been made a major or a colonel or a general no one knew exactly which he was dead was going to be married and hadnt come at all belle fully expiated all her small sins by the agonies of suspense she suffered that day and when at last a note came from kate begging her to drop over to see harry she put her pride in her pocket and went at once  the drawingroom was empty and in confusion there was a murmur of voices upstairs a smell of camphor in the air and an empty wineglass on the table where a military cap was lying belles heart sunk and she covertly kissed the faded blue coat as she stood waiting breathlessly wondering if harry had any arms for her to run into she heard the chuckling biddy lumber up and announce her then a laugh and a halffond halfexulting ah ha i thought shed come  that spoilt it all belle took out her pride instanter rubbed a quick color into her white cheeks and snatching up a newspaper sat herself down with as expressionless a face as it was possible for an excited young woman to possess lennox came running down thank heaven his legs are safe sighed belle with her eyes glued to the price of beef he entered with both hands extended which relieved her mind upon another point and he beamed upon her looking so vigorous manly and martial that she cried within herself my beautiful brown soldier even while she greeted him with an unnecessarily brief how do you do mr lennox  the sudden eclipse which passed over his joyful countenance would have been ludicrous if it hadnt been pathetic but he was used to hard knocks now and bore this his hardest like a man he shook hands heartily and as belle sat down again not to betray that she was trembling a good deal he stood at ease before her talking in a way which soon satisfied her that he had borne the test and that bliss was waiting for her round the corner but she had made it such a very sharp corner she couldnt turn it gracefully and while she pondered how to do so he helped her with a cough she looked up quickly discovering all at once that he was very thin rather pale in spite of the nice tan and breathed hurriedly as he stood with one hand in his breast  are you ill wounded in pain she asked forgetting herself entirely  yes all three he answered after a curious look at her changing color and anxious eyes  sit downtell me about itcan i do any thing and belle began to plump up the pillows on the couch with nervous eagerness  thank you im past help was the mournful reply accompanied by a hollow cough which made her shiver  oh dont say so let me bring father he is very skilful shall i call kate  he can do nothing kate doesnt know this and i beg you wont tell her i got a shot in the breast and made light of it but it will finish me sooner or later i dont mind telling you for you are one of the strong cool sort you know and are not affected by such things but kate is so fond of me i dont want to shock and trouble her yet awhile let her enjoy my little visit and after im gone you can tell her the truth  belle had sat like a statue while he spoke with frequent pauses and an involuntary clutch or two at the suffering breast as he stopped and passed his hand over his eyes she said slowly as if her white lips were stiff  gone where  back to my place id rather die fighting than fussed and wailed over by a parcel of women i expected to stay a week or so but a battle is coming off sooner than we imagined so im away again tomorrow as im not likely ever to come back i just wanted to ask you to stand by poor kate when im finished and to say goodby to you belle before i go he put out his hand but holding it fast in both her own she laid her tearful face down on it whispering imploringly  oh harry stay  never mind what happened for the next ten minutes suffice it to say that the enemy having surrendered the victor took possession with great jubilation and showed no quarter  bang the fieldpiece toot the fife and beat the rolling drum for ruse number three has succeeded come down kate and give us your blessing called lennox taking pity on his sister who was anxiously awaiting the dénouement on the stairs  in she rushed and the young ladies laughed and cried kissed and talked tumultuously while their idol benignantly looked on vainly endeavoring to repress all vestiges of unmanly emotion  and you are not dying really truly cried belle when fair weather set in after the flurry  bless your dear heart no im as sound as a nut and havent a wound to boast of except this ugly slash on the head  its a splendid wound and im proud of it and belle set a rosy little seal on the scar which quite reconciled her lover to the disfigurement of his handsome forehead youve learned to fib in the army and im disappointed in you she added trying to look reproachful and failing entirely  no only the art of strategy you quenched me by your frosty reception and i thought it was all up till you put the idea of playing invalid into my head it succeeded so well that i piled on the agony resolving to fight it out on that line and if i failed again to make a masterly retreat you gave me a lesson in deceit once so dont complain if i turned the tables and made your heart ache for a minute as youve made mine for a year  belles spirit was rapidly coming back so she gave him a capital imitation of his french shrug and drawled out in his old way  i have my doubts about that mon ami  what do you say to thisand thisand this he retorted pulling out and laying before her with a triumphant flourish a faded blue ribbon a fat pincushion with a hole through it and a daintily painted little picture of a pretty girl in scarlet stockings  there ive carried those treasures in my breastpocket for a year and im firmly convinced that they have all done their part toward keeping me safe the blue ribbon bound me fast to you belle the funny cushion caught the bullet that otherwise might have finished me and the blessed little picture was my comfort during those dreadful marches my companion on picketduty with treachery and danger all about me and my inspiration when the word charge went down the line for in the thickest of the fight i always saw the little gray figure beckoning me on to my duty  oh harry you wont go back to all those horrors will you im sure youve done enough and may rest now and enjoy your reward said kate trying not to feel that two is company and three is none  ive enlisted for the war and shall not rest till either it or i come to an end as for my reward i had it when belle kissed me  you are right ill wait for you and love you all the better for the sacrifice whispered belle i only wish i could share your hardships dear for while you fight and suffer i can only love and pray  waiting is harder than working to such as you so be contented with your share for the thought of you will glorify the world generally for me ill tell you what you can do while im away its both useful and amusing so it will occupy and cheer you capitally just knit lots of red hose because i dont intend you to wear any others hereafter mrs lennox  mine are not worn out yet laughed belle getting merry at the thought  no matter for that those are sacred articles and henceforth must be treasured as memorials of our love frame and hang them up or if the prejudices of society forbid that flight of romance lay them carefully away where moths cant devour nor thieves steal them so that years hence when my descendants praise me for any virtues i may possess any good i may have done or any honor i may have earned i can point to those precious relics and say proudly  my children for all that i am or hope to be you must thank your honored mothers scarlet stockings     independence a centennial love story     chapter i  miss dolly   stupidlooking old place dare say i shall have to waste half an hour listening to centennial twaddle before i get what i want the whole thing is a bore but i cant quarrel with my bread and butter so here goes and with an air of resignation the young man applied himself to the rusty knocker  rather a nice old bit maybe useful so ill book it and whipping out a sketchbook the stranger took a hasty likeness of the griffins head on the knocker  deaf as posts try try try again and pocketing his work the artist gave an energetic rat tat tat that echoed through the house  having rashly concluded that the inhabitants of the ancient mansion were proportionately aged he assumed a deferential expression as steps approached and prepared to prefer with all due respect the request which he had come many miles to make the door opened with unexpected rapidity but the neatly arranged speech did not glide glibly off the young mans tongue and the change which came over him was comically sudden for instead of an old woman a blooming girl stood upon the threshold with a petulant expression on her charming face which only made it more charming still  what did you wish sir asked the rosy mouth involuntarily relaxing from a vain attempt to look severe while the hazel eyes softened with a mirthful gleam as they rested on the comely but embarrassed countenance before her  beg pardon for making such a noise i merely wished to inquire if the famous chair in which washington sat when he visited the town is here replied the stranger clutching off his hat with a very different sort of respect from that which he had intended to show and feeling as if he had received a shock of some new and delightful sort of electricity  yes and the girl began to close the door as if she knew what question was coming next  could i be allowed to sketch it for the weekly portfolio all such relics are so valuable this year that we venture to ask many favors and this is such a famous affair ive no doubt you are often troubled by requests of this sort continued the artist with the persuasive tone of one accustomed to make his way everywhere  this is the fifth time this week replied the damsel demurely though her lips still struggled not to smile  its very good of you im sure to let us fellows in but the public demand is immense just now and we only obey orders you know began the fifth intruder fervently hoping the other four had been refused  but mrs hill never does let artists or reporters in was the gentle quencher which arrested him as he was industriously wiping his feet on the doormat  never he asked stopping short while an expression of alarm changed suddenly to one of satisfaction  never answered the damsel like a sweetvoiced echo  then the other fellows lost their chance and that makes the old thing doubly valuable if i could see mrs hill for a moment ive no doubt she will allow me to sketch the chair  she is not at home  so much the better for when i tell you that ive come fifty miles to pick up antiquities in this town i know you wont have the heart to send me away without the gem of the collection replied the artist nothing daunted for his quick eye read the artless face before him and saw a defiant expression come over it which made him suspect that there had been a falling out between mistress and maid if such they were he was sure of it when the girl threw open the door with a decisive gesture saying briefly  walk in if you please she wont be home for an hour  what a little beauty thought the young man admiring her spirit and feeling that the stupid old place contained unexpected treasures as he followed her into the room where the ubiquitous father of his country was reported to have dried his august boots and drunk a mug of cider some hundred years ago  it seemed as if the ghosts of many of the homely household articles used then had come back to celebrate the anniversary of that thrilling event for there was nothing modern in the little room but the girl and her guest who stared about him at the tall andirons on the hearth the bright brass candlesticks above it the spinningwheel on one side a dresser on the other strewn with pewter platters porringers and old china while antique garments hung over the settle by the fire  bless my soul what a capital old place he ejaculated taking it all in with an artists keen appreciation i feel as if id gone back a century and the general might come in at any minute  that is the chair he used and this the tankard he drank from answered the girl pointing out the sacred objects with a reverential air which warned her visitor that he must treat the ancient and honorable relics with due respect  then feeling that this was an unusual stroke of luck he hastened to make the most of it by falling to work at once saying as he took a seat and pointed his pencils  there is such a lot of treasures here that i dont know where to begin i hope i shall not be very much in your way  oh no if you dont mind my going on with my work for i cant leave it very well all these things are to be sent away tomorrow thats why the place is in such confusion replied the girl as she fell to polishing up a brass snuffertray  heres richness thought the artist with a sigh of satisfaction as he dashed at his work feeling wonderfully inspired by his picturesque surroundings  the dull winter sky gloomed without and a chilly wind sighed through the leafless elms but within the little room fairly glowed with the ruddy firelight that shone in the bright brasses glimmered over the tarnished silver of the quaint vests on the settle and warmed the artists busy hand as if it liked to help him in his task but the jolly flames seemed to dance most lovingly about their little mistress bathing the sweet face with a softer bloom touching the waves of brown hair with gold peeping under the long lashes at the downcast eyes that peeped back again half arch half shy glorifying the blue apron that seemed to clasp the trim waist as if conscious of its advantages and showing up the dimples in the bare arms working so briskly that even the verdigris of ages yielded to their persuasive touch  who can this pretty priscilla be i must make her talk and find out never shall get the eyes right if she doesnt look up thought the artist who instead of devoting himself to the historical chair was basely sketching the girl whose youth and beauty were wonderfully enhanced by the antiquity around her  mrs hill is a rich woman if all these treasures have a history even if they havent they would bring a good price for things of this sort are all the rage now and the older the better he said aloud in a sociable tone as he affected to study the left arm of the famous chair  they are not hers to sell for they belonged to the first mrs hill who was a quincy and had a right to be proud of them the present mrs hill doesnt value them a bit but she was a smith so her family relics are nothing to boast of answered the girl using her bit of washleather as if the entire race of smith ought to be rubbed out of existence  and she is going to sell all these fine old things is she asked the artist with an eye to bargains  no indeed they belong toto the first mrs hills daughter named after her dorothy quincy the girl began impetuously but checked herself and ended very quietly with a suddenly averted head  a fine name and i shouldnt think she would be in haste to change it said the artist wondering if miss dorothy quincy was before him  not much hope of that poor thing with a shake of the head that made several brown curls tumble out of the net which tried to confine a riotous mass of them  ah i see a spinster and the young man returned to his work with greatly abated interest in the subject  the bright eyes glanced quickly up and when they fell the snuffertray reflected a merry twinkle in them as their owner answered gravely  yes a spinster  is she one of the amiable sort  oh dear no very quick in her temper and sharp with her tongue but then she has a good deal to try her as i happen to know  sorry for that spinsterhood is trying i fancy so we should be patient with the poor old ladies why i asked was because i thought i might induce miss dolly to let me have some of her relics do you think she would he asked holding his sketch at arms length and studying it with his head on one side  im very sure she wont for these old things are all she has in the world and she loves them dearly people used to laugh at her for it but now they are glad to own her and her duds as they called them the smiths are looking up every thing they can find of that sort even poor relations all these things are going down to a fair tomorrow and miss dolly with them  as one of the relics suggested the artist glancing at a green calash and a plumcolored quilted petticoat lying on the settle  exactly laughed the girl adding with a touch of bitterness in her voice poor miss dolly never got an invitation before and im afraid its foolish of her to go now since she is only wanted to show off the oldfashioned things and give the smiths something to boast of  you are fond of the old lady in spite of her temper i see  she is the only friend ive got and the speaker bent over the tray as if to hide emotion of some sort  i shall probably have to do that fair for our paper if so ill certainly pay my respects to miss dolly why not is she so very awful he asked quickly as the girl looked up with a curious mixture of mirth and malice in her face  very with a lifting of the brows and a pursing up of the lips delightful to behold  you think i wont dare address the peppery virgin i never saw the woman yet whom i was afraid of or the man either for that matter so i give you my word ill not only speak to miss dolly but win her old heart by my admiration for her and her ancestral treasures said the artist accepting the challenge he read in the laughing eyes  we shall see for im going with her i do the spinning and its great fun said the girl prudently changing the conversation though she evidently enjoyed it  i never saw it done could you give me an idea of the thing if it is not asking too much proposed the artist in his most persuasive tone for somehow play of this sort was much more interesting than the study of old furniture  with amiable alacrity the girl set the big wheel buzzing and deftly drew out the yarn from the spindle stepping briskly to and fro twirling and twisting with an ease and grace which convinced the admiring observer that the best thing ever invented to show off a round arm a pretty foot a fine figure and a charming face was a spinningwheel  this opinion was so plainly expressed upon his own countenance that the color deepened in the girls cheeks as she looked over her shoulder to see how he liked it and dropping the thread she left the wheel still whirling and went back to her work without a word  thank you very much its beautiful dont see how in the world you do it murmured the young man affecting to examine the wheel while his own head seemed to whirl in sympathy for that backward glance had unconsciously done great execution  a moonfaced clock behind the door striking eleven recalled the idler to his task and resuming his seat he drew silently till the chair was done then he turned a page and looked about for the next good bit  rather warm work he said smiling as he shook the hair off his forehead and pushed his chair back from the hearth  this is what makes the place so hot ive been learning to make oldfashioned dishes for the fair and this batch is going down to show what i can do  as she spoke the girl threw open the door of a cavernous oven and with an air of housewifely pride displayed a goodly array of brown loaves round as cannonballs earthen crocks suggestive of baked beans and indian pudding and near the door a pan of spicy cakes delectable to smell and see these she drew forth and set upon the table turning from the oven after a careful inspection of its contents with the complexion of a damask rose  delicious spectacle exclaimed the artist with his eyes upon the pretty cook while hers were on her handiwork  you shall taste them for they are made from a very old receipt and are called sweethearts said the innocent creature setting them forth on a large platter while a smile went dimpling round her lips  capital name theyll sell faster than you can make them but it seems to me you are to have all the work and miss dolly all the credit added this highly appreciative guest subduing with difficulty the rash impulse to embrace miss dollys rosy handmaid on the spot  she seemed to feel the impending danger and saying hastily you must have some cider to go with your cake thats the correct thing you know she tripped away with hospitable zeal  upon my soul i begin to feel like the prince of the fairy tale in this quiet place where every thing seems to have been asleep for a hundred years the little beauty ought to have been asleep too and given me a chance to wake her more of a cinderella than a princess i fancy and leads a hard life of it between miss dolly and the second mrs hill wonder what happy fellow will break the spell and set her free and the young man paced the kitchen humming softly      and on her lovers arm she leant       and round her waist she felt it fold     and far across the hills they went       in that new world which is the old  till the sound of a light step made him dart into a chair saying to himself with a sudden descent from poetry to prose bless her little heart ill drink her cider if its as sour as vinegar  in came the maid bearing a tankard on a salver and adding several sweethearts she offered the homely lunch with a curtsey and a smile that would have glorified even pork and beans  you are sitting in the generals chair and here is the tankard he used you can drink his health if you like  id rather drink that of the maker of sweethearts and rising the artist did so gallantly regardless of consequences  but the cider was excellent and subsiding into the immortal chair he enjoyed his lunch with the hearty appetite of a boy while the damsel began to fold up the garments airing on the settle and lay them into a chest standing near the one quite unconscious that he was drinking draughts of a far more potent liquor than applejuice the other that she had begun to spin a golden thread instead of yarn when she turned the great wheel that day  an eloquent sort of silence filled the room for a moment and a ray of sunshine glanced from the silver tankard to the bright head bent over the chest as if to gild the first page of the romance which is as fresh and sweet today as when the stately george wooed his beloved martha a shrill voice suddenly broke that delicious pause exclaiming as a door opened with a bang  not packed yet i wont have this rubbish cluttering round another minute there the voice abruptly fell and the stranger had time to see a withered yellow face in a pumpkin hood stare sharply at him before it vanished with an exclamation of unmistakable disapproval  miss dolly seems more afraid of me than i of her you see began the young man much amused at the retreat of the enemy for such he regarded any one who disturbed this delightful têteàtête  she has only gone to put her cap on and when she comes back you can pay your respects tomrs hill and the girl looked over the lid of the chest with dancing eyes  then id better be off since reporters and artists are not allowed on the premises exclaimed the visitor rising with more haste than dignity  dont hurry she is only a woman and you are not afraid you know  im afraid you will get a scolding began the artist pocketing his sketchbook and grasping his hat  im used to that answered the girl evidently enjoying the rout with naughty satisfaction  but the sharp black eyes and the shrill voice had effectually broken the pleasant daydream and mrs hill in a pumpkin hood was quite enough for his nerves without a second appearance in one of the aweinspiring caps such ladies affect  i couldnt think of repaying your kindness by intruding any longer now that ive got my sketch a thousand thanks goodmorning and opening the first door he came to the dismayed man was about to plunge into the buttery when the girl arrested his flight and led him through the long hall  on the steps he took breath returned thanks again with grateful warmth and pulling out a card presented it as if anxious to leave some token behind which should prevent being forgotten by one person at least  john hancock harris read the card and glancing up from it with sudden interest in her eyes the girl exclaimed impulsively  why then you must be a relation of  no i regret to say im not related to the famous governor only named for him to please my father ive always been contented with a modest initial until now but this year every one does their best to hang on to the past so ive got proud of my middle name and find it useful as well as ornamental hastily explained the honest young fellow though just then he would have liked to claim kinship with every member of the continental congress  i hope you will be worthy of it answered the damsel with a little bow as if saluting the man for his names sake  i try to be he said soberly adding with that engaging smile of his may i ask to whom i am indebted for this very profitable and agreeable call  instantly the sweet sobriety vanished and every feature of the pretty face shone with mirthful malice as the girl answered sweetly  miss dolly goodmorning and closed the door leaving him to stare blankly at the griffin on the knocker which appeared to stare back again with a derisive grin     chapter ii  a cinder and a spark   one of the few snowstorms of the memorably mild winter of 1876 was coming quietly down watched with lazy interest by the passengers in a certain train that rumbled leisurely toward the city without it was cold and wintry enough but within as hot as an oven for with the usual american disregard of health there was a roaring fire in the stove every ventilator shut and only one man in the crowded car had his window open  toward this reckless being many a warning or reproachful glance was cast by rheumatic old gentlemen or delicate women who led the lives of hothouse flowers but the hearty young fellow sat buried in his newspapers regardless alike of these expressive glances and the fresh wind that blew in an occasional snowflake to melt upon his shoulder hair or beard  if his face had not been obscured by the great sheet held before it an observer might have watched with interest the varying expressions of amusement contempt indignation and disgust which passed over it as he read for it was a very expressive face and too young yet to have put on the mask men so soon learn to wear he was evidently one of the strong cheery sympathetic sort of fellows who make their way everywhere finding friends as they go from the simple fact that they are so full of courage and goodwill it is impossible to resist them this had been proved already for during that short journey three old ladies had claimed his services in one way or another a shy little girl had sat upon his knee for half an hour and left him with a kiss and an obstreperous irish baby had been bribed to hold its tongue by the various allurements he devised to the great amusement as well as gratitude of his neighbors  just now however he looked rather grim knit his brows as he read and finally kicked his paper under the seat with an expression which proved that he had as much energy as kindliness in his composition and no taste for the sorrowful record of scandal dishonesty and folly daily offered the american public  upon my word if this sort of thing goes on much longer the country wont be fit for a decent man to live in he said to himself taking a mouthful of fresh air and letting his eyes wander over the faces of his fellowtravellers as if wondering which of the eminently respectable gentlemen about him would next startle the world by some explosion of iniquity even the women did not escape the scrutiny of the keen blue eyes which softened however as they went from one possible delilah to another for john harris had not yet lost his reverence for womankind  suddenly his wandering glance was arrested a look of recognition brightened his whole countenance and an involuntary hullo rose to his lips instead of the romantic ha tis she with which novel heroes are supposed to greet the advent of the charmer  the object which wrought so swift and pleasant a change in the young mans mood and manner was a girls face seen in profile some seats in front of him a modest little hat with a sweeping feather rested easily on a mass of wavy hair which was not spoilt by any fashionable device but looped up in a loose sort of braid from which rebellious tendrils here and there escaped to touch her white throat or shade her temples one particularly captivating little curl twined round her ear and seemed to be whispering some pleasant secret for the blooming cheek dimpled now and then the soft lips smiled and the eyes were full of a dreamy thoughtfulness a book lay in her lap but her own fancies seemed more interesting and she sat watching the snowflakes flutter down lost in one of the delightful reveries girls love quite unconscious of the admiration of her neighbors or the fixed stare of the young man behind her  miss dolly by all thats good he said to himself suddenly forgetting the sins of his native land and finding it quite possible to stop a little longer in it she said she was going to town with the old things and there she is prettier than ever if it hadnt been for those provoking papers i should have seen her when she got in and might have secured a seat by her that stout party evidently doesnt appreciate his advantages i cant order him out but ill watch my chance for i really ought to apologize for my stupidity yesterday wonder if she has forgotten all about it  and john fell into a reverie likewise for he was in just the mood to enjoy any thing so innocent and fresh and sweet as the memory of little dolly at her spinningwheel it all came back to him with a redoubled charm for there was a homelike warmth and simplicity about it that made the recollection very pleasant to a solitary fellow knocking about the world with no ties of any sort to keep him safe and steady he felt the need of them and was all ready to give away his honest heart if he could find any amiable creature who could be satisfied with that alone for he had nothing else to offer he was rather fastidious however having an artists refined taste in the matter of beauty and a manly mans love of the womanliness which shows itself in character not clothes but he had few opportunities to discover his ideal woman and no desire to worship a fashion plate so here was an excellent heart to let and no one knew it unless they had the skill to read the notice in the window  the reveries of both young people were rudely disturbed by the stout party who having finished his paper and taken a comprehensive survey of his thoughtful little neighbor suddenly began to talk as if he did appreciate his advantages and meant to make the most of them  john watched this performance with deep interest and it soon became rather exciting for miss dollys face was a telltale and plainly betrayed the rapid transitions of feeling through which she passed the respectful attention she at first gave in deference to the age of the speaker changed to surprise then to annoyance lastly to girlish confusion and distress for the old gentleman was evidently of the pecksniffian order and took advantage of his gray hairs to harass the pretty damsel with his heavy gallantry  poor miss dolly looked vainly about her for any means of escape but every seat was full and she was quite unconscious that an irate young man behind her was burning to rush to the rescue if he had only known how as no way appeared john was forced to content himself with directing such fiery glances at the broad back of the ancient beau it was a wonder they did not act like burningglasses and set that expanse of broadcloth in a blaze  a crisis soon arrived and womans wit turned the tables capitally for when the old gentleman confiscated her book under pretence of looking at it and then laying his arm over the back of the seat went on talking with a fat smile that exasperated her beyond endurance dolly gave him one indignant glance and opened her window letting in a blast of cold air that made her tormentor start and shiver as if she had boxed his ears  good if that does not rout the enemy im much mistaken said john to himself enjoying it all with the relish of a young man who sees an old one usurping his privileges  the enemy was not routed but his guns were silenced for having expostulated with paternal solicitude he turned up his coatcollar and retired behind his paper evidently much disgusted at finding that two could play at the game of annoyance though the girl had to call the elements to her aid  if i dared id offer to change seats with him not because he is suffering agonies at the idea of getting ticdouloureux or a stiff neck that would only serve him right but because she will get the worst of it there she has already confound that cinder why didnt it go into his eye instead of hers added john as he saw the girl shrink suddenly and begin to wink and rub her eye with distressful haste while the stout party took advantage of the mishap to close the window with an expression of vengeful satisfaction on his rubicund visage he offered no help for his first rebuff still rankled in his memory but placidly twirled his thumbs with a sidelong glance now and then at his companion who finding all her winking and rubbing in vain shrouded her face in a veil and sat a pathetic picture of beauty in distress with an occasional tear rolling over her cheek and her dear little nose reddening rapidly with the general inflammation caused by that fatal cinder  this affecting spectacle was too much for john who not only felt the chivalrous desire of a man to help the gentle sex but remembered that he owed the girl a good turn for her hospitality the day before not to mention the apology he quite burned to make knowing that the train would soon stop a few minutes for the passengers to lunch he resolved then and there to cast himself into the breach and deliver the doubly afflicted damsel at all costs  happily the station was reached before any great damage was done to the girls features or the young mans impatience became uncontrollable the instant the stout gentleman rose to seek refreshment john dived for his valise and cleaving his way through the crowded aisle presented himself beside the empty place asking with an attempt to look and speak like a stranger which would not have deceived dolly a bit had she not been halfblind is this seat engaged madam  no sir she answered unveiling to discover what new affliction fate had sent her  it was delightful to see the one wistful eye light up with a look of recognition the one visible cheek flush with pleasure and the lips smile as they added with the impulsive frankness of a tormented girl oh please take it quickly or that dreadful man will come back  quite satisfied with his welcome john slipped into the coveted place resolving to keep it in spite of a dozen stout gentlemen  thanks now what else can i do for you he asked with such an evident desire to lend a hand somewhere that it was impossible to decline his services  could you take this thing out of my eye it hurts dreadfully and i shall be a spectacle by the time i get to aunt marias answered dolly with a little moan that rent the hearers susceptible heart  that is just what i want to do and you may trust me for ive been a great traveller and have had much experience in the extraction of cinders said john adding as he produced a pencil in a capable sort of way now open your eye wide and well have it out in a jiffy  dolly obeyed with a courage and confidence most flattering and john peered into the suffering eye with an intensity which it was impossible for the most artful cinder to escape  i see it he cried and turning back the lid over his pencil he delicately removed the black atom with a corner of dollys veil  it was all over in an instant and both displayed great nerve and coolness during the operation but as soon as it was done dolly retired into her handkerchief and john found himself as flushed and breathless as if he had faced some great danger instead of merely looking into a girls eye ah but it was a very eloquent eye in spite of the cinderlarge and soft tearful and imploring and the instant during which he had bent to examine it had been a most exciting one for the halfopen lips were so near his own their hurried breath fanned his cheek the inquisitive little curl tumbled over her ear to touch his wrist as he held up the eyelid and a small hand had unconsciously clutched softly at his arm during the inspection bless you the famous scene between uncle toby and the widow wadman was entirely surpassed on this occasion because the actors were both young and neither artful  such relief sighed dolly emerging from a brief retirement with a face so full of gratitude that it was like a burst of sunshine after an eclipse  let me see if it is all right and john could not resist another look into the clear depths through which he seemed to catch delicious glimpses of an innocent young heart before maiden modesty drew the curtain and shut him out as the long lashes fell a sudden color in her cheeks seemed to be reflected upon his and with a hasty  it is a good deal inflamed so im going to prescribe a wet bandage for a few minutes if you can spare your handkerchiefhe hurried away to the water tank near by  thats very comforting thank you so much and dolly patted her invalid eye assiduously while john feeling that he had earned his place planted his valise on the seat with a defiant glance over his shoulder then turned to dolly saying you must have some lunch and waiting for no denial dashed out of the car as if on an errand of life and death  he was gone but a moment or two but in that time dolly had smoothed her hair retied her hat whisked a nicer pair of gloves out of her pocket and taken a rapid survey of herself in a tiny glass concealed from other eyes in the recesses of her bag she had just time to close and cast the aforesaid bag recklessly upon the floor as her knight came up bearing a cup of tea and a block of cake saying in the pleasantly protecting way all women like  dr harris prescribes refreshment after the operation and this is the best he can find your aged admirer was at the counter eating against time and defying apoplexy he added with a laugh as dolly gratefully sipped the tea which by the way was as weak as that made at the famous boston teaparty when as every one knows water was liberally used  you saw him then when he was plaguing me  i did and longed to throw him out of the window  thanks did you recognize me before you spoke  of course i did and wanted to approach but didnt dare till the cinder gave me an excuse  the idea of being afraid of me  how could i help being afraid when you told me miss dolly was awful asked john twinkling with fun as he sat on the arm of a seat sociably eating a sandwich which under other circumstances would have struck him as being a remarkable combination of sawdust and soleleather  before dolly could reply except by a guilty blush a bell rang and john hurried away with the empty cup  a moment or two later the stout gentleman appeared wiping his mouth evidently feeling in a better humor and ready to make up with his pretty neighbor smiling blandly he was about to remove the valise when miss dolly laid her hand upon it saying with great dignity this seat is engaged sir there are plenty of others now and i wish this for my friend  here john who was just behind seeing his prize in danger gave a gentle shove to several intervening fellowbeings who in turn propelled the stout party past the disputed place which the young man took with an air of entire satisfaction and a hearty thank you which told dolly he had overheard her little speech  she colored beautifully but said with grateful frankness  it wasnt a fib a friend in need is a friend indeed and in return for the cinder im glad to give you a seat  blessed be the cinder then murmured john feeling at peace with all mankind then taking advantage of the propitious moment he added in a penitential tone  i want to apologize for my stupidity and unintentional rudeness yesterday  about what asked dolly innocently though her eyes began to sparkle with amusement  why taking it into my head that miss hill must be oldish and going on in that absurd way about spinsters  well i am a spinster and not so young as i have been i ought to apologize for not telling you who i was but it was so very funny to hear you go on in that sober way to my face i couldnt spoil it said the girl with a look that upset johns repentant gravity and they laughed together as only the young and happy can  it is very good of you to take it so kindly but i assure you it weighed upon my conscience and it is a great relief to beg pardon he said feeling as if they had been friends for years  have you been sketching old things ever since asked dolly changing the conversation with womanly tact  yes i went to several places further on but didnt find any thing half so good as your chair and tankard i suppose you are taking the relics to town now  all but one  which is that  the pumpkin hood it is the only thing my stepmother admires among my treasures and she would not give it up you rather admired it didnt you asked dolly with her demurest air  i deserve to be laughed at for my panic answered john owning up manfully then pulled out his sketchbook with an eye to business even in the middle of a joke  see here i tried to get that venerable hood into my sketch but couldnt quite hit it perhaps you can help me  let me see them all said dolly taking possession of the book with a most flattering air of interest  nothing there but queer or famous things all a hundred years old at least began john quite forgetting his stolen sketch of a pretty girl cleaning a snuffertray which he had worked up with great care the night before perhaps this made the book open at that particular page for as the words left his lips dollys eyes fell on her own figure too well done to be mistaken even if the artists face had not betrayed him  what queer or famous old person of the last century is that please she asked holding it off and looking at it through her hand while her lips broke into a smile in spite of her efforts to look unconscious  knowing that a pretty woman will easily forgive a liberty of that sort john got out of the scrape handsomely by answering with mock gravity  oh thats madam hancock when a girl did you never see the famous portrait at portsmouth  no the dress is rather modern and not quite in keeping with the antique chair she is sitting in observed the girl critically  thats to be added later i have to work up things you knowa face here a costume there and so on all artists do  so i see theres the hood but it wants a cape and dolly turned the leaf as much amused at his quickness as flattered by his compliment  there were not many sketches as yet but she admired them all and when the book was shut chatted on about antiquities feeling quite friendly and comfortable for there was respect as well as admiration in the honest blue eyes and the young man did not offend as the old one had done  as you are interested in curiosities perhaps you may like to see some that i have here in my bag i am very fond and proud of them because they are genuine and have histories of old times attached to them she said presently  i shall feel much honored by being allowed to look at them replied the artist remembering that people used to laugh at poor miss dolly and her duds  this little pin made of two hearts in diamonds and rubies with a crown above used to be worn by my mothers great aunt madam hancock she was a quincy you know and this long garnet buckle fastened the governors stock began dolly displaying her store with a gentle pride pleasant to see  most interesting but i cant help feeling grateful that this j h doesnt have to wear a stock requiring a footlong buckle like that answered john picturing himself in the costume of the past century and wondering if it would suit his manly face and figure  now dont laugh at this relic for it is very curious though you wont appreciate it as a woman would and dolly unfolded an oldfashioned housewife of red velvet lined with faded yellow damask that was made by my dear mother out of a bit of the velvet lining of the governors statecoach and the coverlet that a french comte tore with his spurs  come that sounds well i appreciate coaches and spurs if im not up to brooches and needlebooks tell the story please besought john who found it the most delightful thing in the world to sit there following the pretty motions of the small hands the changeful expression of the winsome face and enjoying the companionship of the confiding creature beside him  well you see when madam married captain scott many of the governors things were taken from her among them the statecoach by the way it is said to be in existence now stored away in somebodys barn down in portland you had better go and sketch it began dolly smoothing out the old housewife and evidently glad to tell the little story of the ancestress whom she was said to resemble though she modestly refrained from mentioning a fact of which she was immensely proud  i will and john soberly made a memorandum to visit the ancient coach  when my greatgreat aunt was told she must give up the carriage she ripped out the new velvet lining which had been put in at her expense and gave the bits to her various nieces mother made a spencer of hers and when it was worn out kept enough for this needlebook the lining is a scrap of the yellow damask counterpane that was on the bed in which the frenchman should have slept when he came with lafayette to visit madam only he was so tipsy he laid on the outside and tore the fine cover with his spurs theres a nice comte for you  id like to see the spurs nevertheless any more treasures and john peered into the bag as if he thirsted for more antiquarian knowledge  only one and this is the most valuable of all stoop down and look im afraid i may be robbed if i display my things carelessly  john obediently bent till the sweeping feather of her hat touched his cheek to the great annoyance of the banished peri who viewed these pleasant passages from afar with much disfavor  this is said to be madams wedding ring i like to think so and am very proud to be named for her because she was a good woman as well as a  beauty put in john as the speaker paused to open a faded case in which lay a little ring of reddish gold  i was going to sayas well as a brave one for i need courage added the girl surveying the oldfashioned trinket with such a sober face that the young man refrained from alluding to the remarkable coincidence of another john and dolly looking at the wedding ring together  she seemed to have forgotten all about her companion for a moment and be busy with her own thoughts as she put away her treasures with a care which made it a pleasure to watch her tie knots adjust covers repack her little bag and finally fold her hands over it saying gravely  i love to think about those times for it seems as if people were better thenthe men more honest the women more womanly and every thing simpler and truer than now does it ever seem so to you  indeed it does for this very day as i read the papers i got quite lowspirited thinking what a shameful state things have got into money seems to be the one idea and men are ready to sell their souls for it answered john as soberly as she  money is a good thing to have though and dolly gave a little sigh as she drew her scarf over the worn edges of her jacket  so it is echoed john with the hearty acquiescence of a man who had felt the need of it  my name and these old treasures are all my fortune and i used to be contented with it but im not now dependence is so hateful added the girl impulsively then bit her lip as if the words had escaped in spite of her  and this is all mine said john twirling the pencil which he still held giving confidence for confidence and glad to do it if it made them better friends for he pitied little miss dolly suspecting what was true that her home was not a happy one  she thanked him mutely for the kind look he gave her and said prettily  skill is money and it must be a very pleasant life to go about drawing beautiful or curious things  so it is sometimesyesterday for instance he answered laughing  i have no modern accomplishments to earn a living by mine are all oldfashioned and no one cares for such nowadays except in servants i may be very glad of them though for playing lady doesnt seem half so honest as going out to service when one has nothing but an empty pair of hands she said with a wistful yet courageous look at the wintry world outside which made her companion feel a strong desire to counsel and protect this confiding young columbus who knew so little of the perils which would beset her voyage in search of a womans el dorado  come to me for a recommendation before you try it i can vouch for your cooking you know but id advise you to play lady till you discover a good safe place i dont believe youll find it hard for the world is likely to be very kind to such as you he answered so cheerily that she brightened like a flower to which a stray sunbeam is very welcome  a shrill whistle announced that the journey was over and everybody began at once to fuss and fumble john got up to take his valise from the rack and dolly began to struggle into her rubbers she was still bending down to do this with as little damage as possible to her best gloves when she heard a sounding slap and a hearty voice cry out  hullo john then add in a lower tone so there is a mrs harris you sly dog you  hush there isnt how are you george returned another voice beginning in a hurried whisper and ending in an unnecessarily loud salutation  what happened for a minute or two after that dolly did not know for the rubbers proved so refractory that she only rose from the encounter flushed and hurried as the train entered the station  let me make myself useful in looking after your baggage said her selfconstituted escort handing her out with great respect and care  thank you all my things come by express so ive nothing to do but get into a carriage  then allow me to see you safely there for the sake of the treasures if nothing else and john led her away utterly ignoring the presence of george who stood looking after them with a face full of goodhumored interest and amusement  im very much obliged goodby said dolly from the coach window  not goodby im coming to the fair you know answered john lingering at the door as if loath to lose sight of his little friend  i forgot all about it  i didnt for i depend on the cakes and ale and all the other good things promised me  you will find them there with a smile and then a sudden blush as she remembered that he had not only agreed to speak to miss dolly but to win her old heart  he remembered also and laughed as he bowed with the same audacious look he had worn when he made that rash vow  i wonder if he will come thought the girl as she drove away  as if i should forget said john to himself as he trudged through the snow quite regardless of his waiting friend for from the little cinder had been kindled a spark of the divine fire that moves one of the great engines which transport mankind all the world over     chapter iii  confidential   john harris promised to do the fair and kept his word handsomely for he was there every day for a week lunching in the oldfashioned kitchen and then in his official capacity sketching every relic he could lay his eyes on such punctuality caused the pretty waiters to smile affably upon this faithful devourer of primitive viands and the matrons to predict great things from the young artists application to his work  little guessed the girls and the gossips that love was ravaging their generous patrons heart more persistently than he did their tables and that nature not art caused his devotion to modern beauty rather than ancient ugliness for all john saw in the crowd that filled the place was dolly tripping to and fro tray in hand spinning at her wheel or resting beside aunt maria twin sister of mrs hill in an imposing cap instead of the pumpkin hood pretty dolly was the belle of the kitchen for she alone of all the dozen damsels on duty looked her part and was in truth a country girl rich in the oldfashioned gifts and graces of health modesty housewifely skill and the sweet maidenliness which girls who come out at sixteen soon lose for ever her dress too was wonderfully complete and becoming though only a pink and white chintz a mobcap and an uncompromising apron with the pinball scissors keys and linen pocket hanging at the side the others looked like stage soubrettes and acted like coquettish young ladies who knew nothing about their work but dolly was genuine throughout so she proved a great success and aunt maria took all the credit of it to herself felt that she had done a good thing in bringing so much youth energy and loveliness to market and expressed her satisfaction by talking a great deal about our family which as she was a smith was certainly large enough to furnish endless gossip  another person watched admired and hovered about the girl like a bluebottle fly about a rose and that was mr aaron parker a dapper little man of fifty who having made a snug fortune was now anxious to marry and settle aunt maria was evidently his confidant and friend and it was soon apparent that aunt maria intended to make a match between her niece and this amiable gentleman who set about his wooing with oldfashioned formality and deliberation  all this john saw heard or divined with the keenness of a lover while he watched the events of that week for he very soon made up his mind that he adored miss dolly as he always called her to himself the short time which had elapsed between the car episode and the opening of the fair seemed endless to him and when he came beaming into the kitchen the very first day his heart sang for joy at sight of that bonny face once more she welcomed him so kindly served him so prettily and showed such frank and friendly pleasure at meeting him again that the lonely fellow felt as if he had suddenly found a large and attached family and yielded to the charm without a struggle she seemed to belong to him somehow as if he had discovered her and had the first right to admire help and love her for he alone of all the men there had seen her at home had looked deepest into the shy bright eyes and heard her call him friend  this delightful state of things lasted for a few days during which he felt as if quaffing nectar and tasting ambrosia while he drank the promised cider and ate the spicy sweethearts which dolly always brought him with a smile that went directly to his head and produced a delicious sort of intoxication he never could have but a word or two she was so busy but as he sat apart pretending to sketch he was living over those brief blissful moments and concocting wonderfully witty wise or tender speeches for the morrow  well for him that no one looked over his shoulder at such times for his portfolio would have betrayed him since it was a wild jumble of andirons and mobcaps antique pepperpots and pretty profiles spinningwheels and large eyes with a profusion of lash while a dainty pair of feet in highheeled slippers seemed to dance from page after page as if the artist vainly sought to exorcise some persistent fancy by booking it over and over again  suddenly a change appeared both in the man and in his work for parker had arrived and clouds began to gather on the horizon which was rosy with the dawn of love now john discovered that the cider was sour and the cake stale for the calls of a voracious rival cruelly abbreviated his moments of bliss now he glared and brooded in corners where once he had revelled in dreams of a dim but delightful future now the pages of his sketchbook bore grotesque likenesses of a round snubnosed countenance in all sorts of queer places such as a clockface under a famous cocked hat or peeping out of a memorable warmingpan while a dapper figure was seen in various trying attitudes the most frequent being prone before the dancing feet one of which was usually spurning a fat moneybag with contempt in every line of the pretty slipper  at this stage the fair ended and aunt maria bore the charmer away leaving john to comfort himself with the memory of a parting look of regret from behind governor hancocks punchbowl which dolly embraced with one arm while the other guarded madams best china teapot  maddening was it to haunt the street before aunt marias door and hear a gay voice singing inside fit to melt a paving stone to say nothing of a young mans heart more maddening still to catch occasional glimpses of the girl shut up in a carriage with the dragon or at concerts and theatres under the escort of mr parker but most maddening of all was the frequent spectacle of this enamoured gentleman trotting up the street simpering to himself as he went and freely entering at the door which shut the younger lover out of paradise  at such trying periods john now very far gone indeed for love feeds on air would feel a wild desire to knock the little man down storm aunt marias mansion and carry his dolly away from what he felt assured was an irksome bondage to the girl but alas where could he carry the dear creature when he had got her for all the home he possessed was one room in a dull boardinghouse and his only fortune the salary his pencil earned him then as he groaned over these sad facts a great temptation would assail him for he remembered that with a word he could work the miracle which would give him half a million and make all things possible but the keeping of his own selfrespect  hard times just then for john harris and for some weeks he went about his daily duties with such a divided mind and troubled spirit that the stoniest heart might have pitied him but comfort came when least expected and in trying to help another he got help himself and hope beside  one gusty march morning he arrayed himself in his best put a posy in his buttonhole and went gallantly away to aunt marias door bound to make a call in spite of her frowns at the fair and evident desire to ignore his existence since boldly ringing the forbidden bell he inquired for the ladies both were engaged and as if nothing should be wanting to his chagrin as he went down the steps mr parker bearing a suggestive bouquet went up and was instantly admitted  it was too much for poor john who rushed away into the park and pulling his hat over his eyes tramped wrathfully down the mall muttering to himself  its no use i must give in for with a fortune in my pocket i could carry all before mebribe aunt maria outbid aaron and win my dolly if im not much mistaken  just then a sharp yelp roused him from his excited reverie and looking up he found that he had kicked a fat poodle who was waddling slowly along while some way before him went a little figure in a gray hat at sight of which johns heart gave a leap here was bliss dolly alone at last and he could defy the dragon and all her machinations parker and his fine bouquet were nowhere harris and his buttonhole posy had the best of it now and leaving the fat poodle to whine and waddle at its own sweet will the happy man hurried forward to make the most of this propitious moment  as he drew near he observed that a handkerchief went more than once to the face which drooped in a thoughtful way as the feet paced slowly on  bless her heart she is catching cold and dreaming dreams here all alone thought john as stepping to her side he said gently that he might not startle her goodmorning miss dolly  he did startle her nevertheless and himself as well for as she turned quickly he saw that her face was bathed in tears instantly all his own troubles took wing and with no thought but how to comfort her he said impetuously  i beg pardon but do tell me what is the matter he came upon her so suddenly that there was no time to hide the telltale tears he looked so eager kind and helpful she could not be offended at his words and just then she needed a friend so much it was hard to resist confiding in him yet womanlike she tried to hide her little worries to make light of her girlish grief and turn a brave face to the world so she brushed the drops from her eyes put on a smile and answered stoutly  it was very foolish of me to cry but it is so dull and lonely here i think i was a little homesick  then perhaps you wont mind if i walk on a bit with you and apologize for kicking your little dog said john artfully availing himself of this excuse  no indeed he is aunt marias dog but how came you to do it asked the girl plainly showing that a human companion was very welcome  i was in a brown study and did it by accident hes so fat it didnt hurt him much answered the young man assuming his gayest manner for her sake then he added with an excuse which did not deceive her a bit  the fact is id ventured to call on you to see if i could get a sketch of the punchbowl but you were engaged the girl said and i was rather disappointed  what a fib im sorry i was out but the house was gloomy and aunt rather cross so i ran away under pretence of giving old tip an airing  ah you dont know what you lost mr parker went in as i came out with such a nosegayfor aunt maria i suppose and john tried to look quite easy and gay as he spoke  dollys face darkened ominously and a worried look came into her eyes as she glanced behind her then quickened her steps saying with a little groan that was both comic and pathetic  it does seem as if it was my doom to be tormented by old gentlemen i wish youd get rid of this one as you did of the other  nothing would give me greater pleasure answered john with such heartiness that a sudden color dried dollys wet cheeks as she remembered that he had got rid of tormentor number one by taking his place  cheered by the knowledge that a champion was ready to defend her she ventured to show him a safer way in which to serve her saying very soberly  i think i may be glad of the recommendation you once promised me should you mind giving it  are you tired of playing lady so soon he asked anxiously  so tired that i felt today as if id like to run away and take service with the first person who would engage me  dont exclaimed john with such energy that the fat poodle barked shrilly and made a feeble charge at his boots feeling that something was wrong somewhere run away home if you must run but pray dont get discouraged and do any thing rash he went on with great earnestness for he saw by her face that she was in some real trouble  i havent even a home to run to for mrs hill agrees with aunt that its time i ceased to be a burden its very hard when i only ask a safe corner in the world and am willing to work for it cried the girl with an irrepressible sob for the trials of many weeks had grown unbearable and a kind word made the full heart overflow  neither spoke for a minute then john said with a respectful earnestness which touched her very much  miss dolly you once called me a friend and i was very proud to be so honored forget that i am any thing else and if you have no one wiser and older to consult trust me and let me help you ive knocked about the world enough to know how hard it is for a man to get an honest living doubly hard for a woman especially one as young and beautiful as you are there are safe corners i am sure but it takes time to find them so pray be patient and do nothing without care  i called you a friend in need and so you are for strange as it may seem there is no one to whom i can go for disinterested advice i know so little of the world that im afraid to trust my own judgment yet i am driven to decide between dependence of a sort i despise or to stand alone and take care of myself will you advise me and she looked up with an appealing glance which read such a reassuring answer in the honest eyes full of sincerest sympathy that she was comforted before he spoke  indeed i will for what are we all here for if not to help one another do you know i think there is a sort of fate about these things and its no use to struggle against it we seem to be two lone lorn creatures thrown together in queer ways so lets agree to be old friends and stand by each other come is it a bargain  he seemed so firmly convinced of the inevitability of this fate that the girl felt relieved from farther scruples and agreed in all good faith  now about the troubles began john trying to look old reliable and wise for he guessed the one she was most reluctant to tell  i suppose marrying for an establishment or earning their bread is a question most poor girls have to settle sooner or later observed dolly in a general sort of way as an opening for in spite of his praiseworthy efforts her young counsellor did not succeed in looking like a sage  if pretty yes if plain no we neednt discuss the latter class but go on to the question returned john keeping to the subject in hand with masculine pertinacity  id rather be an old mans housekeeper than his wife but people wont believe it and laugh at me for being what they call so foolish said the girl petulantly for she did not seem to be getting on well with her confidences  i thought from what i saw at the fair that parker seemed ready to offer both situations for your acceptance  john could not help saying that for a jealous pang assailed him at the mere idea he feared that he had spoilt the rôle he was trying to play but it happened to be the best thing he could have done for the introduction of that name made things much easier for dolly as she proved by kindling up as suddenly as if the word had been a match to fire a long train of grievances  he did and aunt scolds me from morning till night because i wont accept the fine establishment he offers me thats what i was sent here for my stepmother wants me out of the way aunt maria hands me over to mr parker and he takes me because i know how to cook and nurse i might as well be put up at auction and sold to the highest bidder she cried with eyes flashing through indignant tears  its abominable echoed john with equal indignation though the words highest bidder rung in his ears as he thought of the fortune waiting for him and the youth which would tell so strongly in the race against old parker as he irreverently called the little man for fifty seems a patriarchal age to fourandtwenty  i know that sort of thing is done every day and thought quite right but i am so oldfashioned it seems terrible to marry merely for a home yet im very tired of being poor and i should like a taste of ease and pleasure while i can enjoy them added dolly with a very natural longing for the bright and happy side of life  and i could give her all she wants thought john with the temptation getting stronger every minute but he only said a little bitterly youd better give in if you want ease and pleasure for money can buy any thing  no it cant buy love and that is better than all the splendor in the world answered the girl in a tone that thrilled her hearer to the heart what i call love seems to have gone out of fashion and that is what troubles me because if there isnt any such thing i may as well take the next best and try to be contented no one seems to value love for itself alone to feel the need of it as much as light and air to miss it when it goes or try to earn and keep it as the most precious thing in the world money and position are every thing and men work and women marry for these as if they had no other hope or end and im frightened at the things i see and hear in what is called society  poor child i dont wonder but i assure you there is an ocean of love in the world only it gets put out of sight in the rush wasted on those who dont deserve it or dammed up by adverse circumstances it exists though the real genuine article waiting for a market do believe it and wait for it and im sure it will come in time  john was so divided between a rash impulse to prove his point by a declaration then and there and the conviction that it would be altogether premature his metaphors got rather mixed and he had to pull himself up abruptly but dolly thought it a beautiful speech was glad to believe every word of it and accepted this piece of advice with admirable docility  ill wait and meantime be looking about for the safe corner to run to when aunt maria gets tired of me because i dont mean to go home again to be a burden then as if anxious to slip away from a too interesting topic she asked with a very winning expression of interest and goodwill  now what can i do for you im sure you have worries as well as i and though not very wise perhaps i might advise in my turn  you are very good but i couldnt think of troubling you and the young man looked both pleased and flurried by the girls offer  we agreed to help one another you remember and i must do my part or the bargain wont be a fair one tell me what the brown study was about and ill forgive the kick poor tip got persisted dolly for her feminine instinct told her that a heavy cloud of some sort had been lifted to let sunshine through for her  john did long to know her opinion on a certain matter but a mans pride would not let him speak as freely as the girl had done so he took refuge in a mild subterfuge and got advice on false pretences  it was only a quandary i was in about a friend of mine he wants my judgment in a case something like yours and perhaps you could help me with an opinion for women are very wise in such matters sometimes  please tell me if you may i should so love to pay my debts by being of some use and dolly was all attention as she pushed back her vail as if to get a clear and impartial view of the case about to be submitted  fixing his eyes on the sparrows who were disporting themselves among the budding elmboughs john plunged abruptly into his story never once looking at his hearer and speaking so rapidly that he was rather red and breathless when he got through  you see jack was plodding along after a fashion all by himself his people being dead when an old friend of his fathers took it into his head to say come and be a son to me and ill leave you a handsome fortune when i die a capital thing it seemed and jack accepted of course but he soon found that he had given up his liberty and was a slave to a very tyrannical master who claimed him soul and body heart and mind that didnt suit jack and he would have broken away but as you say he was tired of being poor and wanted a little ease and pleasure in his life the old man was failing and the money would soon be his so he held on till he suddenly discovered that this fortune for which he was waiting was not honest money but like many another great fortune had been ground out of the poor swindled out of honest men or stolen from trusting friends and hoarded up for a long lifetime to be left to jack with the curse of dishonesty upon it would you advise him to take it  no answered the girl without a moments hesitation  well he didnt but turned his back on the illgotten money and went to work again with clean but empty hands added john still looking away though his face wore a curiously excited expression under its enforced composure  im glad very glad he did wasnt it noble of him asked dolly full of admiring interest in this unknown jack  it was very hard for you see he loved somebody and stood a poor chance of winning her without a penny in his pocket  all the nobler in him then and if she was worth winning shed love him the more for the sacrifice said dolly warmly for the romance of the story took her fancy though it was poorly told  think so ill mention that to jack it will cheer him up immensely for hes afraid to try his fate with nothing to offer but his earnings  whats his business asked dolly suddenly  connected with newspapersfair salary good prospectsnot ashamed to work answered john staring hard at the sparrows and wiping his forehead as if he found the bleak day getting too warm for him  is the girl pretty  the most captivating little creature i ever beheld cried john rapturously  oh indeed and dolly glanced at him sharply while a shadow passed over her face as she asked with redoubled interest is she rich  has nothing but her sweet face and good name i believe  isnt that enough  indeed it is but jack wants to make life beautiful and easy for her and he can by saying a word he is awfully tempted to say it for the old man is dying has sent for him to come back and there is yet time to secure a part of the fortune he wont take it all but has a fancy that if he leaves half to charity it would be a sort of purification to the other half and he might enjoy it with his love dont you think so  no it would spoil the whole thing why cannot they be contented to begin with nothing but love and work up together earning every clean and honest penny they spend it would be a comfort to see such a pair in this mercenary world and i do hope they will do it said the girl heartily though a slightly pensive tone had come into her voice and she stifled a small sigh as she put down her vail as if there was nothing worth seeing in the landscape  i think they will try it answered john with decision as he smiled sympathetically at a pair of sparrows chirping together at the door of one of the desirable family mansions provided for their use  here tip ended the dangerous dialogue by sitting down before dolly with a howl of despair which recalled her to her duty  the poor old thing is tired and must go in goodmorning and many thanks she said turning toward the steps which they would have passed unseen but for the prudent poodles hint  goodby and a thousand pardons for boring you with my affairs began john with a penitent yet very grateful glance  by the way ive been so interested in jacks affairs that ive forgotten exactly what your advice was to me she added pausing on the upper step for a last word  with his hat in his hand and his heart in his eyes john looked up and answered in a tone that made few words necessary  dont sell yourself for a home  and dolly answered back with a sweet shrewd smile that made him flush guiltily  dont smother your conscience with a fortune     chapter iv  april fools   tips constitutionals were taken with praiseworthy regularity about that time and the poor asthmatic animal was nearly walked off his legs by the vigor with which his little mistress paraded the park at unfashionable hours a robust young man who did not look as if he needed early walks was continually meeting dolly by accident as it were till on the fourth rencontre they both burst out laughing gave up all further subterfuge and felt that it was vain to struggle against fate the next time they met both looked very sober and john said watching her face as he spoke  it is all over with me miss dolly the old man is dead and my chance is lost for ever  you look so solemn im afraid he left you something after all  not a penny all went to various charities and i have nothing but my salary and these two hands  im glad of that id like to shake those honest hands and wish them all success may i she said putting out her own with such cordial approval in voice and eyes that john lost his head and holding both the small hands fast in his answered all in one fervently incoherent burst  may you let me keep them and then i shall succeed dearest dolly you said you didnt want any thing but love and heres a whole heart full aching to be poured out you said youd like to see jack and his wife working their way up together contented to be poor heres jack and the wife he wants if she cares enough for him to try that beautiful experiment you said you hadnt any home to run to when those cruel women called you a burden run to me my darling and be the pride and joy and comfort of my life  no one saw what dolly did but tip who sat lolling out his tongue in an imbecile manner and no one heard what she said but some brightfaced crocuses blooming early in that lonely corner of the park but from what took place afterward it was evident that her reply had not been entirely unpropitious for her hand lay on johns arm her face was in an april state between smiles and tears and to her eyes midsummer warmth and radiance seemed to have fallen suddenly upon the earth it is hardly necessary to mention that the other party in this little transaction looked as if he owned the entire world was yearning to embrace all mankind and had nothing more to ask of heaven in the way of happiness  you dont regret saying yes like an angel asked this unreasonable lover five minutes after he had surprised her into uttering that momentous monosyllable  not yet  you know that it is very selfish of me to ask you when ive nothing to give and very unwise in you to take me because you have much to lose  why what  the devoted parker and his plump pocketbook  it was good to hear dolly laugh at that and to see john glance defiantly at an elderly gentleman in the distance as if all that harmless portion of the race ought to be exterminated to leave room for happy young fellows like himself  he will believe now that when i say no i mean it answered dolly with an assumption of dignity which changed with comic suddenness to one of dismay as she added oh my heart what will aunt maria say  dont tell her just yet or she will shut you up whisk you away or do some awful thing to part us keep this delicious secret for a little while and we can enjoy many happy minutes in peace  yes john with a docility that was altogether captivating to the new commanderinchief  i must look about me and be getting ready to take you into my home as well as my heart when the storm breaks there is sure to be one i fancy and for my part i rather relish the idea the air will be clearer and things more settled after it  i dont know what they will say and do to me but i shall not mind now i have you to take care of me and dollys other hand went to join the one on johns arm with a confiding gesture which glorified the old coatsleeve in his eyes more than any badge it could have worn  i suppose we must live somewhere and eat occasionally since we are mortal love certainly is the best capital to start on but a trifle of cash is necessary likewise so we must take a little thought for the morrow wish the city would provide us with a house rent free and board thrown in as it does our feathery confidants here observed the husband elect eying the sparrows with a vague sense of domestic cares already stealing over his masculine mind  dont think of all those worries yet just love and be happy for a time and things will settle themselves somehow cried dolly whose womanly nature would not be so soon defrauded of the sweet romance which comes but once in a lifetime  very well well give a month to clear bliss and then talk about the honeymoon  but with the charming inconsistency of her sex no sooner had she forbidden a subject than she felt an intense desire to talk about it and after a moments pause during which her lover had been looking down at her thoughtful face in silent rapture dolly emerged from a brief reverie clapping her hands and exclaiming  john ive got the most delicious idea that ever was now dont laugh and say it isnt practical for i know it is and it would be so new and appropriate and economical and altogether nice that i hope youll approve we shall want a home by and by shall we not  i want it now if youve no objection  be serious well a room or two must content us at first and we want them to be decent not to say pretty and comfortable dont we  they cant help being all three if you are there my dolly  no john not in public now answer me this wont you have to save up a long time to get enough to buy furniture and things no matter how simple  im afraid i should for at present my housekeeping stock is about as large and varied as that of tommy traddles his consisted of a birdcage and a toastingfork i believe mine of an easel and a bootjack wouldnt they do to begin with  please dont joke but listen for this is the new idea take my dear old relics and furnish our nest with them what could be more economical picturesque and appropriate for this centennial year  dolly stopped short to see how this amazing proposal struck her lord and master it seemed to take him off his legs for he sat suddenly down upon a seat that fortunately was behind him and looked up at the beaming little woman with an expression of admiration and contentment which answered her question so emphatically that she nestled down beside him with all her doubts laid at rest  i thought youd like it now lets plan it all out and see what weve got every thing is as old as the hills you know but still so good and strong we can get years of wear out of it we dont have such wellmade furniture nowadays she went on happily blind to the deficiencies of the timeworn chairs clumsy tables and cracked china which were all her store  my blessing on every stick of it i wasnt thinking about the furniture though i was rejoicing over the fact that if i neednt save up for that sort of thing we could be married all the sooner thats the beauty of the idea dont you see and john regarded the originator thereof with unmitigated satisfaction  so we can but do think about the furniture because you ought to be interested in helping me make an artistic home said dolly knowing that the word artistic would arrest his attention and keep him to the subject in hand for as yet the other idea was too new to bear much discussion  i will in fact i see it now all complete two or three rooms in an old house if possiblethey are always the cheapest my love so dont look as if you saw cobwebs and blue mould and felt black beetles running over your feet in one room well have that spiderlegged table on which you cleaned the snuffer tray and the clawfooted chairs there were three i thinkone for each of us and the third for a friend then on the dresser well put all the porringers out of which we are to eat mush and milk and the pewter platters for an occasional biled dishthats the proper name for the mess isnt it likewise the dear fat teapots the red china cups all cracked the greenhandled knives and forks the wooden spoons funny pepperpots and all the rest of the droll rattletraps  dont forget the tankard cried dolly as john paused for breath in the middle of his rhapsody  that will be in our parlor set forth in state on the little stand i used to have my lunch at during the fair im afraid i scratched your initials all over it that being a trick of mine about that time  i thought you did it never mind but go on please  we shall put flowers in the immortal mug and i shall paint them earn sums and grow famous such will be the inspiration of my surroundings for while i sit in the generals chair at my delightful work you in the pretty chintz gown and the flyaway cappromise me to wear it or i wont go on  ill wear any thing you like in the house and can have a waterproof and a linen duster for the street artists wives usually do have to make guys of themselves i believe  thank you dear well you will always be doing one of three things making sweethearts spinning or looking over my shoulder i prefer the latter occupation on the whole and when im at home that will be your mission during my absence you can attend to the housework you love so well and do so prettily never did i see such brilliant candlesticks in my life and as for the copper teakettle it was like a mirror i saw you steal peeps at it more than once little vanity that day as i sat stealing a sketch of you  then you think it can be done john ignoring the accusation  it not only can but it shall be done and i shouldnt wonder if we set the fashion of furnishing bridal bowers with relics of all sorts throwing in a gluepot gratis to mend up the old things when they tumble to pieces im great at that and can get my living as a cabinetmaker when art fails  i do believe you can do every thing john  no i couldnt cure pneumonia if you should get it by sitting in this chilly wind now ive got you i intend to take great care of you my little treasure  it was so sweet to dolly to be cared for and so delightful to john to do it that they forgot all about poor tip till he tumbled into the pond and was with difficulty fished out by his ears and tail being too fat to do any thing but float this catastrophe shortened an interview which might otherwise have been prolonged till nightfall for      lightly falls the foot of time     that only treads on flowers  why john do you know that this is the first of april asked dolly as they went homeward with tip forlornly dripping in the rear a very fitting day for such an imprudent couple as we are to begin their journey she added enjoying the idea immensely  so it is never mind well prove that we are no fools though a mercenary world may call us so returned john as blithe as she  alas poor things they thought their troubles were all over now they had found each other whereas a cruel fate was laughing at them round the corner     chapter v  the declaration of independence   unfortunately for these deluded young persons their month of bliss turned out to be the most tempestuous one they had ever passed for before the first week was over some malignant imp inspired aunt maria to spy from a certain end window which commanded a corner of the park the lingering adieux of the lovers and then it was all up with them  a single stormy debate during which john manfully claimed his dolly she stoutly defended her right to love whom she chose and aunt maria thundered and lightened unavailingly resulted in the banishment of the claimant the strict seclusion of the damsel and the redoubled devotion of the decorous but determined parker who cheered on by his ally still besieged the rebellious heart undaunted by the reinforcements lately received  the prospect was certainly not a hopeful one but the young people never lost courage rather enjoyed it on the whole and revolved endless schemes in their busy brains which they confided to one another by means of notes slipped under tips collar when he took his solitary airings on the steps for a time persecution lent its zest to their love but presently separation grew unbearable and they were ready for revolt  i must see you wrote john in note number 37  you shall answered dolly and bade him meet her at one of the many centennial balls which afflicted the world in 187576  to hear was to obey and though said ball was to be eminently select thanks to a skilful use of his middle name john was able to keep the appointed tryst well knowing that there is no solitude like that to be found in a crowd costumes were in order and there was a general resurrection of ancient finery which made the handsome hall look as if time had rolled back a hundred years every one who had a hair powdered it and those who had not made up the deficiency by imposing wigs spindlelegged gentlemen affected topboots and spurs those blessed with a manly development of calf pranced in silk stockings and buckled shoes british and continental uniforms amicably marched shoulder to shoulder dimity and brocade mingled prettily together and patriotic ardor animated the hearts under the lace stomachers and embroidered waistcoats as warmly as of old for the spirit of 76 was all alive again  aunt maria looked like a parrot of the most brilliant plumage for the good lady burned to distinguish herself and had vainly tried to wear a suit of madam hancocks belonging to dolly fortunately madam was a small woman and aunt maria quite the reverse so she was forced to give it up and content herself with being one of many martha washingtons who filled the dowagers corner  so dolly bloomed into the sweetest little oldtime lady ever seen and was in truth by nature as by name a dorothy quincy not as the matron but as the maid with all her curly locks turned over a roller before they fell on her white neck where shone the jewelled hearts she prized so much lilies of the valley embroidered her white gown and nestled among the lace that rose and fell upon her bosom from under her quilted satin petticoat her little feet stole in and out wearing madams weddingshoes so high in the heels and so pointed at the toes that dolly suffered martyrdom with a smiling face and danced at the risk of her life long gloves with lafayettes likeness stamped on the back kept splitting at the timeworn seams so plump were the arms inside a quaint scentbottle hung at her waist and she hid her blushes behind a great fan whose dim mirror had reflected faces history has made immortal  you are simply perfect miss hill and nothing could be added whispered the still hopeful parker who was on duty and much elated by the fact for the girl was unusually friendly that evening for reasons of her own  except the governor she answered peeping over her fan with eyes full of anxiety as well as merriment for john had not yet appeared and the little man beside her was very funny in a voluminous white neckcloth furred coatcollar and squaretoed shoes carefully kept in the first position he had longed to personate the character she suggested stature forbade however and he had contented himself with personating benjamin franklin flattering himself that his placid countenance and neat legs would be remarkably effective also the fact that he had been connected with the printing interest in early life  if you had only told me i would have attempted it for your sake you have but to express a wish and i am charmed to gratify it murmured the enamoured benjamin with a tenderly reproachful sigh which stirred his rampant shirtfrill like a passing breeze  at that moment as if a wish had brought him a veritable john hancock stood before them looking comelier than ever in a velvet suit as he laid his cocked hat upon his heart and asked with a bow so deep that it afforded a fine view of the garnet buckle in his stock  may i have the honor madam  glad to hide a traitorously happy face dolly made him a splendid curtsey and took his arm with a hasty  excuse me mr parker please tell aunt im going to dance  butbutbutmy dear miss i promised not to lose sight of you stammered the defrauded franklin turning red with helpless rage as the full audacity of the lovers burst upon him  well you neednt wait for me here till my dance is over then aunt wont know any thing about it laughed wilful dolly over her shoulder as she was swept away into the manycolored whirlpool that circled round the hall to the entrancing music of a waltz  while it lasted words were needless for eyes did the talking smiles proud or tender telegraphed volumes of poetry the big hand held the little one so close that it burst quite out of the old glove rosy with the pressure and the tall head was often so near the short one that the light locks powdered the dark ones  a heavenly waltz panted dolly when it ended feeling that she could go on for ever blind to the droll despair of poor parker as heroically faithful to his trust he struggled frantically to keep the happy pair in sight  now well have a still more heavenly promenade in the corridor ben is busy apologizing to half a dozen ladies whose trains he has walked up in his mad career after us so we are safe for a time answered john ready to brave the wrath of many aunt marias for the revolutionary spirit was high within him and he had quite made up his mind that resistance to tyrants was obedience to the little god he served just then  oh john how glad i am to see you after all this worry and how nice it was of you to come in such grand style tonight i was so afraid you couldnt manage it said dolly hanging on his arm and surveying her gallant governor with pardonable pride  my blessed girl there was nothing i couldnt manage with the prospect of meeting you before me hasnt it been hard times for both of us youve had the hardest im afraid shut up with the dragon and no refuge from daily nagging and parkers persecution if you hadnt the bravest little heart in the world youd have given up by this and taking advantage of a shadowy corner john embraced his idol under pretence of drawing her cloak about her  ill never give up the ship cried the girl quoting lawrence of the chesapeake with a flash of the eye good to see  stand to your guns and well yet say weve met the enemy and they are ours answered john in the words of brave perry and with a ring to his voice which caused a passing waiter to pause fancying he was called  beckoning to him john gave dolly a glass of lemonade and taking one himself said with a look that made the toast a very eloquent one to both of them  the love of libertyandthe liberty of love  they drank it silently then paced on again so intent upon their own emotions that neither saw a flushed and agitated countenance regard them from a doorway and then vanish smiling darkly  governor  dearest madam  things have come to a crisis and ive taken a resolution began dolly remembering that time was short  so have i  this is mineim going to philadelphia  no  yes  how when why  be calm and listen aunt has given me just three days to choose between accepting p and being sent home in disgrace i dont intend to do either but take matters into my own hands and cease to be a burden  hear hear but how  at the fair the kitchen was a success and there is to be a grand one at the exposition girls are wanted to wait there as here they are taken care of and all expenses paid while they serve i know some nice people who are going for fun and im to join them for a month at least that gives me a start and afterward i certainly can find something to do in the city of brotherly love  the knowledge that im to be there on duty had nothing to do with this fine plan of yours hey my dolly and john beamed at her with such a rapturous expression she had to turn him round lest an advancing couple should fancy he had been imbibing something stronger than lemonade and love  why of course it had she answered with adorable candor dont you see how lovely it will be to meet every day and talk over our prospects in peace while we are working away together till we have earned enough to try the experiment we planned in the park  stopping short john grasped the hand that lay on his arm looking as if suddenly inspired and exclaimed in a solemn yet excited tone  ive got a plan a superb plan only it may startle you a bit at first why not marry and go together  before dolly could find breath to answer this momentous question a bombshell in the shape of aunt maria exploded before them and put an end to the privy conspiracy and rebellion  you will not go anywhere together for my niece is in the care of this gentleman i did think we should be free from annoyance here but i see i was mistaken mr parker will you oblige me by taking dolly home at once  every feather in the old ladys gray wig trembled with ire as she plucked the girl from one lover and gave her to the charge of the other in whom the conflicting emotions of triumph and trepidation were so visible that the contrast between his countenance and costume was more comical than ever  but aunt it isnt time to go yet protested dolly finding submission very hard after her taste of freedom  it is quite time for persons who dont know how to behave with propriety in public not a word take my wrap and go at once mr parker please leave her in mrs cobbs care and return to enjoy yourself there is no reason why your evening should be spoilt and aunt maria bundled poor dolly into an ugly shawl which made her look like a lovely tearose done up in brown paper  this sudden fall from the height of happiness to the depths of helpless indignation left john speechless for an instant during which he with difficulty resisted a strong desire to shake aunt maria and spit benjamin franklin on the sword that hung at his side the sight of his dolly reft from him and ruthlessly led away from the gayety she loved reminded him that discretion was the better part of valor and for her sake he tried to soften the dragon by taking all the blame upon himself and promising to go away at once but while he was expostulating the wary parker carried off the prize and when john turned to say goodnight she had vanished and aunt maria stalked away with a grim laugh at his defeat  that laugh made him desperate and rushing downstairs he was about to walk away in the rain regardless of the damage to his costly suit when the sound of a voice checked his reckless flight and looking back he saw dolly pausing on the stairs to say with a glance from the ancestral shoes to the wet pavement outside i dont mind wetting my feet but i cannot spoil these precious slippers please get my overshoes from the dressingroom ill wait for you here  certainly certainly and my coat also we must be prudent after such heat and excitement replied mr parker glad to guard himself against the rheumatism twinges which already began to afflict his lightly clad extremities  as he hurried back a voice whispered dolly and regardless of the perilously high heels she ran down to join a black velvet gentleman below who said in her ear as he led her toward the door  i must have a word more let me take you home any carriage will do and its our last chance  yes john yes but oh my shoes and for one instant dolly lingered as reverence for her relics contended with love for her governor  but he was equal to the occasion and having no cloak to lay under his queens feet just took her in his arms and before she knew it both were in the coach an order given and they were off  oh john how could you was all she said casting away the big shawl to put both hands on the powdery shoulders before her for her escort was on his knees quite in the style of the days when sir charles willoughby carried evelina off in his chariot  how he did it john never knew but there he was as unconscious of his long limbs as if he had been a cherub so intent was he on improving this precious moment  id like to do a great deal more than that but not tonight though im sorely tempted to run away with you dolly he answered feeling as if it would be impossible to relinquish the little bundle of silk and swans down his arm enclosed  oh john please dont how could i in this dress and no place to go to or any thing  dont be frightened dear i wont be rash but seriously it must come to that and the sooner the better so make up your mind to it and ill manage all the rest this is my plan and yours will make it all the easier we will go to philadelphia but well be married first and that shall be our wedding journey  but im not ready we havent any money and only three days i couldnt john i couldnt and dolly hid her face glad yet halffrightened at this prospect of such a release from all her woes  i knew it would startle you at first but getting married is the easiest thing in life when you set about it you dont want any wedding finery ive got money enough and can borrow more if i need it and three days is plenty of time to pack your trunk have a farewell fight with aunt maria and run away to be the happiest little wife that ever was say yes darling trust every thing to me and please god you never shall regret it  dolly had doubted the existence of genuine love nowadays and john had assured her that there were oceans of it there certainly seemed to be that night and it was impossible to doubt the truth of his assertion while listening to the tender prayers and plans and protestations he poured into her ear as they rolled on regardless of the avenging furies behind and the untried fate before them storms raged without but peace reigned within for dolly showed signs of yielding though she had not consented when the runaway ride ended  as john set her down in the hall he added as a last appeal  remember there were daughters of liberty as well as sons in the old times you love so well be one and prove yourself worthy of your name as you bid me be of mine come sweetheart resist tyranny face poverty love liberty and declare your independence as bravely as they did  i will and dolly signed the declaration her hancock headed by giving him her hand and sealing the oath with a kiss  one word more he said hurriedly as the clatter of an approaching carriage sounded through the street i may not be able to see you again but we can each be getting ready and meet on monday morning when you leave for home in good truth put a lamp in the end window the last thing sunday night as the bells ring nine then i shall be sure that all is right and have no delay in the morning  yes john  goodnight and god bless you  there was no time for more and as distracted parker burst out of one carriage and aunt maria came tumbling after happy john harris stepped into the other with a wave of the cocked hat and drove away in triumph     chapter vi  peace is declared   the age of miracles is not over yet and our young people wrought several during those three days for in loves vocabulary there is no such word as fail  dolly stood to her guns womanfully and not only chose to go home but prepared for her banishment with an outward meekness and an inward joy which made each hour memorable aunt maria had her suspicions and kept a vigilant watch she and her maid cobb mounting guard by turns parker finding that no surrender was the countersign raised the siege and retreated in good order though a trifle demoralized in dignity when he looked back during the evacuation and saw tip bolt upright in the end window with the rebel flag proudly displayed  john meanwhile was circulating briskly through the city and showing such ardent interest in the approaching exposition that his mates christened him centennial harris while the higher powers felt that they had done a good thing in giving him the job and increased his salary to make sure of so excellent a servant other arrangements of a private but infinitely more interesting nature were successfully made and he went about smiling to himself as if the little parcel done up in silver paper which he was constantly feeling for in his vest pocket had been a talisman conferring all good gifts upon its happy owner  when the third night came he was at his post long before the time so great was his impatience for the fourfooted traitor had been discovered and ordered into close confinement where he suffered not the fate of andré but the pangs of indigestion for lack of exercise after the feast of tidbits surreptitiously administered by one who never forgot all she owed to her fat friend  it seemed as if nine oclock would never come and if a policeman ever was where he should be the guardian of that beat would have considered john a suspicious character as he paced to and fro in the april starlight at last the bells began to chime promptly the light appeared and remembering how the bell of the old state house rang out the glad tidings a hundred years ago john waved his cherished parcel joyfully exclaiming independence is declared ring ring ring then raced across the park like another paul revere when the signal light shone in the steeple of the old north church  next morning at an early hour a carriage drove to aunt marias door and with a stern farewell from her nightcapped relative dolly was sent forth to banishment still guarded by the faithful cobb the mutinous damsel looked pale and anxious but departed with a friendly adieu and waved her handkerchief to tip disconsolate upon the doormat the instant they turned the corner however a singular transformation took place in both the occupants of that carriage for dolly caught cobb round the neck and kissed her while smiles broke loose on either face as she said gleefully  you dear old thing what should i have done without you am i all right i do hope its becoming i had to give up every thing else so i was resolved not to be married without a new bonnet  its as sweet as sweet can be and not a bit the worse for being smuggled home in a marketbasket returned the perjured cobb surveying with feminine pride and satisfaction the delicate little bonnet which emerged from the thick veil by which its glories had been prudently obscured  heres a glass to see it in such a nice carriage with white horses and a tidy driver so appropriate you know its a happy accident and im so pleased prattled the girl looking about her with the delight of an escaped prisoner  bless your heart miss its all mr harriss doings hes been dodging round the corner ever since daylight and there he is now i do declare i may as well go for a walk till your train is off so goodby and the best of lucks my dear  there was barely time for this brief but very hearty congratulation when a remarkably welldressed highwayman stopped the carriage without a sign of resistance from the grinning driver cobb got out the ruffian armed not with a pistol but a great bouquet of white roses got in and the coach went on its way through the quiet streets  may day and here are your flowers my little queen  oh john  a short answer but a very eloquent one when accompanied with full eyes trembling lips and a face as sweet and lovely as the roses  it was quite satisfactory to john and having slightly damaged the bridal bonnet without reproof he manlike mingled bliss and business by saying in a tone that made poetry of his somewhat confused remarks  heaven bless my wife we ought to have had the governors coach today isnt cobb a trump to get us off so nicely never saw a woman yet who could resist the chance of her helping on a wedding remembered every thing i told her that reminds me wasnt it lucky that your relics were boxed up in dear aunt marias shed so all cobb had to do was to alter the directions and send them off to philadelphia instead of home  ive been in a tremble for three days because it seemed as if it couldnt be possible that so much happiness was coming to me are you quite sure you want me john asked dolly careless for once of her cherished treasures for she had been busy with hopes and fears while he was attending to more material affairs  so sure that ive got something here to bind you with do you mind trying it on to see if it fits for i had to guess at the size answered john producing his talisman with all a bridegrooms pride and eagerness  please let me wear that as a guard and use this one to be married with ive a superstition about it for it suits us and the year better than any other and dolly laid the little ring of reddish gold beside the heavier one in johns palm  so it does and you shall have it as you like do you know when you showed it to me three months ago i had a fancy that it would be the proper thing for me to put it on your finger but i didnt dream i ever should are you very certain that you dont regret the advice you gave my friend jack asked the young man thinking with fond solicitude of the great experiment that lay before them for he knew by experience how hard this worlds ways sometimes are and longed to smooth the rough places for the confiding little creature at his side  do i look as if i did she answered simply but with a face so full of a true womans instinctive faith in the power of love to lighten labor sweeten poverty and make a heaven of the plainest home that it was impossible to doubt her courage or fear her disloyalty  quite satisfied john pocketed the rings and buttoned dollys gloves saying while she buttoned his both marvellously enjoying this first service for each other almost there now and in less than half an hour we shall be so safe that all the aunt marias in christendom cant part us any more george has stood by me like a man and a brother and promised that every thing should be all right the church will look a trifle empty i dare say with only five of us to fill it but i shall like it better than being made a spectacle of so will you i fancy  the church i thought runaways were married in an office by a justice and without much ceremony to make it solemn im very glad it isnt so for i shall never have but one wedding and id love to have it in a sacred place faltered dolly as a sudden sense of all it meant came over her filling her girlish heart with tender awe  i knew that dear and so i did my best to make you feel no lack of love as i could not give you any splendor i wish i had a mother to be with you today but george has lent me his so there will be a womans arms to cry in if you want to drop a tear and fatherly old dr king will give you to the happiest man alive well well my dolly if youd rather cry here and then let me dry your tears as please heaven i will do all your life  so kind john so very kind i cant thank you in words but ill show by deeds how much i honor trust and love my husband and nobly dolly kept her word  no one saw them as they went in but the early sunshine made a golden path for them to tread and the may wind touched them with its balmy kiss no congratulatory clamor greeted them as they came out but the friendly sparrows twittered a wedding march and the jovial george sent them merrily away by saying as he gave johns hand a parting grasp  i was right you see and there is a mrs harris  if any one doubts it let him look well about him and he may discover the best thing america could send to her exposition an oldfashioned home and in it an ambitious man who could not be bought a beautiful woman who would not be sold a young couple happy in their love and labor consecrating this centennial year by practising the oldfashioned virtues honesty and thrift independence and content
