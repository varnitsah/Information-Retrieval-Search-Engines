the tyranny of the dark     i  the setting   the village of colorow is enclosed by a colossal amphitheatre of dovegray stone in whose niches windwarped pines stand like spectators silent and waiting six thousand feet above the valley floor green and orange slopes run to the edges of perennial icefields while farther away and peering above these almost inaccessible defences like tents of besieging titans rise three great mountains gleaming with snow and thunderous with storms altogether a stage worthy of some colossal drama rather than the calm slumber of a forgotten hamlet  the railway enters the valley from the south by sinuously following the windings of a rushing foamwhite stream and for many miles the engines cautiously feel their way among stupendous walls passing haltingly over bridges hung perilously between perpendicular cliffs by slender iron rods or creep like mountaincats from ledge to ledge so that when they have reached safe harbor beside the little red depot they never fail to pant and wheeze like a tired gratified dog beside his masters door aside from the coming and going of these trains the town is silent as the regarding pines  the only other ways of entrance to this deep pocket lie over threadlike trails which climb the divide from silver city and toltec and vermilion and loop their terrifying courses down the declivities trod only by the sturdy burro or the agile surefooted mountainhorse these wavering paths worn deep and dusty once are grassgrown now for they were built in the days when silver was accounted a precious metal and only an occasional hunter or prospector makes present use of them  colorow itself once a flaming tumultuous centre of miners gamblers and social outcasts is now risen or declined to the quiet of a new england summer resort supported partly by two or three big mines whose white ore is streaked with gold but more and more by the growing fame of its mountains and their medicinal springs for these splendid peaks have their waters hot and cold and sweet and bitter whose healing powers are becoming known to an evergrowing number of those americans who are minded to explore their native land  this centre of aërial storms these groups of transcendent summits would be more widely known still but for the singular sense of proprietorship with which each discoverer regards them the lucky traveller who falls into this paradise is seized with a certain instant jealousy of it and communicates his knowledge only to his family and his friends nevertheless its fame spreads slowly and each year new discoverers flock in growing numbers to the one little hotel and its ramshackle bathhouse so that the community once absolutely and viciously utilitarian begins to take timid account of its aesthetic surroundings and here and there a little logcabin as appropriate to this land as the chalet to the alps is built beside the calling ripples of the river while saddled horses laden burros in long lines and now and then a vast yellow or red orewagon creaking dolefully as it descends still give evidence of the mining which goes on far up the zigzag trails towards the soaring shining peaks of the continental divide     ii  the maid on the mountainside   one day in july a fair young girl with beautiful gray eyes sat musingly beside one of these southern trails gazing upon the inverted pyramid of red sky which glowed between the sloping shoulders of the westward warding peaks her exquisite lips scarlet as strawberry stains were drawn into an expression of bitter constraint and her brows were unnaturally knit her hat lay beside her on the ground her brown hair was blowing free and in her eyes was the look of one longing for the world beyond the hills she appeared both lonely and desolate  it was a pity to see one so young and so comely confronting with sad and sullen brow such aërial majesty as the evening presented it was indeed a sort of impiety and the girl seemed at last to feel this her frowning brow smoothed out her lips grew more girlish of line and at length rapt with wonder she fixed her eyes on a single purple cloud which was dissolving becoming each moment smaller more remote like a fleeing eagle yet burning each instant with even more dazzling flame of color than beforehasting as if to overtake the failing day a dream of still fairer lands of conquest and of love swept over herbecame mirrored in her face she had at this moment the wistful gaze which comes to the eyes of the young when desire of the future is strong  upon her musings a small sound broke so faint so far she could not tell from whence it came nor what its cause might be it might have been the rattle of a pebble under the feet of a nearby squirrel or the scrambling rush of a distant bear a few moments later the voice of a manvery diminished and yet unmistakablecame pulsing down the mountainside  the girl rose as lightly as gracefully as a fawn who roused but not affrighted stands on her imprint in the grass and waits and listens  the man or menfor another voice could now be heard in answercame rapidly on and soon a couple of men and a small packtrain came out of a clump of thick trees at the head of a gulch and doubling backward and forward descended swiftly upon the girl who stood with some natural curiosity to let the travellers whoever they might be pass and precede her down to the valley she resented them for the reason that they cut short her reverie her moment of spiritual peace  the man who first appeared was a familiar type of the west a small lean sharpfeatured foxyeyed mountaineer riding gracefully yet wearilythe natural horseman and trailer behind him two tired horses heaped with a camp outfit stumbled with lowhanging heads while at the rear sitting his saddle sturdily rather than with grace rode a young man bareheaded but otherwise in the roughandready dress of a plainsman his eyes were on the sunset also and something in the manner of his beard as well as in the poise of his head proclaimed him to be the master of the little train a man of culture and an alien  at sight of the girl he smiled and bowed with a look of frank and most respectful admiration quite removed from the impudent stare of his guide his hands were gloved he wore a neat shirt and his tie was in orderso much the girl saw as he faced herand as he passed she apprehended something strong and manly in the lines of his back and shoulders plainly he was not to the saddle born like the man ahead and yet he was quite as bronzed and travelworn  a turn in the trail brought them both close under her feet and again the man in the rear glanced up at the figure poised on the bowlder above him and his eyes glowed once more with pleasure there was in his look an expression of acknowledged kinship as of one refined soul to another a kind of subtle flattery which pleased while it puzzled the girl men with eyes of that appeal were not common in her world  the bitter look vanished out of her face she gazed after the trailer with the unabashed interest of a child wondering who he might be in that instant her soul impressionable and eager received and retained like a sensitive plate every line of his figure every minute modelling of his faceeven his fashion of saddle and the leather of his guncase remained with her as food for reflection and as she loitered down the trail a wish to know more about him rose in her heart there was a kind of smiling ecstasy on his face before he saw heras if he too were transported by the scene and this expression came at last to be the chief revelation of his character     illustration there was in his look an expression of    acknowledged kinship  the red went out of the sky the golden eagle of cloud flew home over the illimitable seas of saffron the purple shadows rose in the valleys the lights of the town began to sparkle enginebells clanged to and fro and the strains of a saloon band rose to vex the girls poetic soul with repugnant remembrances of the dancehall i suppose he is only camping through she thought a little wistfully referring back to the stranger i wish i knew who he is  as she came down to the level of the stream its friendly roar cut off the ribald music and the clamor of the engines precisely as the bank shut away the visible town leaving the little row of pretty cottages in the ward of the mountains and the martial ranked and towering firs  at the foot of the trail a grayhaired woman met her it was her mother disturbed indignant viola lambert what do you mean by staying up there after dark im all atremble over you  it isnt dark mother answered the girl and if it were it isnt the first time ive been out alone  mrs lamberts voice softened child i can hardly see your face you must not do such things i dont mind your being out on horseback but you must not go up there afoot it is dangerous with all these tramp miners coming and going  well dont scoldim here safe and sound  i havent had such a turn for years viola the mother explained as they waited side by side along the narrow walk i had an impressionso vividthat i dropped my work and ran to find you it was just as if you called me asking for help it seemed to me that some dreadful thing had happened to you  but nothing did i went up to see the sunset i didnt meet a soul she ended abruptly for she did not wish to retrace her sad reverie  who were the two men who came down just now they must have passed you  yes they passed mei didnt know them the one behind looked like an expert perhaps he has come to examine the san luis mine some one said they were expecting a man from england  he looked more like a frenchman to me  it may be he is answered viola restrainedly  they turned in at a rustic gateway opening into the yard of a small and very pretty logcabin which seemed a toy house so minute was it in contrast to the mighty firdecked wall of gray and yellow rock behind it flowers had been planted along the path and through the open door a redshaded lamp shone like a poppy plainly it was the home of refined and tasteful women a place where tall rude men entered timidly and with apologies  was there any mail asked the girl as she put aside her hat  not a thing  the shadow deepened on her small sensitive face oh why dont the girls write they should know how horribly lonely it is here im tired of everything today motherperfectly stoneblue i dont like what i am im tired of churchwork and the people here i want to go back east i want to change my life completely  the mother a handsome woman with fresh unlined face made no reply to this outburst gusta wont be back until late we will have to get our own supper  the girl seemed rather pleased at this opportunity to do something and went to her work cheerfully moving with such grace and lightness that the mother stood in doting admiration to watch her she was so tall and lithe and fullbosomedher one treasure  as she worked the shadow again lifted from the girls face a smile came back to her scarlet lips and she sang underbreath as only a young maiden can sing to whom love is a wonder and marriage a faroff dream  she recalled the look which lay on the face of the man who was riding with bared head in ecstasy of the scene above and below him but most of all she dwelt upon the gracious and candid glance of admiration with which he greeted her and which he repeated as he disappeared below her to be seen no more  this look went with her to her room and as she sat at her window which opened upon the river she wondered whether he had gone into camp in the pine groves just below the bridge or whether he had taken lodgings at the hotel  she had loversno girl of her charm could move without meeting the admiring glances of men but this strangers regard was so much more subtly exaltingit held an impersonal qualityit went beyond her entire understanding adding an element of mystery to herself to him and to the sunset     iii  the man   meanwhile the young tourist had alighted before the door of the principal hotel and after writing his name in a clear and precise hand on the book in the office had hastened to his supper carrying a most vivid recollection of the slender figure and flushed and speaking face of the girl on the trail that moment of meeting accidental and fleeting had already become a most beautiful climax of his pilgrimage she was born of the sunset she does not really exist he said with unwonted warmth of phrase how could this little mining town produce so exquisite a flower  his grosser needs supplied he lit his big students pipe and went out upon the upper story of the hotels rude porch and there sat listening to the rush of the stream while the great yellow stars appeared one by one above the lofty peaks and the air grew crisp to frostiness he was profoundly at peace with the world and himself his physical weariness being just sufficient to give this hour a sound completeness of content  as the beauty of the night deepened the girls beauty allured like the moon he still sought to explain her she is some traveller like myself he said bret harte to the contrary notwithstanding the wilderness does not produce maids of her evident refinement and grace she comes of a long line of wellbred people  he was not an emotional person and had not been permitted to consider pleasure the chief object even of a vacation but he went to his bed that night well pleased with colorow and with a halfdefined sense that this was after all the point towards which his long journey with all its windings had really tended however he was not ready to acknowledge that a large part of the charm of the place was due to the glamour of a slender maid lit by the sunset light  this delight in the town and its surroundings gained a new quality next morning as he looked from his window upon a single white cloud resting like a weary swan on the keen point of old kanab though the mesas of new mexico and the deserts of arizona were his special field he bared his head to the charm of the high country  each summer after months of prolonged peering into the hidden heart of microscopic things in his laboratory he was both analytical chemist and biologist it was his custom to return for a few weeks to huge crude synthetic nature for relief after endless discussion of whorls of force and of the office of germs in the human organism he enjoyed the racy vernacular of the plainsman to whom bacteria were as indifferent as blackberryseeds each year he resolved to go to the forest to the lake regions or to the mountains but as the day of departure drew near the desert and the strange peoples living thereon reasserted their dominion and so he had continued to return to the sand to the home of the horned toad and the rattlesnake these trips restored the sane balance of his mind to camp in the chaparral to explore the source of streams and to relive the wonder of the boy kept his faculties alert and keen  his love of the sands and the purple buttes of the plain did not blind him to the beauty of coloring and the gracious majesty of these peaks clothed as they were with the russet and gold and amber of ripened grasses which grew even to the very summits only the kingliest of the peaks were permitted to wear the ermine robes which denoted sovereignty the continental divide was indeed much more impressive than he had expected it to be  he was not one of those who seek out strange women and he had no hope of meeting the girl of the mountainside again he was content to have her remain a poema song of the sunseta picture seen only for a moment yet whose impression outlasts iron everything in nature had converged to make her momentous his long stay among the ugly dusky women of the desert his exultant joy in the mountain sunset and his abounding health which filled his heart with the buoyancy of a boyall these causes combined to revive emotions which his absorption in scientific investigation had set in the backgroundemotions which concern the common man but which the deeply ambitious chemist eager to discover the chemical molecular structure of the plasm must put aside with a firm hand     iv  a second meeting   viola was just leaving her mothers gate the following afternoon when a mans voice cordial assured and cultivated startled her  goodmorning is this your home  she looked up to meet the smiling eyes of the stranger horseman again an indefinable charm of manner robbed his greeting of offence and quite composedly she replied  yes this is our home  what a view you have and what music he indicated the river which ran white and broad over its pebbles just below the walk i am enchanted with the place i think you must love it very much  her face expressed a qualified assent oh yes but i get tired of it sometimes especially in winter when we are all shut in with snow  then you really are a yearround resident i suppose my view is the tourists view i cant believe anybody lives here in winter i hope you wont mind my introducing myselfhe handed her a card you made such a pretty picture up there beside the trail yesterday that i couldnt forbear speaking to you on a second meeting i wanted to know whether you were real or just a fragment of sunset cloud  the ease and candor of his manner joined to the effect of the name on the card fully reassured her and she looked up with a smile wont you come in and rest  thank you i should like particularly to do so ive been for a climb up that peak behind your cottage and im tired  her reserve quite melted the girl led the way to the door where her mother stood in artless wonder  mother this is dr serviss of corlear college  im glad to know you sir said mrs lambert with oldfashioned formality wont you come in  thank you it will be a pleasure  are you a physician she asked as she took his hat and stick  oh dear no nothing so useful as that im a doctor by brevet as they say in the army then as though acknowledging that his hostess was entitled to know a little more about her intrusive guest he added i am a student of biology mrs lambert and assistant to dr weissmann the head of the bacteriological department of corlear medical college we study germsmicroscopic bugs he ended with humorous glance at viola what a charming bungalow you have here did you gather those wild flowers  viola answered in the tone of a pupil to her master yes sir  but some of them grow high you must be a mountaineer pardon my curiosityit is inexcusablebut how long have you lived here  the mother looked at her daughter for confirmation eight years  of course you are from the east  yes from wisconsin  he laughed we call wisconsin a western state of course its the ignorant prejudice of the newyorker but i find it hard to think of you as actual residents of this faraway little town i thought only miners lived here  we are miners my husband has a mine up in the basin but hes putting in some new machinery just now and is unable to come down but once a week then mildly resenting his implied criticism of the town she added we have just as nice people here as youll find anywhere  he responded gallantly i am quite prepared to believe that mrs lambert but do many nice people like you live here all the year round he was bent on drawing the girl out but she did not respond  the mother answered i havent been away except to take my daughter east to school  he was cautious by east you mean milwaukee  diamond lake wisconsin  he turned to the girl how long were you away  four years  did you like it  very much  that is the reason you find it lonesome here up to this moment his attitude was that of a teacher towards a pretty pupil you miss your classmates i suppose still there must be diversions here even for a young girl  the mother sighed it really is very lonesome here for violaif it werent for her church work and her music i dont know what shed do there are so few young people and then her years at the seminary spoiled her for the society out here anyway  so much the worse for colorow society laughed serviss then to clear the shadow which had gathered on the girls face he said i see a fine piano and shelves of music books this argues that you love music wont you sing for me i am hungry for a song  i do not sing she replied coldly i have no voice  then play for me i have been for eight weeks on the desert and i am famishing for music  are you a musician asked mrs lambert  oh no only a musiclover  my daughter is passionately fond of the piano the mother explained and her teachers advised her to go on and make a specialty of it they recommended boston but viola wants to go to new york she wanted to go last year but i couldnt let her go id been without her for four years and mr lamberts affairs wouldnt permit us both to go and so she had to stay but it does seem too bad for one as gifted as she is to give it up  at this moment serviss changed his entire attitude towards these people they were too genuine too trustful and too fine to permit of any patronization and the girls dignified silence and the charm of her pellucid eyes and roseleaf lips quite transmuted him from the curious onlooker to the friend i can understand your dilemma he said with less of formal cheer and more of genuine sympathy and yet if your daughter has most decided talent it is only fair to give her a chance to show what she can do  the girl flushed and her eyes fell as the mother bent towards her visitor  i wish you would listen to her play dr serviss and tell me what you think of her talent  his eyes shone with humor i will listen with great pleasure but dont ask a chemist to judge a pianist i love musicit is a sweet noise in my earsbut i can hardly distinguish chopin from schumann he faced the girl play for me i shall be very deeply indebted as she still hesitated he added please do or i will certainly think you consider me intrusive  as viola slowly rose mrs lambert said you must not feel that way dr serviss we are highly honored to entertain one so eminent as you are i was brought up to value learning play for him viola  what is the reason for her reluctance serviss asked himself is it shyness or does she resent me  with a glance of protest at her mother the girl took her seat at the piano i will try she said bluntly but i know i shall fail  twice she laid her hands upon the keys only to snatch them away again as if they were whitehot metal and serviss fancied her cheek grew pale the third time she clashed out a few jarring chords intermixed with quite astonishing roulade on the treblean unaccountable interruption as if a third hand had been thrust in to confuse her she stopped and he began to share her embarrassment  she tried again shaking her head determinedly from side to side as if to escape some invisible annoying object it seemed as if some mocking sprite in the instrument were laboring to make her every harmony a discord and serviss keenly regretted his insistence  suddenly she sprang up with an impatient choking cry i cant do it he wont let me she passionately exclaimed and rushed from the room leaving her visitor gazing with pity and amazement into the face of the mother who seemed troubled but in no wise astounded by her daughters hysterical action she sat in silencea painful silence as if lacking words to express her thought and serviss rose rebuked and for the first time ill at ease  i beg your pardon mrs lambert i didnt intend to embarrass your daughter  she is very nervous  i understand being a complete stranger i should not have insisted one of the best singers i ever knew was so morbidly shy that on the platform she was an absolute failure her vocal chords became so contracted that she sang quite out of tune and yet among friends she was magnificent  the mothers voice was quite calm it was not your fault sir sometimes shes this way even when her best friends ask her to play thats why i fear she will never be able to perform in concertsshe is liable to these breakdowns  he was puzzled by something concealed in the mothers tone and pained and deeply anxious to restore the peaceful charm of the home into which he had in a sense unbiddenly penetrated i am guiltyunpardonably guilty i beg you to tell her that my request was something more than polite seemingi was sincerely eager to hear her play perhaps at another time when she has come to know me better she will feel like trying again i dont like to think that our acquaintance has ended thusin discord may i not come in again now that i am in a sense explained  he blundered on from sentence to sentence seeking to soften the stern straight line on the mothers lipsa line of singular repression sweet but firm  i wish you would come again i should really like your advice about violas future cant you come in this evening  i shall be very glad to do so at what hour  at eight perhaps she will be able to play for you then  with a feeling of having blundered into a most unpleasant predicament through a passing interest in a pretty girl serviss retreated to his hotel across the river     v  pupil and master   once out of the spell of the immediate presence of this troubled mother and her appealing daughter serviss began to doubt and to question they are almost too simple too confiding why should mrs lambert at a first meeting accidental and without explanation ask me to take thought of her daughters future the fact that his connection with an institution of learning gave him a sort of sanctity in their eyes did not weigh with him he was of those who take professorships in the modern waywith levity either real or assumed  i think on the whole id better keep out of this family complication whatever it may be he concluded this absence of the husband in the hills may be more significant than at present appearsit may be a voluntary sequestration i take the hint i am not seeking new responsibilities and i dont care to act as adviser even to a pretty girlespecially not to a pretty girl and he waved his hand in the manner of one declining a doubtful cigar  but this slim young witch with the scarlet lips and pleading gray eyes was not so easily banished his inward eye dwelt upon her with increasing joy how beautiful she was as she stood there on that bowlder perhaps she was posing she is now at the very height of her girlish charm what an appeal she must make to the men of this regionthose exquisite lipsthat pliant waistthat full bosom there is some antagonism between mother and daughtersomething more than appears on the surface she is both sullen and hysterical what a pity  she continued to trouble him as he sat again after his evening meal on the veranda of the hotel he could hear the slow tramp of heavy boots along the sidewalks beneath him and the roar of the colorow softened by distance rose and fell like a drowsy tune on the highest peaks the afterglow still lingered and from one of the little cottages deep in the shadow across the stream a light appeared like a signal an invitation and the blood in him being young accepted the lure he rose with the impulse im going why not tis a night for adventure theres no need of involving myself in any wise with their future im an outsider and will take precious good care to stay so his face was impassive but his heart was quick within him as he set foot on the bridge perhaps this is my rubicon he said and paused with a moments irresolution  his doubt his suspicion instantly vanished as he reentered the pretty little sittingroom and faced the sweetvisaged mother who tacitly acknowledged her daughter as the cause of his coming by saying  viola has just stepped over to the parsonage she will return in a moment wont you please be seated  serviss took a chair quite readyeven eagerto listen to the further confidences which he perceived his hostess was about to give him  i hope you wont think it strange professor  he interrupted her please dont call me professor  i beg your pardon sir i understood that you were a professor in a university  she seemed disappointed and he explained its true i am in the handbook as a member of the faculty and i plead guilty to the degree of doctor of philosophythat i am proud of but to be called professor robs me of my young humanity this humorous explanation seemed to confuse her and he added kindly and naturally really mrs lambert i am a chemist and experimentalist in biology i have no classroom work because the college prefers to have me make what they call original investigation and pray let me say that while i am very willing to assist your daughter or to advise you in any way i see very little of musical new york my work confines me to my shop very closely and when i go out i associate almost wholly with my peculiar kind however i can easily secure information as to the best schools of music for i have several friends who know all about it i interrupted youplease continue  this pleasant straightforward speech restored her confidence i think i was about to say sir that it may seem strange to you that i should so suddenly ask your advice but you see  oh not at all he genially interrupted i am consulted on all kinds of matters in fact i pass for a real doctorout on the trail i carry a little medicinecase for emergencies and i assume all the authority of the regular practitioneron occasion i shall be very sorry if my distaste for the title professor leads you to think me unsympathetic i shall be very glad to assist you in any way  thank you you see i was brought up to esteem learning and we seldom meet one of your eminencewe are so completely out of the world hereit is a great pleasure to us  footsteps just outside of the screendoor announced the return of the girl who entered composedly followed by a young man her manner was cold her glance aloof as she greeted serviss  im glad you came she said i was afraid you would forget us she turned towards her escort who had halted in the doorway professor serviss this is the reverend mr clarke the pastor of our church  as serviss shook hands with the reverend clarke he experienced a distinct shock of repulsionan unaccountable feeling for the clergyman was decidedly handsome at first sight but his hand was cold his face pallid and a bitter line the worn pathway of a sneer curved at one corner of his mouth unwholesome anæmic was servisss inward comment as he turned away to address the girl whose change of manner exerted a new witchery over him  she was dressed in black for some reason and her face seemed both sad and morose but the graceful dignity of her strong young body was enhanced by her dark gown her hands her feet were shapely without being dainty plainly these women come of good stock no matter what the husband and father may be serviss thought he resented the clergymans intrusive presence more and more is he brought in as a safeguard he asked himself  mr clarkes attitude was certainly forbidding he perched in grim expectant silence on the edge of his chair waiting watching his lean face had the bluewhite look of the muchshaven actor and his manner was as portentous as that of a tragedian  what the devil does he mean by staring at me like that serviss continued to ask himself does he expect me to go off like a bomb  he had started a discussion of the weather or some other harmless topic when clarke began in a deep voice with the formal inflections of the parson miss lambert tells me you are from corlear university professor  serviss groaned and threw up his hands with a comical gesture well let it go at that i suppose it explains me to call me professor yes i have a connection therei draw a salary from the institution  the clergyman regarded him soberly as did the women without sharing his humor in the least evidently being a professor in a university was no light thing to a western preacher she tells me you have proposed to act as her adviser  again serviss protested oh nothing so formidable as that my dear sir i have promised to make inquiries for her then obscurely moved to create a better impression in the girls mind he added i shall be very happy of course to do all that is in my power to aid you miss lambert but as i have just been saying to your mother i can only act through my friends nobody enjoys music more than i but no one can possibly know less about it in these days of specialization one is forced to ones own little groove in order to achieve practical results general culture is impossible to specially trained sharps like myself  what is your specialty may i ask inquired clarke remotely  i usually answer bugs but when i wish to be quite understood i explain that i am a physiological chemist and biologist at the present moment i am assistant in the pathological department of the corlear medical college  the preacher seemed to lighten a little ah that is a noble study a study of incalculable service to mankind i am deeply interested in that line of thought myselfi may say vitally interested for i suffer from lung trouble one by one the germs of disease are being discovered and their antitoxins catalogued it was evident that he was anxious to impress the women with his wonderful understanding of the scientists work and aims  his tone was so sententious that serviss instantly became flippant as an offset yes one by one we round em up but dont think me unfriendly to the beasts they have their uses id no sooner kill a bacterium than a songbird i think we care too highly for the cancerous and the consumptive im not at all sure that humanity oughtnt to be hackled like weeds and so toughen its hold on life germs may be blessings in disguise  clarke pursued his way how little we know about their reactionstheir secretions youve given some attention to the xray and its effect on these cells i presume  serviss inwardly grinned to think what weissmann would say at sight of his assistant sitting in solemn discussion of the germs and xrays with a village clergyman and two reverential women why yes ive considered it naturally any new thing that bears on my specialty makes me sit up ive even done a little experimenting with it  but have you considered the bearing of all these subtleties of science uponhe hesitatedaupon certainaoccult phenomena  serviss eyed him noncommittally well what for instance  well upon say telepathyandawell upon spiritual healingand the like  i cant say that i have i dont exactly see the connection furthermore i dont believe in these particular delusions my work concerns the material facts of life not the dying superstitions of the race i have no patience with any morbid theory of life  this remark plainly produced a sensation the preacher cast a significant glance at the mother and the girl looked away at the lamp a flush upon her face  hello exclaimed serviss under his breath have i discovered a neat of cranks ive been enlisted on somebodys sidei wonder whose  the clergyman faced him again and calmly asked have you ever investigated these occult phenomena  certainly not i have no time to waste on such imaginings my time is all taken in a study of certain definite processes in the living organism  a light began to glow in the eyes of the young clergyman i suppose you class mental healing among the delusions  most assuredly i do answered serviss with the remorselessness of youth  you would say that the mind of man cannot mend the body of another  if you mean directlyin the manner of faith cures and the likei would answer certainly not unless the disorder happens to be in itself due to a delusion i can imagine the hypochondriac being cured by mental stimulus he felt that he was drawing near the point at issue and his eyes shone with glee  the preacher set his trap you believe in the action of a drugsay prussic acidyou believe it will kill  yes and quite irrespective of the opinion of the one who takes it his thinking it water will not check or change its action in the slightest degree  but how does it kill persisted clarke what does it do  if you mean why at the last analysis does one drug attack cells and the other nourish them i answer frankly i dont knownobody knows  clarke pursued his point under the microscope the germ of say tetanus is a minute bar with spore at the end like the head of a tadpole of what is this cell composed  probably of a jellylike substance with excessively minute filaments but we dont know we are at the limit of the microscope we trace certain processes we even dissect certain cells but elemental composition of plasm remains a mystery  the preacher glowed with triumph then you confess yourself baffled the union of matter and spirit is beyond your microscope what do you know about a drop of water you say it is formed of hydrogen and oxygen in such and such proportions what is hydrogen why do they unite  i dont know calmly replied serviss we admit that any material substance remains inexplicable the molecule lies far below the line of visibility we only push the zone of the known a little farther into the realm of the unknown but how does that serve your argument  by demonstrating that the mind of a man is simply the mastering mystery in a world of mysteries and that there is no known limit to what it may do we say that at the point where life enters to differentiate the germ is beyond sciencethere of necessity faith is born  you say weare you an apostle of the new church asked serviss abruptly  the preacher visibly shrank i do not care to announce my growing conviction to my congregation at present but i find many things about the doctrine which appeal to me some form of spiritism is the coming religionin my judgment the old order changeth the traditional theologythe very faith i preachhas become too gross too materialistic for this age some sweeter and more mystic faith is to follow even science is prophesying new power for man new realms for the spirit you men of science pretend to lead but you are laggards you pore upon the culture of germs but shut your eyes to the most vital of all truths is the life beyond the grave of less account than the habits of animalculæ  the young scientist listened to this query with outward courtesy but inwardly his gorge rose i see one gain in your new position he answered lightly matter is no longer the dead inorganic godless thing which the oldtime theologians declared it to be matter so far from being some inert lump is permeated with lifeis life itself so far as we now know all the visible and tangible universe is resolvable into terms of forcethat is to say chemical process there may be no line of demarcation between the organic and the inorganic  and yet with your knowledge of the inscrutable final mystery of matter you set a mark at the grave you condemn all manifestation of the spirit all the phenomena of spiritism for example  condemn is not the wordwe simply say the phenomena are absurd the spirit cannot exist without the body  have you ever investigated a single form of spirit manifestation have you studied the claims of those who are in touch with the spirit world  no  the preachers sneer broke forth i cant see but you scientists are quite as dogmatic quite as bigoted as the theologians  serviss laughed it does look a little that way however im not as uninformed as i seem it happens that i am in close personal contact with men whose specialty is the study of morbid psychology and i know the quality of those who act as mediums for the return of the dead the intensity of the interest on the part of the little group before him was astonishing not to say appalling it is evident that the mother and her pastor are both of the new dispensation or worse was his thought but his natural courtesy led him to say placably there are mysteries in the world i admitin chemistry as in biologybut they seem to me to be different in very essence from the mysteries of spiritualism and all allied psychic phenomena which appear to me essentially absurd ignobleratty to use a slang phrasea faith founded upon things done in the dark always in the dark  the preacher flamed out at this i knew you would get round to that that is the reason why i began by drawing you out on the xray how little do we know of motion the xray moves in straight lines i understand while light has a wave motion hence they are antagonistic may it not be that the spirits of those gone before manifest by means of an unknown force which light neutralizes may this not be the explanation why the phenomena of the spirit world require darkness  it may answered serviss dryly but there is a far easier explanationbut see here he returned to his boyish humor this is my vacation i came out here to escape shop and here we are wasting time on xrays and spiritism and boring our patient hostess besides miss lambert wont you play for us and clear the air of our controversial dust  the girl who had been sitting during this conversation in rigid immobility intent on every word now turned towards clarke as if asking his consent the mother too seemed to wait anxiously for the ministers answer as if wondering whether he would willingly cut short his interrogation  his eyes were still glowing with the heat of controversy but he gravely said i hope you will give me another opportunity to discuss this matter it is very important to me  certainly with pleasure answered serviss glad to rid himself of the discussion of the moment  as viola stood slowly turning the leaves of her music three loud knocks sounded upon the inner door as if an insistent neighbor had entered and signalled for help the mother rose and went out hurriedly but the clergyman merely glanced after her and said to the girl  you would better play viola  the girl dashed into a stormy polish march which she played very well but with a mechanical precision which seemed to offend clarke who rose and laid his hand on her arm wait youre not in the mood yet he turned to serviss the spirit of our discussion is upon her she is very sensitive to such things i will sing firstif you dont object he added in a new tone a touch of apology in his voice and he gave out the effect of addressing an unseen auditorsome one in the inner room  i shall be delighted replied serviss with formal politeness though he began to apprehend something morbidly forbidding in the minister and in his influence on the girl an extraordinary intimacy was revealed not so much in the words he spoke as in the tones he used here is the girls lover he decided  there was no timidity or hesitation in violas manner as she struck the first chords of an old ballad and clarke transformed by a new and lofty mood sang with notable beauty of phrasing the banks o ben lomond something in the melancholy of the lovers cry seemed to fit with this singular young preachers mood his voice searched the heart his eyes misted with feeling and when he finished serviss applauded most fervently bravo and impulsively offered his hand  my dear fellow you have a wonderful voice you are the one to go to new york youd make carolus look to his laurels sing something elsesomething of strauss do you know strauss  clarke smiled with wistful sadness i sing very few ballads my voice was given me to use in christs service not for the gratification of my pride  serviss recoiled before this sanctimonious speech and the light went out of his face a disgust which he could not entirely conceal crossed his lips my dear sir you cant serve the lord better than by singing beautiful songs to the weary people of this earth to wear out a voice like that on pinchbeck hymn tunes is a crime then as if becoming conscious of a neglect of the girl he added now that you are in the mood miss lambert you must try that sonata again  the girl seemed not to be offended by his enthusiasm over the ministers singing and with a word in a low voice to clarke who placed a sheet of music before her she began to play opening the composition with unexpected breadth and dignity of phrasing serviss listened with growing amazement her hands were not large but they had ample spread and were under perfect control there was power in the poise of her head and in the rhythmic swaying of her body but her playing was curiously unfeminine there was no touch of girlish grace of sentiment in her performance and with a sudden enlightenment serviss inwardly exclaimed aha a clerical svengali this musical preacher has trained his pupil till she plays as he would play if he had the digital facility its all fine but it is not the girl and the question of their relationship again engaged him     illustration serviss listened with growing amazement  when the final stormy note was still viola remained on her stool as though waiting for her critic to applaud  serviss broke the silence by exclaiming see here you people are making game of me you are both professionals in disguise come now fess up he challenged clarke you are señor del corte barytone of the saltair opera company and you miss lambert belong to the arion ladies orchestra i have found you both out  the girl smiled with pleasure but clarke remained so unassailably serious that serviss was moved to further deeps of audacity dont tell me you are a comedian also you certainly have me guessing who are you really  clarke answered resentfully i am the pastor of the presbyterian church in this village as miss lambert has told you and she is my organist  again that thump three times repeated sounded upon the door serviss baffled and silenced by clarkes impenetrable gravity and by something inexplicably submissive yet watchful in the face of the girl felt himself confronted by an intangible sinister and inescapable influence the young clergyman seemed to darken and oppress both women it was as if they were all leagued in a conspiracy to deceive and cajole this bewilderment lasted but a moment and he rose from his chair with a spring well now play something elsegive us a bit of ragtime that last piece has left us all a little dashedtry a cakewalk  clarke interposed miss lambert does not play those trashy melodies i consider them essentially irreligious  serviss resented the preachers tone but quickly answered theyre not exactly reverent ill admit but without them american music would be but a poor reflection of the german  as if to save his reputation the preacher sang the palms and sang it magnificently and the girl accompanied him with such accuracy and good judgment that serviss was able to infer long hours of practice and this did not please him  his influence on her and on this household is not good he decided that chap is decidedly morbid if he is married so much the worse hes far too handsome to be a safe guide to an impressionable young girl there is some mystery here and he recalled that violas face was troubled when first he saw it and at the close of this song without a glance at the preacher he offered a parting hand to viola if i can be of any aid in putting you in touch with a teacher in new york please write me i think you have my card you play with astonishing power and brilliancy you would certainly interest a man like greer  her face flamed with colorall her sullen restraint vanished all her girlish charm came back oh do you think so do you suppose i could get him to teach me  i dont say thathe is a very busy manbut i think you are decidedly to be encouraged but i may be able to hear you again before i go i want to hear you play alone  i wish you would come again there was a subtle entreaty in her voice almost a prayer and in her uplifted face was expressed the respect and confidence of a child his heart was moved with pity as well as with admiration and turning to the mother he added i shall probably remain over sunday and it would be a pleasure if i might come again to your pretty home  mrs lamberts face glowed with pleasure it will be a great honor to have you sir  in this spirit he went away without again taking clarkes hand with a last glance at the girls face as she stood at the open door to let him pass he turned from the gate with a sense of having been permitted a glance into the very heart of a secret drama which might at any moment become a tragedy his interest was profoundly stirred his sympathies wholly enlisted in behalf of this girl so young and so aspiring  as he stood above the roaring water he formulated a theory with regard to the relationship of the personalities he had just left behind him the girl is being persecuted by this man clarke who is madly in love with her she has an inner repugnance to him but he is a clergyman and that means a great deal to a girl in the adoration stage her mother a nice religious sort of person favors the preacher of course but the father probably despises him clarke is evidently losing his hold on the rockballasted keel of his creed and in his shipwreck he may carry that girl down with him such cases are all too common if he is married he is all the more dangerous but it is not my duty to interfere he ended resolute to put the whole problem from him the girl has legal guardianson them rests the blame if she is corrupted to reform this world has never been my call  but he could not rid himself of a growing sense of responsibility his mind returned again and again to the complication into which he had suddenly been thrust perhaps this desire on the part of the girl to go away to study is only an instinctive desire to escape it would be like that preacher to have a worn little commonplace wife what can lambert be thinking of to let such a man come into his home and direct the daily life of both his wife and daughter he is neglecting his plain duty  he fell asleep fancying himself on the way up the trail to the mine and when he woke to find the good rectifying rays of the morning sun filling his room the theories of the night were absurd he desired to see the girl again not to warn her of her peril but because she was piquant and lovely as befitted her romantic surroundings     vi  in the marshall basin   it must have been about eleven oclock next morning when serviss rode up and dismounted at the lambert gate and in the flaming light of midday the sense of mystification the feeling that the girl was in the coils of some invisible menace had entirely vanished the preacher had sunk to the rôle of a conceited clerical ass who regarded science as an enemy to his especial theories and the visible universe as an outlying province of calvinism while viola who came to the door was again most humanly charming delighting his eyes like the morning  she smiled blithely and spoke collectedly in response to his greeting but when he asked her to be his guide to the wonders of the region her face clouded in dismay  oh im sorry i wish i could but i must carry a message up to my father at the mine  very well why not take me i infer you go on horseback  she hesitated yes but its a long hard rideand you said you were tired of the saddle  i was yesterday but i feel quite rested now by all means let me accompany you i should particularly enjoy mounting high today i should also like to meet your father  very well i will speak to mother she replied with shining face and disappeared within  the mother mindful of servisss connection with a great university made no objection to the plan on the contrary she was pleased and flattered by his interest in her daughter and a few moments later the young people rode off up the mountain road side by side and in high spirits  serviss winced at times at the childish flatness of violas comment but her voice was musical and her face flowerliketherefore he forgave her with all his knowledge of the constitution of matter he was still young and in the mating mood  they talked of the flowers of the trails of the birds to be found on the heights for a time but soon inevitably they came to talk of themselves under his questioning she outlined her plans for a musical education and this led at last to a consideration of the reverend mr clarke  at the first mention of his name the girls face distinctly darkened and her answers became curiously studied almost evasiveor so it seemed to serviss  yes i play in his church she said and he teaches me he is a splendid musiciandont you think so i owe a great deal to him he has helped me so muchespecially in my phrasing he is a wonderful man we are fortunate in having him with us  he struck me as a little morbid not to say morose has he had trouble in his church  her answer was deeptoned and affectedly solemn in one so young no but his wife passed out last year  passed out what do you mean by that  i mean she died  oh i see his inflection checked her confidence and they rode for a little way in silence  serviss was thinking the situation is now clear clarke is working upon this sweet and charming girl in order to have her take the place of his dead wife a sorrowful thing to think of but not so bad as i have been imagining at length he asked what else can you tell me about this mr clarke is he a native of the west  oh no he is from the east he had a big church in brooklyn but his health gave out and he was forced to leave it he came here for the baths and the air he is much better now  he retains all his intellectual diseases however what medicine will he find for those meeting the girls startled glance he hastened to add i beg your pardon i was just wondering if he were as morbid when he came as he now seems  oh no he was quite cheerful till his wife went away that changed him greatly for months he hardly left his study he reads too much even now that is why he looks so pale his house is packed with books  he seems in need of fresh air how does your father get on with him  not at all well  i inferred that your father is a man of deedsof open airi take it  mr lambert isnt my own father she took this opportunity to explain my own father passed to the other side when i was eleven  pardon my curiosity miss lambert but youve used a phrase once or twice which ive heard the people of a certain faith use is your mother a spiritualist  she looked at him with timid eyes then turned quickly away sheshe used to be shes studying theosophy now  and the minister is trying to convert you all to his especial theory i can imagine his discourses no wonder you want to flee  the girls whole face voice and manner changedbecame bitter passionate oh i hate it i hate it i want to be free of it all  the intensity of her utterance amazed serviss and he studied her profile in silence before he answered i think i know what you mean and i sympathize with you youre too young to be troubled by the doubts and dismays of men like clarke he is preposterous in the face of a landscape like this let us forget him and his isms with these words he straightened in his saddle and lifted his eyes towards the height before them isnt that superb  they were drawing near the great gray boundarywall of the valley and the sound of roaring water grew tumultuous as they rounded the curve in the road and came into the little triangular nook which had been anciently formed by the colorow as it descended in power from its source in the high parks on the left the ledges rose almost sheer for a thousand feet and from the edge of this cliff orebuckets aslide on invisible cables appeared in the sky swooping like eagles silently dropping one by one to disappear tamely as doves in the gable end of a huge drabcolored mill which stood upon the flat beside the stream beyond the mill mount ignacio rose darkly purple hooded in white clouds  the entire scene was typical of the west of its energy its greed and its faith here was lifelife and buoyant healthand the blood of the young scientist quickened as he comprehended the daring the originality of the miners plan  is this your fathers enterprise he asked in the hope of an affirmative answer a man of this quality would hang the minister if necessary  oh no weve got to climb the hill and cross the upper basin before we reach our mine this is the ore from the san luis tunnel  she was happily of the sunny world now and with a gay smile turned her horse into a narrow trail and called back to him we climb here he followed admiring the strength and grace of her rounded figure as her horse zigzagged up the steep acclivity she was troubled by no problems at this moment she was rather a daughter of the mountains a sister to the eagles  she stopped once or twice to permit him to locate the farfamed peaks rising one by one to the south of them and the third time she drew rein he was afoot and she said were almost to the top of this grade its easier in the basin  i am thinking only of my horse he answered you see he is carrying a fortypound saddle and is not so fresh as yours im sorry to delay you  the basin was a most glorious valley bowlshaped green with grass and groves of aspen and fir and flooded with a cataract of sunshine all about it ran a rim of lofty summits purple in shadow garnet and gold and green in the sun here and there a prospecthole showed like a scar or a gray dismantled stampmill stood like a disintegrating bowlder beside its yellowgray dump of useless ore serviss familiar with the rise and fall of the silverminer looked over the lovely valley with a certain sense of satisfaction for he was able to reconstruct its beauty before that flood of devastating humankind swept up from the eastern plain nature is reasserting her dominion he said aloud mining is a wounding businesslike murder  the girl glanced away to the south well have to hurry if we reach camp by one oclock she called and he waved his hand as a sign of surrender to her leadership  they overtook a long train of burros bearing a most miscellaneous cargo of odds and ends of machinery nailkegs ironrods bundles of bolts lumber oil and boxes of groceries  this is all fathersall for the new mill said the girl nodding and smiling at the mexicans in charge of the donkeys hello clint she called cheerily to another muleteer a little farther up the trail a brown goodlooking young fellow who saluted her joyfully his eyes aglow with adoration  every man is her suitor thought serviss with a twinge of disapproval think what she must seem to that leathercolored arab urging forward those donkeys and a knowledge of her dangerhe put it that waybegan to oppress him she is too fine and sweet to marry among these rough miners  she it seemed was not afraid of mountaineers for she had a gay nod and a bright word for every one she met though some of them were brutalmouthed and grimy and sullen serviss derived no comfort from the fact that the most sinister of them brightened for an instant in the light of her adorable smile  at last far ahead they came in sight of the mill on a bare peak the white clouds which had been silently gathering round the great domes swiftly overspread the whole sky the air grew chill as november the wind began to roar in the firs with a stern mournfulness which went to the heart of the man but the girl without once stopping her horse unrolled her raincoat and put it on calling back at her cavalier as she did so with a fine challenging gleeful shout  they were very high now perennial ice lay in the gullies and on the north side of the cliffs and the air was light and keen suddenly the wind died away a gray hush came over the valley the water in the streams lost its vivid green and became leadcolor streaked with white foam one by one the mountains were blotted out by the storm the world of sky and rocks grew mysterious menacing but the girl pushed fearlessly forward singing like a robin while the rain slashed over her and the thunder boomed and reechoed from crag to crag like warning guns in magnificent alarums i love this she cried her clear voice piercing the veil of water like a flute note dont you  serviss was not without imagination and the contrast of this jocund fearless free young maid with the silent constrained girl of the night before moved him to wonder here she is herselfnatures own child he thought last night she was a subjecta plaything of the preachers strange the mother does not realize her daughters danger  the storm passed as quickly as it came and when they drew rein at the mine the sun was shining the mill standing on a smooth steep slope and sheltered on the north by a group of low firs seemed half a ruin but was in fact being rebuilt and enlarged all about it were dumps of clay slippery with water and rough bunkhouses and oresheds all the structures were rude masculine utilitarian and the girl grew each moment in delicacy and refinement by contrast  in answer to her halloo a plainly clad man came to the door his face set in amazement  whysee heredaughter i wasnt looking for you today  im here just the same she laughingly replied here are some telegrams professor serviss this is my father  joseph lambert was a small man with shy blue eyes and a low and gentle utterance he carried his head leaning a little to the left and seemed a shade discouraged almost melancholy he was however a brave silent tireless little man who had made one great fortune in silvermines only to lose it in the panic he was now cannily working a vein which had a streak of gold in it and like all miners was just on the point of making a strike he was distracted with work and though cordial could not at the moment give much time to his visitor  well now viola you take professor serviss into the cookhouse and feed him i guess youll find something left over if not you will have to scratch up something  viola thereupon led the way into the kitchen greeting each man she met cooks and waiters alike with impartial cleareyed joyousness and trust and when the food came on she ate without grimace or hesitation the cook a big selfcontained chinaman came in with a china cup  use this kluptin klup no good for lady his voice was gruff and his manner that of one who compels a child to use a napkin but it was plain he adored her as she thanked him he shuffled away with an irrepressible grin  all this produced in serviss an uneasiness to him she was a lamb venturing among wolves she should not expose herself to the coarse comment the seeking eyes of these fellows he indignantly commented blaming the acquiescent mother and the absentminded stepfather this childlike trust is charming but it is not war  her essential weakness of defence her innocence began to move him deeply dangerously he began to understand how she had turned to clarke for companionship not merely because he was a clergyman but because he was a young man of more than usual culture and attainment whose sympathy and counsel promised aid and comfort in her loneliness she does not love him she merely admires certain sides of his character she fears to marry him and quite properly his morbid faith would destroy her  as they were returning to the office they met the young driver of the muletrain and viola introduced him as mr ward of boston  he was tall and spare with a fine sensitive boyish facea face of refinement which his rough gray shirt faded leggings and badly battered hat belied  mr ward is out here for his health also viola explained all the really nice people are onelungers  isnt it sad said ward gravely however miss lambert is only partly right i made my health an excuse im here because i like it  serviss bent a keen look upon him you dont look as if you had ever been sick  im not i came out here to escape collegeand my fathers business he laughed but dont betray me im supposed to be slowly improving  there was something fine and hawklike in the young fellows profile as he stood negligently leaning on the doorframe his eyes on the flushed face of the girl and serviss experienced another pang of jealous painthey were so young so comely so full of the fire and imagination of youth at the moment his own fame and special tasks were of small account  upon their return to the office lambert met them in the same absentminded apologetic way im just getting some new machinery into place and havent a minute but you must make yourself as much at home as you can viola will show you around  serviss protested that he needed no entertainment that he was not tired and that he was well content to sit in the door and smoke and watch the changing glory of the peaks and this he did while viola moved about among the workmen in earnest conversation with her stepfather  she is explaining me serviss reasoned i wish i could hear what she says it would be amusing to know myself as she sees me i hope she doesnt think me middleaged as well as wise  lambert listened to his daughters words with attention for a professor in a college was an exalted person in his eyes and one of his chief regrets at the moment was that he was unable to say to serviss i am a college man myself but this he could not do for the reason that the death of his father had taken him out of his class at the beginning of his third year and put him at the head of a large family as its breadwinner  he looks like a very young man almost a boytoo young to be a professor but thenhere his eyes twinkledwhen i was at jefferson all professors seemed old to me whats he doing here  just riding through the mountains on his vacation  what does your mother think of him  she likes him very much  well i wont make any objection then  viola staredthen blushed furiously what do you mean  why didnt you bring him up here to see how i liked him  she pounded him with her little brown fist while tears of mortification filled her eyes now you stop that youre teasing me why ive only known him three days  he laughed silently shaking his head well these things move quickly sometimesand how was i to know but youd known him in the eastyou seemed so chummylike  youve spoiled everything she wailed deeply disturbed and painfully selfconscious youre mean to me  he became instantly contrite there now dont you mind my joking of course i was fooling its all safe between us anyway  but the mischief was done she forgave him but never again would she be the same to him to her mother or to the imperturbable young man smoking his pipe beneath the firs he was youngthat was only too plain to her now not so young as clinton but not the middleaged person she had been fancying him to be  as they were about to start on their homeward trail serviss sought opportunity to say mr lambert i met this man clarke at your house last night and i want to say that i dont think his influence on your family is particularly wholesome hes morbid and given to fads  lambert replied i know what you mean professor and i believe youre right i dont believe in him myself and i dont take any stock in any of his notions but my wife does she thinks hes of the covenant somehow i wish youd talk with her and try to have her let up on viola i dont think theyre doin right by her if she was my own girl id stop iti would so then he added in a curious tone this vague defence as for viola she would be all right if they would leave her alone shes gifted in a way i dont understand but if she isnt twisted by clarkes foolishness shes going to make some man a good wife shes a good girl and as i say if she was my own child id serve notice that this circle business should stop i wish youd talk to em i dont countbut theyll listen to you im glad to have met you i hope youll come up again id like to mill that business over with you its all very curious but im just plumb distracted with work now  i beg you not to apologizeits time to start back anyhow  as they rode away down the valley the girl silent and constrained serviss pondered lamberts words which were plainly directed against clarke his sense of responsibility was increased by lamberts trust in him this wont do he decided i must pull out or i will find myself laden with the woes of the entire family and clarkes distresses besides  the girl was invested now with compelling pathos each mile they descended seemed to deepen the returning shadow on her face the gayety the buoyancy of the upward trail was gone she was silent constrained and sad and he set to work to restore her to the simple and girlish candor of the morning he called attention to the wonders of the western sky he shouted to induce echoes and challenged her to a race and at the last descent dared her to ride down in one of the orebuckets seeking to bring the smiles back to her lips  she responded to his cheer but not as before something clouded her clear glanceher smiles died quickly and the poise of her head was less alert  when they had reached the wagonroad and he could ride by her side he too became serious i hope i havent given offence in any way miss lambert if i have i assure you it was entirely unintentional and i beg your pardon  she looked away you have done nothing she said slowly  but you seem distinctly less friendly to me i hope you didnt take anything i said concerning your mothers faith to heart i had no intention of attacking her beliefs but i must be honest with youi dont like mr clarke theres something unwholesome about him and what youve told me today is not reassuring evidently he took the death of his wife very hard and it has added to his natural tendency towards a sort of spiritual monomania as a matter of fact hes more spiritualist than calvinist at present isnt that so  the girls face grew sullen and weary oh i dont know im tired of it all  he endlessly talks his grind i suppose how foolish how sickly it all seemshere in the presence of uncontaminated nature in such sunlight as this it seems insanity to sit in a bookwalled room and grow bloodless with dreaming over insoluble problems and yet a friend of mine told me that these towns and especially california towns were filled with seers and prophets the occult flourishes in the high dry atmosphere those of the faith say dont you permit clarke to destroy your love of nature miss lambert you belong to the sane and sunny world and he has no right to bring his gloomy conceptions home to you you are too young and too naturally joyous to be concerned with the problems of disease and death you were made to be happy  he ended with greater earnestness than he had intended to use and the effect of his words on the girl was very great she could not speak tears were in her eyes and her bosom heaved most piteously his sense of her helplessness deepened and he added will you permit me to talk to mr clarke about you and your plans  this seemed to alarm her no no she cried out distressfully please dont say anything to him about me it will do no good you dont understand and i cant tell you she added breathlessly  very well he said soothingly but remember your case interests me exceedingly and you may call on me at any time and i will gladly help  she turned a pale and tearful face towards him and extended her hand  i thank you very very much you have helped me more than i can say  during the remainder of the ride he discussed the springs the source of the streams the caverns and other natural features of the scene and had the satisfaction of seeing her face in a smile before he left her  he went back to his hotel with a feeling of having spent six days in her company rather than six hours she absorbed his entire thought and so keen was his sense of her beleaguerment that he resolved to call upon clarke in order to define his character and to understand his motives his passions or his doubt overshadow the girls sky and im going to find out whether his designs are those of friend or fiend at the moment he had a feeling that they were those of a devouring fiend     vii  the forces of light and darkness   clarkes church typified the decaying faith of its pastor grass was serenely pushing up through the rotting planks of the walk which led from the street to the basement study just as the natural goodness and cheer of man returns to dominion through the barriers of custom the paint was blistering and peeling from the clapboarding on the sunny side of the main building and in one of the windows a piece of shingle had been set to repair a broken pane it had the appearance of neglected age  the preacher was rightthe creed of his church as of all others in a lesser degree perhaps is too crass too mechanical too childish to tally the ideals of a generation which is each day awakening to some new potency of matter some wider conception of the universe  on the study door checked by the sun and worn by the rain the tourist applied his knuckle and a voice formal and sonorous called out come in  opening the door which led directly into a dark little den with only one window serviss confronted clarke reading by a greenshaded lamp in whose light he appeared as pallid as remote from the sun as a monk of the middle ages  he rose quickly upon recognizing his visitor im glad to see you professor i beg your pardon for not rising i thought the knock came from my janitor take a seat please he gathered a handful of books from a yellow armchair and pushed it forward with his foot your visit is most opportune i was meditating a call at your hotel tonight i wanted to get your idea concerning two or three scientific discoveries which seem to me to have a most important bearing on the welfare of the race  serviss became each moment more keenly aware of being face to face with a task which required all his tact his selfpossession and his wit for the man before him was immured in selfconceit accustomed to carrying his point by a rush of words and was withal a student possessed of unusual intellectual resource he made a very handsome figure as he took his seat amid his books his face freshly shaven gleamed like bluewhite marble and his abundant dark hair drawn away from his brow by careless fingers lay in a tumbled mass above his ear adding a noticeably sculptural finish to his shapely head his hands thin long and restless alone betrayed the excitement which the coming of this master of the germ engendered in him he was eager to question but he waited for his visitor to begin which he did with manly directness  i have called to talk with you about miss lambert she and her mother having honored me by asking my advice as to her study in new york i would like to know whether you as their pastor counsel this movement on her part  the clergymans sentient fingers sought found and closed tightly upon a ruler that i cannot answer directly he said slowly miss lamberts case is not simple she is a very remarkable musician that you know and yet her talent is fitful she sometimes plays very badly i am not at all sure she has the temperament which will succeed on the musicstage  i made a somewhat similar remark to the mother myself  moreover her interests are not the only factors in the problem mrs lamberts life is bound up in her daughter and without her she would suffer the wellbeing of the family as a whole is against her going  you have your own interests too i dare say  clarkes eyes narrowed what do you mean  it would be difficult to replace her here in your churchwork would it not  the clergyman returned to his candid manner it would indeed she is the only organist in the village and is invaluable to me especially in the sundayschool  i am disposed to consider her interests and not those of the mother and father or even the church pursued serviss i am of those who recognize the rights of the young as of chief importance to the race  clarke seized upon this as a gage of battle the race oh you inexorable men of science what do we care for the race we would save individuals the race can take care of itself the race is only an abstractionit cannot suffer of what avail to the individual to know that the race is to be perfected a thousand years hence  we wander interposed serviss with decision the question is really quite simple shall we advise the lamberts to send their daughter to new york to study music or shall we counsel her to remain here and in marriage to some good honest young miner resign herself to the common lot of women her talent should determine  a dull flush rose to the cheek of the preacher his eyes fell and his voice unconsciously softened marriage is still a long way off for viola lambert she is but a child and besides he paused  serviss smiled they marry young in the west i believe besides she must be twenty and quite robust  she seems but a child to me repeated clarke returning to his clerical manner and something in the hypocritical tone of his speech angered and disgusted serviss and to himself he said he is a fraud he does not intend to let the girl pass out of his control then aloud he reopened the discussion it all comes back to a question of the girls talent if it is sufficient to enable her to earn a living in some larger community she has a right to go if not she should certainly stay here i believe in the largest possible life for every human being and miss lamberts ambition is a perfectly legitimate craving furthermore she seems eager to escape from this life she hints at some sort of mysterious persecution she has not defined her troubles in detail but i inferred that some undesirable suitor made life miserable for her with these words he bent a keen glance at clarke  you are quite mistaken sir miss lambert has many admirers but no suitors i have cautioned her against entanglements of that kind i have shown how they would interfere with her work  you mean her work in your church  clarkes eyes again took on the narrowed glance of suspicion partly that but more on account of other and higher work which i hope to see her do  to what do you refer  pardon me of that i cannot at present speak i can only say that it is a work whose preliminary stages can be passed as well here as in new york citybetter in fact  you arouse my curiosity  clarke suddenly awoke from his musing and became aggressive he resolutely changed the subject before you go i want to ask youdo you as a chemist deny the immortality of the soul  chemistry does not concern itself with the soul  do you as a man deny the immortality of the soul  i neither deny nor affirm i have never concerned myself with the question  clarke was a little daunted you leave the most vital question in all this world uninvestigated  yes because i was long ago convinced that the problem of death like the origin of life is insoluble and why waste time on the insoluble to pore upon the constitution of matter is a species of mediævalism i am concerned with what bacteria donot what they are  i deny that the question of immortality is insoluble replied clarke his eyes glowing with the fire of his faith it is because you scientists ignore the phenomena of spiritism that you remain ignorant of the messages which come from the other side  what other side  the realm of those you call the dead he caught up a book there is the word of a german scientist a hundred times more eminent than you and here are the conclusions of two great englishmen members of the royal academy who have investigated and have been convinced of the return of the dead  i know those men replied serviss coldly the common opinion is that they ceased to be scientists when they wrote these volumes all were past their prime and bereaved and one was nearly blind their true balance of judgment was lost before they set to work on what you call their investigations the german was considered insane on the fourth dimension but what has this girl to do with your realm of the dead or my study of cancerous tissue she belongs to the realm of music and flowers i beg you to remember that you have no right to throw over her the shadow of your religious perplexities any more than i would have the right to lay before her my knowledge of parasitic growths youth and especially young womanhood has its rights and one of them is to be blithe you admit that you are losing faith why destroy hers your doubts and despairs should not touch her but they have she is troubled and sad by reason of your attitude towards life and especially by your insistence upon the presence of death in the world  this was not precisely what serviss had started out to say but as he went on a sense of being misled a suspicion that he was playing into the hands of the enemy kept him from putting into words the strong conviction which had seized him  the preacher put his interlocked fingers behind his head and looking at his visitor beneath lowered contemptuous lids replied my dear sir you dont know a thing of what youre talking about  the note of patronization the tone of superior wisdom stung the scientist he felt in the clergymans reply not merely opposition but insult his very pose was an affront  i dont know your motives that is perfectly true but i can infer them it is due me to say that i am not in the habit of mixing in where i am not wanted but as mr and mrs lambert have both asked my advice i shall give it the girl is morbid and unhappy here and i shall tell them to send her away for a time she has musical talent i shall advise them to allow her to go east to study  the preachers smile deepened into a sneer i think i understand your motives and i shall oppose her going what is there to restrain a man who recognizes neither spirit nor god  serviss was at first astounded then hot at the grossness of this insinuation and his strong brown hands clinched in the instinct to punishto retaliatebut his anger cooled to the level of words and he said this interview has more than convinced me of the justice of lamberts distrust of you i shall see him again and repeat the warning i have already given and with these words he turned and went out  it was with a sense of astonishment and relief that he reentered the daylight for the sunset glow was not yet out of the sky a moment before the world had seemed enveloped in midnight darkness and lo here now were the splendid peaks the singing river all aglow with golden light the encounter of the moment before receded swiftly became incredible but the preacher remained squat in his den like a vampire in his cave  as he went slowly up the street he acknowledged a feeling of growing weight of uncertainty having given his word in such wise he had become the defender the protector of one of whom he knew nothing that was reassuring his youth seemed to have suddenly taken on care his vacation had ended in a cloud of distrust from the detachment of the scientist he had descended to the level of a moralist and meddler and most significant of all a meddler in the affairs of a young and attractive girl     viii  dr britt explains   serviss had just written and sealed a letter to his sister wherein he said i shall remain a few days longer here in the mountainsthey interest me greatly when a knock on the door announced the bellboy bearing a card  dr britt exclaimed serviss with pleasure bring him up please and to himself added now we will learn something definite about this amazing group of people  the manner in which britt entered the room proclaimed a distinctive character he edged himself through the door not stealthily but carelessly casually he too was tall with a wide dark beard curling over very pink and rather plump cheeks and in his bright black eyes a sardonic sheen played as he loosely shook his hosts hand his expression was that of a man perpetually amused as if anticipating a joke or recollecting a mockery his voice was as languid as his limbs but his words were precise and to their mark  serviss greeted him heartily i am glad to meet you dr britt take a seat i have heard of you through miss lambert  i saw you on the street replied britt without change of expression so i looked over the register to find out who you were im mighty glad to meet up with you i know you very well by reputation and weissmann is an old acquaintance of our familys what are you doing out here visiting the lamberts  for some reason this directness disturbed serviss a little nooh no i just drifted in over the divide from the desert and met miss lambert by accident quite by accident i dropped into colorow to rest and rinse the desert dust away before returning east turn about is fair playwhat are you doing here  britt struck his left breast with his thumb same old storybusted lung whenever you strike a suspicious character out here hes either a onelunger or a remittance man  thats what makes your country worth while  i dont know about that but youll find a good many of us waiting when you fellows develop an antitoxin for the consumption bug were all going back to gods country  were hot on its trail replied serviss jocularly  i know you are i read after you as they say out here in fact ive got a little farm and take a shy at breeding the beasts myself id like you to come in and give me a hint or two  with pleasure serviss heartily responded so you know weissmann  i used to my father was an attaché of the embassy at berlin at one time and was a factor in getting old hair and goggles to come over he was a conceited ass at that time with more wool than brains the governor always said but the governor wanted to do something for the college  serviss studied the card do i know your fatheris he still in public life  he is not britts glance veered the governor im sorry to say has a weakness for toddy and ive retired him he boards in white plains with patsy cline summers and relapses winters  serviss changed the subject bytheway i want to ask you about this man clarke what kind of a chap is he  britts answer was languid but adequate three parts fakir and the rest fanatic  i was afraid soand the lamberts what of them  mrs lambert is a dear old ninny viola is a mighty bright girl suffering from a welldeveloped case of hysteria and autohypnosis  what do you mean asked serviss sharply  britt checked himself i ought not to speak of it i suppose but as you are a stranger and can keep a professional secret i will explain the mother is a spiritualisthas been for yearsand being on the lookout for it naturally discovered what she calls mediumship in viola when a child by carefully nursing the delusion in herself and in her subject she has been able to develop a rare uprush of the subliminal as myers would say when i came here to take dr randalls practice i found among his papers elaborate notes on the girls development  you amaze me exclaimed serviss she seems so normal and so charming  in reality shes the most extraordinary puzzle i have ever undertaken to solve it seems according to randall that this power came upon her soon after the death of her little brothera couple of years younger than herself ill let you see these notes if you like theyre very curious in fact i brought the book alongi wanted your opinion of them and your advice as to the girls treatment  serviss leaned forward in growing interest by all means let me see the notes you begin to throw light on something that puzzled me  britt drew a small brown book from his pocket and said your first thought will be to relate this business to hysteria and one of randalls first entries is a reflection along these lines there is much inconclusive literature on the shelves of medical libraries on the subject of hysteria and many diverse ailments are thrown into that box of explanations britt looked up hes right there but he goes on to slate the medical profession thus the mind of a child like any other expanding growing thing tends to depart from the normloves apparently to surprise its progenitors holding in its grasp latent tendencies of all ages of all the race it may at any time astound by its sudden expansion in unexpected directions as well as by its inexplicable failure to follow ordained grooves here britt paused again you can see the old chap was hard hit he now gets evolutionary we are all goats satyrs and serpents potentiallyeven from the neurologists point of view our minds are infinitely complex  serviss said all this is wise but is it pertinent  hes coming at it now what we men of medicine call hysteria seems to be a violent and in a sense unaccountable departure from the norm induced by the removal of some checkby some deep change in the nervous constitution thus a girl suddenly refuses to eat has visions shouts and sings uncontrollably perhaps speaks in an unknown tongueshe is said to be hysterical a mother hearing of the death of her child begins to laugh passes at length into a cataleptic state during which a childs voice sounds from her throat this too is hysteria a man of fortyfive becomes melancholy professes to hear music inaudible to others develops automatic writing and trances in which he is able to hear distant voices and to read sealed letters this too is hysteria in reality nothing is explained  what of it interrupted serviss lets have the application  he makes his point in the next paragraph in conformity with this habit when called in by mrs lambert to study her daughter who had passed suddenly into deep sleep and was speaking with the voice of her grandfather i with owlish gravity pronounced her attack a case of hysteria take her on a little trip said i keep her well nourished and outofdoors and she will outgrow it  very good advice  so it was but mark the sequel she did not outgrow it he puts this in italics the power within her gained in mastery and what is most singular and baffling to me she continues to be a hearty healthy child in all other ways and yet at times she seems the calm centre of a whirlwind of invisible forces chairs books thimbles even the piano move to and fro without visible pushing electric snapping is heard in the carpet under her little feet and loud knocking comes upon the walls  ah exclaimed serviss and recalled the knocking at his first visit while the girl was at the piano  here he drops into italics again one by one all the familiar manifestations of the spiritualistic medium are being reproduced by this pretty maiden here in this mountain home  good lord what a pity exclaimed serviss  britt read on the mother aggrieved and alarmed by the rude way in which the girl is buffeted has been put to her paces to conceal the topsyturvy doings of her household stones are hurled through the windows cabinets are opened by invisible and silent locksmiths and i have seen these things and can offer no explanation britt closed the book right here the old doctor lost his nerve up to this time he was a fairly acute observer his next entry is evidently some weeks or possibly months later he says slowly we have learned to understand the phenomena but we cannot control them and the child is still cruelly embarrassed by intrusive tappings and cracklings as she visits her friends or as she sits in her seat in school she has become afraid to sleep alone and calls piteously for a light whenever the noises begin  the poor child  you may well say that replied britt she has told me that her time of greatest trial comes just after the family have had their evening meal and while she is seated at her book but randall grows eloquent in his description of what took place almost every night at seven oclock the obscure powers begin their uncanny and invisible riot ending by seizing upon the child as if to destroy her compelling her in the end to sleep then her voice her limbs seem at the disposal of some invisible intelligence you see the old man is weakening he says no more of hysteria and nothing about taking the girl away  do you mean to tell me he joined in fostering this delusion  mark his change of tone he goes on the mother convinced by her reading as well as by messages in writing believes that the spirits of her dead are trying to communicate with her and so sits night after night terrified yet hoping waiting for further instructions from the imponderable ones britt turned a few pages rapidly listen to this here is the key to the old mans change of heart tonight the child began to speak to me in the voice of a man hoarse words rose from deep in her throat a voice and words impossible to her in her normal condition the voice purported to be my fathers it is all very singular i do not understand how she could know the things this voice uttered to me you see said britt he has ceased to be the medical adviser he turned a number of pages slowly well the girl passed rapidly through these various phases according to randall she wrote messages with her left hand wherein her grandfather mcleod detailed the method of treating her and randall was so far gone that he acquiesced from her eleventh to her fifteenth year she lived under this control the manifestations increased in power and definiteness the controls at last were threeher grandfather her brother and her own father at sixteen the most violent of the manifestations ceased and the girl went away to school at this point joe lambert entershe married the mother  how did he take these doings  he seems to have been a silent and reluctant witness the doctor only mentions him incidentally there are one or two pitiful letters from the girl written while at school detailing several embarrassing returns of the spirits but on the whole she was happy according to the record her vacations must have been a torment for waltie thats no poltergeist seemed determined to make up for lost time he came every night making life a hell for his sister she could go nowhere and it was with the greatest difficulty that the mother kept her dreadful secret  serviss with darkened brow writhed uneasily in his chair i have heard of these things before now but this is a new view of a mediums development i dont understand the mothers attitude  randall notes that the mother was resigned and content as soon as she was convinced of the return of her dead father and husband and son and at present will not think of giving up her fancied communion especially as the guides constantly assure her that they will protect the girl but observe the senility of this note in randalls diary martha comes regularly to me now and i am happy in a renewed sense of her companionship indeed i fancy at times that i can see her she showed me her hands last night i could see them plainly against the window i had quite a controversy with lambert after the sitting its all bad business he said i am scared when i think of whats going to become of viola here she is growing to be a big girl and a pretty girl and she ought to be out in companyshe ought to be singing and dancing like other girls she ought to marry like other girls and be happy and she cant be so long as these things are going on it isnt right  no more was it said serviss it was villainous  randall was too far gone to even agree but it hasnt hurt her i replied and indeed this marvellous fact resigns me to the practice i cant endure now the thought of being cut off from martha and paul our precious boy it would be like shutting the door in their faces besides they are in control we could not stop their use of the girl if we were to try as for me it is now my life i am old my friends my dear ones are all on that side i have only a few more days to live and then right here the old man stopped he lived a month or two after that but he made no more notes and when i came on the scene clarke was in control of the situation i had no acquaintance with the family and no personal knowledge of the case till lambert called one day and told me of the sittings going on in the little cottage he had a notion that i might be able to cure the girl  serviss had listened to britt with growing pain and indignationpain at thought of violas undoing indignation that the mother and her physician could so complacently join in the dark proceedings of course you took hold of the case  i tried to but mrs lambert and clarke would not admit that the girl was in need of my care they invited me to join the circle as a spectator which i did i am still the onlookermerely  you dont mean to say they are still experimenting with her  you may call it that they sit regularly two or three nights each week clarke is preparing to renounce his pulpit and startle the world by a book on spiritism as he calls his faith the girl is his source of thunder  serviss sank back into his chair and darkly pondered that explains a number of very strange words and actions on the girls part what is her attitude she seemed to me extremely discontented and unhappy  she is unhappy she understands her situation and has moments of rebellion she knows that she is cut off from her rightful share in the world of young people and feels accursed  i can understand that and several things she said to me corroborate your analysis of her feeling but tell meyou have attended these sittingswhat takes placewhat does the girl profess to do  i dont know i cant determine clarkes share in the hocuspocus it all takes place in the dark  it always does it belongs there  many of the good old stunts of the professional medium are reproduced lights dance about guitars are played chairs nose about your knees hands are laid on your cheek and so on  you dont think she is wilfully tricking serviss asked this with manifest anxiety  theres every inducementdarkness deeply anxious friends it would not be strange if she did help on now and then  what a deplorable thing  and yet im not so sure that she wilfully deceives though i have detected her in fraud probably the whole thing began in some childish disorder which threw her system out of balance there are hundreds of such cases in medical literature she was possessed as of old with a sort of devilish secondary personality she probably wrote treatises lefthanded and upsidedown they often begin that way the mother lately bereaved was convinced of her daughters occult powers she nursed the delusion formed a circle sat in the darkness petting the girl when things happened mourning when the walls were silentand there you are sludge the medium all over again in a small way probably the girl didnt intend to deceive anybody at first but she was tolled along from one fakery to another till at last she found herself powerless in the grasp of her selfinduced coma she is anxious to escape her slavery she revolts and is most unhappy but sees no way out thats my present understanding of the case now what is your advice what can i do i am deeply interested in the girl but i have no authority to act  you shock and disgust me said serviss profoundly moved the girl seems too fine for such chicanery who is this man clarke  he was a sensational preacher in brooklyn a few years ago but a hemorrhage in the pulpit cut short his career in the east he came out here and got better but his wife who had a weak heart couldnt stand the altitude she dieda sacrifice to her husband hes the kind of a man who demands sacrifice after his wifes death he fairly lived at the lambert cottage and is now in full control the girls will is so weakened that she is but a puppet in the grasp of his powerful personality  serviss was now absorbed in reconstructing his conception of viola her situation appealed to him with the greatest poignancy but his ability to help her seemed gone fair as she looked she was to be avoided as one tainted with leprosy his impression that first afternoon had been trueshe was beleaguered if not lost  britt was saying if the girl were under age id appeal to the health authorities of the statei really would much as i like mrs lambertbut she is of age and what is more to the point clarke has won her love and confidence and what can you do he fills her horizon and the mother favors him he talks to her of her daughters mission to the world and suchlike vapor and has the girl herself half convinced that her cataleptic states are of divine origin i confess i havent felt free to make any real testsyou cant treat her like a professional you knowbut she seems to have induced by long practice a genuine coma and until some clamp is applied i cant say whether she or clarke is the chief offender now what would you do  serviss burned with the heat of his anger dont reveal to me any more of this wretched business i cant advise if you her physician and lambert her stepfather cant put a stop to it what can i a passing stranger do i dont want to know anything more about it why man its diabolical to warp and imprison a girl like that to think of that bewitching creature as a common tricksterappalls me and to think that good people millions of them believe in such mummery it is incredible  youd be surprised at the number of somewhat similar cases we find among our patients since coming here ive gone in for a little library of books on the subject every physician during his practice comes upon one or more of these abnormal cases which as randall says we label for convenience hysteria and im free to say that i dont think were at the bottom of the matter lets be just to this girl there are points in her favor  serviss protested not another word its too painful  britt persisted i was merely going to say that i think there is some basis for all this humbuggery these mediums dont start from nothing they nearly all begin with some abnormality some submerged power rises to the surface of their minds like a seaserpent and that distinguishes them as seers curious friends crowd around then the lying begins its going to be worth while to take the subject up byandby id do it myself if i could live in new york city he rose well i dont blame you for not going into this casei wish i were clear of it myselfbut i was hoping youd had some experience that would help me thereupon the conversation shifted to other grounds  after britt went out serviss sat in brooding uneasiness over his visitors sad revelations he had known viola lambert but three days and yet these revelations concerning her affected him most painfully quite vitally his pleasure in her and in the mother and their pretty home was utterly gone and the breakingoff of this acquaintance left an ache in his heart  of course he put all this on very general grounds i hate to lose faith in any one it is a shock to know that i can be so wholly deceived by appearance clarke is really the one to blame in the deception i cant believe the girl wilfully deceives and yet britt was explicit and he seems to be a keen dispassionate observer  thereupon he began to pack in order to take the early morning train for the east he decided not to see her again and posted a polite note saying he had been obliged to return to new york and that he regretted his inability to call  as he stood on the rear platform of his train next day looking back up the cañon towards the shining crest of colorow he had a craven sense of having deserted a helpless young girl in the hour of her greatest trial     ix  anthony clarke evangel   mr britt was right mrs lambert was very fond of clarkehad indeed quite taken him into her heart he was at once son and spiritual adviser and his wishes had the force of commands his bereavement could not have anguished her much more keenly had adele been her own daughter and this affliction still lay like a mist between them preventing even a foreboding of his impending confession of desire her remembrance of the beauty and high character of his wife made viola seem doubly the child and so when from time to time some busybody hinted at the ministers marked intimacy with her daughter she put the covert insinuation away with a frank wordyou mustnt even think such a thing  viola too from the very beginning of their acquaintance had admired the young minister quite as deeply as serviss imagined and had humbled herself before adele as to a very wonderful lady of the mysterious outer world whose deportment dress and speech had been sources of enlightenment and when she passed away the land of the shadow became just that much richer more complete in its dominion over her almost at once adele spoke through the vale saying i am here to help and guide  thus all powers of earth and heaven had combined to make clarke the ruler of viola lamberts little world he stood between her and young clinton ward and all other suitorshe absorbed her thought she admired his gifts and trembled beneath the power of his dark eyes his magnetic hands and especially responded to the music of his deep voice which was very enthralling when it took on the pleading melody of the lover at times he filled her with such passion of vague unrest that life became a torment for she was of the age when the world is for the lovers conquest and the cadence of loves song means most and is least understood and yet at times she felt a fear of him which chilled her she was struggling too with growing ambitions and with an expanding knowledge of the world which was beginning to make her criticalthe wonder of the child was giving place to the insight of the woman the wish to shake off her invisible tormentors and be like other girls was in reality a demand for the right to be loved and valued for her own natural self entirely free from the touch of spectral hands  she was disappointed that clarke did not understand and sympathize with this wish but that he desired her in marriage had never once entered her mind he was a minister and she reverenced his office and besides she considered herself but a girl too ignorant and too trivial to be the wife of one so high in holy service  with the coming of the young professor a new force seemed entered upon the saner side of her life she recognized in him a master of the great outer worldthe eastern world the world of the unafraidand her determination to at least subordinate her controls had expanded swiftly to a most dangerous height during the few hours of her companionship with him she felt that he would sympathize with herthat he would help her the clear positiveness of his speech his health his humor grew upon her each moment and she resolved to confide in him when next they met  part of this upspringing revolt this antagonism clarke divined and the determination to arrest her purpose the desire to possess her entirely and at once excluded every other wish or plan and to feel was to act with anthony clarke for he was born to emotional experience as the sparks fly upward he had ever been a creature of unreason morbidly conscious of selfand naturally for in him struggled the blood of three races his father was scotch and his motherspanish on the spindle side and irish by way of a most mercurial fatherremained an unsolved problem all her days even to her husband her laughter was as illogical as her tears her household could never tell what the next hour would bring forth so ready were her sympathies so instant her despairs she lived all her life at the heights or the depths with never a day of serene womanly reasonable action and when she died her passing was of the same emotional stress she clung to earth like one whose body was about to drop into soundless deeps  her son had inherited all her fervency her inconstancy of purpose as well as her tendency to collapse under pressure physically he had always been of slender figure with weak lungs and these weaknesses he had used to free himself from work from responsibility  he was not a hypocritein that britt was mistaken he was by nature deeply religious his soul aspired at times to high things he was sympathetic to actual pain and had always been morbidly in awe of death the sight of any poor lost and suffering man threw him into instant profound and melancholy pity a dead beetle in the road a fly caught in a spiders web a young robin watersoaked and bedraggled appalled him even as a boy and he pondered them with sad and questioning eyes long after his young companions had forgotten them where had the light of their eyes fled he asked himself he found no sport in killing any creature and more than once he used all his slender force to defend a cat from stoning and yet he was known to have joined the worst youths of his native town in secret drinkingbouts thereby acquiring the reputation of a liar and sneak as well as that of licentiate at seventeen just when the appetite for liquor seemed beyond his control a great revivalist won his soul as the saying went and at twentythree he assumed his first pastorate  success as a pulpit orator was assured by the charm of his voice the magnetism of his manner his head was singularly handsome and often when he spoke his face was irradiated like that of a seraph and the women of all his congregations adored him from the first glance embarrassing him with their ardent praises that he had remained faithful to his wife in spite of this adoration was evidence of her great beauty of character she was indeed his safeguard and his hourly monitor while she lived  for him she had sacrificed all her friends in the east she came to the mountains without a murmur she bore with him cheered him upheld him in a hundred waysand when she died his world went black as midnight it was as if in the midst of a monster interminable cavern his one starlike light had gone out in his hand for days he beat his head against the wall crying defiant curses against his god but in the end he sank into voiceless despair then it was as he lay prone and passive that he began to hear mysterious whisperings and tappings on the walls of his cavern of despond he rose and listened he groped his way towards the dim light he returned to the world of men his faith in the scriptures was weakened but he soon discovered a wondrous change of heart towards those who claimed to be intermediaries between the worlds of matter and of spirit he turned his attention to the study of the physical evidences of life after death  up to that moment he had given but little credence to mrs lamberts halfhearted confidences concerning her own change of faith and as viola had been away at school much of the time he had forgotten that she was concerned in the mothers confession  the disclosure of her powers as he told dr brittafter they were both involved in the curious casecame violently without warning a few days after adeles death i was sitting with mrs lambert in sad conversation seeking her aid and comfort viola occupied a low chair beside the shaded lamp a book upon her knee she was listening to me i had just finished saying in deeply passionate tones i would give all my hope of life for one whisper from the lips of my adele when the room began to darken at first i thought the effect lay in my own brain but a moment later i perceived that the light had actually begun to fail we all watched it in silence for a moment then mrs lambert remarked viola mary forgot to fill the lamp  even as she spoke a cool wind blew over my head and lay along my hands the flame leaped into the air the room went black save where a pale glow coming from the street lay upon the floor a faint rustling arose a hand touched my cheek soft lips brushed my ear and a whisper that stopped the beating of my heart began a vague inarticulate murmur at first but at last i plainly heard my spiritwife speaking in gentle reprooftony tony i am always with you  the whisper ceased the hand was taken away a deep sigh came to my ear my adele was gone the moment of ecstasy was over i sat stunned inert my brain whirling with the farreaching import of this experience before i could drag myself to my feet mrs lambert practical and undisturbed threw open the door and let the light of the street in only then as i looked on viola lying in trance with white set face did i first connect her in any way with my sweet communion with adele  then like a flash of joyous light irradiating my soul came the conviction that she was the medium through whom my adele had spokenthat she had opened the gates of silence for me  i was no longer bodyi was a brain suspended in some invisible sea of force here was the reality of religion here was the answer to the anguished cry of humanityan answer to my prayers which the hebrew scriptures could not give there was a life beyond the grave the spirit did persist after the decay of the body and here in this little room when my despair was deepest the proof had come blinding me with its beauty  then i said viola you have given me the most wonderful moment of all my life you brought my adele and put her hand in mine through you i heard her voice again god has chosen you for a great work i feel it you should not repel these powers your gift may mean the most exquisite comfort to thousandsnay millionsof bereaved souls  i was amazed at the vehement unreason of her reply i dont want it she cried i hate it i wont sit again then i tried to persuade her of her great mission to no result the following night i came and we pleaded with her to act again with us but she still passionately refused why dont they come to you or to mother she complained instead of to me to this i said there is no answer they have made you their instrument and it is your duty to do their will  that night the little parlor became a battlefield mrs lambert had invoked the aid of donald mcleod her father the girls control viola resisted almost to the death it seemed as if a strong hand clutched her throat commanding obedience i feared she would be torn to pieces and at last i protested she is suffering too much let us give over the sitting but mrs lambert said quietly it is her own fault she is being punished for her obstinacy father is disciplining herhe will not harm her in the end the power conquered and the girl lay back in slumber so deep so dead that her breath seemed stilled foreverher hands icily inert her face as white as marble  why didnt you interfere asked britt sternly  how could i when the mother and the girls controls were minded otherwise besides i began to believe in the girls missioni began to understand the enormous value of her work my god dr britt had i that girls gift i would engross the world i would write such words across the tomb that death would seem as sweet as baby slumber i would make the grave a gateway to the light i would eliminate sorrow from the earth the bible no longer satisfies me i want something more than cold black letters on a printed page i want to know i want to thrill the world with a new message and here now at my hand is a medium i can never have this powerperhaps it is only given to babes and to sucklings but i can spread the light you dr britt shall help me let us study this wonderful gift let us concentrate our energies upon this supreme problem i will note all that comes to us and i will write a burning booka revelation that shall go round the globe guiding and gladdening every human soul think of it there is no mightier mission on earth this girl can be and must be made a savior a hopebringer to thousands of despairing souls  to this fervid appeal britt remained impassive and coldly criticaltill chilled and repelled clarke had withdrawn his confidence the two still met occasionally in mrs lamberts home but their antagonism had deepened to actual hatred britt impotent to help had long since ceased to protest even to the girl herself for he had learned that every revolt on her part brought keener pain and deeper humiliation in its train he entered upon a study of the subject and thus far had found little to encourage the hope of the girls redemption from her maladies  clarke too had surrounded himself with every available book which bore upon these baffling phases of human experiences and had put himself in touch with every society organized for the investigation of occult phenomenaand in his dark little den brooded day and night over the dimly apprehended laws of the unseen universe he left his studies only to be with viola who had become as necessary to him as his daily foodas indispensable as air she was at once his hope and his very present help how to keep her how to mould her to his will how to use her to his great purpose of ridding the world of the fear of deaththese became his hourly care his only interest  to these ends he strove to enthrall her by his singing by his oratory and by his love of poetry knowing well that to drum constantly upon the harsh string of her mission would revolt her and she thus beset thus beleaguered gave over her rebellion resigning herself to her guides till this ruddy and powerful young man of science came into her world to fill her with new determination to escape from her mental slavery  clarke loved this girl not as he had loved adele of course but quite as humanly her mediumship so vital to the world so sacred in his eyes had but added to her allurement all that i am and all i hope to be is bound up in the possession of that sweet wonderful child he said in acknowledgment of his discovery in a very subtle way he now apprehended a change in the girl and realizing how utterly his aims his daily happiness his future depended upon her he rose from his seat resolved not merely to advise against her going away but to claim her as his ownhis wife  my wife at this deeply significant word adeles pleading face rose vividly before him writhing with shame before her reproachful glance he cried out but i cannot live alone and then consideri shall be able to meet you each day perhaps each hour and as i myself develop in grace of soul i may come to you without any medium i am not disloyal to you adele i love this girl i confess that but not as i loved you you were my true wife the only spouse i can ever haveyou filled my soul my love for this girl is that of a fathera teacher i need her foroh my adele i will confess before you came back to me through this child i was weary of the earth ready to violently end my anguish viola put your hand again in mineshe gave me to hear your voice i cannot bear to lose those priceless moments and yet i must do so if she goes from me am i not justified in desiring her presence come to me tell me tonight what you would have me do be merciful my angel spouse remember my empty desolate heart remember the greatness of the work i have set myself to do oh my sweet spirit if you could only put an arm about my neck now without any other interposing soul come to me whisper to menow let me know your presence here as i sit alone and despairing  he ceased to pray and bowed his head upon his desk and waited in an agony of hopewaited while the darkness deepened and the splendid eternal song of the river proclaimed the futility and folly of man a cricket sang with heartpiercing cheer as if to say i die tomorrow but i never despair but no silken rustle no whispering voice came to still the agony welling in bitter sighs from the lips of the tempted man     x  clarkes wooing   mrs lambert was face to face with a decision of almost equal momentwas indeed in the midst of formulating the question which perplexed her in order that she might lay it before her invisible guides for their consideration she had just written upon a slate these words shall i take viola and go east or shall i send her on alone when clarkes foot was heard outside her door hastily hiding the slate she rose to meet her visitor  he was very pale and something in his glance made her aware that his call was of no ordinary intent  where is viola he asked abruptly  she has gone to the street with a friend she will return soon  i am glad you are alone i want to talk with you i dont like the condition of mind viola is in today the coming of this eastern professor seems to have stirred her to another fit of restless desire to go away i cant think of this julia she is too precious to me to lose she has become a part of my very hearts blood and i am afraid to let her go out of my sight she is young and very impressionable if she goes away into the city we may both lose her forever the time has come to tell you that i love hernot precisely as i loved adele but deeply passionately i want her as my wife i ask your consent to tell her sotonight will you give that permission  mrs lambert gazed up at him with such fixity of surprise that the rush of his forthright appeal weakened towards its end she was overwhelmed by the intensity of passion in his voice as well as by surprise that he so soon after his bitter loss could turn to anotherto her daughter a child and at last she whispered what will they say anthony  this question he had anticipated and his reply was ready they will advise it i am sure for does it not fit to their purpose does not my great book depend on violas daily cooperation i have no fear of their answer i fear what she will say he began to pace up and down the room what from their point of view does her musical education signify think of it she holds the key to the gates of death on her the hopes of millions hang she is the most wonderful organism in this worldso normal in all other ways so trustworthy she will convince all who come into her presence and then have not her controls chosen me to publish their discoveries to the world it is ordained that we work together in this way she must not go to new york that vast caldron which destroys all that is spiritual she should go only when closely guarded by those who love her and understand her exquisite nature her gifts some day i will take her there alone she will be prevented from her grand mission her message lost her faith destroyed cant you see she must not go  i have done my best to keep her  i know you have he answered quickly and now you must give me authority over herthe authority of a husband i am willing to put the whole matter to the test this night she knows that i love her and i think she honors and respects meperhaps she may already love me unworthy as i am  the mother began now to tremble i dont know anthony she thoughtwe all understoodthat you  i know what you mean he irritably exclaimed why will you persist in misreading me i am not disloyal to adele cant you see that my devotion for her remains and that my regard for viola is no treason to the dead adele will understand how vital how necessary viola is to me for does she not know that i could not even communicate with her if viola went away i do not love viola as a boy loves but as a man who understands himself and heras one who understands her duties it is a different love but it is just as true and it is high and holy without her i would have gone mad she saved me from despair her union with me will make her an evangel to the earthbound millions  flattered as well as awed by this disclosure of her daughters power the mother consented to his demand marriage with him would safeharbor viola would establish her in life and would also carry forward the work which she too considered of greater importance than any other concern of her life  i dont know her mind anthony she said after a silence she worries and puzzles me lately by her opposition to all our plans but i dont think she is attached to any of the young men she knows still she is not one to speak of such things and if she consents  when she comes leave her to me answered he with returning confidence deep in the mans egotistic soul lay the thought i know why this girl is restless and uneasyi know why she seeks afar off it is because she thinks me indissolubly bound to adele when she finds that i love her that i want her for my wife she will comeher vague rebellions will cease her longings will close round me  when the door opened and viola stepped into the room so tall so vivid so tingling with life the very force of his desire rendered clarke outwardly humble drove him to a feigning of sadness and to the voicing of desolate weakness after the mother left them alone he began speaking in a low voice with deepdropping cadences  viola i have something important to say to you i am much disturbed over your renewed determination to go away in the face of the great work which is yours to do i do not understand how you can think of dropping it in midair so to speak to go away on an errand which is essentially selfishas well as most unwise and full of danger i dont understand this renewal of restlessness on your part  the girls face was clouded for she had just learned of servisss departure and was deeply hurt she drew the pin from her hat and silently laid it on the table and in this gesture was something of the resolution of the warrior who divests himself of his cumbering plumed helmet its very simple she curtly answered i want to get away from here for a while i cant endure my life here any longer  why not why are you so unhappy he asked with an accent of stern reproof it is a beautiful landyou are among your own people you have your music your work and you are young you ought to be happy  thats just it she interrupted quite fiercely it is because i am young that i want to do something it seems to me today as if i were losing the best years of my life here in this little town and i want to get away i must get away  does your work with me seem of no value his glowing eyes sought hers he approached her do i weary you am i an irritation  her face softened no you have helped me very much i couldnt have endured this life without you and my music but this other lifethese sittingsi cant go on with them  dont you feel that you must dont you feel their enormous importance  no i dont i begin to doubt myselfeverybody what have they done for you for anybody that i should sacrifice nay whole life to them and their wishes  they brought me healing they made dr randall happy in his last years they are a daily solace to your mother they will comfort millions through our agency he bent towards her viola my girl god has designed for you and me a closer union than even this you say i have comforted you that i have made life happier for you i have come tonight to tell you that i love you and that i want you to be my wife  the girl recoiled from the touch of his hand uttering a low cry of surprise of question  he went on yes i have grown to care for you beyond any other human being you are my staff my stay god sent you to my spiritual healing i should have gone mad but for you he bent upon her a look of passion and command you must not think of going away you belong to me her face warned him that his appeal was being misinterpreted and he added quickly i know this comes to you abruptly and yet you must have felt my love you must have read my heart  not in that way she answered in a low voice i thought youi always understood the memory of his professed suffering his oftexpressed adoration for the dead adele checked her filled her with a storm of doubt and she could not finish her accusation  he caught up the thread she dropped i did love adele i love her stilla holy mysterious lovea love you cannot understand my feeling for you is different but no less high it is the cry of a lonely desolate man come to me viola do not question follow your hearts leadings as i do the light of her accusing young eyes pierced the armor of his defence and he fell upon his knees before her i cant explain it but it is true viola i have not deceived you i loved heri love her still she is vital in my life i was sincere in all i said but you are flesh and she is spirit dont you see you can comfort meassist me work with me as she cannot  as he poured out his passionate plea a sense of injury of disillusionment overran the girl she revolted from the touch of his head against her knee you must not talk to me that wayyou belong to her she pushed him away get up go away from me i hate you now  there was something so final so convicting in her gesture of repulsion that the mans head dropped he covered his face and uttered a groaning cry and so lay silently sobbing while she looked down at himwomangrown in that instant his passion moved her to pity not to love and she put him aside gently and left the room without further word her master her highest earthly guide had fallen from his lofty place and lay grovelling at her feet this conception vague but massive oppressed her heart and lay upon her brain like a leaden cap  at the moment she too despaired of life and knew not where to turn for aid     book ii     i  the modernists   the bacteriologic department of the corlear medical school stood at this time on one of the crossstreets of the old east side not far from corlear park it was a large oldfashioned brick building worn of threshold and as ugly in line as a livery barn its entrance was merely a gap in the wall its windows rectangular openings to let in the light not one touch of color or grace not one dignified line could be detected throughout its whole exterior it was constructed for use not ornament  interiorly it was quite as utilitarian its halls bare and cheerless echoed to the tread and were repellent as those of a barracks the visitor felt chilled disappointed as if he had been met by the insolent servant of an indifferent hostess it seemed the home of the mathematical the mechanical the material but this was a mistake it was a house of dreams the right knock at one of those ugly doors would permit one to step into the presence of the most cheery the most learned the most imaginative of individualsthe man of germs poet dreamer and experimentalist absorbed in the pursuit of the unattainable concerned with the ultimate structure of organic life baffled yet toiling on for love of his work while the sick of the world believe in him as an angel of altruism  the faraway rivers of

dreamer of baseless visions and christ but incarnate love in an age of war the creator they conceive is too profound to admit of any attribute he neither thinks nor feels and the life that pulses at

morton serviss returned after eight weeks study of the sands and the stars and the cavedwellings of vanished men from the infinitely lonely and huge and beautiful he cloistered himself to pore upon the habits of the infinitely small to listen to the swarming diminished tumult of the protozoa he came back as usual brown alert and keeneyedeager for work confident of some new victory for he was an investigator of weight and standing among the younger men of science on the street he was indistinguishable from other debonair young men of good social position in his laboratory he was a master absorbed reticent and precise of plan  his chief a little gray bent brusque german greeted him with absentminded smile remarked briefly upon his good health and then they set to work in thirty seconds he had forgotten the desert the face of viola all his energies concentrated on the segment of cancer beneath his eye a newly developed germ a thousandth part the stature of a gnats toe shut out the valley of the colorow all day he moved among a wilderness of tubes jars and copper ovens peering observingand in a sense happy  but at night when alone with his pipe in his study the lavender sands the violet peaks the vivid saffron skies returned with power viola too came back to bewitch him from his reading to make his microscopic world of shadowy substance and the smell of his laboratory a hateful thing  he heard nothing further of her britt wrote once or twice but did not allude to either clarke or the lamberts and serviss did not care to ask particularly about them it was better for him not to be concerned further with the girls singular history he hated the irregular the pretentious his own life so clear so well regulated made her daily performances the more monstrous the whole had become so foolish in retrospect that he refrained from speaking of it even to his sister  it was not quite true that he saw little of new york for his sister mrs ricea widow with two childrenwho kept his house or rather his double flat was a social soul and not merely went about freely but entertained regularly they lived handsomely and the world in which they moved was crowded with duties as well as with sane pleasures they entertained at their table artists from paris savans from berlin and literary lesser lights from london and they enjoyed all this envying the richer and more ostentatious families of the city as little as they despised the poor of hester street the one quality which they insisted upon in their guests was intellectual cleverness perhaps they were a little severe on bores  their ways were quite as remote from the socalled captains of industry as from the farmers of jersey and the roar of broad street was so far away it reached them but as the hum of hornets outside their windowpane to the explorer of tibet this life was narrow to the gay dinnerparties of upper fifth avenue it would have seemed dull to the wrecker of railroads on wall street it was indubitably petty to the merchant it was unprofitable and yet they were quite content with it and looked out upon the bustling throngs of fashion and the hustling world of business with equal word of goodnatured contempt  we cant all be biologists serviss was accustomed to say and i suppose somebody must continue to steal and murder     illustration viola too came back to bewitch him from his    reading  they came of good stock these servisses and knew it and felt it breeding was indicated in their wellset heads in their shapely hands and especially in their handsome noses we are inclined to be stubby thats true but we have the noses of aristocratsthey go back to the aryans of the danube said mrs rice to a friend morton cannot consider a girl of questionable pedigree no matter how rich or charming she may be we believe in stocknot in family but strain a family is an accident a strain is a formation the mortons and the servisses are strains their union in my brother will yet make itself felt her confidence in his powers was absolute he is one of the greatest young men of his day time will show she added as if to clinch her argument  the circle of their acquaintance included first of alland of coursethe scientific group then in successive widening waves the general literary and educational fraternities the artistic and musical sets and finally they kept in touch with the old new york families their own schoolmates and friends and those related all the details and duties of the social side of his life morton turned over to kate and such was her tact and her skill and charm as hostess that her rooms of a tuesday afternoon were filled with a company of men and women as cheerful and as informal as they were clever and distinguished among these groups serviss moved as detached of all responsibility as any of his guests finding in this contact with bright minds one of the greatest pleasures of his life  these various circles moved afar from isms they prided themselves on their balance their commonsense their fund of comparative ideas true some of the women had embraced christian science more or less openly but they did not esteem it necessary to proselyte political creeds were but jocularly discussed to advocate any special belief was to prick ones self down a bore although some of those in the strictly university circles did at times become troublesomely learned in conversation however this was esteemed old fogyism by the younger men like serviss who alluded to the days of the professional monologue with smiling contempt conversation with them was a means of diversion not of enlightenment as to any special subject  into these circles a thoroughgoing spiritualist never penetrated to tell the truth these modernists did not permit the hereafter to awe or affright them some of them went to church but they did so calmly patiently as to a decorous function and some may at times have prayed through the medium of printed supplication but generally speaking they had reached a sort of philosophic indifference as to the onetime burning question of heaven or hell so far from acquiescing in the dictum that morality was but filthy rags they esteemed good deeds and clean thoughts higher than any religion whatsoever  mrs rice expressed the convictions of many of her associates by saying humorously no i dont want to be saved im not lost i dont know as i care for immortality forever is a long timei might get bored anyhow the future must take care of itself  in all the drawingrooms of his friends morton serviss was a most welcome guest his frank boyish ways his careless dress his freedom from cant his essential goodfellowship deceived the most of his acquaintances into thinking him a mere dabbler in science a man of wealth amusing himself but weissmann who was qualified to know said he has persistency concentration a keen mind a clear eye and a voonderful physique  he belonged moreover to the men of imagination not to those who write books or poems but to those who tunnel mountains build vast bridges invent new motors and play with electrical currents as if they were ribbons the novelist basing himself on what he knows of human nature projects himself into the unknown just as the scientist who stands on the discoveries of those before him feels out into the darkness for new stars new forces and yet as clarke and his party indignantly declared both novelist and scientist ignore the question most vital to us allthe question of the souls survival after deathignore it till some loved one dies then they too agonize in secret over the mystery for a space only to rise and go back to their work concealing the conviction which their hour of anguish brought to them  perhaps it was not chance but deep design which had brought this vigorous young investigator face to face with a mystery crying out for solutioncertainly it was not without craft that the unseen powers had baited their hook with the almost irresistible allurement of a young and ardent girl if there is logic in the shadow fate was on violas side     ii  news of viola   one morning in late march while serviss was still at his mornings mail dr britts card came in bringing with it instant vivid recollection of colorow the beauty of his days there had by no means faded from his mind although he had succeeded in putting his romance in the background of his working brain and had given up all thought of ever seeing viola again  he greeted britt most cordially so you turned up at last how is the lung isnt this a raw time of the year for you  well yes but my father died a few days ago and i had to come on and being near i ran in to see how you and the bugs were getting on  oh were thriving their ways are quite absorbing how is your own farm  all in ruins the fact is ive neglected the poor little brutes i had no time for germs after i went off into the study of spooks  you dont tell me youve turned investigator of spirits what have you discovered  not a thing its the most elusive problem i ever tackled you remember the lamberts  very well i was about to ask about them  theyre here now  here in new york  yes they went to boston last fallboston is a hotbed of spookism as you may know they spent the winter there among the brethren and have come on here for a change  theyll get it what isthe girl doing  spooking mainly thats all her guides will allow her to do clarke still dominates the household by the aid of the ghostly granddaddya grim old chap that they hold regular séances now  you dont mean it serviss grew graver yet of countenance i had hoped they would spare her that humiliation i havent seen her name in the papers  oh they dont go quite so far as that the circles are very select only the priests of the faith and their friends are invitedno admission feeyou understand  im glad of that it would be too bad to put that child forward in the double rôle of fakir and moneybreeder but tell me have you any fresh light on the subject of her mediumship  well yes ive changed my point of view slightly im inclined to think there is pretty generally some basis for the faith the literature of the subject is immense and some of it is as well authenticated as any physical treatise im convinced that miss lambert has no intent to deceiveshe has no possible motive to do sobut clarke has and yet i cannot connect him directly with the phenomena  how is her health  very good apparently she is quite as blooming as when you saw her and is immensely more mature mentally  is she resigned to her life  sometimes she is and sometimes not she is very sensitive to influences and at times when clarke is near she grows almost as enthusiastic as heat other times she bitterly complains i tried to free her from clarke but she wouldnt give me the authority necessary  what do you mean by that  there was something both sad and mocking in britts face as he answered i offered to marry herwasnt that generous of me she spurned my humble offer intimating that there was small choice between me and clarke and the spooks no ill be honest she was very nice and kind about it and added that perhaps mr clarke was righther duty in the world was to convince people of the reality of the forces or something like that i shall never marry she added to soften the blow and really she does seem a person set apart  serviss looked down at his book i suppose she imagines herself stricken with a mortal illness i confess i sometimes think of her in that way i cant understand why her parents he checked himself where are they stopping  theyre housed over near the riverside drive with a wild enthusiast who has oodles and wads of moneyold simeon pratt  ive heard of simeonuncle simeon the reporters call him on the street i remember now about his spiritualism he had some remarkable experiences after his wifes deathdrowned wasnt she  you cant afford to be indefinite about simeons sorrows doctor for they made him what he is i find these believers all start in about the same way simeons wife and two daughters were lost in the english channel simeon became a believer the following mondayor maybe it was tuesday  i recall the story of his life now it was all very tragic i wonder he didnt become a maniac  some people think he did answered britt dryly  so theyre with simeon he lives gorgeously im told  about like a lone american guest in a twentyfrancperday hotel in paris why yes theyre very comfortable thereall but the girl shes discontented and unhappy if im any judge and is besieged day and night by the mourning faithful not to speak of certain amorous males  this hurt and serviss shifted ground does she keep up her music  again britt smiled but not humorously she plays the harpin the dark  you mean  shes taken on a lot more of the regulation tricksmaterializing flowers slatewriting music without hands etc  you dont mean it i can hardly associate such doings with her sorrow and indignation mingled in his voice  i assure you i was there last night at a circle and these things took place with clarke as ringmaster there wasnt a particle of originalityit was the same old mill and the same old grist yet i dont hold her responsible in any harmful degree i cant believe she designedly tricks but shes surrounded now by a gang of chattering softpated women and men with bats in their belfry who unite in assuring her that her godgiven powers must be fostered theyve cut her off from any decent marriageshes virtually a prisoner to their whims what they may induce her to do next i dont know im going to hang round here for a week or two and see a violent fit of coughing interrupted him when he recovered he looked up sidewise isnt this a peach of a climate wouldnt you think theyd build at least one of their big cities where microbes couldnt fatten on genius  what led clarke to consent to leaving the west when i was there he bitterly opposed her going  oh its very simple he has written a book on the physical proof of immortality and being anxious for a publisher withdrew his opposition to her plan and declared himself willing to go to bostonat lamberts expense  is he out of the church  absolutely you should have heard his farewell sermon it really was as dramatic a speech as i ever heard he went on to declare that the hebrews were not the only seers that the wells of inspiration were not yet dry that revelation was waiting upon every soul today and that he had been led by sorrow to listen at the keyhole and so on i trembled for the girls secret but he had himself in hand and did not betray her no one out there knows for certain what her abnormalities are  how about lambert why didnt he take a hand  he seemed bewildered by it all and overawed by clarke and the girls controls its all above timberline for me he said but he didnt like their coming away a little bit he was angry with clarke for breaking up his home and if the girl had been his own i think he would have stopped the business long ago then there was a young fellow clinton ward who was working for lambert a fine young fellow  i remember him  well it seems that his father is a partner in a publishing firm in boston and clarke tried to make use of him to get his book published and i believe his firm is to take it meanwhile the young fellow is in love with viola and willing to marry her and take chances but his family is very properly aghast viola knowing thisor for some other reasonrefuses him and there you are the girl seems cursed on all sides and worst of all has to endure clarke and his ravings twelve hours of every mortal day  what is her relation to clarke asked serviss hesitatingly  well now i dont know sometimes i think he controls her by some infernal hypnotic power and then again from some phrase of her own i think she considers her mind diseased and marriage with any one else impossible  i dont see how the mother can stand by and see her daughters life burned away  she in her turn seems enslaved to the dead she has often told me that her fathers spirit is leading her every movement  that particular ghost is clarkedont you think  britts eyes narrowed i dont know i have never been able to connect him directly with a single one of these manifestations and yet he must be at the bottom of part of it  it all comes back then to the girl herself  britt rose uneasily i repeat i am completely at sea i have studied every line of old randalls notes till im dopy myself everything has conspired to make the girl hystericalto fasten some accursed mental weakness upon her if i could have stopped it two years ago she might have outgrown it every year now makes it less easy for her to shake it offwhatever it is  atrocious exclaimed serviss has no one authority to act  britt shrugged his shoulders what would you do when both parentsthe living and the deadconsent only a husband could intervene and clarke seems to be about to claim that place no i see no hope for the girl she may be right after all in joining clarke  serviss rose to release the emotional tension under which he had kept his limbs you dont know their present plans  no only that clarke is going to publish soon he looked round the room what a development since my time bacteriology and autotransportation are neck and neck in their amazing expansion  thereupon they dropped all reference to the lamberts and their trials and turned their minds upon phagocytes and other ravening mites whose likes and dislikes minute as they are work more devastation than cannon  servisss work was over for that day after britt went away he sat idly at his desk his mind busy with the revolting pictures called up by what he had heard of viola they are destroying a beautiful soul he exclaimed bitterly as he recalled the charm of her face and voice on that ride to the mine they are forcing a charming girl into an abominable life they are warping her moral fibre into ugliness and deathand clarke is the fanatic devil of the scheme  the desire to see her to talk with her to measure the change in her grew very strongso strong that he meditated a call but the thought of clarke cut the resolution off before it was fully formed probably britt is rightclarkes rotten soul has fatally infected hers  when weissmann came in serviss turned to him and said doctor i want to ask you a very unusual question  proceed replied the old man who spoke with a little touch of the german now and then  what do you think of the claims of spiritualism  weissmann did not smile as serviss had expected he became grave i am not qualified to judge speaking generally i would say there are many phases to be considered there are some millions of people who believe in itwhich would argue some small basis of truth to start with on the other hand the extraordinary credulity of these people is to be taken into account  you mean they are those bereaved and anxious to believe  precisely again speaking generally i find few things impossible in this world of mystery to take an old metaphor i would not be surprised to find a grain of wheat in all this bushel of chaff every genuine phenomenon in the world stands related to every other phenomenon and i believe that the truth or falsity of the spiritualistic hypothesis can be determined in accordance with physical science if i were young and strong like you i would devote myself to the study of this delusion it should be studied by one like yourselfto whom death is no near presence as for me i have two sons and one wife dead my judgment would be vitiated therewith you have no dead you would make an admirable student of these spiritvoices and signs  serviss though a little awed by the old mans unexpectedly solemn manner ventured further have you ever witnessed any of these unaccountable doings which crookes and zöllner instance  i have had them in my own chamber the old mans eyes twinkled once as i was dozing on my bed one morning early a faint cloud like a puff of smoke began to form above my head it became pendulous reaching towards me and out of it a hand developed and extended i said it is an hallucinationvery curious i will touch it and it will vanish i reachedi grasped the handit was warm and solid i leaped from my bed with a yell he chuckled at his keenly remembered discomfiture  how do you account for it it was an illusion of course you thought the illusion only ocularit extended to the sense of touch  weissmanns eyes gleamed speculatively we will let it go so the world of sense and the world of spirit curiously intermingleas we know  but these manifestations so far as i have any knowledge are so foolish and childish  well so many foolish and childish persons have gone to the other world death is not the beginning of wisdom i am an old man serviss and already many of my loved ones are dead i should like to believe they are still sentient and maybe they are i am german the blood of kant is in my veins he seemed to be speaking partly to himself i do not dogmatize so gladly as i once did as i do not know the essence of matter it would be folly for me to assume to fathom the depth of spirit the essential hopelessness of science is coming to render me humble spiritualism certainly is a comfortable belief i would gladly embrace it if i could i suspend judgment this desire for another life may be only a survival of a more unreasoning time something we will outgrow  serviss was profoundly surprised by his chiefs attitude he had expected a large calm and rather contemptuous reply to his question in place of decision he encountered a doubt a hesitancy which betrayed weakness rudolph weissmann great as he was belonged to the innumerable throng of the bereaved whose judgments are clouded by passion he too was growing old his allembracing mind had yielded to an hallucination  the young mans respect for his chief did not diminish but a feeling of sadness swept over him as he realized that another renowned and fearless investigator was nearing the end of his great usefulness and that upon the clear blue steel of his intelligence the rust of age had begun to fall truly the power of his early training his worship of kant and his school was still vital  then he pondered his words if i were a young man like you i would investigate this thing and recalled that no young man of science had ever devoted himself to it they all came to it late in life after bereavement  the bereaved the whole stupendous delusion seemed to rest upon the overmastering desire of the bereaved for their beloved the great and good men and women among the believers he was willing to admit there were such came to investigation weakened by sorrow made illogical by loss they put their sane judgment their strength their calm patience aside and grasped eagerly at the lying comfort extended to them they were not merely deceived they developed fraud by their blindness by their hunger for consolation and by their crass credulity he was still young enough to have inexorable theoriesto be of singlehearted loyalty to his creed to him as a monist the soul as an entity apart from the body did not exist consciousness was a physical disturbance of the higher nerve centres and thought a secretion of the brain he acknowledged no line of demarcation between the crystal and the moneraand no chasm of course between man and the animals the universe was a unitand all its forms and forces differentiations of one substance and that substance too mysterious to be analyzed or named in such a philosophy as this there could be no room for any hypothesis which even so much as squinted towards dualism or that permitted a conception so childish as the persistence of the individuality after death  however he did not carry his implacable principles into the homes of his friends and seldom permitted them to interfere with his enjoyment of wines or good dinners the theatre or the drawingroom this fact from a cynical point of view proved his faith to have been as truly of his laboratory as that of a bishop with spencer and darwin and koch and haeckel as the founders of its articles  he went home that night with the words of both weissmann and britt intermingling in his mind strongly tempted to tell violas story to his sister and so enlist her sympathy for the poor girl  but it happened that an engagement to dine filled kates mind and he had no time to open the subject till they were on the way and by that time he had concluded not to involve her in his perplexity  by a curious coincidence one of the guests at the dinner brought a hush of expectancy over the entire company by relating a series of experiences he had been privileged to share with a psychic some years before he told of his mystification with a laugh in his eyes and with racy vigor of tongue but serviss newly alive to the topic could not but marvel at the intensity of interest manifested by every soul present disguise it as we may said the narrator this question of the life beyond the grave is chief of all our problems it is the sovereign mystery after all  at this the hostess spoke i wish we could see some of these things you make us shudder deliciously cant you sometime bring this remarkable young womantheyre always women arent they  oh no laughingly replied the young fellow one of the most amusing stunts i ever saw was that of a man in washington who made a banjo play behind a curtain while holding both your hands  why do the spirits do such foolish things i should think theyd be ashamed to act so frivolous like  they always talk like indians dont they its a pity why arent they dignified and sincere  the young storyteller went on thats just it the mediums are so nonchalant while causing these marvels that they fail to convince why when i was holding a slate in order that they might write upon it i minded the scratching no more than a clock aticking they had made me that careless of their hocuspocus a voice in my ear cant make me start and nothing absolutely nothing can now rouse my fell of hair you put a potato in the ashes of the hearth and it will ultimately pop into something to eat you put a medium in a dark place and she will set your souls nerves atingle  under all this banter serviss perceived the pulse of an interest which laid hold on the most secret hopes and fears of the youngest and shook the eldest with an elemental dread and longing it was as if the floodgates of a sea of doubt and wonder had been turned in upon a dozen minds hitherto as well kept as lawns questions popped like corks and answers were as vivacious as the gurgle of wine but the topic remained indeterminatethe argument inconclusive  on their way home serviss said to his sister did you notice how profound the silence became when ralph started that discussion of the occult  it is always so  is it really i hadnt noticed it particularly  thats because people are afraid to talk such things before you scientists why every woman there has been to a palmist or mindreader or something  you astonish me have you  of course i go every little while just for fun we all pretend that we dont believe in it but we do im scared blue every time i go to a new onetheyre all such creepy creatures the last one i went to was positively weird  serviss was severe kate i am ashamed of you to think that you a woman of penetration associating with people of rare intelligence like myself  but why dont you people of rare intelligence look into these things why do you leave us poor untrained emotional creatures to suffer befoolment when you could so easily instruct us and shield us  because while we could easily prove you befooled you would still follow after your sawdust idols we prefer to save you from your bodily infirmities and contagions and so react on your minds  she laughed thats very clever of you and very decent stay with your germs rob us of our diseases but leave us oh leave us our delicious thrills she became grave the fact is morton we all have moments when we feel the presence of the dead i do father and mother never seem away off in our graceland vault sometimes they seem to be in the room with me its all a fancy youll say and very foolish but i believe mother actually comes to help me with georgie when he is ill sometimes in the deep of the night i thrill as if she touched me  he was not unsympathetic as he said you never hinted at this before  i was afraid to do so if mother exists somewhere and in some etherealized form why cant she come back why couldnt her mind act on mine and produce the sensation of her presence  perhaps it could only there is no proof of its ever happening  now see here morton so long as we are on this subject at last i want to ask you do you believe mother is goneabsolutely blotted out of existence she waited in tense silence and as they passed a streetlamp and the light fell on his face he seemed to have grown suddenly pale do you believe darwin and spencer and victor hugo have gone to nothingness  no at the bottom of my heart i cant think that and yet theoretically i cannot conceive of the existence of any soul apart from the body think of it if mother lives so do all the billions of cannibals negroes bushmenyou cant draw a line and say here begins the immortal souls  that isnt the question i do not believe that father and mother and hayward have vanished into a handful of dust i cling to a belief in their living selves not because the bishop and the prayerbooks say so but just because my own mind says so i wont surrender them thats all  and yet a faith springing from such a desire is not well based i want to tell you about some people i met last summer they will interest you thereupon he pictured his first meeting with viola he described the mother and clarke he told of his interview with britt and of randalls revelations concerning violas life and now they have convinced the girl that she should extend her sphere of influence and bring her chicanery to bear on the metropolis  how do you know it is chicanery  britt said  i dont care what britt said you found the mother sweet and you admit the girl is charming ill trust your instinct in such matters mort youve never been one to run after frumps and minxes she had good eyes  beautiful eyes steady bluegray wistful she quite enchanted me at first  and youre sentimental over her still  i didnt say that i was sentimental over her at any time  i dont care what you said i can tell by your voice that she is a lost sweet dream what do you want me to do  nothing  yes you do you want me to see her and find out what shes doing here it is kate to the rescue i will go tomorrow  you are too precipitate you might wait and get my mind  i have your mind already and i believe in doing things vigorously besides youve roused my curiosity after all these years of waiting to see you get interested in something besides your bugsim delighted to know youre human and that there is one woman in the world who can make you moan you are hitdont deny it youve been brooding on that girl all this time ive known you were hit but i thought i would wait till you cared to speak im crazy to see her i shall act at once  its too much to ask of you but i hope you will consider me to the extent  if your theory is correct that girl ought to be snatched away before the mob of occultists freaks and flatterers of this city utterly spoil her anyhow im going to look into her case on my own account and in this determination she snuggled into the corner of the carriage and became silent  serviss found that sharing his experience with his sister had enormously increased the weight and importance of his doubt viola and her singular beleaguerment had suddenly grown to be a vital problemsomething to be immediately seized upon and he casually added it is only fair to say that the lamberts are above the need of taking money for any display of psychic force  suddenly kate sat up suppose the girl really has these powers  that is impossible  why impossible do you men of science pretend to know all there is to know  certainly not but think what such an admission involves  no matter what it involves you dont ask what the xray involves you ask first of all is it a fact if the girl has these powers then what you dont even know what she claims do you  not in detail  well then dont condemn her till you know what youre condemning her for  kate you amaze me i thought you would commend my cool judgment my sanity and lo and behold as aunt celina says you have become the girls advocate and the assailant of science  not at all i merely say you scientific people should not be so insultingly sure that people with a faith are fools  we dont say foolswe merely say misinformed  anyhow youve interested me in this medium  for heavens sake dont call her that if youre going to see her to apply such a name to that sweet child is an outrage  kates voice was exultant as she cried out now i know youre in love with her  mrs rice you are a very wise woman  i hope i shall not find you a very silly scientist she replied with several implications of superiority in both words and tone     iii  britt comes to dine   his sisters blunt words brought morton face to face with himself his heart had been touched his imagination fired by viola hence his discontent his heat of anger towards the unlovely side of her life it was the memory of her that had kept him halfhearted to the claims of several comely women of his circle whom kate had advocated  and now his mind which ought to have been given up entirely to bacteria was filled with the face and fortunes of one who was either living a lie or suffering from an abnormally developed brain singular and sad predicament for a man who had determined to move slowly and with calm foresight furthermore the whole world in which his love lived and moved was repellent silly and morbid since his meeting with her he had tried to read some of the journals devoted to her faith and had found them incredibly inanesmudgily printed slovenly of phrase and filled with messages from aristotle columbus and confucius which would have been discouraging in a boy of twelve years old the phraseology the cant terms nauseated him the advertisements of psychics worldfamous mediums palmists horologists and only the devil himself knows what else filled him with disgust added to his already poor opinion of sick humanity of these viola now formed a partas an actress shares the envy the brag the selfish blatant struggle for success which is reflected in the advertising columns of dramatic journals he ran down each column of display ads of the world of spirit timorously almost expecting to see a notice of the marvellous psychic miss viola lambert the mountain seeressand so on  on deeper thought he found these papers shrewdly contrived to take human beings at their weakest point their most unguarded moment they had the boldness of the juggler who knows the blind spot in the eyes of his spectators they occupied a field apart from all other periodicals in the world science literature and art concerned them only so far as they touched upon illuminated or strengthened faith in the farther shore they were as special as a tradejournalfar more so indeed for the boot and shoe news prints occasional reviews of books and some admirable stories may be found within its pages side by side with notes on burnishers and stitchingmachines  the accounts of circles sittings and séancesgood lord how he hated that wordwere almost comic and yet to think of viola and her gracious mother concerned with these meetings even as spectators filled him with angry disgust  according to britt the girl was a selfdeluded fakir at the bestat the worst an habitual hysterical trickster avid for notoriety in either case a tainted leprous thinga woman to be shunned by every man who valued a dignified and wholesome life it was worse than folly to permit such a creature to break in on his work to draw his mind from his reading nevertheless she continued to do both these things  the next morning as he was leaving the house for his office he stepped into the diningroom and took a seat by his sisters side  kate he said and his voice was stern you must not call upon miss lambert  why not morton  because it would prove a snare to you and an embarrassment to me she is a singularly attractive girl no one can face her and accuse her britt says she is much more mature than when i saw her and by that he meant to convey that she had grown clever if not tricky there is a bad streak in her im afraid for all her charm and you would better let her entirely alone upon the most charitable construction she is hysterical and her deception probably arises as britt says from a diseased brain in any case she is not a fit person for you to meet  but you said she has good eyes  she has she is bewitchingly pretty but that only makes her case the more perplexing why trouble ourselves about her  im going to call upon her anyway im not afraid i am wild to see a girl who can upset you so completely you are upset i can see that  morton laughed rather sadly thats a fine womanly reason and may be sufficient for you but if you go understand kate it is against my wish i do not care to know anything more about her and her problems she has interfered too much with my work already  she looked deep into his soul then took another tack well then bring on this man britt hes the only witness for the prosecution isnt he lets have him to dinner i want to interrogate him as the lawyers say i want to know what kind of a man he is before i take his word against a girl who rejected him he may be only jaundiced  he was their family physician  i dont care if he was he may be seeking revenge on the girl she put her arm about his neck you poor boy that girls troubles have upset you im delighted to find you so humanly romanticat least i would be if she werent so questionable but well find out im on her side till i know more of britt besides im not sure that her mysterious powers are not real and she sent him away less keenly concerned with all her impulse and zeal of friendship she was a woman of sense and power                                       britt came to dinner promptly gratified for a chance to wear his evening dress kate received him gladly but was taken aback by his languid elegance of manner he really looked distinguished and she rather hastily explained our dinner is only a family affair dr britt we wanted to have you all to ourselves  nothing could be better for me mrs rice i assure you he answered gallantly a formal dinner would embarrass me ive been so long in the hills i feel like a long island hermit its a far halloo from colorow to the bowery  its farther still from the bowery to colorow thats what makes you western people so interesting to us of the east  please dont make me out an honored son of the west mrs rice i was born in new jersey  were you indeed oh im so sorry  i regret it myself the west would have fitted me out with better lungs  kate never went round when she could wade across therefore no sooner were they inhaling the savor of the soup than she began her interrogation i am very much interested in occult affairs dr britt and my brother tells me you were the family physician of this remarkable miss lambert tell us about her  britt considered a moment it is true that mrs lambert confided in me and permitted me to take a part in violas sittings but i can hardly be called her physician in the first place the girl seems so perfectly well physically that medicine is unnecessary and then too i never had her confidence to be plain i think she hated the sight of me  why was that  he cast a curious sidewise glance well im not pretty to look at and then i reckon she thought i was investigating her  i hope you were  i was but i didnt get very far  what barred you  well to begin with pretty nearly everything took place in the dark  its always so exclaimed kate i wonder why  he shrugged his shoulders they all say light is antagonistic to the power you can draw your own inference  morton spoke i never could understand why they didnt make a special effort to avoid that criticism  well tell us what happened cried kate im on the edge of my chair with interest  britt looked at morton thats the curious thing isnt it people are interested the fact is we all secretly hope the ghoststory may turn out to be true  kate laughed youre perfectly right we all poohpooh but wed be bitterly disappointed if all spirit footsteps turned out to be rats rolling nuts but please hurrywasnt any of it true  now im going to be candid  at this morton leaned forward with excess of interest and kate exulted good now its coming be as candid as you can  britt went on musingly one night as i sat between viola and the closed piano the spook or whatever it was ran up and down the keysnow on the treble now on the basskeeping time to my whistling  morton interrupted did you know that the lid was closed  yes i laid my hand on it while the keys were drummed  where was miss lambert  apparently at my left sleeping it didnt really matter where she was for the lid was down when the lights were turned on she was in deep tranceapparently that one fact of the closed piano being played in that way remains inexplicable  was that all cried kate in a most disappointed way  oh no there were marvels to raise your hair but that was all that i really valued  morton answered quickly it was enough if properly conditioned the theory isive been reading up on itthat these spook brethren of ours attack their doubters in different ways knowing you to be a man of materialistic and rather methodical habit of mind the powers essayed a material test perhaps it was a mouse  or the cat suggested kate  they must have been musical and of exceptional intelligence then put in britt for they played up and down on the keyboard at my request and kept time to yankee doodle  kate exulted what do you think of that morton if one is true then all may be true  britt went on no whatever the power was it was controlled by human intelligence it answered to my will  you were convinced of that mortons glance was keen keener than he knew if you admit that one of these manifestations is true you open the door for the witches  britt was a little nettled all this took place precisely as i relate it in the dark of course but one sense that of touch controlled the situationhearing took the rest  it all shows the inadequacy of human evidence you must not expect any one to believe that such a manifestation took place it is like the stories we hear of haunted houses a friend of mine the other day was telling me of a ghost that frequented an australian bungalow where he was visiting last year said he i saw vases thrown from the mantelpiece in broad daylight ive heard invisible feet tramping all about my chair in a vividly lighted room i didnt believe him of course the fact is we dont know our own capacity for being deceived we are each a microcosma summingup of all our forebears and in the obscure places of our brains are the cells of cavemen nooks troubled by shadows and inhabited by strange noises if you come at me in the right way you can raise a terrifying echo deep in some knot of my braincells but it is only the echo of a faraway cryit is not even the cry  britt poised himself let me tell you this i have started in to understand this thing it isnt a haphazard series of deceits of that i am at this moment convinced the most amazing consideration to my mind is this there is system in their fooltricks i dont mean miss lambert alone i mean in all the bestauthenticated manifestations as you say they know how to attack the public the ones who dont are exposed and drop out but generally speaking they go on smoothly because they know just what can be safely attempted and what cant now in miss lamberts case the same system appears her alleged phenomena fit into the scheme her development is according to the spiritualistic hoyle no originality is permitted hence no failure of effect  and yet my brother tells me she is quite young and engaging  altogether charming in body and in every other thought most ingenuous  morton interposed mockingly and you think she has built up this most elaborate system of deceit  somebody has i lay a good part of it to clarke but most of it to hysteria and the suggestion of the flag of truth and other similar sheets  but she already had all these manifestations before clarkes coming and presumably before she read the flag of truth  they say so i dont know that many of the tricks are noted in randalls notes  who was randall asked kate  their family physicianmy predecessor some of her phenomena convinced him he put himself on record in his notes as a convert however that was after his wife died  they all weaken when their wives die  not all some are not anxious to bridge the gulf answered britt lightly im told clarkes communion with his dead wife is now as cool as friendship  kate faced him its only fair to say dr britt that i too am one of the bereaved and that if i seem more hospitable to these messages than my brother you will understand my husband died two years ago  i beg your pardon mrs rice if ive seemed too harsh in my zeal to explain  oh im not one to fear the truth she answered quickly i come of a family of questioners its only now and then that i waverfor a moment my husband said he would come back to me if he could and ive been half hopingnot really expecting it you know  she did not complete her sentence and morton spoke with tender reproach i am being profoundly illumined kate why didnt you tell me that  because it was only a jocular remark i didnt intend you should know it i dont know how i came to let it slip from my mouth he has never returned strange to say i feel mother but never hayward  they had reached a very tender and solemn pauseso selfrevealing had been the womans admissionand britt was looking at his plate as his hostess began again with assumed brightness well now about this girl can you take me to see her she interests me beyond anything  certainly i should be delighted but your brother knows hershe would be pleased to see you both ive no doubt  my brother thinks she is a fraud and does not wish to see her  i derive my knowledge from you dr britt  britt was undisturbed i think she is a fraud too but a very charming one  that ought to make her all the more convincing said kate  and all the more dangerous replied britt she baffles mewhen face to face with her  what are they going to do with herexhibit her to the public  not for the present clarke has been making notes industriously all the year and is about ready to publish he now wants a few of the big fellows like uncle simeon pratt to help boom his book the lamberts are not in this for moneyplease give them credit for thatand as for the mother she is entirely honestshe believes implicitly in her spirits  that puts the girl in a horrible positionif she is deceiving morton interposed imagine her state of mind if she realizes that her own mother has come to rest upon her system of deceit the thought is horrible  it is quite as bad at that returned britt you see the mother has been for years in close daily communionas she supposeswith her husband her little son and others of her dead half of her daily life is in these joys the other half in her daughter there stood the wall that stopped me i couldnt express my doubt to the mother i couldnt apply the clamps i simply withdrew i do not intend to pursue the matter to a finish so long as the mother is alive  mortons face was clouded with pain let us drop the lamberts as a subject they are too distressing especially as i see no way of helping them when do you return  kate acquiesced in her brothers diversion of the stream of talk but an hour later as britt was about to go she seized the opportunity to say you must not fail to take me to see this girl i have never been so excited about any one in my life cant you take me tomorrow  i am entirely at your service suppose i call at fourwill that do  perfectly im very grateful to you  i hope you wont come to curse me for it i warn you the girl is damnably convincing she may enamour you  no fear of that she cried in defiant brightness im not so easily fooled  she reentered the library with the flush of an excited conviction in her face morton i feel as if i had taken part in the dissection of a human soul  he threw up his hand with a gesture of pain and despair dont i can only hope that girl is utterly bad otherwise she is the sport of devils help me forget the whole uncanny business  youre wrong she said firmly it is just such men as you and dr weissmann who should snatch the pearl of truth from this bucket of mental mire  thats a very good phrase kateif only i was sure of the pearl  there really was no way out for him his mind utterly discredited the phenomena viola claimed to produce and that left but one other interpretation she was a trickster and autohypnotistuncanny as the fabled women who were fair on one side but utterly foul and corrupt on the other in his musing her splendid glowing physical self drew near and when he looked into her sweet clear eyes his brain reeled with doubt of his doubt if there were any honest eyes in the world she was innocent and a tortured victim as kate had so quickly decided and his plain duty was to beat back the forces seeking to devour her  the mind is an obscure kingdom subject to inexplicable revolts and sudden confusions he thought delusions are easy to foment and at the last are indistinguishable from the fact so far as the mind which gave them being is concerned the body of this girl is young but her brain may be cankered by the sins and lies of a long line of decadent ancestry the thought was horrible but it was less revolting than the alternativein no other way could her life be explained and excused in any case it was highly courageous in her to put marriage away as decisively as if it were a crime and this she must have done for even clarke according to britt had thus far sued in vain there was a heroic strain in the girl somewhere was it too late to rescue her from the mental gangrene eating its way to the very centre of her soul this was the question which only a renewed acquaintance a careful study could resolve     iv  the patron of psychics   up to the hour of his wifes death simeon pratt had been but the businessman large of appetite pitiless selfsufficient and selfabsorbedthe type of man often described by amiable critics as a hard citizen but good to his family you know as if the fact of his not beating his wife were adequate excuse for railway wrecking  he might be seen taking the 749 train at eightysixth street each weekday morning with a bundle of newspapers under his arm a man of depending jowls and protuberant belly who never offered any one a seat and did not expect such courtesy from others he was burly and selfish as a hog and was often so designated by workweary women whom he forced to stand while he read his market reports in callous absorption  his associates greeted him with a nod unsmiling and curt and the elevatorboys at the pratt building were careful not to elbow him he had the greed of a wolf and the temper of an aging bear and yet his business ability admittedly commanded respect everything he did had a certain sweep he was not penurious or mean in his wars on the contrary he despised the small revenges but in a strife with his equals he was inexorablehe pushed his adversaries to the last ditch and into it remorseless as a mountain landslide  all the tenderness in his nature all his faith in goodness and virtue he reserved for his home to his wife a woman of simple tastes and native refinement and to his children bright and buxom girls of twentyodd he was a fond and gruffly indulgent provider making little protest over new gowns and parties he had no sons and this was a hidden sorrow to him and had the effect of centring all his paternal pride and care in his daughters he could deny them nothing when they wheedled him and they were nearly always humorously and brazenly trying to work him as he called it only in one particular had he been granite with means to build on the east side of the park he had deliberately chosen the riverside drive in order to show his contempt for the social climbers of upper fifth avenue and neither smiles nor tears had availed to change his plan  his house was a dignified structure exteriorly but within was dominated by his taste rather than by that of his daughters who were quite unable to change his habits after they were once set he refused to consider their suggestions as to furniture the interior was as britt had said not unlike a very ornately formal french hotel and this resemblance arose from the fact that he had once enjoyed a pleasant stay in a house of this sort and when the decorator submitted a number of schemes he chose the one which made the pleasantest impression on his mind  with three women at the table he habitually took charge of the dinner controlling the menu and the decorations as well it amused outsiders to see him in wordy consultation with the headwaiter and the butler while his guest of honor vainly tried to continue some story he had begun but his wife suffered in silence in short simeon proceeded precisely as he would have done at a restaurant or at his club and his family stood clear of his elbow the girls with sly shrugs of their rounded shoulders the wife meekly but ineffectually protesting against his usurpation of her domain  he was not politically ambitious and was in a fair way to grow old as one of the obscure millionaires of new york city when death reached a sable hand and smote him full in the front of his pride and assurancehis wife and daughters were lost in the sinking of a boat off the coast of france  the news of this disaster came to him as he sat at his deskthe morning papers had given no hint of it i dont believe it he said quietly and began pressing the buttons of his desk with the same swift calmness he would have used had the markets been going against him messages flew to and fro the wires pulsed with his imperious anxiety the manager of the steamboat company answereddenied the news was confirmed all to the same end and when simeon pratt rose from his desk that night his jaw hung lax his big form stooped and shambled as though twenty additional years had suddenly been heaped upon his shoulders he went back to his splendid lonely palace where the servants huddled and whispered and hastened with a hard dry knot in his throat and with eyes heavy and hot and tearless confronted his ruined altar from one to be feared he had fallen in a day to the most desolate of beings  messengers pursued him the bodies were recovered he gave orders for them to be shipped by the first boat in the blaze of the electric light with horrid staring eyes and stiffly moving lips he cursed himself and god he cursed himself for letting his treasures go from him he cursed god for permitting such outrages upon justice at last he fell silent but he did not sleep nor eat till the end of the second day then he rose took the 749 train as usual and returned to his deskunshaved with creased and crumpled clothing a gray and battered man sustained by habit seeking relief in work  his associates with forced cheerfulness professed pleasure at his return carefully avoiding mention of his appalling loss to those who did speak of it he returned no word or glance with fumbling thick and nerveless fingers he took up the purplelettered ribbon of his trade he fixed his dim eyes on market reports and dictated notes and orders but it was a poor show even those who hated him as a gross unlovely character were shocked at his shrunken form his grayed and grizzled cheek when death deals a blow like that the defeated one acquires a certain majesty  gradually the old man regained ability to compute and combine and to converse with his partners concerning the affairs of the house but his keen interest his prompt decision of utterance were all gone his presence in the office was the result of habit merely in reality he was waiting the return of the steamer which bore his precious clay  this boat was delayed by storms and for three days the broken financier unable to remain in his office walked to and fro between broad street and bowling green haunting the office of the steamship company until the bloodless manager nervous and irritated left his chair to avoid him unable to endure the sight of his haggard face and piteous eyes  when the boat arrived simeon met it with his own yacht and with a return of his iron resolution stood by to protect the graves of his hopes as they slid across the rail then ordering every soul from the cabin he sat down beside the caskets he knew that his loved ones were there and yet he could not realize it he was filled with a desire to prove it all a mistake but the fearthe certainty of the disfigured facesdeterred him  he took them home nothing could have been more piercingly pathetic than that flabby gray old man sitting alone amid the tawdry splendor of his drawingroom with the remains of all he loved in this world shut away from him by rosewood and silver when the last pale and shaking servant had left the room the father gave one long hoarse choking wail and fell upon his face on the floor crushed and utterly despairing  when he rose he was calmer he began to give orders for a sumptuous funeral taking charge of every detail in his familiar way the ceremony was magnificent and profoundly affecting every one present in the great church shed tears of heartfelt sorrow pitying the great banker quite humanly but he himself did not weep he sat limply with eyes on the floor in a daze of internal emotion but when the door of the vault closed on his dead a final terrible cry burst from him the cry of one who realizes to the last and to the full the emptiness the futility of a life without love an old age without hope  his interest in the material world in the war of trade was gone his vast wealth would still bring him dividends and his clerks and partners would still consult him still demand his signatures but the ones who made all these matters worth doing had vanished  life seemed utterly useless a vain effort but while yet he struggled with the fear of death and a hate of the day a delegation of those who claim to hold communion with the dead came to him with a greeting from his wife this message contained words which startled him he was persuaded to seek confirmation he was convinced and became the most fervent of spiritualists his form lifted his eyes brightened a new world opened for him he announced his intention to use his vast wealth for the faith which had comforted him he built a magnificent temple to the unseen he hired speakers and musicians to entertain and instruct those who came to hear he sought out and entertained scores of mediums psychics sensitives inspiritual speakers and natural healersall were welcome at his hearth he might have been called and was called the prey of harpies but as his interests now were in these matters and as he had the means wherewithal to amuse himself surely he was not a loser true he was many times deceived by false prophets and wronged by fraudulent seers but still he enjoyed the exquisite solace which the voice of his wife unfailingly brought when the conditions were favorable he was no longer hopeless on the contrary he was reanimated made over in the faith of the spiritworld the daughters came less often to speak to him but when they did come they made his dark cold heart glow with their gay words at times it seemed that he could reach out his hands and touch their soft cheeks so palpable were they so intimate and familiar were their voices  gradually a part of his oldtime business shrewdness came to his aid in these intangible matters and he began to distinguish and to cast out the base and parasitic prestidigitators who infested his house he grew discerning and was able to weed the tares from the wheat and with this discernment came the conviction that it was his duty to violently expose those who sought to cheat him he became a terror to the fraudulent and by his vigorous denouncement of this and that performer raised storms of opposition for it seemed that no trickster no matter how base was without a following his purposes clarified aided by cunning counsel he began to conceive of himself as one called to a great mission and resigned to his lot he set himself to the work of furthering in every possible way the reign of the spiritworld  it was into the hands of this shattered yet still powerful man that viola lambert had been persuaded to deliver herself and simeon convinced of her powers by experiment and charmed by her girlish grace and dignity had pushed all other keepers of the door of silence from his house thereby arousing a tempest of denunciation for these sibyls gave up the luxury of his table the munificence of his purse only after persuasion and in bitterness and wrath  violas meeting with pratt was brought about by clarke who was aware through the special organs of the faith that the great merchant and promoter was not merely insatiable in his thirst for new sources of solace but exceedingly generous with his comforters no sooner had he secured the girls consent to go than he wrote to pratt asking him to meet them in boston receiving no answer pratt was afflicted with such letters he wrote again detailing the experiments he had made laying great stress upon the fact that the psychic was the daughter of a welltodo western mineowner that she was a cultured young girl and that her mother a distinguished evangel in the cause was devoted even to the point of submitting her daughter to a series of absolutely convincing tests he made mention also of his book which was nearly ready for the press and which he hoped would create a great stir among scientists  simeon did not answer this letter but sent a representative to colorow to investigate the writers claims the detective returned to say that the parties had gone to boston but that they had a fine reputation in the region and that the father was a rich and wellconsidered citizen no one knows anything out o the way with the girl the spy added  simeon now flamed with eagerness and set out to find viola and to test her it was not easy to locate her for clarke had proceeded with caution in boston after consultation with the editor of the spiritist and at his suggestion he had given only a few very private sittings to a few very discreet friends these evenings however had been very successful and those who had been permitted to attend them had jealously guarded the jewel they had found selfishly urging continued secrecy nevertheless the circle had spread and viola apparently resigned to her singular function was patiently sitting night after night in stuffy darkened rooms while clarke vivid as ever sonorous as ever declaimed in passionate rhythms the promise of a new era for spiritism to be inaugurated by the message of this wonderful organism he had indeed laid out an elaborate programme for the capture of boston but this he instantly dropped when simeon pratt sent up his card and asked to see what the girl could do he demanded a sitting much as a dealer in horses would ask the hostler to drive the proffered animal before him in order that he might judge of her paces he did not intend to offend on the contrary he was instantly consumed with anxiety lest this splendid young creature should refuse to perform  viola was deeply offended by his first manner and coldly said i am not sitting for money and i will not be put on exhibition for any one  simeon ended by pleading with her for one sittingone short hour but she refused and he went away dejected flabby with defeat he returned next day and still a third time and at last to work on her sympathies he told her how he came to enter the faith and with broken voice and quivering lips displayed his sorrows  his weakness availed the utter tragedy of his life brought the ready tears to violas eyes and quite melted her opposition she saw him in a new light understood him for what he really was a lonely broken old man hastening to the grave and in her pity consented  the manifestation which followed he reported as the most marvellous he had ever had jennie my eldest daughter spoke from the megaphone for more than an hour minutely detailing the circumstances of her death giving orders for the disposition of their jewels and trinkets and in other ways most completely satisfied me of her identity  he rose from this sitting exalted comforted beyond measure pathetically happy quite ready to embrace the blessed girl who had made his hour of sweet communion possible his home his private car his yacht were all at her disposal no queen however powerful could have won such homage from him you must come to my home he said i will enlarge your work i will meet every wish of your guides  with clarke and the mother on his side he prevailed viola consented to go to new york as his guest provided her secret powers were not revealed i will not be advertised she said too many people are coming to see me now if you publish me i will never sit again  this threat threw simeon into a panic of course you will remain private you will be my guest the same as your mother no one but my own family shall know of your wonderful powers i will see to that  perhaps he was honest in this promise but his habit of entertaining arabian priestesses crystal gazers and other women of singular endowments was too well known to permit of the fulfilment of his agreement no sooner was viola seen on the drive in his carriage than his friends and hangerson began to smile and say simeon has a new enchantress i wonder who she is and those remarks aroused the curiosity of the ubiquitous workers for the press furthermore the directors of the temple of course must needs be told and the other seeresses neglected by their onceidolized patron did not need to be told so that long before serviss had a hint of her coming the news of violas domestication with simeon was widely disseminated among the faithful who hurried at once to meet her  these seekers went with smiling faces and hastening feet but they came away laggardly reproaching the master of the temple for a selfish brute some few were admitted stayed and met the girl and clarkefor clarke fairly divided the honors so vivid so picturesque was he he did not hesitate to speak of his great work a work which would astound the world and to announce the title of his great oration which simeon had engaged for the temple this was the first big gun of his campaign this compelling oration but he must have violas consent to the use of her nameher consent also to sit with a group of chosen great men of the city in order to issue a defiant challenge to science from these special sittings he expected to deduce the final and greatest chapter of his book  from this public test of her power viola still shrank but pratts wealth and power which clarke continually emphasized fairly stunned her into acquiescence so far from being a faith of the poor the obscure a faith that lurked in dark corners avoiding the direct gaze of men spiritualism from the portals of a resplendent temple appeared to be not merely respectable but triumphant from this sacred meetingplace of the angelic forces from the windows of pratts palatial home she looked out upon the city with more of content with her mission than she had ever known beforetroubled only by a deeply hidden wish to see again the man whose buoyant health and smiling eyes had so strongly impressed her on their ride into the marshal basin  but this sense of security of power did not last as the novelty of her position in pratts household wore away she found her duties irksome she resented the flocks of curious or melancholy visitors and began to perceive the bitter truththat she was only a servant after all ministering to the pleasures of pratt and his friends she had very little time to herself and could not escape her masters even for a drive in the parkone or the other of them was always at her side  she attempted to withdraw her consent to the use of her name but clarke the guides even her mother insisted on the test britt alone of all her friends took the side of her fears they were in correspondence of a formal sort and when he reached the city he went straight to her anxious to know what clarkes plans actually were to him she spoke more freely than ever before expressing her dread of the flaring light which clarke was about to turn upon her  britt listened gravely there is one way of escape he said at last with a smile both mocking and tender i dont pretend to say its to your mind but want to remind you that my offer is still open if you give me the necessary authority i will stop this crusade with a jolt  im grateful to you dr britt truly i am but i cant do what you asknot even she hesitated and fell silent  not even to save your life or mine i dont blame youi am but a poor thing  i didnt mean it that way i respect you very very much but you must know anthony depends on me and besides maybe it is my duty to go on the platform father and grandfather both say it is to them it seems small and selfish of me to want to be happy in my own home while the millions weep uncomforted but oh if i could only live my own life part of the time if i could feel free of this terrible weight one day in seven  britt looking into her clear eyes acquired a new confidence in her tell me miss lambert do you really believe that your father comes to you in this way  i dare not doubt it she answered with evasive eyes  some of the messages are not specially  i know she acquiesced with a shudder there are evil spirits as well as good and sometimes the bad ones come i dont see why grandfather permits them to use me he says he cant always help it if there are bad people in the circle that is another reason why i dread this public testthere is no knowing what the evil spirits might make me say or do if it did not mean so much to anthony i would refuseeven if grandfather asked it  i saw professor serviss today  did you her eyes were instantly alight where did you see him does he know we are here  he didnt know till i told him i called at his laboratory  did you tell him where we are  yes and he felt as i do that this is not a good place for you pratt has the reputation of entertaining sensational characters and it will be a miracle if you are not exploited to the press  her face clouded again oh i am so tired of having people look at me and shrug and whisper i am so tired of having this abnormal thing reflected in the eyes of all my visitors i wish i could become commonplacewithout the slightest thing queer about me sometimes i feel like taking a dose of poison and ending it all  dont do that britt replied soberly you mustnt even say such a thing i wish i could help you but i see no way so long as your own parents and clarke himself are your guides but if at any time you will give me the authorityhere his voice became sterni will see that you are not troubled by any outside influence  you are very kind she said but her face expressed only a troubled liking and he pressed her hand in both of his and silently went away  young clinton ward also came seeking boyish eager contemptuous of any barrier so illusory as the fact of her trances which she confessed to him her words hardly impressed themselves on his mind and he replied flippantly that cuts no ice with me you couldnt be anything i wouldnt like youre living too close and your nerves are sort of frazzled what you need is a jolly good time come back to boston and forget all about this business come i want folks to meet you my mother knows how i feel about you and is crazy to see you  what would she say if she knew what i have told you she asked bitterly  she wont mindafter she sees you he answered loyally no one can know you withoutwithoutoh hang it viola you know what i mean nothing matters when you love a person i want you no matter what any one says and besides i dont see why you cant just chuck the whole blooming business ill chuck clarke out o the window if you say the word hes just trying to work you and  you mustnt talk that way clinton  why not its true  well because she hesitated then said as if to end her own uncertainty i am committed to this lifeand to him my way is marked out and i must walk in it  the young fellow was hard hit he sat looking at her with eyes of consternation and awe he tried to speak but could not for a little while at last he made a second trial do you meanyou dont mean  yes i meanall you think i mean she answered and then her fortitude failed her and she turned away her eyes filled with hot tears  he rose awkwardly all his jaunty selfconfidence gone i take my medicine its all right i hope youll be happy he broke off with quivering lips  i shall never be happy she said and the very calmness of her voice went to the boys heart ive given up all hope of being anything but an instrumenta thing whose wishes do not count goodbye clint and she gave her hand  he took it and pressed it hard and went out into the street staggering under the weight of the revelation he had received  viola was fond of clintonhis simple wholesome untroubled nature appealed to herand yet this very ingenuousness this ready confidence made her own life and daily habit seem the more forbidding she understood now the insuperable barrier which had been raised between herself and the careless youth of the normal world  in this hour of depression as in many others her mind went out towards morton serviss britts mention of the young scientists name seemed to bring him very near and she wondered again for the hundredth time whether he had entirely forgotten her or not would he call now that he was informed of her presence in the city she knew almost as well as if he had written it the reason for his hasty flight from colorow and with a knowledge that he considered her a freak if not something worse she could not write to him although she still had his card and address  he was a greater man in the world than when he visited their mountain home for he had written a book which the critics called a great and implacable study of diseases and their uses she had not been able to read it but she treasured it nevertheless and longed to meet him again to lay her case before him to ask his advice not with regard to whether she should go on with her music but whether her life was worth continuingfor there were times when she secretly considered the morality of making an end of it it was in the hope of drawing him again to her side that she asked clarke to include him in the list of scientific men to whom he was planning to send a printed copy of his oration and challengeafter their deliveryand to her mother she said i would not be so nervous if i knew that dr serviss were on the committee i know he would be just and considerate even if he does despise mediums  hes exactly the one responded mrs lambert with enthusiasm i wonder tony hasnt spoken of him grandfather will be delighted im sure     v  kate visits viola   towards simeons portal held sacred to the keepers of the keys of the silent house kate rice and dr britt set their faces at the appointed hour  the plot thickens round the girl began britt with a kind of mocking levity mrs lambert has done it now  they had reached the comparative quiet of the crossstreet what has she done  she has delivered her ewelamb over to this ancient wolf of wall street who will eat her up for a little red ridinghood ive been looking into pratts record he has a cheerful way im told of treating his psychics like orangessqueezing them and throwing them into the street he has become so sensitive to the sneers of the outsiders that he fears to be done after getting all that a medium can give him he exposes her elaborately and sets her adrift and so guards himself from the possible accusation of having been deceived if there is any question of the mediums powers he can then come out with a card saying i knew soandso was a fraud i exposed her two yearsor two monthsago i see the girls finish right here  the dreadful old man does the girl know this  i dont think she does but she ought to i hate to see a nice girl who would make some one a charming wife perverted to these unholy uses the crowning infamy heaped upon her head will be a full page in the sunday blastanother harpie exposedand it will come mrs rice i am sure of it pratt fairly fawns before her now she is his princess his seeress his chief jewel but woe to her if she displeases him or fails to meet his requirements  you appall me dr britt some one should at least warn her  ive already done so but with the mother clarke and pratt to war against the case seems hopeless besides she believes in herselfup to a certain point shell never degenerate into one of those frumps who go from city to city playing to the foolish women and tackheaded men but she will certainly be corrupted if she marries clarke her future will be woful she has entered in so far i dont see how she can retreat she is bound to keep on for his sake and her mothers sake  is she in love with clarke  that i havent been able to determine but she is under his control or she wouldnt be here  with these gloomy words in her ears kate entered the big cold drawingroom to wait for the coming of the master of the house  pratt is the one to whom you are to pay your first respectshe is master warned britt ask to see his collectionsthat always pleases him if you will permit i will lead the way  i am trusting you  you may do so  pratt came in quite briskly a heavyfaced whitebearded man wearing a sacksuit and an oldfashioned turndown collar he greeted britt with a casual handshake looking at kate suspiciously and who is this he asked bluffly  a friend of mine a mrs rice who desires to see your wonderful collection of slates and paintings  pratt softened a little ill be very glad to show them he said but not now ill have to ask you to excuse me just now i am in consultation with my directors  certainly said britt and after pratt went out he added that means that clarke is going to launch his thunderbolt hes going to defy the scientific world in the most burning oration since cicero  at this moment two ladies in superb wraps descended the stairway on their way to their carriages and one of them said i think its a shameas long as weve known simeon prattto be turned away like a tramp  oh i dont blame her said the other  some disappointed callers said britt  a moment later several other curious ones were ushered into the drawingroom britt kept up a lowtoned comment all these rubbernecks are here to see the girl you will be surprised to know how many there are with a sneaking belief in these revelations  it was a singular situation in which to find simeon prattmajordomo to a crowd of idle curiosityseekersand when he returned with an assumption of haste and bustle britt saw him in a new lightthat of a poor lonely broken old man weary of life yet living on in daily hope of communion with the dead stuffing his heart with dreams and delusions walking mechanically round interested only in death  he had forgotten kates name but he remembered her wish to see his treasures  come to my library he said but first let me call your attention to this remarkable painting  the paintingor rather washdrawing in blackandwhitehung over the grandpiano in the light of the west windows it was globular in form and represented simeon explained the war of light and darkness onehalf of the globe was darkly shaded curiously fretted by the lighter half above sat a snowwhite eagle beneath with prodigious wings outspread and eyes gleaming like points of fire hovered a mysterious bat  look closer commanded simeon  narrower scrutiny brought out even in the darker half of the globe a multitude of intertwined forms outlined with pen and ink those of the lighter hemisphere were beautiful as angels with faint stars in their hair all were singing the others the denizens of the dark were twisted and contorted in agony and each was drawn with such certainty of prearrangement that the line which formed the arm of one outlined the head of another there were hundreds of them and the whole work was as intricate in design as the engraving on a banknote and so packed with symbolismaccording to simeons exegesisthat one might study it for days observe said he the innumerable faces formed by the line which divides the two worlds take these glasses  kate by means of the powerful instrument which he thrust upon her was able to detect hundreds of other faces invisible to the unaided eye it is wonderful who did it  a swedish servantgirl answered simeon loudly addressing every one in the room she couldnt write her name but when the spirit of raphael controlled her she could do this with her eyes shut theres nothing like that picture in the world it cannot be duplicated by any artist in the flesh  thats no dream murmured britt  pratt hurried them on past many other equally wonderful paintings to his library and as his guests filed in he faced them the things i am about to show you have no equal anywhere they have taken years to collect and have cost me more than a hundred thousand dollars i can show you but a few  the library was a splendid room rich with the light of the western sun whose arrangement instantly struck kate rice as unusual for the bookshelves were precisely like those of a butlers pantry they began at about four feet from the floor and reached entirely to the ceiling and were filled with splendid neglected books while beneath a broad shelf at their base were rows of little brass knobs each of which indicated a shallow drawer each drawer had a lock and a small plate which bore a letter and a number not unlike the cabinet of a numismatist  there are but two keys in existence explained simeon with shining face the one i now hold and the one in my safety vaults no one is permitted in this room without my secretary or myself he moved down the room between the cabinet and the big table here is a message from columbus he unlocked and drew out one of the drawers and laid it upon the table it was exquisitely made and contained two ordinary hinged schoolslates with the inner sides visible but protected by a heavy plate of glass this message came to me through angelica coxunder test conditions pratt further explained as kate bent above it  what do you mean by test conditions asked britt  i mean sir that i bought and took these slates to the medium and held them in my hands while that message was written there was irritation in his voice he replaced the drawer but here is a painting from murillo the great artist he painted the face of one of the ancients he laid before his silent auditors another drawer which contained a sheet of cardboard on which was a fairly good pastel of an arab in a burnouse it had the weak and false drawing which would result in the attempt of an amateur to copy an engraving in color this came in broad daylight while i held the clean cardboard on my head explained simeon  britt looked at kate the painter might have stood on his head he blasphemously whispered  and so down through that splendid room the host moved exhibiting letters from napoleon flowers from marie antoinette verses from mary queen of scots together with paternal advice from many others equally eminent in history  you keep good company ventured kate have you anything from shakespeare  certainly and from edwin forrest and lincoln and grant  anything from admiral kidd asked britt  or from mary jane holmes added kate  simeon looked at the jokers in silence not quite sure whether they intended to trap him or not no i save only the words of the most eminent persons in history outside my own familyi have wonderful testimony from them  ah show us those please cried kate  he hesitated pondering britts face and at last said i will show you some materializations and led the way to some cases filled with pressed flowers these are from india and tibet he explained  kate was getting bored but britt seemed fascinated by both pratt and the exhibit to think of one human being possessing a collection like thatpainfully amassing it its too beautiful  but the girlask him to let us see the girl she urged  dont hurry he cant be turned aside from his groove  the treasures of the drawers hinted at simeon proceeded to exhibit other wonders he possessed a coin brought from the sacred city of lhasa and dropped through the ceiling into a closed and sealed box there is no other known to the western hemisphere he said the british museum offered me a thousand pounds for it  to his mind all these slates pictures and flowers were evidences of the interest the great shades had taken in the work of converting simeon pratt to the faith and the messages were intended to steady him in his convictions and to furnish him material with which to bring the world to his view the mans faith was like to madnesswithout one ray of humor  at any other time this astounding museum would have been a most absorbing study to kate but she was tingling with desire to get at the young seeress and her mother what must they be she asked herself to mix with this kind of idiocy  at last when the favoring pause came britt explained to pratt that mrs rice was the sister of one who had known viola in the west and that she very much wished to see the psychic for a moment  i think miss lambert is engaged replied simeon sulkily but ill see and he led the way to a small sittingroom on the same floor stay here and ill send your card up  tell her a sister of professor serviss  simeon turned quickly servissaint he one of the men that clarke talks of having on the committee are you his sister  kate bowed yes my brother met miss lambert in the west  pratts face cleared well well i will send her right down your brother is the kind of man we want to reach he added as he went out  now dr britt began kate firmly i want you to keep that boresome old man occupied while i talk with these women i dont want him putting in his oar  ill do my best he answered manfully up to the measure of gagging him i cant agree to order him out of the house  kate was on her chairs edge with interest as she heard the rustle of skirts and the murmur of a pleasant voice and when viola flushed smiling beautifully gowned entered the room with outstretched hand she rose with a spring carried out of her wellplanned reserve by the warmth and charm of the girls greeting she closed her gloved palm cordially on the fine hand so confidingly given i am glad to know you my brother has spoken so enthusiastically of you  violas flush deepened has he i assure you we speak often of him i suppose he is too busy with his wonderful microbes to come and see poor commonplace creatures like us  he is busy but he only learned of your presence a few days ago  viola turned mother this is mrs rice professor servisss sister  kate liked mrs lambert also for she was looking remarkably handsome in a black gown of simple pattern if these are adventuresses they are very clever in dress was her inward comment i dont wonder morton was captivated and she presently said cant you take me to your own room i want to talk secrets with you  yes let us do that viola turned to her mother lets take mrs rice to our sittingroom  mrs lambert assented timidly with a quick glance towards simeon who was garrulously declaiming to britt concerning the wonders of another painting by the swedish cook  pratt seeing the women rise approached where are you going he asked with a note of impatience in his voice  to my room answered viola firmly and led the way upstairs in silence but when they were beyond earshot in the hall above she bitterly exclaimed he spies on everything i do he will hardly let me out of his sight i am beginning to hate him he has so little sense of decency  viola warned the mother  i dont care retorted the girl defiantly why do we endure himwe are not dependent on him he treats us precisely as if he owned us and im tired of it i wish papa would come on and take us home  he may be a bore but he houses you like royalty kate remarked as she glanced about the suite which viola and her mother occupied it formed the entire eastern end of the third floor of the house and the decorations were empire throughout with stately canopied beds and a most luxurious bathroom  oh yes its beautiful but i would rather be this minute in our little logcabin in the west answered the girl with wistful sadness oh these warm days make me homesick when i was there i hated it now i long to get back i seem five years olderthis winter has been terribly long to me  well now lock the door exclaimed kate excitedly and tell me all about yourself start at the very beginning dr britt has told me something but i want to know everything when did you first know you had this power thats the first question  mrs lambert began in the tone of one retelling an old story up till the day my little son walter died viola was just like any other girl of her agehealthy and prettya very pretty child  i can believe it kates eyes dwelt admiringly on the girl  my husband and i were good presbyterians and i had never given much thought to spirits or spiritualism but after our little boy died robert began to study up and every time we went to the city hed go to see a psychic and that troubled me as a good churchmember i thought he ought not to do it and so one day i said robert i think you ought to tell mr mclanethat was our ministerwhat you are doing it isnt right to visit mediums and go to church tooone or the other ought to be given up he saidi remember his exact words i cant live without these messages of comfort from my boy they say he is going to manifest himself soonhere in our own home i remember that was his exact expression for i wondered what it was to manifest that very night things began  kates eyes snapped what things  well waltie had a little chair that he likeda little reed rockingchairand my husband always kept this chair close by where he sat reading that night i saw the chair begin to rock all by itselfand yet some way it didnt scare me robert did you move walties chair i asked no he said why because it rocked robert threw down his book and looked at the chair viola must have moved it he said viola was in her own little chair on the other side of the table i said it must have been the cat then  and then just while we both looked at it it began to move again exactly as if waltie were in it it creaked too as it used to when he rocked  i should have been frightened stiff exclaimed kate whose eyes were beginning to widen  nothing that has happened since has given me such a turn robert jumped up and felt all about the chair sure that viola had tied a string to itand still she was no child for tricks then robert bent right down over the chair and it stopped for a moment and then slid backward under the table just as our own boy used to do he loved to play tent robert looked up at me as white as the dead it is waltie mother he has come back to us he said and i believed it too  in spite of herself kate shivered with a keen complete comprehension of the thrilling joy and terror of that moment but viola sat listlessly waiting the end of her mothers explanation plainly it was all a wearisome story to her  mrs lambert went on after that he came every night and soon the tappings began and finally we got into communication with my father who told us to be patient and wait and waltie would speak to us then the power took hold of viola and frightened her almost into fits  the girl visibly shuddered and her eyes fell  how did it begin asked kate breathless with interest  the first we noticed was that her left arm began to twitch so that she couldnt control it then she took to writing with her left hand exactly like my fathers handwriting she could write twenty different kinds of writing before she was twelve these messages were all signed and all said that she was to be a great medium then began the strangest doings my thimbles would be stolen and hidden vases would tumble off the mantels chairs would rock it was just pandemonium there some nights they used to break things and pound on the doors then all of a sudden these doings stopped and viola went into deathly trances i shall never forget that first night we thought she was dead we couldnt see her breathe and her hands and feet were like ice  the girl rose her face gray and rigid dont mother dont she whispered they are here she shook her head and cried out as if to the air no no not now no no  the mother spoke she is being entranced some one has a message for you mrs rice  for the first time kate had a suspicion of both mother and daughter this action of the girl seemed a thought too opportune and much too theatric now that her splendid eyes were clouded she lost confidence in her and as she waited she grew cold with a kind of disgust and fear of what was to follow  the mother gently sided with her daughter against the control and taking both her hands said quietly not now father not now but in vain the girl sank back into her chair rigid they have something they insist on saying mrs rice said mrs lambert after a silence is it some one for mrs rice three loud snapping sounds came from the carpet under violas feet  good gracious what is that exclaimed kate a cold tremor passing up her spine  it is my father answered mrs lambert quite placidly cant you write father be easy on viola todayhe is very anxious to converse with you for some reason mrs rice  again a creeping thrill made kates hair rise and she bit her fingertip am i dreaming she asked herself as she listened to the mother talking to the air only to be answered by rappings from the table and thumpings from the chairs how absurd how childish it all is she thought  even as this thought passed through her mind the room seemed to darken the air to thicken the girls proud young body sank doubled till she seemed a crone old and withered and jocose a sneering laugh came from her drawn lips her hands trembling together hookedly reached towards kate the eyes were sunk lidless and gleaming with malice a voice that was like the croak of a raven sounded forth you got my money kitbut you didnt get it all and from the young distorted lips a disgusting laugh issued a laugh that froze kates blood and stiffened her tongue so that she could not cry out she gasped and sank back into her chair while the voice went on you know me i always hated youyou wasted my moneyyou poisoned my petsi hated your husbandhe cheated me onceyoull get no joy of my money till you pay that debt  kate inert aghast sat blindly staring while this vindictive remorseless voice went on only when it stopped was she aware of the mothers serene attitude of waiting of polite regret at being present at a disagreeable scene then the girls lips resumed their sweetness the beautiful hands fell slack upon her knees the head lifted and turning rested peacefully against the cushion of her chair the table was violently shaken a small ornament upon it leaped into the air and fell in kates lap she sprang to her feet with a cry of alarm shaking the thing away as if it were a toad and was about to flee when mrs lamberts voice struck her into immobility so unconcerned was it so utterly matter of fact  did you know the spirit visitor she asked  with the question kates panic ceased her awe her fright passed into wonder and amazement  it was exactly like my greataunt she gaspingly admitted but oh it was terrible why do you let her go into such states  we cannot control these manifestations hush they are not yet finished they are about to write for you  still lying in languid ease the girl lifted one hand to the tableto kate it seemed that the hand was raised by some outside invisible powerand there it rested as though weary and meditating as it paused thus the girls eyes opened and she sat regarding it as though it belonged to some other intruding self mrs lambert brought a pencil and a pad of paper and laid them upon the stand  suddenly the hand woke to vigorous action seizing the pencil as a dog might lay hold upon a bone it began to write slowly firmly while viola watched it quietly detachedly as if it were something entirely separate from her brain at the end it tore the leaf from the pad and flung it to the floor  mrs lambert picked it up it is from father she said but it is for you  kate took the leaf on which was written in a firm round oldfashioned hand these words your aunt is here and asks that you and your brother pay her debt she is angry because it has not been done  i have no knowledge of any such debt said kate i dont understand this  the hand was writing again busily imperturbably and the color was coming back into violas face as kate waited her awe began to pass and doubts came thronging back upon her there was something farcical in all this  again the hand flung its message and again the mother picked it from the floor  this also is from father she announced with more of excitement than she had hitherto betrayed  the message began abruptly the doubter may be convinced if he will but put himself in the way of it the life of my granddaughter is more valuable today than that of any king or queen her mission is to open the door between the two worlds she is here ready for the test let the men of science come to her and be convinced of the life beyond the grave it was signed with an elaborate rubric mcleod  who is this message for father asked mrs lambert mrs rice  a violent thump answered no  maybe its for my brother suggested kate  three tremendous thumps upon the underside of the table gave affirmative answer  kate was quite restored to her ruddy self very well i will see that he gets it  viola now spoke wearily but quite in her natural voice again there is no test in that kind of a message i didnt write iti had nothing to do with it but you or professor serviss would be justified in thinking i did grandpa wanted me to go into a trance this kind of writing is a compromise  but what of my aunt who spoke through you asked kate  viola stared at her blankly and her mother laid a warning hand on kates arm she knows nothing of these impersonations she said  what did i do asked viola i hope nothing ridiculous  mrs rices aunt spoke through you thats all answered mrs lambert reassuringly  tell me more said kate eagerly it is all so unreal to mei want to see more dr britt has told us wonderful things of you do you really believe the dead speak to you  they are with us all the time placidly yet decisively answered mrs lambert we are never alone i can feel them always near  kate shrank i dont believe i like thataltogether dont you feel oppressed by the thought  yes i do answered viola they take all the joy out of my life  dearest warned the mother  it is true and i want mrs rice to know it since i was ten years old i have not been free of the thing for a dayonly in the high mountains there i could always draw a long breath i am glad youve come mrs rice i want you to ask professor serviss to come and investigate me my only hope is in the men of science tell him i want him to help me understand myself she was speaking now with force and heat i want him to padlock me and nail me down i want to know whether i am in the hands of friends or enemies sometimes i think devils are playing with me all my life ive been tortured by these powers even at school they came banging about my bed scaring my roommates they disgraced me before my teacher the one i loved best they interfered with my music they cut me off from my friends and now theyve landed me here in this strange house with this dreadful old man and i want some one some good man who knows some one who is not afraid to come and test me mamma never doubts mr clarke is entirely satisfied and this mr pratt is worse than all i dont believe in his pictures i dont believe in what i doi dont know what i believe she ended despairingly then added fiercely this i do know i want to be free from itfree freeabsolutely free i pray to god to release me but he does not and my slavery grows worse every day  the girls intensity of utterance thrilled kate to the heart here was the cry of a tortured soul the appeal of one in bondage dr britt was right she was a victim  you poor thing i begin to understand i will help you and so will my brother he is already interested in you he is just the one to advise with you if any one can help you he can he is so keeneyed so strong  i know he is have him come soon wont you  the mother interposed but dearie you know mr clarke says  i know what he says the girl answered her face sullen and weary again he and all of you have no regard for me you pretend to have but you are all willing to sacrifice me to prove a theory i dont care whether spiritualism is true or not i want to have one single day when i can be sure of being myself free to come and go like other girls i feel as if i had a band of iron around my neck i shall go mad with it some day  kate usually ready blunt and fearless sat in silence perfectly convinced by the fury of the girls protest stunned by a belief in the complete truth of her indignant accusations these devotees these fanatics were immolating a beautiful young life on the altar of their own selfish faith the virgin was already bound to the rock and the priest torch in hand was about to apply the flame  what can i do i want to help you  an imperious knock at the door interrupted her and for an instant kate thought this another spirit message but mrs lambert called out is that you anthony  a deep voice answered yes it is i i have something to tell you clarke opened the door and stepped within a handsome dark theatrical figure  mrs lambert rose to meet him what is it anthony  weve decided on the date i am to speak on the second he answered exultantly  viola started up you shall not use my name i forbid it her hands were clinched her eyes blazed with the fury of her determination and she struck her heel upon the floor i tell you i forbid it  clarke pushed mrs lambert aside and strode to the centre of the room his face was hard his tone contemptuous you forbid it what is your puny will against the invisible ones you forbid it his voice changed as he asked who has influenced you to this childish revolt he turned to kate have you madam  kate rice was not one to be outfaced if i have i shall be most happy she answered who are you that demand so much of this poor girl  i am the one chosen by her control to convey their message to the world  kate recoiled a little oh you are well i dont care if you are you have no right to use her name in this way without her consent  her consent what she desires or what i desire is of small account we are both in the grasp of the invisible forces making for the happiness of the race she cant refuse to go on it is her duty there are millions of other women to sing to dance to amuse menthere is only one viola lambert in the world nothing in the annals of the occult exceeds her wonderful mediumship she must give herself to the world of science she must help us to prevail over the terrors of the grave her mission is magnificent her fame will fill the earth  kate stoutly confronted him perhaps the fame you give her will destroy her it sounds to me like notoriety rather than fame this poor child has a right to herself and i will help her assert it  clarkes eloquent hand fell to his side something in kates calm matteroffact speech reached his shrewder self he perceived here no mean antagonist you need not take the trouble madam i am guarding her they are guarding her  it was plain that both mrs lambert and her daughter were profoundly in obedience if not in terror of this wild young evangel and kate to test her divination said suppose she refuses  she dare not refuse her control would cut her down where she stands she has no choice where they are concerned the hands are upon her this moment he ended triumphantly  a shudder of despair went over the girl its true i feel them here she touched her throat they are all against methe living and the dead and she fell into her chair with a moan of despair her beauty her shining garments adding to the pity of her fate kates heart went out to her without reservation as she knelt beside her  i am for you my dear and so is my brother we will help you i give you my word be brave you must see morton and dr weissmann they will know what to do  viola turned upon her mother with a wail of supplication take me home mother take me home  mrs lambert herself was weeping now i dare not dearie not till they consent be patientthey have promised to release you after this test  over the girls face a stony rigidity spread her eyelids drooped her head rolled from side to side a pitiful moaning cry came from her pinched lips and then at last drawing a long peaceful sigh she slept  kate in terror stood watching waiting till the lines of struggle of pain smoothed out and the girl doubly beautiful in her resignation lay like one adorned for the angel of death then clarke said solemnly she has ceased to struggle she is in good hands in the care of those who love her and understand her when she wakes she will be newly consecrated to her great work come  kate awed and helpless permitted him to lead her from the room but when fairly outside she turned upon him fiercely dont touch me i despise you you are all crazy a set of fanatics and youd sacrifice that poor girl without a pang but you shant do it i tell youyou shant do it  and with that defiant phrase she swept past him down to the street forgetting dr britt in her frenzy of indignation and defeat     vi  serviss listens shrewdly   meanwhile morton with an armful of the publications of the society for psychical research before him was busied with the arguments of the spiritists and their bearings on viola lamberts case  the thing claimedthat the dead spoke through herhe could not for a moment entertain such a claim was opposed to all sound thinking to every law known to sciencewas in short preposterous  he had acquired all the prejudices against such a faith from emersons famous phrase rathole philosophy down to the latest sneer in the editorial columns of the pillar to the latest exposé in the blast upon the most charitable construction those who believed in rappings planchettes materialized forms ghosts messages on slates and all the rest of the amazing catalogue were either halfbaked thinkers intellectual perverts or softpated sentimentalists whose judgment was momentarily clouded by the passing of a grief  and yet said one author go a little deeper and you will find in the very absurdities of these phenomena a possible argument for their truth a manufactured system would be careful to avoid putting forward as evidence a thing so childish and so ludicrous as a spirit tipping a table writing in a bottle or speaking through a tin horn who but a childlike and trusting soul would expect to convince a man of science of the immortality of the soul by causing a message from his grandfather to appear in red letters on his arm the hitormiss character of all these phenomena the very silliness and stupidity which you find in the appeal may be taken as evidence of the sincerity of the psychic  to this morton took exception i dont see that there has never been a religion too gross too fallacious to fail of followers remember the sacred bull of egypt and the snakedance of the hopi the whole theory as spencer says is a survival of a more primitive life and religion  finding himself alone with weissmann during the afternoon he said carelessly  if you were called upon to prove the falsity or demonstrate the truth of the spiritualistic faithhow would you set to work  weissmann was a delicious picture as he stood facing his young colleague he was dressed to go home and was topped by a lowcrowned broadbrimmed black hat set rather far back on his head and floating like a shallop on the curling wave of his grizzled hair his eyebrows gray with two black tufts near the nose resembled the antennæ of a moth his loose coat his baggy trousers and a huge umbrella finished the picture he was a veritable german professora figure worthy of die fliegende blätter  i cant say exactly he replied thoughtfully in general i would bring to bear as many senses as possible i would see i would hear i would touch i would make electricity my watchdog i would make matter my trap  but how  that circumstances would determine my plan would develop to fit the cases i would begin with the simplest of the phenomena  do you know meyerss book  bah no  and yet they say it is a careful and scientific study  they say who say  serviss smiled the spiritualists then lightly added what would you and the rest of the scientific world do to me if i should go into this investigation and come out converted  the old mans eyes twinkled and his mustache writhed in silent enjoyment burn you alive as we did bent and zöllner  of course you would what you really want me to do is to go in and smash the whole thing eh  thats about it  clarke that crazy preacher said we men of science were just as dogmatic in our way as the bishops and i begin to think hes right we condemn without investigationwe play the heretic just as they did could youcould any mango into this thing and not lose standing among his fellows  no the old figure straightened and his mustache bristled sternly no he who goes into this arena invites a kind of martyrdomthat is also why i say you a young manyou might live to see your vindication but i would die in my disgrace as zöllner did  so they parted serviss admiring his chiefs blunt honesty and vast learning weissmann busy with the thought that his eyes were failing and his work nearly done and so little accomplished he sadly added  kate met her brother at the door in a kind of fury something must be done for that girl i have had a perfectly nerveracking time we must get her out of that house before they drive her crazy  the sincerity of her rage froze the smile on his face is it as bad as that  it is as bad as you can imagine that man clarke has some kind of baneful influence over her he seems able to control her by just waving his hand at her and the mother is such a dear old sillyshe trusts to him completely but go and dress and we will talk it all over im all of atremble yet with what ive seen i feel as if i had been to an insane asylum and witnessed a strangling  he went away to his room deeply perturbed resentful of all this illregulated human nature which could so upset his sane sister and come between his own mind and his work he believed in orderly and humorous human life why should this teasing tormenting girl from the mountains come with her trances and tricks to make life furious and antic where it had been amusing and accountable to what would a closer acquaintance lead what would become of his studies if he gave himself to her case to disillusionment i sincerely hope he said  as he joined his sister at dinner he began well now sis ill listen  kate had lost a little of her excitement under the influence of her toilettable but she was still tense and flushed as she hesitated her heart overflowing with sisterly admiration so handsome so strong and so very established did morton appear at the moment his tone still further calmed and reassured her and she began  in the first place i like the girl very much she is very pretty and much more au fait than you had led me to suppose her manner is extremely good the mother is dear and sweet but deluded clarke and that old man pratt ought to be in an asylumor the calaboose  morton laughed harshly your succinct statement puts me in complete possession of the case theyre all fakirs together  no i didnt mean that theyre all fanatics you should see the spiritpaintings and the slatewritings in that house it was like a journey to a far country really morton it staggers belief to think that within twenty blocks of where we sit such a man and such a home can exist they do exist and it only makes me realize how small a part of the city we know after all and some things i heard there today make me wonder if science isnt shutting its eyesas these people sayto a world right under its nose morton those people believe what they talk that girl is honest she may be selfdeceived but her sufferings are real i cant believe that she is wicked  weissmann practically advised me to go into a study of these morbid conditions  he did well that from rudolph weissmann after what ive seen today unsettles my reason maybe those people really have a message but morton you really must do something for that girl her condition is pitiful one of the plans of that lunatic clarke is to issue a challenge to the world of science and to throw that girl into the arena for you scientists to tear  morton startedstared no not a public challenge  isnt it pitiful yes hes going to speak on the second of next month at the spirit temple and hes going to publicly describe violas powers and as her manager challenge the world to prove her false  as mortons mind flashed over the consequences of this challenge his face paled good god what an ordeal but the girl does she consent  she does and she doesnt as a sweet nice child she shrinks from it but as a psychic as they call her she has no choice these inner forces seem able to take her by the throat any minute they seized her while i was there morton she impersonated aunt dosia and delivered the most vindictive messageshe scared me blue you never saw anything more dramaticmore awful  what was the message  something about a debt she wanted us to pay she was furious about it i dont know of any debt do you  no how did the message come  as kate described it the impersonation grew grotesque lost much of its power to horrify and morton though he writhed at thought of the girls depravity blamed the mother and clarke for it kate made end by saying it was horrible to see and it startled me then the other messages those written ones came through her hand  automatic writing they call it that has no valuenone whatever the whole programme was arranged for your benefit  no it wasnt the girl was carried out of herself she is somehow enslaved by clarke and she wants help she wants to be investigated but she wants it done privately she wants you to do it she begs you to do it  begs me his eyebrows lifted  yes she passionately desires your advice the poor thing made an appeal that would have touched your heart she wants to be cured of this horrid thingwhatever it is she wants to escape from pratt and clarke and all the rest of those queer people you must take it up morton you must make up a committee and take charge of her  clarke is mad no reputable man of science will go on such a committee the girl will fall into the hands of notorietyseekersmen of position do not meddle with such questions  kate flared forth why dont they it is their duty just as much as it is violas duty to offer herself that is where i lose patience with you men of science why dont you meet these people halfway women wouldnt be such bigotssuch cowards if you dont help this poor girl ill consider you a bigot and coward with the rest  your whole position is most feminine said morton arguing as much against himself as against kate youve only seen this girl onceyou have witnessed only one of her performances and yet you are ready to champion her before the world i wish youd tell me how you arrived at a conviction of her honesty think of it she assumes to be the mouthpiece of the dead the very assumption is a discredit  i dont care she has good honest sweet eyes  i bow to the force of the eyes but over against her claim i put the denials of science the phenomena these fanatics base their hopes upon science has already proven to be tricks illusions deceits  i dont care her story her own attitude towards the thing convinced me that she is honest  its the rogue who looks like a gentleman who runs the longest race  well ended kate rather helplessly see hersee her before you condemn her  but i have seen herive spent more days in her company than you have hours  kate looked at him with new interest you didnt tell me that before you said youd met her casually  she is enormously interesting buthis voice changed to earnest protestbut kate the thing the girl claims to be is out of key with all organized human knowledge it is a survival of the past it belongs to a world of dreams and portents it is of a piece with the old crones tales fortunetelling palmistry and all the rest of the hodgepodge or hocuspocus which makes up the world of the unlearned ive given a great deal of thought to her fate my heart bleeds for her but what can i do she really needs the care of a great physician like tolman she should be snatched from her unwholesome surroundings and sent away to europe or back to her hills when i saw her last she was as sweet and blithe as a bobolinkwe were on the trail together so far above the miasma of humankind that her girlhood seemed uncontaminated by any deathaffrighted soul why dont she go back she is vigorous and experienced in travel her stepfather is not poor he is rich why dont she pull away and go back to her valley  do you know what a control is  i believe that is the name they give the particular spirits which assume to advise and guide a medium why  well that poor thing is in mortal terror of her control who is her grandfather she was quite defiant till clarke reminded her that her guide would cut her down in her tracks if she refused then she wiltedwent right off into deathlike sleep it was pitiful to see her clarke was terrible when he said ithe is a regular svengali i believe and the mother is completely dominated by him one of the spooks is her own father the other her first husband it seems that they are willing to sacrifice the girl to their science for it seems they are leagued to dig a hole through to us from their side and viola is their avenue of communication then too the girl believes in it all she rebels at times but she has been having these trances ever since she was ten years old as the memory of the mothers tale freshened kate changed her tone you neednt tell me morton serviss that these people are frauds they may be mistaken but theyre horribly in earnest they believe in those spirits as you do in germs and viola is absolutely helpless in their hands if you can say they have hands they can throw her into a trance at any moment theyve made her life a misery she is absolutely enslaved to them  that too could be a delusionmedical science is full of cases of autohypnotism  viola lambert is not a medical case its astonishing what a blooming beauty she is in the midst of it all in fact her health gives clarke and the mother an argumentthey say it hasnt hurt her you see but what future has the poor girl think of going through life in that way  mortons eyes were sad as he said her future is a dark one from our point of view but she may be earning a crown to be given in the land of shadows she is beautiful but it is the beauty of a blighted flower  kate regarded him with affectionate eyes i dont wonder that she has bewitched you morton she can never be anything to you of course but we must help her just the same and i confess i am crazy to see one of her performances as you call them her face lightened how would it do to invite them to dinner and have a séance afterwards you could judge then of her truth  sacrifice her to make our holiday eh kate i thought better of you than that isnt that precisely the poor girls complaint that everybody wants to use her as a sort of telephone connection with the other world no if you invite her here receive her as a lady not as a pervert but now let us see you say clarke is going to issue his challenge soon  on the second  and that she has consented  consented poor thing she has no choice  if he issues that challenge she is lost his brows knitted to defy the world of science in that way will make her fair game for every charlatan in the city the press will unite to destroy her i will see clarke and pratt myself for the sake of their own cause they must not enter on such a foolish plan unless this life has already eaten deep into the essential purity of the girls nature she will be corrupted this publictest business will drive her into all kinds of artifices and shifts her exposure will be swift and sure yes i will see clarke if necessary i will undertake to secure a purely private investigation of her claims  kate rose and came round to his chair will you oh that will be good of you mort i cant begin to tell you how that girls face has worked on me today i feel that it would be criminal in you not to do something when she expects it of you she looks to us to save her she passionately desires your help go over there tomorrow dont delay they may issue that challenge any minute clarke was angry and alarmed at my attitude and may send out the notice tonight do go morton you cant afford to stand on ceremony when a soul is in danger  he rose very well i will go but i never embarked on an enterprise that seemed more dangerous more futile my heart says go but my reason is against it  follow your heart in this instance  if i did that wholly i would go straight to this dragons den and snatch the fair maiden home to my castle  that would be romantic but a little too daring even for my enthusiasm  you may be reassured no one really follows the heart in these daysat least those who do land in jail of the almshouse  as he lit his cigar he observed that his hand trembled for the first time in his life his nerves were overcharged and leaping with excitement just above control     vii  the sleeping sibyl   the following evening after much debate with himself serviss armored in scientific reflection set forth towards the unknown country wherefrom his sister had brought report of a maiden dwelling in the power of giants pitiably ensnared by evilminded enchanters the errand in kates mind was as chivalric as any of the olden time but the knights progress was lit by the green and red lamps of trade and threaded only the brazen jungles of traffic for dragons he had but the overhead monsters of iron and brassmonsters too intent on their own mad game to take account of such small deer as this footman picking his road beneath it was halfpast eight of the nightwatch  serviss began to realize that his reawakened interest in this girl was not purely impersonal and scientific it had become indeed a most disquieting intimate concern and every step towards the west sharpened the sense of his folly had it not been for the memory of that ride up the mountainshis keen remembrance of that day of joyous youthhe could have easily dismissed violas case from his mind but as he permitted himself to dwell upon her rosy rainwet face her birdlike ecstasy of voice her splendid defiance of the sun and wind a desire that was as fierce as anger actuated him making his proffer of aid not a gallantry but a duty i will defend her from herself though a liar she is still worth redemption in a certain sense the despicable rôle she is playing has been forced upon her  as he mounted simeons steps he observed that awnings covered the adjacent carriageblock and that some young people all in party dress were enteringa merry chattering groupwhereas the pratt mansion towered gloomily unlighted unalluring as a prison  he was about to touch the bell when the door opened and a porter softly greeted him the meeting has begun sir step right in sir this way sir softly please  before he was fairly aware of his attendants meaning serviss found himself thrust through a heavily curtained archway into a large room dimly lighted by a single lamp at the farther end it contained about twenty people and he hesitated in embarrassment and some amazement at the threshold  beneath the light on a recliningchair lay a woman with closed eyes and folded hands beside this figure stood clarke in the midst of an address every word of which was made dramatically effective by a forced calmness an elocutionary trick  some of you my friends may never have seen any of these mysterious things so many people say to me nothing supernatural ever happens where i am to you i repeat my answer to them have you ever tried to enter the right conditions here is a caravan of arabs on the desert the road hardbeaten is wide and dusty the necks of the camels sway the drivers shout there is the smell of sweat of leather of oil the alkaline dust blinds and blisters physical weariness and suffering shut out all else this is no place to look for heavenly visitors you would be a fool to expect a demonstration there but at night when the beasts are at rest when the cool starry sky bends close when the tentflaps are closed then the old men sit about and commune with their deadas all primitive natural peoples do  so with you you say to me i have no heavenly visions in my life i answer do you expect them on broadway or in your business office you are on the dusty weedy noisy highroad my friends and you will never hear a spirit voice or catch the flutter of a hand till you retire to the dusk and the quiet enter the land of meditation manifest a willingness to meet the angel visitors halfway and then the wings of the unseen will rustle about you the cool and scented winds of the invisible universe will kiss your cheeks shadowy voices will be wafted from the dark song will break from the silences to comfort and heal you  we see only what we will to seethat is a known law of psychology electricity was a force in the world six thousand years before man really saw it now we hear it crackle in our hair and stir in our garments by studying the conditions of its manifestation we are able to call it forth in giant power so of these invisible onesthey are all about us eager to bless to prove their presence they are here now around each one of you there are throngs hovering to manifest their love they will do so by the aid of this wonderful psychic who has consented to sit for us tonight let me repeat that she does this because the dead demand and the living beseech her to act as their intermediary with abrupt almost ludicrous change to a matteroffact tone he added henry turn the light a little lower  as the attendant glided to his task serviss was mightily moved to rise in his seat and cry out against the foolish profaning business they were putting the girl into the exact attitude of the paid trickster at college he had attended a few of these séances where vulgar and immoral women had furthered their trade and to see viola whom he still believed to be essentially sweet or at least reclaimable thrown into this most dubious posture disgusted and angered him but i am an uninvited guest my rising would precipitate a scene involving viola he reasoned and so kept his seat though his hands clinched and his teeth set with the effort at control  some one commenced to play softly upon a harp and a little sigh like a breeze passed over the group the women had begun to respond to the managers emotional appeal i can feel them gathering he called softly from his seat beside the motionless girl the spirit host are about us i can almost hear the rustle of their wings  the harpist stopped abruptly and an echoing strain of faint music continued to sound seemingly from the ceilinga fairy harp exquisitely clear that is my adele announced clarke in a voice so convincing in its tone of satisfied longing that the women of his audience again rustled with ecstasy  i think he is beautiful exclaimed one  a voice is whispering to me clarke continued it is asking for some onei cannot quite make out who is it again please morton serviss his voice rose in surprise he is not here you are surely mistaken certainly i will ask is professor serviss here  serviss replied with a slight note of annoyance in his voice yes i am here  again the little group shivered with excitementnot because they were acquainted with the name and fame of the scientist but because they anticipated some especially wonderful manifestation of the psychics power serviss irritated and puzzled waited in silence  clarkes voice trembled with his effort to appear calm as he said professor serviss i am glad to welcome you wont you please come forward the control desires it  for a full minute in dead silence serviss debated the matter then rose to comply mrs lambert met him with cordial hand saying in a whisper we did not know you were coming but they knew they want you closer to the manifestation  he sick at heart at her connivance in the trick made no reply but silently took the seat which clarke indicated  viola lay as silent as a statue her face faintly showing a diamond in her corsage emitting a momentary gleam as she breathed tranquilly at long intervals there was nothing of the professional sibyl in her dress and her tall figure was very beautiful in this attitude of deep sleep  clarke mindful of effect made explanation professor serviss as many of you know is renowned in science and the controls are especially anxious that he shall have the best possible opportunity to hear and see will you play again mrs robinson  as the harp resumed its sadly sweet pulsations the dead matter in the room seemed to awake cracklings snappings as of a firelog arose from the carpet rappings resounded from the walls the piano began to thrill as if a roguish child were thumping it  thats my little boy whispered mrs lambert  clarke shut off the light above his head till it was but a faint point of yellow light and then a hand firm and broad was laid for an instant on servisss shoulder stars of phosphorescent fire floated about a small hand fluttered in a caress about the face of the sleeping girl  that is her fathers hand again murmured mrs lambert  serviss was willing to believe the girls trance real and that she had no part in the hocuspocus up to this point but even as he leaned forward to peer into the faintly visible face of the sleeper a voice breathy yet metallic as though coming through the horn of a phonograph sounded in his ear be not so doubting my boy i too doubted  who are you he asked  loggy answered the voice with a chuckle  this answer so unexpected this chuckle so familiar startled him for it was his pet name for an uncle a professor of mathematics who used to call himself old logarithms when in play with his nephews but before serviss had time to put out his hand the horn came down softly on his head then withdrew and a boyish voice laughed in his ear youre a dunce  mrs lambert bent towards him did some dear one speak to you i hope so we are so anxious to have you one of us  he did not reply for a third voice seemingly that of an old man was issuing from the horn in pompous stolid oldfashioned utterance the reality of all you see young man can be proven set yourself to the grand task of destroying all fear of the change men call death science is hopeless we alone can save the world from despair  that is my father explained mrs lambert he is my daughters chief control he cares for herteaches her  again the floating horn passed mortons face and a boyish voice called mamma are you happy  yes dear when you are with me  were always with you were glad pofessor serviss came  so are we waltie  papa says tell him to watchtell himto be patient the voice hesitated murmured and was silent then added plaintively oh dear there are so many who want to talkthey take my strength away goodbye  the horn dropped with a clang but was at once caught up and floated away over the circle dear names were whispered secrets recalled loved voices long stilled by the grave were heard again hands that the earth had covered touched tearwet cheeks and with these caresses sobbing outcries burst from the women  i believe yes yes i know you darling called a mans voice and his accent was more moving than the cries of the women  pratt in wistful accents asked is there no one for me tonight  yes father answered a girls voice from the megaphone now hanging almost directly in front of serviss we are all here im going to sing for youthe song you liked the best  this she did in a faraway voice sweetly and with excellent vocalization but the first notes startled serviss they were from the banks of loch lomond the very song clarke sang to violas accompaniment that night in the little cabin in colorow and yet she told me she had no voice he said to himself and a bitter heat overcame the chill of his disgust what unconscionable trickery this last piece of deception seemed to involve the girl more directly than any other of the evenings accursed jugglery  pratt was pleading brokenly my old paw is open jennie put your hand in itjust for a momentas you used to im so lonely without you girls cant you touch your old father give me a kissand mother is she with you tonight  yes were all here i cant kiss you tonight father sometime i will the gentle voice replied im not strong enough tonight there was infinite regret in the tone which conveyed to serviss with singular vividness a virginal charm united to something very sweet almost saintly every sentiment had been beautifully voicedno actress could have done it better  clarke spoke gently solemnly professor serviss will you now take a seat beside the psychic her controls wish to make some special demonstration for you  with reluctance and loathing the young scientist moved forward guided by the mother and placed his seat at the right side of viola whose daintily robed graceful figure he could still detect her wrists appeared to be lying on the broad arms of her recliningchair and her head was turned away from him she seemed very feminine very lovely and very helpless and he had a definite and powerful desire to take her in his arms to wake her to snatch her from this most revolting drama of the dark  he was now seated directly between the sibyl and clarke her manager and every sense was keenly awake a tapping metallic sound at once arose either upon his chair or violas and the horn or whatever it was floated dimly into view then vanished and a moment later the voice of the chief control entered his right ear man of science do not shirk your duty here now we offer you a chance to solve the great mystery will you accept  to this he made no answer for his widely opened eyes were strained in the effort to locate violas hands eager to determine her part in the phenomena and as the moving megaphone again touched his right temple he laid a quick hand lightly on her white wrist  she leaped convulsively with a gasping cry the horn tumbled to the floor with prodigious clatter and the women all shrieked and rose to their feet  fool what have you done cried clarke in a terrible voice  servisss tone expressed only contempt as he answered no great harm i think  the clergyman pushed him aside rudely and knelt beside the girl who was writhing and moaning in her chair as though contorted with pain  words of indignation arose from the circle and one or two shouted run him out he has no business here but clarke cried out in a commanding voice remain where you are friends be quiet for a few minutes they obeyed and serviss was about to withdraw when pratt confronted him what do you mean do you want to kill the psychic  the mother was bending above her daughter with soothing words there there dearie it will soon pass you may turn on the light anthony  clarke turned the cock of the burner till a faint glow revealed the girl white suffering her left side convulsed you cant do things like that he went on addressing himself to serviss in these trances the nervous system is in a state of enormous tension the psychic must not be mishandled  i merely touched her arm answered serviss quietly  the mother answered the lightest touch is sufficient to convulse her professor you should have asked permission of the control then it would not have shocked her  i hope it has done no lasting harm his voice in spite of himself took on sympathy though he believed the girls shock to have been grossly exaggerated for some reason of her own i thought i was invited to make the test  the mothers calm voice was thrilling as she said shes better now you may turn the light on full  viola was a most appealing figure as she bloomed from the dark pure and pale as a lily she was dressed exquisitely in white and seemed older more worldly wise and more bewitching than when he had last seen her but with a feeling of profound contempt and bitterness serviss shrank from meeting her gaze he slipped away into the hall and out of the houseback into the cool crisp air of the night ashamed of himself for having yielded again to the girls disturbing lure burning with disappointment and sad and grieving over the loss of his last shred of respect for her  britt was right he exclaimed drawing a deep breath as if to free his lungs of the foul air of deceit they are all frauds together and with this decision came a sense of relief as well as of loss     illustration what do you mean do you want to kill the    psychic     viii  kates interrogation   kate waiting impatiently in her turn met him at the door well did you see her what did she say her voice rose in excitement for she perceived unusual gravity in the lines of his face  your far country lies on the borders of hell he replied with disconcerting succinctness yes i saw heror rather the ruin of her  she recoiled before this tone what do you mean  he shook himself free of his coat she has descended swiftly she now lends herself to the shallowest basest trickery  i dont believe it what has happened to make you so bitter  i will tell you presently he replied hanging up his hat with aggravating deliberation but not here come to the library he led the way and she followed quite meekly for she perceived in him something new and harsh she sat quite still while he filled his pipe and lit it waited until the soothing flow of smoke through its stem had softened his face he began sadly the girl has gone beyond our interference kate and if she werent so pretty if i hadnt seen her when she was wholesome and altogether charming i would not have wasted this evening on her tonights doings were unforgivable  did she give you a sitting  no but they were in the midst of a séancehe spoke this word with infinite disgustand the usher mistaking me for an invited guest thrust me into the very centre of the circle  how lucky i wish i had been there  well thats as you look at it when i realized what was going on i wanted to leave and i repeat had the chief actress been an old hag or the usual sloven who plays this game i would have fled but she was as beautiful as a statue as she lay there professedly in deep trance  youre sure it was viola  i wish there were a doubt yes she was there surrounded by a group of pratts friends giving a performance this word too expressed his contempt his pain she went the whole lengthlent herself to the cheapest kind of jugglery playing with horrible adroitness upon the emotions of a lot of bereaved men and women it was revolting kate it shakes ones faith in humanity to see such a girl in such a positionand that niceappearing old mother sat there serene as a tabbycat while her daughter bamboozled a dozen openfaced ninnies  tell me exactly what happened i cant share your horror till i know what the girl actually did  he approached the details with a grimace  first of all imagine a little halfcircle of welldressed men and women in a big drawingroom enclosing a girl lying on a low chair under a single gasjet and a man standing beside her speechifying  that was clarke of course  of course then imagine the light turned down and the usual floating guitarin the dark of courseand rappings and whispers and the touch of handsall in the dark then imaginethis will make you laughsome kind of horn or megaphone of tin that rambled around invisibly distributing voices of loved ones here and there like sweetmeats out of a cornucopia  you mean the spirits spoke through that thing  thats what they all believed  but you dont think the girl  who else some of the voices were womens and one or two were childrens clarke couldnt do the childrens voices  i cant believe it of her clarke must have done them hes capable of anything but i dont i wont believe such baseness of that girl  it hurts me to admit it kate but i am forced to believe that she not only sang through that horn tonight but that she lied to me she told me once that she had no voice and yet by request she sang into that horn and very sweetly too the very song to which she played an accompaniment when clarke and i met for the first time the effrontery of it was confounding  maybe there was a confederate  that doesnt sweeten the mess very much  no and yet it wouldnt be quite so bad but go onwhat else  then i was invited by the controlsso clarke saidto come up and sit beside the medium which i did very loathly it gave me a keen pang to look down on that lovely creature pretending to sleep knowing perfectly well that she was planning some deep deception  you are bitter what next  i took a seat beside her determined to see if she really had a hand in the deception i thought i could prevent anything happening  did you  no everything went on quite as briskly as before and all the while i thought i could see her arms lying limp along her chairlovely arms they were too she isnt poor you must understand that kate and that really makes the crime worse for she has not the usual excuseshe is not doing it for her daily bread  kate sat like a judge go on you seized her of course  yes just when the cone was emitting an old mans pompous harangue i laid my hand on her arm the horn dropped the circle rose in confusion and i came away  i expected youd do that all sceptics do i believe but i want to know all that took place youre so concise you say the cone emitted a mans voice now how could  it produced the impression of a mans voice it is easy to deceive under such conditions the cone was passed from her hand to clarkes at the proper moments and as you say there might have been a child  you must not infer mortmy faith in that girl is at stake was there nothing in her favor nothing that justified her claim  he hesitated and kate leaned forward in excess of interest go on morton be honest  well now as i think of it there was one little thing which was rather curious i dont know how she or clarke or any one there should know what we used to call uncle ben  what did you get a message from him  a voice from the megaphone asked for me and when i requested the name of the party speaking as clarke says it replied with an oily chuckle exactly like the old duffer its old loggy  it did her voice was sharp with surprise well now that is as wonderful as my experience how do you account for that how do you account for such things she repeated insistently  clarke must have known  nonsense no one outside our immediate family knows of that nickname besides how would he know the way loggy laughed id forgotten it myself  so had i but what would you say would you jump to the conclusion  you are jumping at the conclusion mort if there is one single thing that you cant understand you must give that girl the benefit of the doubt what did loggy say  there you go youre ready to swallow the whole lump of humbuggery just because there is one little puzzling plum in it  kate was not to be put down what did uncle say  he submitted nothing else like most of those dead folk he was there just to manifest not to impart wisdom  kate leaned back in her chair and grew thoughtful morton that was wonderful no one knew you were coming no one knew you except those people and theyre from the other end of the earthand yet somebody speaks using a pet name weve both forgotten now i call that a most important thing to dwell upon how can you a scientist overlook it  but you must remember all this happened in the house of jugglery there is no value in a performance of that kind there was no test applied confederates had full opportunity to come and go to have weight with me these wonders must take place under conditions of my making not theirs  thats what she wants  i dont believe it pardon me kate but youve been taken in whatever this girl was two years ago she is now a part of clarkes scheme which is to secure a tremendous lot of advertising and thenemit a book  kate transfixed him with a finger morton serviss there is nothing so convincing as a tone i know that girl is honestshe may be deceived she may be made a tool of unconsciously by clarke but she does not wilfully deceive i will not let you off with this experience you must see her in privatetalk with her as i did  i will have nothing further to do with her or hers he replied with determined quiet knocking the ashes from his pipe i have other and better business in the world  i dont believe it is better business now wait a moment i have something to tell of my own evening while you were gone i phoned uncle harrison and aunt nancy about that debt of my greatauntwho came to me through viola today they knew nothing about it but they set to work looking over her old papers and found that there was a sealed letter addressed to a doctor in michigan and in the letter was a check made out to him and which she intended to send him now what do you think of that  i dont see that that has any necessary connection with your experience this afternoon  but it does im sure of it auntie felt grateful to this young doctor and wanted to reward him morton it was a big check she uttered this impressively  was it how much  five thousand dollars  he faced her with a whistle of surprise well well that isnt so amusing are we to pay it is that the idea  if i am sureif the letter is what they phoned it to be weve got to pay it im her sole legatee and she was very angry because it hadnt been paid but thats not the really important part how did viola lambert know of that letterand that check  he was deeply impressed and did not try to conceal it that is very puzzling but it may be a case of mindreading which i believe the modern psychologists admit has been proved he began to muse it may be as weissmann says that there is always some basis for a claim such as clarke makes for this girl it may be that she has a faculty for reading what lies in the brain of another  morton serviss you shall not condemn that girl unheard you have taken britts word about her and youve listened to my story but you must see her yourself and talk with her alone so that she will be free to tell you just how she feels  no i am going to bed and try to forget the whole disconcerting group  thats the way with you scientists youll pursue the tail of a cometor a germtill youre black in the face but when something really important to the human race comes under your nose you cant see it  youre forceful but not elegant sis  im out of all patience with you  he laughed goodnight  i hope that girls face will haunt you she replied  it did from the moment he turned off his light his mind leaped into the most restless activity taking up the scroll of the nights events he read and reread it with minutest care a voice seemed to present the girls case arguing that she had no conscious part in the manifestations it is possible for one in deep trance to rise and manipulate horns bells and guitars at the suggestion of another precisely as a somnambulist walks without intention of wrongdoing without conscious knowledge of what is being done she might have had a veritable hand in tonights drama and still be innocent hypnotism is now pretty thoroughly provenand to clarke you must look for the real offender  the human brain which is marvellous enough when in health and singing merrily forward like a cunningly constructed and jewelled timepiece becomes in disease as baffling as hopeless of solution as the laws of the unfathomable sky beyond the utmost sweep of the imagined lies the marvel of fact the beliefs the vagaries the hallucinations of the insane have never been coordinated perhaps they never will be it is possible that this girl so normal in appearance has a rotten strand in hersome weakness inherited from her father this is the only way in which to account for her glowing physical health and her manifest mental disorder she has her fathers mind in a body drawn from her mother onehalf of her is pure and sweet and girlish the other is old decayed lying and irresponsible can she be reclaimed  it is now known that the conscious mind is but a pinspoint of the minds activity the conscious state being but one of an infinite number of possible statesthat the submerged unconscious self is a million times more complex than the chain of those conscious states which makes up the normal or orderly life of an individual may it not be that this girl by reason of her long practice of submissioninduced by othershas dethroned her conscious higher self making of her subliminal self a tyrant this submerged self holding as it does all the experiences of the dark past all the lusts deceits and subterfuges all the cruelties and shameless potentialities of her animal and semicivilized forebears and being but a mass of discordant impulsesstates almost entirely disassociated from her conscious lifehas all but taken possession of her higher self the restraint of the laterdeveloped governing moral self being weakened the witches and wolves are leaping forth to vex and destroy over this fortuitous subversion of her souls kingdom clarke now rules like a demon councillor  considered in the light of a study in morbid psychology her case is enthralling from the standpoint of human pity this use of her is a diabolical outrage suppose kate to be rightsuppose the girl has awakened to a full realization of her danger suppose that her cry for succor is real can i can any man who hears it refuse to heed would i ever sleep in peace again  he went further he admitted that her beauty was the deciding element she is too lovely to be left to a fanatics designs she has matured in body grown more womanly since we rode the trail together may it not be that her mind maturing even more rapidly has come to perceive the crumbling edge of the abyss before it stands and turns to science as the only rescuer no matter what her past deceptions have been is it not my duty to help her  his anger and contempt dissolved into compassion he recalled her youth her inexperience i will at least see her again he decided deep in the night i will talk with her i will draw her out i will study her all will depend upon her attitude towards me and towards her own soul and in that softened mood sleep came to him     ix  violas plea for help   morton went to his work next morning quite unfitted for an especially delicate piece of dissection which he had in hand he bungled it and weissmann transfixed him with a glare of disapproval my boy these social gayeties do not consort well with science  the young man smiled to think how wide of the mark his chief was he held up both hands i swear it shall not happen again then moved by a desire to secure a comment on the curious phenomena of the séance he related the story of his brief interview with his uncle bens ghost now do you suppose that clarke or the medium could dig around among the dusty forgotten lumber of my mind and get hold of a queer fact like that nickname  why go so far round inquired weissmann why not say it was your uncle ben who spoke  you are joking  i am not joking if the facts are as you say then one explanation is as reasonable as the other  serviss was amazed you dont really mean it  if you say it was an illusion of the sense of hearing i agree but do we not stagger among illusions who so well as we know the illusory nature of every fact nothing is stable under our hands of what avail to reduce the universe to one substance as the monists do we pry we peer into that substanceit fades like smoke forty years i have probed among the cells of the bodythe final mystery remains insoluble why because the atom the thing once demonstrated the final division of matter is itself an illusion made up of the intangible and the imponderable this i have given my whole life to discover life is an illusionwhy not death shall we dogmatize especially on the one thing of which we know nothing the spirit world is unthinkable but so at the last analysis is the world of matter  the young man believing this to be only the mocking mood of one who knew the argument of the dualists better than they knew it themselves remained silent and weissmann composedly resumed the dogmatism of haeckel is as vain as the assumption of metchnikoff we shall forever discover and forever despair such is the life of man  when he went home morton found a note from his sister saying that she had received a message from viola and that she would be at home at five now dont fail to go i have to pour tea for sally or i would go with you im crazy to see the girl again i spent the morning talking the whole thing over with doctor safford she thinks as i do that the girl is exactly what she claims to be a medium and that while it is her duty to go on she ought to be protected from the vulgar public we both want you to take her in hand certainly there ought to be no disgrace in standing as interpreter between the living and the dead isnt it just our foolish prejudice if the girl can bring messages from the other world she ought to be honored above all other women seriously morton her plea the other day wrung my heart i dont want you to get too interested in her of course but what we call a disease may be a godgiven power think of the way we run after a foolish vulgar woman who has married into millions and then think of the way we sniff at this girl because she has some gift which science doesnt understand if one teenty tiny bit of what they claim about her is true science ought to cherish her as marion said if she had discovered a star so far off and so faint it wouldnt matter in the least to any one but a few cranks whether it existed or not she would be honored all over the world but as she claims to have discovered something vital to every human soul she is despised it is your duty to help her i had her over the phone just now and her voice was trembling with eagerness as she said do tell him to please come and see me  this note so like his sister so full of her audacities touched morton on the quick it was plain that she was more than halfseas over towards faith in the girl and quite ready to take her up and exhibit her among her friends her use of the word disease was intended as a mockery of his theories he knew that she was quite capable of talking over the phone precisely as she had written reserve was not her strong point and that she had undoubtedly given viola reason to expect him however having concluded on his own account to see her once more kates exhortation merely confirmed him in a good intention i will confront clarke and try to pluck the heart out of this mystery but i will keep clear of any personal relation with the girl and her mother he said as if in answer to his sisters admonition  it was about five oclock of the afternoon as he again mounted to pratts portico recalling as he did so the dramatic contrasting scenes of the evening beforeon this side of the brick wall a communion with the dead on that the throbbing gay life of a ballroom truly a city street was a microcosm  a solemnvisaged colored mannot the officious usher of the night beforetook his card and led him into a gorgeous glacial receptionroom on the left the house was very still and cold and gloomy for the day was darkening and the lights were not yet on it impressed him as a vast and splendid tomb and with a revived knowledge of simeon pratts tragic history he chilled with a premonition of some approaching shadow what a contrast to the sunlit cabin of the colorow he inwardly exclaimed and the thought of the mountain girl housed in this grim and sepulchral mansion deepened his wonder  a gruff voice above inquired who is it let me see the card serviss eh tell himno wait ill go down and see him myself  morton smiled grimly realizing perfectly the manner in which pratt had intercepted his card the old watchdog he exclaimed  a heavy tread descending the stairs announced the approach of his host whose sullen face was by no means engaging as he entered are you professor serviss  i am  the flabby lips curled in scorn you are one of those scientific gentlemen who know it all arent you  i sent my card to miss lambert replied serviss with cutting formality  pratts face darkened i am the master of this house  but not of your guests i hope  i have a right to know who calls and i intend to protect miss lambert from such as you you were not invited here last night  not by you i admit i owe you an explanation for that i came to call on miss lambert your man shouldered me into the room before i knew what was going on i didnt intend to butt in as they say i was afterwards invited forward by mr clarke as you will remember and later by the control  clarke is not running things here  ah but the spirits would you question their judgment they insisted on making me the guest of honor you will remember they played to me you may say  pratt was daunted by his visitors mocking tone you should have had more sense of honor than to grab the medium the way you did  being invited to sit near i took it as an invitation to make a test i wanted to know who held that horn how can you hope to convince a sane mind of the truth of such an exhibition as that last night unless you permit tests  the colored man had returned miss lambert will see you sir this way please  for a moment pratt meditated interference but something in the movement and face of the visitor deterred him as serviss followed his guide up the great stairway he asked himself what will she be like she must be changeddeeply changed how will she meet me he acknowledged a growing excitement  she met him so simply so cordially with such frank pleasure that his own restraint gave way at first glance in her glowing color in the tones of her voice lay a charm which carried him back to colorow linking the mature and splendid woman with the unformed girl of the mountaincabin he took her hand with a keen thrill of admirationwhatever had come to her she had gained in grace without apparent loss of sincerity  his eyes disturbed her and she stammered some commonplace expression of pleasure and he replied almost as lamely then turned to the mother i hope you have forgiven me for my action of last night then again to viola i only intended to touch your arm i trust you suffered no lasting ill effects  again something that was at once attraction and repulsion passed between them she perceived in his tone a note of mockery involuntary in its expression but all the more significant on that account  i am sorry you were there she quickly replied i dont blame you no it did not hurt mei mean it was all over in half an hour the contraction is very painful while it lasts its just like a cramp i didnt intend to give the sitting but mr pratt requested it for a few of his friends and i couldnt well refuse i didnt know you were there till mamma told me afterwards there is no value in such a sitting to you  with a dim suspicion of her wish to cover some deception he answered my entrance was quite as unpremeditated i assure you he spoke with returning humor i really came to call upon you to welcome you to the city and to talk of the west the usher mistook me for one of the seekers and thrust me bodily into the circle please believe that i acted upon sudden impulse in seizing your wrist i am heartily ashamed of myself i was an intruder and had no right no excusealthough your guides as you call them seemed eager to have me sit beside you  i do not blame you she repeated and fell strangely silent  he studied her with mounting pleasure the flowerlike line of her lips her glorious bosom the poise of her head all the lines that had meant so much to him at their first meeting were there more womanly more dangerous in their witchery than ever for two years their thoughts had subtly crossed and intertwined and she now felt his doubt his question almost as keenly as if he had uttered them  he broke the momentary silence by saying with a distinctly tender tone are you thinking of colorow i am  she flushed and started a little yes  i was recalling my first view of youa fragment of sunset cloud caught on a mountaincrag  her face grew wistful that seems a long time ago to me  it doesnt to me it seems but yesterday my trip that year was a symphonic poem with a most moving final movement i have thought of it a thousand times he paused a moment then added well now here you are in new york and here i am and what of your music i was to advise you you remember  her head lifted in defiance an adorable gesture you know my secret now it was as if she said come let us have it over  he replied very gently i knew something of it then dr britt told me something of it at the time  her eyes bravely searched his was that why you did not come to say goodbye to us his glance fell in a wish that she had been less cruelly direct she went on you neednt answer im used to being treated that way i knew somebody had told you i was a medium you despised me when you found out about meeverybody does except those who want to use me all the people i really want to know go by on the other side as if i were a leper it was so in boston it is going to be the same here  mrs lambert interposed that is not true dr serviss we met many nice people in boston  yes mammanice people who wanted me to tell their fortunes  her tone went to servisss heart she was so young to be so bitter but he could think of nothing at the moment which would not add to her chagrin for was not his own interpretation of her quite as hard to bear  she went on no i dont blame you or any one for avoiding me but i wish they would let me have one or two friends but they wont lots of people like me at first but they surely find out after a while and then they change towards me sometimes i think i might as well publish my name as a medium and let everybody know it at once  you must not permit that miss lambert he earnestly said that is what i came to say dont allow them to use you so  how can i help it she passionately exclaimed when they all demand itmother mr clarke mr pratt grandfathereverybody they think i owe it to the world  i dont i think it is your right to say  i have no rights listen she leaned towards him her face paling her eyes big and soft and terrified i want you to understand me dr serviss you must know all about me her voice fell to a husky murmur you must know that i cant direct my own life my guides can do what they please with me can you understand that  i confess i cannot  it is true my grandfather insists on these public tests he is determined to convict the men of science and mr clarke is only too glad to agree with him mother is controlled entirely by what grandfather says my wishes dont count with anybody but i think ive done my share in this work she faced her mother in challenge and appeal ever since i was ten years old ive given myself up to it but now im afraid to go on i dont want to be a medium all my life they all say it is hard to change after one is grown up and im afraid she repeated with a perceptible shudder  the mother undisturbed by this plea turned to serviss with an exultant smile does she look like one breaking down  the girl rose from her chair like a tragedienne it isnt my body its my mind she cried with poignant inflection clasping her head with both her hands and her look transformed her in the eyes of the young scientist it was the tragic gaze of one who confronts insanity and death at a time when life should be at its sweetest for an instant she stood there absorbed in her terror then dropped her hands and in a voice of entreaty which melted all his distrust hurried on i want to know what is going on in my brain i am losing control of my self i want some man of science like you to study me your sister said you would help me and you must you think i deceiveyou thought so last nightbut i dont i knew nothing of what went on i didnt know that you were there i dont know what i do nor what i am i want you men of science to investigate me i will submit to any test you like you may fasten me in a cage or padlock me downanythingbut i will not be advertised to the world as a medium and i must have rest from this strain dont you understand cant you see how it will be  i do he answered quickly i understand perfectly and i will go at once to see mr clarke and intercede  that is not enough you must intercede with my grandfather and his band they are the ones who control me ask him to release me  this request staggered the scientist my dear miss lambert you will pardon me but i cant do thati do not even believe in the existence of your grandfather  she stood in silence for a moment and then answered you would if his hands were at your throat as they are at mine he is just as real to me as you are he is listening this minute  that is a delusion  i wish it were she bitterly and tragically answered the hands are so real they choke methat i know i am helpless when he demands things of me he can lead me anywhere he wants me to go he can use my arms my voice as he wills you must believe in him to help me he will listen to you i feel that she grew appealing again your sister believes in mei am sure of thatand my heart went out to her sometimes it seems as if all the world even my own mother were willing to sacrifice me  viola cried mrs lambert sharply you shall not say things like that  theyre true you know theyre true the girl passionately retorted you all treat me as if i had no more soul than a telephone  that is very unjust declared mrs lambert this is only one of her dark moods doctor you must not think she really means this  the girls brows were now set in sullen lines which seemed a profanation of her fair young face but i do mean it and i want dr serviss to know just what is in my heart her voice choked with a kind of helpless rebellious anger as she went on im tired of my life i am sick of all these moaning people that crowd round me its all unnatural to me i want to touch young people and have a share in their life before i grow old i want to know healthy people who dont care anything about death or spirits its all a craze with people anywaysomething that comes after they lose a wife or child they are very nice to me then but after a few weeks they despise me as the dust under their feetor else they make love to me and want to marry me  mrs lambert rose i will not allow you to go on like this viola i dont understand you today youll give dr serviss a dreadful opinion of us all  i dont care the girl recklessly replied i am going to be honest with dr serviss i dont like what i do and i dont intend to trust my whole life to the spirits any longer they may all be devils and lying to us i dont believe my own grandfather would be so cruel as to push me into this public work  mrs lambert again warned serviss from taking this outburst too seriously she is possessed doctor some bad spirit is influencing her to say these things to you shes not herself  viola seized on this admission thats just it theyve destroyed my own mind so that i dont know my own thoughts if there are good spirits there must be bad spiritsdont you think so dr serviss  his eyes did not waver now his voice was very quiet but very decisive as he replied my training my habit of thinking excludes all belief in the return of the dead either as good spirits or bad but if there are spirits i should certainly think evil of them if they were to force you into a service you abhor i do not pretend to pass judgment on your casei know so little about itbut i do sympathize with you i deeply feel the injustice of these public tests and i will do all i can to prevent them  mrs lambert interrupted but dr serviss my fathers advice has always been good to question it now would be to question my faith his wish is my law  serviss shrugged his shoulders a little impatiently my dear lady we have no common ground there the wishes of the dead have no weight with me when set against the welfare of the living the question which i beg you to consider is whether you wish your daughter to continue in this mental torture do you want her name blazoned to the world as a public medium you cannot afford to add disgrace to her private torment  the mother held her ground her guides say she will be taken care of and as for the disgrace that is all imaginary it is an honor  viola again burst forth they are always talking to me about the honor of being a medium about the distinction of it and when i ask what distinction the world gave to the fox sisters or home or madame cerillio they answer that the world has changed since then but it has not changed enough to make my work respected mr clarke says it ought to be but saying so does not make it so every time i read of a medium exposed i turn cold and hot for i know people consider all mediums alike i dont want to go about all my life like an outcast i dont want to be happy after im dead i want to be happy now i dont want to be different from other girls i want to be like them if they publish me i will be a medium forever i will be in constant terror of attack and that will drive me insanethey must set me free dr serviss she pleaded as if she were the victim of some murderous design you are wise and strong there must be some way for you to help me  all of servisss wellordered sympathetic phrases failed him as he listened to the storm of her plea and felt the flame of her passionate protest all doubt of her sincerity her own honesty vanished being utterly burned away by the light in her lovely eyes her mental bondage was real her desire to escape contamination indubitable he met her gaze with tender gravity i believe in you he said as if committing himself to a most momentous enterprise and i will help you  his voice so manly so strong so tender robbed her of the power to speak she seized his extended hand in both of hers and pressed it hard the tears in her eyes veiling her soul from the passion that filled his glance  as she faced him thus leaning to him trustfully so vivid so magnetic so much the woman so little the sibyl that he forgot all his hesitations and doubts filled for an instant with an irrational impulse to seize her claiming her as his own in defiance of the mandates of her world and the conventions of his own but she dropped his hand and turned away and he went out in a maze of conflicting desires his judgment sadly clouded by the youthful riot in his blood  at the moment he was in love with her and singleminded in his desire to aid her to defend her but the door had hardly closed behind him when his questionings his suspicions began to file back stealthily silently along the underways of his brain her distress began to seem a little too theatric her troubles selfinducedall but onemadness did in very truth seem to hover over her a baleful imminent shadow  clarke looming darkly confronted him in the lower hall well met dr serviss id like a word with you  i have a request to make of you responded serviss miss lambert has expressed to me her great distress of mind as concerns the public tests you are planning and has asked me to intercede for her she profoundly objects to the use of her name and i ask  clarkes voice was harsh and sullen as he interrupted i have considered her objections and find them insufficient  servisss voice rose slightly her lightest objection should be insuperable i dont understand your point of view i cant see by what right you ignore the wish of the human soul most vitally concerned in your crusade you treat her as if she were a rabbit dedicated to the use of a biologic laboratory i am better informed now than when we met in your churchstudy mr clarke i know not merely miss lamberts secret but your own it may be that you honestly think this challenge will confer great distinction upon her but let me assure you it will put an ineffaceable stain upon her furthermore your tests will end in disaster to yourself and to your cause  what do you mean by that interposed pratt who had come up and stood listening do you doubt her powers  i do she will fail and the failure will be crushing the thing you claim is preposterous every time science has taken one of your mediums in hand he or she has suffered extinguishment it is the grossest outrage to ask this girl to face certain exposure a challenge of this blatant kind will rouse the most violent antagonism among scientists and if you succeed in getting any really good man to take it upwhich i doubthe will be merciless  we want him to be declared clarke we glory in your defiance let your scientific men come with their bands of steel their bolts and bars their telephones and their electric traps we defy every material test  you are foolsmadmen hotly answered serviss you would sacrifice this girl to a brazen scheme of selfadvertising  clarke was contemptuous that is your point of view from our side there is no greater glory than to be an evangel of the new faith what matters the comment of the gross and selfsatisfied to us who work for the happiness of those who mourn the world in which we live despises the materialism of yours  at this moment a new conception of clarkes plan crossed servisss mind he is deeper than i thought he would discredit the girl in the eyes of normal suitors thereby assuring her to himself aloud he said miss lamberts right to herself should be your first consideration she is something more than a trumpet for sounding your fame  clarkes resounding voice had drawn mrs lambert from her room and she now hurried down the stairway with intent to calm him  serviss turned to her again i beg of you mrs lambert to consider well before you consent to this plan your daughters name will be a jest from one end of the country to the other it doesnt matter how sincere and earnest you are the public will regard this challenge as a seeking for notoriety your daughter is about to be flung to the beasts seeing something unyielding in her eyes he added with such intensity his own heart responded will you stake your daughters reputation her health her reason upon the issue of a voice in the dark  yes when the voice is that of her own father he knows the future he will protect her i have no fear  there was such conviction such immutable faith in her gentle voice that serviss was confounded when he spoke in answer his voice was lower in key with a cadence of hopeless appeal  how do you know these advisers are your husband and your father you must be very certain of them  i am certain i believe in them as i believe in my own existence the line of her mouth lost something of its sweetness and serviss seeing this took another tack  granted these voices are genuine they may be mistakenrash with zeal you wouldnt say that they have gained infallibilitya knowledge of both past and futuremerely by passing to the shadow world  to this clarke made answer that is precisely what we do believe they have predicted our future they have laid out all our plans their advice has brought us to our present high place and we shall continue in our course despite you or any other doubter  they have brought you to a very dubious sort of success serviss cuttingly replied but what about your victim i know this city and its ways i realize as none of you seem to do the wasting injustice you are about to inflict let me intercedelet me arrange some other plan  on clarkes face a sneering onesided smile crept as he answered you are too late our plans are made our programme published  what do you mean  the reporters have just been here the notice of my speech and a broad hint of the nature of my challenge will appear in four of the leading papers tomorrow morning  but violasmiss lamberts name you surely havent used that  oh no that is to follow the challenge with her name and defiance form the climax to my oration he swelled with pride as he spoke as if visualizing himself on the platform the centre of thousands of eyes the champion of reviving faith  thank god for your vanity there is still time for some one to intervene responded serviss minded to thrust him through  pratt shouldered in again what have you got to do with it anyway who asked you to interfere  the chief person concernedmiss lambert herself  pratt was about to utter some further insult when clarke diplomatically interposed we want you to have a part in the work dr serviss we will welcome you to a committee of investigation but we cannot permit you to interfere with our plan the forces are bent on the work and they are inexorable  it is you who are inexorable replied the young scientistyou and this deluded mother  this rapid dialogue had taken place in the wide hall just beneath the huge chandelier whose light fell on servisss white forehead and square determined face pratt was confronting him with lowering brow a bearlike stoop in his shoulders and the muttering growl of his voice was again filling the room as viola appeared upon the great stairway she came slowly with one slim hand on the railing as though feeling her way and at every step mysterious jarring sounds came from beneath her feet and from the walls her eyes were shut her chin lifted and on her face white and tense lay the expression of a sorrowful dreamer her mouth drooping at the corners was pitiful to see all her vivid youth her flaming rebellion had been frozen into soulless calm by the implacable powers which reigned above and beneath her in the dark  in horror and fierce impotent rage serviss watched her descend it was plain that she was again in the grasp of some soul stronger than herself and he believed this obsession close akin to madness to be due to a living overmastering magicianto clarke whose voice broke the silence there is your answer he called and his voice rang out with triumphant glee her guides have brought her to show you the folly of human interference she is only an instrument like myselfclay to the hands of the invisible potters  once again a flaming desire to seize the girl with protecting hands filled servisss young and chivalric heart but a sense of his essential helplessness a knowledge of his utter lack of authority stayed his arm while his blaze of resolution went out like a flame in the wind sick with horror he stood till mrs lambert took viola in her arms then in a voice that shook with passion he said madam your faith in your spirits passes my understanding only devils from hell would demand such torture from a blithe young girl  and so saying with shame of his impotence and with a full realization of violas mental bondage to anthony clarke he turned away i now understand britts wordsonly the authority of the husband can save her from her allsurrounding foes and at the moment his fist doubled with desire to claim and exercise that power     x  morton sends a telegram   the harsh reality of the outside world was like the harddriven acrid spray of the ocean in a wintry storm it stung yet calmed with its grateful stern menace a thin drizzle of rain was beginning to fall and the avenues were filled with the furious clamor of belated traffic the clangor of the overhead trainsalmost incessant at this hourbenumbed the ear and every sidestreet rang with the hideous clatter of drays and expresscarts each driver each motorman laboring in a kind of sullen frenzy to reach his barn before six oclock while truculent pedestrians tired eager and exacting trod upon one anothers heels in their homeward haste  this tumult of turbulent coarse unthinking life seemed at the moment not merely normal but wholesome and admirable by force of contrast with the morbid unnatural and useless scenes through which he had just passed better to be a burly unreflecting truckman than a troubled unresting soul like anthony clarke yes and better for viola lambert to be the wife of one of these rude animal types suffering a life of physical hardship than to continue the sport of a man who having lost the true values out of his own life is remorselessly distorting those of the woman he professes to love  his mind then went back by the same law of contrast to his momentous ride across the sulphur spring trail to think on how small a chance my share in this girls singular history hangs had i taken the cutoff as my guide suggested had i camped in the logcabin at the head of the cañon or had i saddled up the next morning and ridden over to silver city as i had planned we would never have met and i would not now be involved in her hysterical career  but he had done neither of these things he had camped in the town he had sought her and in this seeking lay something more than chance his second meeting was an acknowledgment of his youth and her beauty she had held him in the village day by day because she was lithe of body and fair of face and because her eyes were unaccountably wistful yes he had sought her that night when the river sang with joyous immemorial clamor and the lamp beckoned like a hand he had gone to her for diversionthat he now acknowledgedand he had grown each day more deeply concerned with her life and its burdens  and now here she was at his door more dangerously enthralling than ever involved in a snare of most intricate pattern calling upon him through some hidden affinity of their natures as no woman had ever called him beforecalling so powerfully so insistently that to save her from her peril as pressing as it was intangible seemed the one and only task at his hand  in this mood sustained by the memory of her anguished face he sent a telegram to lambert urging him to come at once to the relief of his wife and daughter  he did not appreciate the full force of this act until he left the office and resumed his walk homeward then like a shock from a battery came the realisation i have now definitely intervened but how weakly how ingloriously  this thought grew less agreeable and more humiliating as he dwelt upon the possible consequences will lambert remember me will he take my warning to heart  in imagination he followed the small envelope as it passed to the hand of a messenger and started up that fearsome splendid trail towards the mill the world was stern and cold and white and still up there in the basinwinter yet reigned in majesty and the pathways were deep sunk in heaped and sculptured snows  up to the halfburied office the courier would ride and with a cheery halloo call lambert to the door what would he think upon receiving such an imperative summons from a stranger did i make the situation clear he may imagine that some dire physical disaster has overtaken his women but that would be true their peril is none the less real because intangible and yet my part in it may not seem either wise or manly  in truth every step towards his own door removed him an emotional league from the scene in the hall and as the throb of violas agonized voice died out of his ears the crisis in her life grew hysteric unsubstantial and at last unreal her gestures her plea for help her descent of the stairway came to seem like the climaxes in a singular drama powerfully acted god what an actressif she is an actress he exclaimed as the tragic intensity of her face returned upon him  he passed from this to the next phase of his development in a certain goodhumored way he had accepted his friend tolmans theories of hypnotic control but had never taken them into serious account till this moment he was forced now to admit the entire truth of suggestion or to charge this girl whose character so bewitched him with being an impostor she was either a marvellous artist in deception or clarke controlled her through some sinister and littleunderstood law of the mind what else could have brought her creeping like a somnambulist down the stairway to demonstrate her tormentors demoniacal sovereignty and if he could call her to him in such wise then all the weird tales of the romancers all the halfmythical doings of mesmer and charcot were true and the feet of bulwer lyttons remorseless lover solidly set upon the rock of fact  my school of thought is very exact and very dogmatic it prides itself on not looking beyond its nose there is no room in our textbooks for this girl and her claims but he stood on the corner and surveyed the familiar scene the rushing commonplace men the commonplace horses the commonplace ugly walls and signs and for an instant they lost substance became as shadowy as drifting mist the men were of no more bulk than phantoms the walls and pavements but the effluvia of the commonplace perceiving mind all were as transitory as smoke as illusionary as the opiumeaters midday dream what did it signifythis mad rush to get round a corner to creep into a hole why should he trouble himself about one of the millions of women evanescent as butterflies with which the earth continually replenished its swarms of men  he walked on eager to return to his own little nest to his books his easychair his glowing fire what folly to go out of his own life to profess accountability for the welfare of a girl whom he had seen but a few hours in all his life why trouble to explain her case was it worth while to dethrone spencer in order to defend the action of a childs disordered mind  this mood gave way to one far less philosophicalhe permitted himself a moment of exultation over his youth science had not yet taken out of him the nerves that leap to the touch of a womans palmthe right woman ten years deep patient absorbing dissection of pathologic tissue had not rendered the gloss and glow of a girls cheek less velvetsoft on the contrary the healthy wholesome flesh the matured beauty of this mountain maid seemed of more worth than any fame to be wrung from the niggard hands of the royal academy the absorption of the true scientist was completely broken up love is worth while he said in answer to himself and to serve others the only solace in the end     xi  dr britt pays his dinnercall   kate had not returned and he was glad of this for it gave him time in which to recover his normal serenity of mind he met her at dinner with an attempt at humor but she was not to be deceived nor put off from the main subject he was forced to make instant report which he did leaving out however all the deeply emotional passages he fell silent in the midst of this storyprofoundly stirred by the memory of violas confiding gesture as she leaned to him awed by the essential purity of the soul he perceived lying deep in her eyes how blue how profound they seemed at the moment  kate if she perceived his abstraction ignored it well i hope you agree with me now clarke is her control her black beast  yes that is the only explanation at this moment the only solution which leaves her innocent  but to admit that is to admit a good deal mr scientist  i know that mrs precipitancy but what would you have me do i dont want to believe the girl a trickster after a pause he said kate i never felt less of a man than i acknowledged myself to be as i turned away leaving her in the clutches of those accursed fanatics  why did you do it  what else could i do she was entrancedi had no authority my attempt at a rescue would have created a disgusting scene and put clarke on his guard my native caution and my conventional training combined to paralyze me  kate fired with reckless ardor said lets go and snatch her awaynow  no my second thought is best think of what clarkes arrest would mean to the girl and to us no we must wait for lambert clarke at present has all the authority it wont do to push him he would instantly trumpet her name to the four winds of heaven if he thought we were about to interfere if lambert heeds my warning he will arrive on friday and that will prevent the challenge  what sort of person is this mr lambert  serviss pondered hes a small mildmannered mannot unlike a nice thoughtful country doctor in appearance  i wish he were six feet high and fierce as his inches said kate  if he had been that this preacher fellow would never have been able to run away with his family he sighed well hes all we have to conjure with if he fails us we must resort to craft  i wish we could get viola and her mother here would they come to dinner if i should ask them if we could get them here once we might be able to persuade them to stay  that would not save her from the pillory in which pratt and clarke design to set her we must be careful not to anger them the girl hates and fears pratt  i know she does  his air of proprietorship is fairly indecent we must be especially careful not to rouse him he has millions to use in asserting his claims and is as vindictive as a wolf  kate sat in silence for a few momentsa very unusual state with herand at last announced her purpose leave the whole thing to me we will have dr weissmann and i will ask clarke to come to meet you in order to talk over his plans for a committee ill just ignore pratt hes nothing but an old killjoy anyway  hes worse than that dont brush him the wrong way were going to have trouble with him before we are out of this  i dont care i will not have him in my house responded kate  very well hes eliminated i hope clarke will permit them to come  oh theyll come unless pratt absolutely locks them in their rooms shall i ask marion and paul  no i want a chance to talk to our psychic alone  very well the table just balances anyway now about your telegram are you going to speak to mrs lambert about that  no it is all up to lambert he can act or not as he sees fit he will probably wire them that he is coming and as there can be no explanations till he arrives you will please say nothing of my share in the warning  they had just risen from the table when britt sent in his card  excuse my calling so early he began with tranquil drawl but im going back to the west tonight ive got to get out of this climate or join the spooks im thinking of doing that anyway just to see what its like round the corner in the fourth dimension and also because id like a change of climate  you look wellexceedingly well kate cheerily replied  youre very good but i dont feel as well as i look my poor one lung is working overtime and a collapse is imminent i dont see how my beloved brother clarke bears up he must get help from the other side you see he spent the winter in bostonthink o that but its telling on him if i wished him wellwhich i dontid advise him to return to colorado and to his presbyterianism by the limited mail  could he do thati mean go back to his church  i dont suppose he could you see he went out under a cloudtook the whole windowsash with him you might sayand i dont think the elders would welcome his relapse furthermore he has embraced spiritism as he calls it with both arms bytheway professor ive been talking about these psychic matters with weissmann and others and i agree with him that youre the very man to go into an investigation of these occult forces  and be called insane as zöllner was  oh well times have softened since then now really what do you think of zöllners experiments  i wish he hadnt been so eager to demonstrate the fourth dimensionthat vitiated everything he did  oh i dont know ive been rereading lodge and wallace and meyer we studied them when i was at college mainly to click our tonguespoor old chaps he smiled you understand of course i cant go the whole length but i must say i dont know what youre going to do with the evidence crookes collected  but slade and home and the fox sisters from whom he drew his facts were exposed again and again and one of the fox sisters confessed to fraud didnt she  myes but afterwards recanted and rerecanted they were all a dubious lot ill admit that is why i hate to see a girl like viola lambert put in their class by a selfseeking fakir like clarke  is he selfseekingor is he only a fanatic asked kate i believe him to be quite sincerethats why hes so dangerous he is willing to walk hot ploughshares to advance his faith what are his relations to viola do you suppose she has actually promised to marry him  serviss waited for his reply in such suspense that his hands clutched his chair britts face lost its gleam im afraid she hasor at least she feels herself sealed to him by her controls serviss rose and took a turn about the room as britt went on you see this sweettempered old ghost mcleod is anxious to have his granddaughter unite her powers with clarkes in order to advance the grand cause mcleod it seems was a presbyterian clergyman himself here on the earth plane and has carried his granitic formation right along with him ive argued with the old man by the hour but his egotism is invincible  serviss faced him abruptly now see here britt youve seen a good deal of miss lamberts performanceswhats your honest opinion of them  frankly i dont know he answered with a smile since rereading zöllner and crookes and going over my notes and those of dr randall im a little shaken i confess so far as human evidence goes these men prove that there is a world of phenomena ignored by science i dont go so far as to say that these doings were the work of disembodied spirits but i do admit that i am puzzled by things which i have witnessed with one sense or another the things seem to tally in a most convincing way this girl is repeating substantially the same phenomena witnessed by crookes twentyfive years ago the singular thing about the whole subject is that one man cant convince another by any amount of evidence a personal revelation is necessary for each individual  isnt that true of other faiths asked kate  no theres a difference for example i would take your brothers evidence as to a new germ but as to a spiritno and yet one is quite as incredible as another crookes applied the same methods to the study of these manifestations that he used in his other researches and piled up a mass of evidence yet his fellows of the royal academy sneered or hawhawedand do yet do you know doctor he continued i have moments when i dimly suspicion that we scientists are a thought too arrogant we lose the expectant mind we assume that weve corralled and branded all facts when as a matter of history there are scattered bunches of cattle all through the hills take haeckel for instance he talks very like the head of a church laying down the law to you and to me as well as to the ignorant outsider spencer was a good deal less sure of himself it takes a physical specialist to be cocksure darwin never professed to solve the final mystery of life or death but haeckel and metchnikoff do they are so militant against religion that they become intolerant of their colleagues who presume to differ with them on matters that are purely speculative any one attempting to discuss new phases of human thought is a fakir i am not willing to say that all the notions of the dualists are survivals of the age of superstition as haeckel does it may be that in the midst of all their fancies which are survivals there are some subtle perceptions of the future  serviss lifted his eyebrows in surprise thats a whole lot for you to concede weissmann must have been corrupting you  britt went on we must always remember that every age is an age of transition we are losing faith in the revelations of the past but we should not presume to define the faith of the future men will not live in the hopelessness which the monists would thrust upon them they will not patiently wait while pasteur and koch and the other germ theorists labor to prolong the life of some other generation they will always insist on having something to live for and to die for i dont pretend to say what this faith will be but it will be sufficing  kate exclaimed with glowing eyes and all this change in you two men has come about through the influence of a pretty girl  the two inexorables looked at each other with a certain air of timidity and britts face expanded in a slow sly smile youve discovered us we are human like the rest of our sex if you catch us out of our laboratories theoretically we hold life of no account actually were all lovers or husbands a mockery more moving than tears came into his voice my hopeless philosophy dear lady arises from weak nerves and a poor digestion i would give all i know of science all i expect to be in my profession and all i hope to be after i am dead for just five years of health such as lamberts miners squander in carousals every saturday night in the saloons of colorow i hold with haeckel in one thingi believe in a mans right to suicide and when i find myself of no further use to the sick i shall slip quietly out i hope i wont have to poison clarke before i go id do it cheerfully if i thought it the only way to rid that girl of him seeing that his hostess was really shocked by these words he lightly ended however i think such extreme measures unnecessary im going to send lambert on to kill him for me  kate looked at morton with inquiring eyehe shook his head  britt resumed i am trusting in you serviss if i could be sure of living two weeks longer i would stay and help but money and breath are now vital to me and i must go however im perfectly willing to put clarke out of the way if you advise it he really ought to die mrs rice he gravely explained as he rose to go he is a male vampire to think of him despoiling that glorious young soul maddens me i am the son of a coarse powerful sensual drunken father but he neglected to endow me with his brutal health my mother was an invalid therefore here am i old and worn out at fortythats why i worship youth and beauty health is the only heaven i know and that is denied me here his smile died his eyes softened and his face set in impenetrable gravity had i the power i would keep viola lambert forever young and forever virgin then with a quick return to his familiar drawl but i am going away without even killing clarke to plod my little round in colorow and wait news from you if i do not see you again mrs rice keep me in mind i make the same promise your husband madei will manifest to you if i can  i would rather you came in the flesh she replied  he bowed deeply i thank you both for a very satisfying glimpse of a civilised home  sometimes i think were overcivilized she replied quickly but come and see us again  i fear it will be as a spookthey laugh at microbes as well as locks however i promise to rap when i call  thank you that will make you a most considerate ghost  when they were alone together kate said with a sigh what an amount of sin and sickness and trouble and death there is in the world  thats a sign were getting on he replied when were young we laugh at the falling leavesthey are only a sign of some new sport when im as old as you are i suppose ill begin to observe all the baldheads at the theatre  well now for our dinnerparty i must write to mrs lambert tonight  youd better take second thought about this matterreckless kate  i have  take a third consider thisthe girl may go into a trance at the table  oh if she only would my fear is shell be like other amateur performerssubject to a cold or something these gifted people are so often disappointing  now see here kit seriously if you invite miss lambert to our house it must be as any other charming guest  you didnt suppose i was really going to ask her to spookle she indignantly answered then added with a smile of course if she insists on reading my palmorany little thing like that it wouldnt be nice to refuse would it  i knew it you have designs upon her dont do it it would be too gross after your protest against others for using her she herself complained bitterly of just this treatment you must not even speak of her powers  she lifted her hand solemnly i swear  i mistrust you even when you swear he ended doubtfully theres a telltale gleam in your eyes  and at this moment of banter they both lost their sense of the girls imminent peril and thought of her only as a most entertaining possibility as a guest     xii  viola in dinnerdress   viola glowed with joy over kates invitation to dinner and flying to the telephone as she was requested to do accepted without consulting either her mother or clarke and fell immediately into wonder whether she possessed a gown becoming enough to fit the golden opportunity  mrs lambert was also pleased but at once said i hope tony will feel like going  viola resented the implied doubt of their own acceptance i am going anyhow i will not be shut up here any longer like a convict i like mrs rice very much and i want to see her house i know it will be just as nice as she is  but we cant go without anthony my dear  clarke came to the door a little later to say that he had received mrs rices invitation but that he did not care to feed the curiosity of such people you would better plead a previous engagement he added to viola  ill do nothing of the sort she indignantly answered indeed ive already accepted you neednt look blackim going she added in pouting defiance  something in her look as well as in her tone convinced him that wisdom lay in not attempting to restrain her therefore he gave assent gloomily and with a sense of loss i dont know how pratt will feel about it he dont like those people and besides he has invited some friends in to see you this evening  he said nothing to me about it viola responded curtly and besides how can he expect me to be always at his command he is not my jailer im tired of his demands they are so unreasonable  mrs lambert as usual entered to soothe and heal violas been very good about meeting mr pratts friends tony weve hardly been out to dinner since we came here and it really seems to me as if we had the right to go out tonight  we ought to have thursdays anyway the girl scornfully added we have less liberty than our maids the whole situation is becoming intolerable  clarke acknowledged that pratt demanded a good deal and was gracious enough to say it wont be necessary much longer ill go down and try to arrange the matter and report what he says  i dont care what he says im going viola repeated im going if he locks us out i wish he would  pratt was resentful at once i dont want her to go tonight i have some people coming in to see her i dont want them disappointed she must remain  she feels aggrieved because she has been kept so close here and i must say  i dont see why she feels that way she has every luxury she goes for a drive every afternoon and there is hardly a night that i dont bring home somebody to dinner it seems to me shes seeing all the people she ought to see i dont believe in having her mix with those sceptics too freely  he went upstairs sulkily quite in the mood to bully but mrs lambert turned away his wrath with a smile and several soft words and viola did not see him till she was on her way to the carriage he was lurking in the hall below waiting for her surly and sour and insulting  viola perceiving his humor said to herself i will not let you spoil my evening by making me angry i will not listen to you and she didnt though she could not help hearing his warning growl  ill expect you home early  once safely out of the house she said to clarke this really is too much anthony he is insufferable if you dont tell him so and teach him better manners i will leave the house but there i said i wouldnt let him spoil our evening and i wonti wont even think of him again  serviss expected her to show some signs of the deep emotional stress of his former interview but in this he was most pleasurably surprised he marvelled at the height of her rebound from the wan helplessness of her mood upon the stairs she was indeed a totally different beinga radiant blooming creature belonging wholly to the world of youthand he was scarcely able to relate the two scenes to the same girl and again he exclaimed what an actressif she is an actress she was very simply attired in pale blue with but few ornaments but she bore herself like a queen demanding homageand he gave it he was all the lover and nothing of the scientist as he stood to greet her  she on her part behind her proud mask was breathing quick with pleasure to meet professor serviss in dinnerdress in his own home exalted her above the pupil and transformed him into something more intimate than the mastersomething more dangerously compelling than friend  kate quite carried away by her enthusiasm caught the girl again in her arms you dear sweet thing i wish i had made a big party for you youre too fine to be wasted on three cranky old scientists  serviss met clarke with less of repulsion than he had anticipated for notwithstanding the preachers haggard cheeks and a certain set glare which came into his eyes occasionally he was a handsome figure he was plainly on guard however and extremely ill at ease and his eyes kept furtive watch on violas every movement  kate at once engaged him in conversation in order that he and morton might not fall into argument and with the further purpose of permitting her young people a little time for mutual explanation she was glad when weissmann came in brisk as a boy his keen eyes peering alertly through his hornbowed glasses he not merely proved a diversion he completed her party the great man was as animated as a cricket this was his society manner and upon being presented to viola began paying her the most marked and absorbed attention hopping briskly from one heavy german compliment to another quite unaware apparently that she was anything more than a very pretty girl  he took her out to dinner with elaborate courtesy and divided his attentions between his partner and his hostess with mathematical precision beaming now upon viola now upon kate with such wellcalculated intervals that serviss broke into a broad smile  you find yourself well placed dr weissmann  well placed and well pleased he responded quickly with no thanks to you i suspect  kate was much relieved by weissmanns liking for violait made her party a little less difficult but she was anxious to have morton free to talk with viola and to that end drew the good doctor into conversation with clarke who was not at all pleased with his seat which was by design at the farthest remove from his psychic he saw no reason why they might not have been seated side by side  as kate remarked to marion afterwards it was a hard team to drive for the table was too small to permit anything like private conversation at either end and to enter upon general topics was to start clarke and weissmann into dialectic clamor i trusted in the food she answered to marions query it was a good dinner and kept even the preacher silentpart of the time  clarkes face was flushed with wine and his glance which rested often on viola was not pleasant he was afraid of her when she shone thus brightly among careless worldly sceptical people she seemed to forget her work her endowments and to think only of flattering speeches and caresses it was all so childish so foolish in her so undignified in one who meant so much to the sindarkened world  mrs lambert on the contrary was humanly glad for the moment at least of her daughters respite from her grave duties and sat blandly smiling while the young people talked animatedly on a wide list of subjects  morton was delighted to find that viola had read a good many books not always the best books but of such variety that her mind was by no means that of the schoolgirl her experience in life was very slight but her hunger to know was keen he was eager to draw her out on her morbid side but as he had said to kate we must not permit anything to rob her of one evening of unbroken normal intercourse if you can manage clarke i will do the rest  kate tried hard to manage clarke and was succeeding rather adroitly whenever he seemed about to enter upon a discourse she interrupted him met his ponderous phrases with flippancies plied him with food for which he had a singular weakness and in many other womanly ways discouraged and in the end intimidated him he was at a distinct disadvantage and knew it and the knowledge irritated him however with all his eccentricities he was a man of considerable social experience and while he was not at any time joyous of countenance he did not in open guise offend though he sank at last into a glowering silence leaving the talk to weissmann  morton gave much attention to mrs lambert securing from her almost before she realized it a promise to join a theatreparty and thereupon turned to viola to say i hope you will consent  consent she cried with shining eyes i should like it above everything you see ive never really lived in a big city and its all so new and splendid to me  morton responded lightly i wish i could see it with your eyes i suppose new york is a wonderful city and im sure all this chaos is making towards something unparalleled in beauty but just now i take the point of view of a native who has been driven out of the good old downtown streets by vulgar trade the servisses lived for forty years at the corner of corlear square but four years ago a big apartment hotel rose next door shutting off our light and we had to move hence our acrimony the city grows more and more a showplace wherein the prodigal american may buy the pleasure he thinks commensurate most of us who were born here have quite lost our hold on the earth for instance here we are kate and i treed in a tenstory hotel on ground from which we used to gather huckleberries and therein lies the history of many another new york family  viola looked round the spacious and handsome diningroom i think this way of living is beautiful i want mamma to take an apartment over here on the park i love the park although it makes me homesick for the west sometimes  if you do decide to take an apartment consult kate what she doesnt know of new york isnt ladylike for any one to know frankly mrs lambert i should be very glad to see you get away from pratts house he is i fear a selfish brutal businessmanan egotist who would sacrifice you both instantly if it would add to his comfort of mind or body but wait i am forgetting my duties as hostwe are to avoid all unpleasant topics and thereupon he led the conversation back to impersonal discussions of books and music  all through this exquisite little dinner viola sat with a strengthening determination to assert her right to leave her gloomy prisonhouse on the drive a house in which there was neither wholesome conversation nor privacy nor order an ambition to live humanly and harmoniously in an apartment like this grew each moment in definiteness she appreciated the delicacy of the centrepiece of maidenhairfern veiling with its cloud of green a few flamelike jonquils she took a womans joy in the immaculate napery and in the charm and variety of the china such housekeeping was an art and quite impossible without the personal touch of the mistress and as she looked across towards kates homely pleasant face her heart went out to her in gratitude and love she could be trusted this frank laughing graceful woman she represented a most modern union of housewife and intellectual companion no wonder dr serviss remained unmarried  clarkes forbidding unrelenting face looming darkly at kates side was revealed to her in a new and most unpleasant light she resented his scowling glances and pitied his failure to glow in such genial company she saw him for the first time the prosing bigot narrow and repulsive she resented his failure to subordinate his theories up to this moment she had supposed herself respecting him now she began to realize that she had lost even that and the thought made her shiver with foreboding how different were the men of science with their jocular irrelevant but always illuminating comment on whatever subject they handled it was all touch and go with them and yet they were quite as serious as he  as the coffee came in kate rose with a word of caution morton well expect you to join us soon  you may depend upon us replied weissmann  and you mustnt talk out all the interesting subjectssave some of them for us to hear  we shall not be able to talk on any other subject than yourselves retorted weissmann gallantly and that would not be good for you to hear  kate laughed i know what that means these western girls are compelling creatures well i will not complain if she only shakes you out of your scientific complacency  they were hardly out of the room before weissmann asked is miss lambert from the west  from the rocky mountains  so i find her quite charming  morton dryly answered i noticed that yes shes western born but of eastern stock mr clarke is a newyorker i believe  i was born in maryland sir but all my early life was spent in brooklyn  weissmann turned his telescopic eyes upon clarke and studied him in silence somewhat as a popeyed crab might regard a clam so so he said softly you are the one who is preparing to assault the scientific worldthe clarke mentioned in the papers today  clarke folded his arms in defiant mood i am  and this charming girl is your victimthe one for whom you make such claims eh  clarke regarded the old man with imperious lift of the head she is without question the most marvellous psychic in the world  psychic weissmann barked this word at him like an angry mastiff psychic what business has she to be a psychic she is too lovely to be anything but a wife and mothera happy hausfrau and you would make her infamous my friend i do not understand you  clarkes eyes blazed if i had the power i would lay her message before every living soul on the globe infamy sir i know no higher honor than that of being cupbearer to despairing souls thirsting for the water of life then a direct answer to the old mans prolonged stare you need have no fear i will not go one jot beyond the advice of her guides  her guides who are they  i mean her invisible ministers compared with whose wisdom our learning is childs prattle for they are one with the sages of history their minds drink of the limitless ocean of all past knowledge and catch the gleam of discovery to come furthermorehere his voice grew hard and his glance shifted to servissno one living has a more vital interest in her welfare than i surely i may be trusted to guard and cherish one who is soon to be my wife  this blow delivered with the orators telling arrangement of phrase fell with tremendous force upon serviss towards whom it was vengefully directed with a heart filled with anger and disgust and pain the young host responded i am glad to have this assurance from you for your action has seemed to me calculated to do miss lambert irreparable injury of course i do not doubt your good intentions as regards heri cannot do that after your final statementbut i think you underestimate your opposing force  we expect battle but nothing can really harm us what do we care for the puerile dispraise of the press we are doing gods work in the world and as for the scientists they are as moles in the dark  weissmanns voice became reflective do the parents of the girl not object  quite the contrary her mother trained her for this great work  that is very strangethis mother seems nice and sensible  clarke sneered you physicists think nothing is natural or sensible but your own grubbing you nose in the mire studying parasites of decaying flesh while we are lifting wing into the world of spirit where neither pain nor death is known you are blinded by your bigotry or you would see the leading of every new discovery in the modes of motion heat light the xray the emanation of radiumdo they not all point to new subtleties of the physical universe the power which the spirits use to communicate with us the world which they inhabit is only a higher evolution a more potent condition  weissmann arrested him in full flight and began to question him about violas powers drawing from him rapidly and with the precision of a great lawyer all that he would say of her case while serviss smoking quietly listened in deep amazement so candid so sincere did clarke seem to be in his answers he was morehe became eloquent almost convincing and the young scientist was forced to acknowledge once more that appearances were deceitful can this man be the fakir i have thought him he is a bigot a crazy fool but he does not fit the rôle of villain and yet  he could not put the alternative into words so deeply did it involve viola herself  the preacher was in full flowturgid studiedly ornate egotistical and bombastic but the final effect even upon weissmann was that of one deluded rather than of one carrying on a deep and farreaching system of deception he bodied forth the emotional moralist seeking escape from the ferocity of the creed in which his youth had been nurtured rather than the selfseeking coldly calculating fortunehunter with lofty courage he concluded  now to you gentlemen of science we say we respect your methods but not your subjects of study nothing gives me greater pleasure than a perusal of your books the patient way in which you pursue some clew in the labyrinth of biology is admirable i met a man last weeka man i knew in collegeand upon my asking what he was doing he replied gravely for the last six months ive been making a study of the parasites in the abdomen of the flea here clarkes sneering laugh broke out yet that man despised mecalled me a foolbecause i forsooth was intent on the laws which govern the return of the dead his laugh died he became very earnest and very sincere now men of science all we ask of you is to apply your precision of handling to subjects a little more worth while than the putrid body of an insect  serviss laughed but weissmann with true german contrariety returned the compliment gravely being confronted with a true believer he automatically assumed the opposite position and with searching scorn assailed the whole spiritist camp with merciless knowledge of every defenceless portal  for a time morton enjoyed clarkes discomfiture but at last his sense of duty as host awoke and he was about to come to the preachers relief when kate appeared in the doorway and the old warrior lowered his lance and rose politely  kate gave him a reproving glance youve been arguingi can tell by your guilty looks  oh no not at all a mere statement of opinionof no interest i assure you  kates voice was eager mr clarke viola wants to sit for ushave you any objections  kate called serviss i am ashamed of you  i assure you i didnt ask iti didnt even hint towards it cross my hearthope to die  morton was at the moment displeased for he had been looking forward to a long and intimate conversation with viola in the drawingroom and would have been glad if clarke had opposed it firmlywhich he did not perhaps he saw a chance to turn the tables on his critics at any rate he rose saying i will talk with her and decide the matter and followed kate out of the room  what is it what did she say queried weissmann bewilderedly  morton explained that miss lambert had particularly requested him to sit with her and talk to her guides and that she had expressed a particular desire for an immediate test  weissmanns eyes glittered with new interest very good why not it is a fine opportunity do you not feel so  in truth he did not the intrusion of the abnormal side of violas life seemed at the moment not merely inopportune but repulsive as he entered the drawingroom he found her sitting in a low chair beside a small table on which stood a shaded lamp clarke was talking with her and serviss could detect even at a distance the depressing change which had come to her her girlish ecstasy was quite gone and in its place lay pallid languor and a look of appeal  clarke moved away as his host approached and viola glancing up wanly and wistfully said isnt it stupid just when i was so happy i wanted this evening free but they would not have it so no sooner was i seated here than they began to work on me they say they want to talk with youmy grandfather especiallyand i too want you to do soonly i didnt intend to ask it tonight please be patient with me wont you  do not distress yourself about that i shall be very glad to sit i was afraid kate might be requesting it i particularly warned her against mentioning the subject but if your guides wish it and you are willing be sure dr weissmann and i will be most pleased but tell me how did the change come what began to happen     illustration but tell me how did the change come what    began to happen  the usual tappinghere on the tablethen my hand wanted to write i ignored iti fought it i didnt intend to yield but they set to work undermining my will and then i knew that i must consent or be strangled as soon as i gave up they took their fingers from my throat but they are heremy grandfather is just back of mei can feel his heavy hand on my head im sorry professor serviss i was having such a good time i hope you wont despise me  you are entirely too modest he answered cheerily we are highly favored its like having paderewski volunteer to play for his dinner  his lightness of tone hurt her a little you dont believe in me in the least do you you think i am an impostor  oh no i believe in you  but youve got to believe in these manifestations if you believe in me  no no that does not follow he replied quickly then perceiving that this involved him all you do may possibly be explained without resort to the spiritualistic hypothesis he was embarrassed by her gaze  why are you so contemptuous of spiritualists it is very hard to bear  he felt the rebuke i am not contemptuous  yes you are scientific people never speak of us without a laugh or a sneer and it hurts it confuses me too if good people like you care nothing about deathif you only laugh  i beg your pardon miss lambert i never intended to be either harsh or contemptuous i do not accepti mean to say i am unable to acceptyour faith i confess that my mind refuses to entertain the postulates of what clarke considers a religion i must be honest i am a sceptic so far as your faith goes but that does not mean that i do not believe in the sincerity of your mother and as to your own powersi do not wish to dogmatize for the physical universe is a very large and complicate thing and young as i amhere he smiledi dont pretend to a knowledge of all it contains  she accepted his explanation and with musing candor replied i dont really blame you i suppose if these things had happened to some one else i would not have believed in them i have thought a great deal of what you said to me i want to get away from that house i am hating mr pratt more and more and i will leave tomorrow if grandfather will only consent if he comes to you tonight tell him somaybe my father will come too i want you to know my father im sure you will like him isnt it strange that i have never been able to hear his voice  he ignored her question i do not understand the motives of your guidesi cannot conceive of myself sacrificing you to any cause whatsoever  dont awaken my doubts she cried despairingly i dont know why it is but you always rouse in me something that makes war  im sorry if i seem to corrupt you  i dont mean that she hastened to say the life which you and your sister represent is the life i love i was almost resigned to my fate when your sister called upon me now im all rebellion again being here tonight makes me hate all that i am i hate my very name i hate pratt and his horrible housei almost hate my mother sometimes she is so cruel to me she dont mean to be but she is  his face grew reflective almost stern i wish there were some way of taking you out of the world in which you now suffer i wish he paused checked by the thought of clarkes claims upon her  there is only one waymy grandfather must consent to my release he rules us all  this delusion rose like a stone wall at the end of every avenue and morton turned to a personal explanation i cannot associate what you seem to me now with what you were when i last saw you what would you have said had i seized you the other daysnatched you from the stairs and ran  her eyes opened wide the stairs  had you no knowledge of following your mother down the stairway after our interview  i knew i was entranced but i didnt knowwhat did i do she asked this anxiously  nothing he hastened again to change the current we were in hot argument you came down as peacemaker i went away cravenly most impotently leaving you there like a captive  i dont remember a word of it i came to myself in my own room and only mother was with me her rebellious fire blazed up again oh dr serviss i was resigned yesterday but tonight i am in terror again and they know it they are eager to show their power to confound you and convert dr weissmann im sure they will do some wonderful thing for you tonight if you will let them  the best thing they could do for me would be to let you sit and talk to me he replied in the voice of a lover  she seemed to listen to some interior voice they are insisting they are herelisten  as he listened a series of throbbing raps seemed to come from the chair beneath her hand  very well we will sit as he said this three heavy rending low thuds sounded on the under side of the table  that is grandfather she said he wants you to be very rigid and so do i she said sometimes it seems as if i did these things myselfi mean certain physical thingsand i get all mixed in my mind i want you to study me she passed her hand wearily over her face and morton looked at her in sorrow meditating a firm decisive assault on her hallucination but checked himself if i am to help you i must know all about you he said at last and a sitting may help  you wonder at my fear of my grandfather but thats because you dont realize his power let me tell you what happened to me once when i tried to run away from him i became desperate one summer vacation and determined to get away from it all without telling mother i took the train one morning she paused abruptly and pressed both hands to her burning cheeks oh it was horrible my grandfather threw me into a trance on the train and the conductor thought i was drunk she shuddered with the memory of it and could not finish since then i have never dared to really oppose him  he pondered her blush the quiver of her lips and the timid look of her eyes and gravely answered i share your horror of an experience like that but it does not endear your malevolent grandfather to me he must be a kind of male witch  you mustnt feel that way towards him she cried out in some alarm he is firm because he feels that i should be doing my work  id like to talk this matter over with him but i dont like to have you entranced is that necessary  yes to get the voices the writing we can have any time  what do you do to induce this comathis sleep  just fold my hands and give myself up  it seems a desecration of you but if there is no other way we will grant the powers audience  at his word her face cleared her fingers relaxed and she smiled thank you he has taken away his hand  as she rose and stood before him she seemed again the buoyant carefree girl and he could only weakly say it seems so ungracious so inhospitable in us as they walked side by side across the room to kate  clarke was sitting in silence without pretence of listening to his hostess watching serviss with gloomy uneasy eyesa fierce flame of jealousy burning in his brain he recalled the change in viola which had followed this mans visit to colorow and associated her first persistent revolt with him and now seeing her beside him in his own house looking up into his face absorbed fascinated utterly forgetful of her duty oblivious to every one else was maddening her gown angered him why did she wear that dress he fiercely asked himself she does not do that for me she is in love with himthat is why she shall not come here again these people are destructive to her higher aims  in this mood he changed his mind opposed the sitting but viola convinced him that it was the will of her guides and that it was a splendid opportunity to interest two renowned sceptics and in that spirit he again reluctantly consented     xiii  the test sÉance   mortons study was decided upon as the most suitable place in which to experiment for the reason that it had but one exit a sliding double door which led to the library and its windows all opened upon the street six stories below a burglar could not have entered with full license to do so  viola assisted morton and kate in clearing the big mahogany table while weissmann conferred with clarke to judge from the girls gayety and eager interest the preparations were for a game of cards rather than for a test séance in which her love and honor were at stake mrs lambert was quite serene clarke alone seemed anxious and ill at ease  weissmann at mortons request assumed general direction and betrayed an astonishing familiarity with the requirements under his direction they grouped themselves about the table as for whist viola at the north end with clarke directly opposite and kate and mrs lambert on either side and quite near him the two inquisitors then took seatsmorton at the psychics right weissmann at her left  when the positions were all decided upon viola with a note of disappointment in her voice asked arent you going to tie me  oh no replied morton the conditions are yours tonight you are our guest our tests will be made at some other time  please make them tonight she pleaded please make them as hard as you can  weissmanns glasses glistened upon her with joyful acclaim very good your wishes shall be met let us seewe shall tie you have you something suitable he asked of his assistant  morton took from his desk a roll of white tape how will this do  just the thing weissmann replied but we must have no knots no tying kate get your needle we must fasten miss lambert in such wise that no one can say oh she untied the knots  under his supervision kate looped the tape about violas wrists and sewed it fast to her closefitting satin cuffs she then encircled her ankles with the tape and morton drew the long ends under and far back of the chair and nailed them to the floor thereupon weissmann said i wish to nail these wristbands to the chairarmdo we sacrifice the cuffs he asked of viola  yes yesanything nail as hard as you please  and the chair pursued the old man glancing at morton  oh certainly replied he science goes before furniture in this house and a couple of long brass tacks were driven firmly down through both tape and sleeve  you poor child exclaimed kate if they hurt you cry out and i will free you  weissmann then fastened a silk thread to her wrist and gave one end to morton we will keep this taut he said every motion will be felt  as they worked the enthusiasm of investigation filled their eyes they lost sight of the fact that all this precaution implied a doubt of the girl and viola on her part remained as blithe as if it were all a game of hideandseek  clarke too became exultant mcleod now is your opportunity he called to the invisible guide bring your band and put the monist bigots to rout  morton moved about the girl with growing excitement a subtle fire mounting to his brain each time his fingers touched her smooth round wrists once she said i have never had a real test like thisthis is what i wanted you to do if anything happens now it will be outside of me wont it  we must be cruel in order to be kind he answered enigmatically  at last weissmann stood clear of her now we are ready he said beaming with satisfaction you see i lock this door and here is the key he held it up in confirmation i pocket the key now what  turn down the gas replied clarke do not use electricitythe room must be perfectly dark  why perfectly dark i dont like that weissmann spoke with manifest irritation we should be able to see something  clarke shrugged his shoulders you can do as you wish the guides say their manifestations are antagonized by lightand that darkness is necessary for these special phenomena of the cone  oh we have no cone exclaimed mrs lambert  cone what cone asked weissmann  we need some sort of megaphone to enlarge the spiritvoices  make one of cardboard suggested viola any sort of horn will do  morton rose and took down a horn from the top of a bookcase here is the megaphone of my phonograph will it do  clarke examined it its rather heavy but i think they will use it place it on the table put a pad and pencil there also he added we may get some writing  anything else  nonow we are quite ready replied clarke in his exhibition voice it is well to touch hands for a timeuntil the psychic sinks into her trance  with your permission said morton to viola  a faint flush came into her face certainly professor and a touch of emphasis on his title had the effect of a slight a very slight rebuff  clarke turned the light down to a mere point of yellow fire and in the sudden gloom all were plunged into silence now whatever you do gentlemen dont startle the psychic after she goes into sleep  morton with his fingers resting lightly on violas soft hand experienced a keen pang of sympathetic pain she is so charming what profanation to develop the seamy side of her nature what pitiful tomfoolery she is in the lions mouth nowand yet how eagerly she seemed to desire it weissmann has made anything but the simplest ventriloquistic performance impossibleshe cannot lift a hand to save her from herself as well as from clarke it is necessary to expose her weakness as well as his trickery  she was saying in answer to a question no dr weissmann i have no control over the manifestations in fact the more anxious i am the longer we have to wait i cannot promise anything tonight  morton hearing this inwardly commented these obscure forms of hysteria often possess the cunning the dissimulation of madness poor girl she is beginning to realize her predicament and is preparing us for disappointment and a return of his doubt kept him silent  weissmann spoke shall we not sing somethingwe shall meet beyond the river or some ditty like that  thereat kate said doctor you betray astonishing familiarity with the ways of spooks  oh i know everything  i begin to believe it she retorted i begin to suspect that you are a secret adherent morton you would better tie dr weissmann otherwise he may speak from the cone himself  as if to counteract this banter clarke began a discourse on the leadings of the most recent discoveries  the xray is a mode of motion as light is a mode of motion but the waves of light move in such a way as to clash with and weaken those of the xray so we argue that the mode of motion through which disembodied souls manifest themselves being far subtler than the xray is neutralizedthough by no means destroyedby the motion called light furthermore there seems to be a reluctance on the part of the invisible ones to have the actual processes scrutinized i once laid a pencil on the table and asked for a visible action of writing vainly so long as it was completely exposed but upon being covered with a silk handkerchief it plainly rose and wrote it could be distinctly seen moving beneath the cloth sir william crookes had a similar experience except in his case he saw the pencil move prop itself against a ruler and try three times to writeall in the light i have seen letters form on an exposed surface of a slate i have had hands appear through a curtain and write in the light but the power must always be generated in shadow  kate shuddered woo it gives me the shivers to think of such things will anything as wonderful happen tonight  i cannot tellthe conditions are severe but i think we will have something viola he called softly  yes she answered faintly  would you like us to sing  noid rather youd all talk perhaps they will let me take part in the demonstration tonight they promised to do so you remember  weissman recounted some of the experiences zöllner had enjoyed in germany shortly after the fox sisters became so celebrated in america crookes and wallace and several others went into the whole question at that timethe world rang with the controversy but the clamor passed the phenomena passed it is like an epidemic it comes and it goes and in the end is humanity the wiser no  yes it is broke in clarke we are just that much more certain of the indestructible life of the soulevery wave of this spiritsea leaves a deposit of fact on the beach of time makes death that much less dreadful we make gains each decade sir william crookes sir oliver lodge alfred russel wallace lombroso have all been convinced of the reality of these phenomena surely such men must influence the thought of their time experimental psychology is on the right road  morton was suffering with the girl whose hand was beginning to tremble beneath his palm she no longer replied to his questions but that she was still awake he knew for he could hear her sighing deeply so deeply that the sound troubled him almost as if she were weeping his impulse was to rise and turn on the light and give over this trial which could only end in humiliating her her temerity is a part of her malady he argued it has arisen through years of misconceived petting and nursing on the part of her mother up to this moment her performances have always been in the presence of friends and relatives or for the consolation of those eager to believe and therefore easily deluded every sitter has conspired to practically force her into an elaborate series of deceptions each deceit being built upon and made necessary by the other it is pitiful but she now believes in herselfthat is pathetically certain otherwise she would not have yielded herself so completely into the hands of an inexorable investigator like weissmann she must take the consequences he ended with grim closing of the lips we must be cruel in order to be kind this night may be her salvation  weissmann was replying to mrs lambert i do not care for a return of my dead madam what i wish your daughter to do is quite simple i would like her to move a particle of matter from a to b without a known push or a pullthat is to say by a power not known to scienceas zöllner claimed slade was able to do for him  she can do it cried clarke she can move a chair from a to b without bringing to bear any of the known forces she can suspend the law of gravity she can make a closed piano play and she can read sealed letters in an ebony box tightly closed and locked  you claim too much my friend replied weissmann ironically we shall be satisfied with much less if she will change one onehundredth part of a grain from one scale to another under my conditions i will be satisfied the most wonderful phenomena taking place in the dark have no value to me  mrs lambert interposed please dont argueit prevents the coming of the spirits  both men felt rebuked and the group again settled into silence suddenly kate began to laugh isnt it childish really morton if our friends could see us sitting around here in the dark as we are now they would roar why should it all be so silly mr clarke  it is not silly if we take the right view we must sit together in order to get into harmony we further these conditions by sitting in subdued light with fingers touching song adds still more to this concert of thought nothing is really silly or prosaicall depends upon the minds of those  he was in the midst of an elaborate defence of spirit methods when violas hand began to leap as if struggling to be free she moaned and sighed and writhed so powerfully that her chair creaked oh dear oh dear she cried gaspingly  is she trying to free her hands morton asked himself with roused suspicion is this a ruse to cover some trick  mrs lambert spoke quietly she is going sing something anthony  clarke began to hum a monotonous tune while morton bending towards the girl listened to her gurgling moans with growing heartache she seems in great pain mrs lambert dont you think wed better release her i do not care to purchase sensation so clearly at her expense  dont be alarmed she always seems to suffer that way when some great manifestation is about to take place  the poor girls outcries so nearly resembled those of a death struggle that kate at last rose turn up that light she is being strangled  please be silent said clarke almost angrily take your hands from her gentlemen you are too strongand do not startle her be quiet everybody  morton took his hand away in anger and disgust all this is a ruse to weaken our grasp upon her he thought even the mother so serene so candid is aiding the deception  things will happen now remarked mrs lambert confidently she is giving herself up at last  the girl drew a long deep peaceful sigh and became silent so silent that morton leaning far over with suspended breath his ear almost to her lips could detect no sound no slightest movement and listening thus he had for an instant a singular vision of her he seemed to see her laughing silently at him from a distant upper corner of the room and for the moment secured a glimpse into a new and amazing worldthe world of darkness and silence wherein matter was fluid imponderable an insubstantial world peopled nevertheless with rustling busy souls  a sharp rapping began on the cone a measured beat which ended in a clang which startled kate into a shriek who is doing that she asked nervously  they are here clarke solemnly announced  is that you waltie asked mrs lambert sweetly  three raps loud and clear answered yes a drumming on the cone followed and mrs lambert her voice full of maternal pride remarked waltie is the life of our sittingshes such a rogue you must be a nice boy tonighton account of these very distinguished men  rap rap went the cone  does that mean all right  rap rap rap yes  is grandfather there  yes  does he wish to speak to the gentlemen  yes  are we sitting right  a decided thumpno  guided by the rapping mrs lambert and kate moved down to the foot of the table sitting close beside clarke thus leaving morton and weissmann alone with the sleeping girl no sooner were they rearranged than the table began to move precisely as though pushed by the girls feet still guided by the rapping weissmann and morton moved with the table but retained their threads of silk mortons pity had given place to a feeling of resentment at this device to get them farther away and he drew his telltale thread tight across his finger if she moves she is betrayed he thought with hardening heart  no sooner were they settled than a fumbling sound began in the middle of the table and the pencil was twice lifted and dropped following this the leaves of the writingpad rustled as though being thumbed by boyish hands  kate shivered and cried out this is uncanny morton are you doing this  certainly not he replied curtly  do you feel any motion in your thread asked weissmann in a quiet voice  none whatever morton replied  then the psychic is not moving  again they sat in silence and after some minutes the fumbling began again and the horn was heard scraping slowly about as if being lifted with effort only to fall back with a clang  is it too heavy asked clarke  three sharp raps repliedan angry yesand then with a petulant swing the instrument apparently left the table and floated upon the air in deep amazement morton listened for some movement some sound from viola but there was none not a breath not a rustle of motion where she sat and the silk thread was tight and calm she has nothing to do with that he said beneath his breath  kate called excitedly oh it touched me  what touched you asked weissmann  the horn  did it bump you  no it seemed to float against me  morton spoke out sharply where is mr clarke  right here on my right replied kate  what idiotic business he exclaimed mystified nevertheless  the horn dropped to the middle of the table but was immediately swept into the air again as if by a new and more vigorous hand and a voice heavily mixed with air but a mans voice unmistakably spoke directly to morton sternly contemptuously  we meet you on your own level you asked for material tests and now conditions being as you have made themproceed what would you have us do  who are you  i am donald mcleodgrandfather to the psychic  at this moment morton became seized of the most vivid realization of the physical characteristics of the man back of the voice in some mysterious way through some hitherto unknown sense he was aware of a long rugged face with bleak and knobby brow the lips were thin the mouth wide the darkgray eyes contemptuous it is all an inner delusion caused by some resemblance of this voice to that of some one i have known he said to himself but a shiver ran over him as he questioned the old man if you are the grandfather of the psychic he said i would like to ask you if you think it fair to a young girl to use her against her will for such foolery as this  the purposes are grand the work she is doing importanttherefore i answer yes she is yet but a child and the things she does of her own motion trivial and vain we make of her an instrument that will enable man to triumph over the grave you will observe that we do not harm her we take but little of her time after all you are unnecessarily alarmed our regard for her welfare far exceeds yours her troubles arise from her resistance if she would yield herself entirely she would be happy  as the voice paused morton asked weissmann can you hear what is being said to me  very indistinctly answered weissmann  what does it say asked kate i can only hear a kind of jumble  weissmann interjected i must ask you mrs rice have you tight hold of mr clarkes hand  yes answered kate  mortons brain whirled in confusion and conjecture he believed the whole thing to be a piece of juggling and yet he could not connect viola in any way with it and it seemed impossible also for mrs lambert to sit where she was and handle the cone to say nothing of the ventriloquistic skill necessary to carry on this conversation he again addressed the voice you consider your control of the psychic to be justified  we do  do you know also what perilous notoriety what positive disgracefrom every human point of viewyou are about to bring upon her  the hidden old man pondered a moment as if to master a profound contempt then answered we have taken all things into account when she has grown to years of sobriety she will thank us that we turned her aside from dancing and from light conversation and from all looseminded companions all the sane pleasures are now hers she is soon to be idolized by thousands her playing on the piano her singing are as the rustle of leaves in the forest compared to her mediumship which is as a trumpetblast opening the gates of the city of refuge to let the weary traveller in the voice weakened a little the earthlife is but a schoolthe real life is here besides when she has completely subordinated her will to ours when she has given our message the spirit grandsire seemed to falter and diminish my power is waning but i will again manifest we will try the voice stopped as though a door had been shut upon the speaker and the megaphone dropped upon the table  all that is very interesting commented weissmann but inconclusive is it all over  oh no answered mrs lambert they are uniting upon something wonderfuli feel it  as they listened the horn moved feebly uneasily rising a few inches only to fall as though some weak hand were struggling with it but at last it turned towards weissmann and from it issued the voice of a little girl thrillingly sweet and so clear that serviss could hear every word she addressed weissmann in german calling him father asking him to tell mother not to grieve that they would soon all be together in a bright land  to this weissmann replied in harsh accent you assert you are my daughter  the voice sweetly answered yes i am mina  but mina could not understand a word of englishhow is that  the little voice hesitated it is hard to explain she replied still in german i can understand you in any languagebut i can only speak as you taught me  thereupon he addressed her in french to which she replied easily but in her native tongue  as this curious dialogue went on serviss was searching vainly for an explanation mr clarke will you kindly speak at the same time that this voice appears  clarke began a discourse and the two voices went on at the same time the young scientist then said mrs lambert will you permit kate to lay her hand over your lips you understand it is for the sake of science  certainly said mrs lambert  here the test failed of completeness it was so difficult to get the three voices precisely together but at last it seemed that the childs voice was produced at the same time that clarke spoke and while kates hand covered the mothers mouth  thereupon the little voice said farewell and all was silent for a few moments the cone rose again into the air and a soft sibilant voice addressed mrs lambert  oh she cried joyfully it is robertyes dear im listening im so glad youve come cant you talk with professor servisshe says he will try she said to the company  as morton waited the cone gently touched him on the shoulder and a moment later a mans voice utterly different from the first one and of most refined accent half spoke half whispered we are glad to meet you professor i am deeply gratified by your interest in our dear girl  who are you he asked moved in spite of himself by a liking for this new personality so distinct from the others  i am rm waldronviolas father  he seemed to wait for questions and serviss asked how do you feel about your daughters mediumship are you not uneasy when you think of what you are demanding of her  the invisible one sighed hesitated and replied with evident sadness it troubles me to find her reluctant i wish she were happier in the work it seems so important to us then the voice brightened but perhaps it is only for a little while after the public testafter the truth of her mediumship is made manifesti think i hope we will ask less of her perhaps it will be possible to release her altogether for a time but for the present she is too valuable the sentence was lost in a buzz of inarticulate whispering as if two or three friends were consulting the opening and closing of lips could be heard and a stir within the horn was curiously trivial in effect as if a mouse were at play with a dry leaf  if i were to organize a committee of men like weissmann and tolman and other men of international fame willing to test your daughters powers will you give over this public demonstrationthis publishing of a challenge  clarke interrupted almost angrily not unless you promise to  be silent commanded weissmann  from the horn came a faint murmur so dim so far serviss could with difficulty distinguish the words we will consider that i am going guard my girl goodbye  the horn again seemed to rest and for a long time no sound or stir broke the silence till at last viola began to writhe in her chair in greater agony than before  i think she is waking said morton  mrs lambert answered quickly no some great event is preparingwhen this paroxysm passes some very beautiful test will come  while morton and weissmann were considering this the girl again became silent as a stone and a moment later a clear sweet sound pulsed through the air as if an exquisite crystal bell had been struck then while still this signal trembled in his ear a whispering noise developed just before the young mans face as if tremulous lips were closing and unclosing in anxious effort to communicate a message without the use of the trumpet  is some one trying to speak to me he asked gently  three measured strokes upon the tiny bell replied and with their pulsations the room seemed to stir with a new and different throng of winged memories the very air took on mystery and beauty and a sweet gravity matter was for the moment as subtle as imponderable as soul  who is it he asked and into his voice in spite of himself crept a note of awe  the answer came instantly faint as the fall of an autumn leaf on the grass  mother  kate bent eagerly forward who was it morton  ignoring her question morton addressed the invisible one cant you speak again  there was no reply and the whispering ceased almost instantly the horn seemed grasped by a firm and masterful hand and the rollicking voice of a man broke startlingly from the darkness in words so clear so resonant that all could hear them  hello folks is this a quaker meeting  who are you asked morton  cant you guess  kate gasped why its uncle ben roberts  the voice chuckled right the first time its old loggytrue bill how are you all  kate could hardly speak so great was her fear and joy morton serviss what do you think now ask him  the voice from the trumpet interposed dont ask me a word about conditions over hereits no use i cant tell you a thing  why not asked morton  well how would you describe a connecticut winter to a hottentot not that youre a hottentotthe voice broke into an oily chuckleor that im in a cold climate the chuckle was renewed im very comfortable thank you here the invisible one grew tender my boy your mother is here and wants to speak to you but cant do so she asked me to manifest for her she says to trust this girl and to carry a message of love to henry i brought one of her colonial wineglasses with meas a sign of her presence and as a test of the power we have of passing through matter  for nearly an hour this voice kept up a perfectly normal conversation with a running fire of quips and cranksrecalling incidents in the lives of both kate and morton arguing basic principles with weissmann yet never quite replying to the most searching questions and finally ended by saying your conception of matter is childish there is no such thing as you understand it and yet the universe is not as kant conceived it as liberated spirits we move in an essence subtler than any matter known to youether is a gross thing compared to spirit your knowledge is merely rudimentarybut keep on take up this work and my band will meet you halfway my boy the question of the persistence of the individual after death is the most vital of all questions apply your keen mind to it and depend on old loggy goodby  kate was quivering with excitement morton that settles it for me that certainly was loggy oh i wish mother could have spoken  mortons voice was eager and penetrating as he said mrs lambert i would like to place my hand on your daughters arm again i must be permitted to demonstrate conclusively that she has had nothing to do with the handling of the horn  i will ask the guides father can professor serviss  three feeble raps anticipated her question  they say yesbut they are very doubtfulso please be very gentle  serviss rose his blood astir at last he was about to remove his doubtor prove violas guilt doctor he said and his voice was incisive take the other side and place a hand on her wrist that will be permitted he asked  three raps very slow and soft assented  clarke interposed i am impressed gentlemen to say let each of you put one hand on the psychics head the other on her arm  we will do so replied weissmann cheerfully  with a full realization of the value of this supreme test of violas honor morton laid his right hand lightly on her wrist at the first contact she started as though his fingers had been hot iron and he was unpleasantly aware that her flesh had grown cold and inert he spoke of this to weissmann who replied is that so the hand which i clasp is hot and dry which is a singular symptom then to the others i am now holding both her hands one is very hot the other cold and damp and i feel no pulse  she is always so mrs lambert explained she seems to die for the time being  that is very strange muttered weissmann may i listen for her heartbeat three raps assented and a moment later he said with increased excitement i cannot detect her heartbeat  clarke reassured him do not be alarmed she is not dead proceed with your experiment there was a distinct note of contempt in his voice  as morton laid his hand upon the soft coils of her hair viola again moved slightly as a sleeper stirs beneath a caress disturbed yet not distressedto settle instantly into deeper dream  we are ready called weissmann whatever happens now miss lambert is not the cause take mr clarkes hands in yours  mrs lamberts also added morton  our hands are all touching answered kate  now let us see cried weissmann and his voice rang triumphantly now spirits to your work  clarke laughed contemptuously you scientists are very amusing your unbelief is heroic  as they stood thus a powerful revulsion took place in mortons mind and with a painful constriction in his throat he bowed to the silent girl and with an inconsistency which he would not have published to the world he prayed that something might happennot to demonstrate the return of the dead but to prove her innocence  as he waited the pencil began to tap on the table and with its stir his nerves took fire a leaf of paper flew by brushing his face like the wing of a bird a hand clutched his shoulder then as if to make every explanation of no avail the room filled with fairy unseen folk books began to hurtle through the air and to fall upon the table a banjo on the wall was strummed the entire library seemed crowded with tricksy pucks a bustling irresponsible elfish crew each on some inconsequential action bent until as if at a signal the megaphone tumbled to the floor with a clang and all was stilla silence deathly deep as if a bevy of sprites frightened from their play had whirled upward and away leaving the scene of their revels empty desolate and forlorn  that is all said clarke  how can you tell asked kate her voice faint and shrill with awe  the fall of the horn to the floor is a sure sign of the end you may turn up the gas but very slowly  stunned by the significance the farreaching implications of his experiment morton remained standing while weissmann turned on the light  pale in deep placid sleep viola sat precisely as they had left her bound helpless and exonerated she recalled to mortons mind a picture in his schoolbooks of a martyrmaiden who was depicted chained to the altar of some hideous heathen deity a monster who devoured the flesh of virgins and demanded with pitiless lust the fairest of the race  of her innocence he was at that moment profoundly convinced     xiv  puzzled philosophers   while he still stood looking down upon her viola began to moan and toss her head from side to side  she is waking cried mrs lambert let me go to her  no commanded weissmann disturb nothing till we have examined all things  make your studies quickly said morton his heart tender to the girls sufferings we must release her as soon as possible  weissmann was not to be hastened if we do not now go slowly we lose much of what we are trying to attain we must take her pulse and temperature and observe the position of every object  quite right agreed clarke do not be troubledthe psychic is being cared for  thus reassured the two investigators scrutinized measured made notes while kate and mrs lambert stood waiting watching with anxious eyes the changes which came to violas face weissmann talked on in a disjointed mutter you see she has no pulse the threads are unbroken the table is thirty inches from her fingertips observe this pad fortyeight inches from her handand which contains a message  read it demanded kate  he complied you ask for a particle of matter to be moved from a to b without the use of any force known to science here in this wineglass is the test oh men of science how long will you close your eyes to the grander truths  that is from father remarked mrs lambert  it is signed mcleod and under it are two words loggy and mother each in different handwriting  give it to me cried kate deeply moved  and here is the wineglass replied weissmann extracting from among the books a beautiful piece of antique crystal  kate took it reverentially as if receiving it from the hand of her dead mother how came that here  you recognize it it was not left here by mistake  oh no there are only four of them left and i keep them locked away i have not had them out in months  clarke smiled in benign triumph that is why they brought itto show you that matter is an illusion and to prove that dematerialization and transubstantiation are facts that was the bell we heard  morton what do you think how could  but morton was bending above viola and did not heed his sister the girls eyes were opening as from natural slumber and he said gently i hope you are not in pain we will release you in a moment     illustration the girls eyes were opening as from natural    slumber  she smiled faintly as she recognized him my arms are numb and my feet feel as if strips of wood were nailed to my soles she answered wearily and my head is aching dreadfully but that will soon pass  she always complains of her feet the mother explained she cant walk for quite a little while afterwards  you poor thing exclaimed kate you are a martyrthats what you are  viola looked up with sweet and anxious glance did anything happen did your friends come to you mrs rice  no but several voices spoke to morton  im sorry no one came to you ive been a long way off this time she continued with dreamy inward glance into a beautiful country from which i hated to return i wouldnt have come back to you at all only a thread of light tied my soul to my body and drew me down to earth in spite of myself  what was it likethat far country asked morton  she pondered sleepily i cant tell youonly it was very beautiful and i was happy every one lived in the light with nothing to fear i had no memory of the earthonly of my body which i was sorry for there was no death no cold no darkness up there i was very happy and free  you should be free and happy here answered morton gravely come doctor cant we free her now  yes you may do so he replied still busy with his notebook  the young host with a feeling of having been unnecessarily brutal ripped the tape loose from the floor and kate slipped the loops from violas ankles then leaning on her hostesss arm she rose slowly smiling brightly her weakness most appealing i hope a great deal happenedit means so much to me i want to talk but i cant now my head is too thick you must tell me all about it pretty soon  a great deal happenedyou are quite clear of any connection with it  her face lit with placid joy oh im so glad it must be very late she added turning to her mother  yes and we must be going responded mrs lambert nervously mr pratt will be impatient  i wish youd stay with me tonight pleaded kate it was all so wonderful i cant let you go please stay both of you youre too tired to go out into the raw air  oh no we cant do thatnot tonight viola answered decisively  morton threw back the doors kate take miss lambert into the diningroom and give her something to drink she is quite exhausted let me steady you he said tenderly touching her arm you fairly reel with weakness  i will be as well as ever as soon as my blood begins to circulate she bravely answered and his touch quickened her pulse miraculously  as soon as weissmann had finished taking his notes and measurements he locked the door of the library and joined them all in the diningroom where they were sipping coffee and nibbling cake morton was sitting beside viola who had entirely regained her girlish lightness of mood and was chafing her cold hand in the effort to restore the circulation as well as to remove the deep mark the silken thread had made about her wrist  we shall be obliged to shut out all young men from our committee the old scientist jocularly remarked as he stood looking down at them lovely psychics like you would put the whole american academy of science in disorder  clarke raging with jealous fire turned to weissmann in truculent mood well dr weissmann how do you account for these phenomena to whose agency do you ascribe these marvels  spooks answered the old man with cheerful promptness  clarke reeled before this laconic admission what you agree you admit the agency of spirits  certainlyunless i say miss lambert wriggled herself out of her skin which would not be nice of me or that you are the greatest ventriloquist in the world no i prefer to compliment the spirits  clarkes face darkened the old mans face and voice were too jocose i see you do not value our wonderful experiences tonight  viola pinching her sleeve about her wrist looked up roguishly i couldnt possibly wriggle out of my gown could i dr weissmann and if i did how could i get the tacks back without a hammer  precisely you would be more burglarious than the ghosts which walk through the keyholes he answered  and the little girl who spoke germanwho was she asked kate  the hour that followed was a delicious one for the young people for they had come at last to some sweet and subtle understanding as she recovered the use of her limbs viola glowed with joy of mortons change of attitude towards her he on his part was puzzled by this mood it was as if she had been vindicated to herselfliberated from some dead body of doubt  clarke glowered in silence disapproving with manifest disdain the levity of the scientists and resenting bitterly violas growing trust and confidence in serviss each moment his anger took on heat and he found it hard to reply even to his hostess who tried to interest him in a deeper discussion of the evenings marvels he seemed to have but one desireto get away and to take viola with him  tell me said viola to morton did papa speak to you  a voice purporting to be your father spoke a few words  he is very nice didnt you think so  the voice was very gentle and refined and expressed a very tender regard for you  she sighed i have never heard my fathers voice for he always comes when i am in my deepest trances they say that i will be permitted some day to hear all the voices through the conei only hear them now in an interior way  do you really suffer as you seem to do he asked the echo of his pity still in his tone  not after i am really gone did i groan  horribly my heart was filled with remorse  im sorry it doesnt really hurt mephysically you see i am perfectly well again and yet i hate more and more to give myself up i cant explain it but i seem to be losing more and more of myselfthat is the thought that scares me i hate to think of being so helpless it seems to me as if i were becoming likelike a hotel pianofor any one to strum oni mean that any one in the other worldit is so crowded over there you know her brows drew together in momentary disgust  i dont know but it must be so if all the myriads of past humanity are living there if i had my way you would never sit again he declared most fervently  i wouldnt mind so much she went on if i were not marked out for suspicionif people would only talk to me of nice earthly things part of the time as they would to any other girlbut they never do everybody wants to talk to me about death and spirits  thats what gives edge to my remorse he interrupted here am i doing the very things you abhor to think that we who have made such a protest against your slavery could not allow you one free evening i will not say another word on these uncanny subjects  but i want to talk of them to you i wanted to tell you all about myself that day we rode up to the minebut i could not  i wish you had it might have made a great deal of difference in your lifeand mine i have been thinking of that ride tonight as we sat in the darkness if i could i would keep you as girlish as gay as you were that day this business is all a desecration to me i love to think of you as you were thenwhen you laughed back at me in the rain i wish we were both there this minute  she smiled you forget the time of night her face grew wistful ive been getting homesick for the mountains latelyand yet i like it here i love this beautiful room i adore your sister i know i could have a delightful time if only my guides werent so anxious to have me convert the world  i grow more and more consciencesmitten he exclaimed to think we should be the ones to tie and torture you and at our first dinnerparty  please dont blame yourself it was not your fault grandfather insisted on talking with you and ii wished it very much her face grew radiant with pleasure oh im so glad you made it a testsittingi want you to believe in me i mean that i dont deceive  i am sure of that  there are so many things i want to talk with you aboutbut not nowit is late  clarke who had grown too restless to remain seated interrupted a story which kate was relating and rose saying harshly it is time for us to be going pratt will lock us out if we dont  the cloud again fell on violas faceher little hour of freedom from her keeper was over morton felt the change in her and so did kate who fairly pleaded with the mother to remain it is late and you are tired and after this wonderful evening you ought not to go back to that gloomy place  mrs lambert looked at clarke whose reply was stern no we must return  something very sweet and intimate was in mortons voice as he found opportunity to say to viola i dont like to think of you returning to that gilded mausoleum it is a most unwholesome place for you you are too closely surrounded with morbid influences  i know it i dread to go backi admit that i suppose mr pratt is a good man i know he does a great deal for the faith and he is very generous to us but oh he is so vulgar so impertinent he bores me nearly frantic by being always at my elbow i shudder when he touches me as if he were some sort of evil animal mother cant realize how he annoys and depresses me and anthony insists that we must endure it  i wish youd stay here he exclaimed impulsively accept my sisters invitationit would give us such an opportunity to talk of this sitting come let me send for your trunks  she shrank a little from his eager eyes and mrs lambert again interposed it is quite impossible professor perhaps some other time  viola yielded to her mother and went away to get her cloak and morton turned to clarke one of the conditions of my promise to organize a committee is this you and pratt must be excluded from the circle  weissmann echoed this quite right that we demand  the clergymans face hardened you ask the impossible it is necessary for me to be present at each sitting i have the right to be there as the historian of the case furthermore i add to the strength of the manifestationsthat i have fully demonstrated  i appreciate your position but in order to avoid criticism to make the tests perfect it will be necessary to hold the sittings either here or at weissmanns and to exclude every one connected with miss lambert in no other way can we convince ourselves or the public  clarkes face was darkly stubborn then you will have no sittings my challenge will go forth next sunday afternoon and one of the unchangeable clauses of that challenge will be this the sittings must take place in pratts library and i must be present  i hope you will not insist on that morton further urged for miss lamberts sake you must not to incorporate such terms in your challenge will brand her as an impostor and you and pratt as her confederates in this statement i think you will find her controls agreeing they were undecided tonight but when they consider carefully they will see that my advice is sound  clarkes eyes were aflame you have my terms accept them or refuse them as you please  viola returning extended her hand to morton with a trustful smile ive had a beautiful evening  to say that after we have tied you hand and foot till you were numb and kept you in the dark all the evening is very gracious of you i feel very much the brutal host but you must come again i swear kate shall not pester you next time  kate was indignant well i like that when you were the one crazy to experiment of course theyre coming coming to stay tomorrow night and any one who dares to talk ghosts to her will be sent to bed  and so in a hearty cordial clangor of farewells they got out into the hall and morton seeing viola in her handsome cloak her eyes shining her face once more gay and smiling was again filled with wonder at her astounding resiliency of mood it was as if two sharply differentiated souls alternated in the possession of her body  clarke wearing a cape overcoat and a soft hat was far less admirable in appearance than when with head uncovered he sat within he resembled a comic picture of an oldfashioned tragediana man glad to feel the finger of remark directed towards him but his face was bitter his eyes burning with anger his lips white with pain  serviss relented as he studied him youd better take britts trail and return to the mountains he said kindly this is a bad climate for you  my work is here he replied curtly i have no fear and so they parted  weissmann was sitting in silent meditation in one corner of the diningroom when serviss returned well master what do you think of tonights performance  weissmann replied in ironical phrase hearing in civilized man is vague and indefinite spooks do well to limit their manifestations to a sense which most powerfully appeals to the imagination  morton spoke with great earnestness weissmann that girl could not move a limb she positively remained where we put her so far as i am concerned tonights test eliminated her from the slightest complicity and i confess it rejoices me greatly but who was responsible for the prestidigitation  weissmann replied slowly it is very puzzling and fell into a muse which lasted for several minutes at last he roused to say well we will see next time clarke and the mother must be eliminated  you dont think evil of her exclaimed morton  she is very anxious you know  kate put in her word its all very simple she said the spirits did it you neednt tell me that clarke or mrs lambert got up and skittered around the room doing those things i held their handsand know they didnt get away besides how did that glass come there and how could they make those voices sound so natural what is the use of being stupidly stubborn if you treat viola fairly she will confound your science  you base all this on one imperfect test  i dont know what youd call a perfect one anyhow that child is absolutely honest  i hope you are right kate but there are some serious discrepancieseven in tonights performances nothing took place which i could not do sitting in her chair with my hands free  but her hands werent free if there is any virtue in cotton fibre or steel she remained precisely where we set her at the beginning  but to admit that one book was moved from its place is to admit that a force exists unknown to science  but what are you going to do did you do it or did i did clarke reach from where he sat and manipulate the horn who brought the old wineglass from the chinacloset no one entered from the outsidethat is certain and then the things loggy said  what do you think dr weissmann  weissmann looked up abstractedly if clarke performed these feats tonight he is wasting his time in any profession but jugglery you said the cone touched you he asked of morton  several times  to do that he must have left his seat  i am perfectly sure he did not replied kate firmly  morton insisted he must have done so katethere is no other explanation of what took place it was very dark and the rug soft there is another important pointall of the books came from within a radius of a few feet of the psychic so that if she were able to rise and free her hands  which she did not do answered weissmann she remained precisely where we put her but we should have nailed clarke to the floor also  how about the child who spoke german asked kate was she  weissmann replied slowly with a little effort i had a little girl of the name mina who died at eight years of age  kates voice expressed sympathy i didnt know that she must have been a dear the voice was very sweet i could almost touch the little thing  i do not see how clarke or any one here knew of my daughter or her name clarke may be a mindreader the voice did not prove itself  neither was loggy quite convincing said morton and yet i cannot understand how those voices were produced our imaginations must have been made enormously active by the dark as scientists we cannot admit the slightest of those movements without the fall of some of our most deeply grounded dogmas what becomes of haeckels dictumthat matter and spirit are inseparable  there is matter and matter replied weissmann to say that spirit and flesh is inseparable is to claim too much we can say that we have no proof of such separation but crookes and others claim the contrary it is curious to observe that we tonight have trenched on the very ground crookes trod i am very eager now to sit with this girlthe mother and clarke being excluded  of one thing i am more than half persuaded and that is that clarke is a mindreader for how else could he know the things which the supposed ghost of my uncle recounted  it is very puzzling repeated weissmann deepsunk in speculation and in this abstraction he took himself silently away  kate with an air of saying now that we are alone lets know your real mind faced her brother with eyes of wonder morton what do you honestly think of it viola had nothing to do with it did she  no but are you absolutely sure clarke did not get loose and do things  mort i was never more alert in my life and i know he didnt move out of his chair  but think what it involves  i dont care what it involves so far as the senses of touch and hearing go clarke remained seated every minute of the time and i certainly held both his and mrs lamberts hands the whole time while the books were being thrown  well there you are somebody did it he shrugged his shoulders in an unwonted irritation  why not say the spirits did it all  because that is unthinkable  sir william crookes and dr zöllner you say believed in these disembodied intelligences  yes but they belong to what haeckel calls the imaginative scientists  you neednt quote haeckel to me morton if i believed what he preaches i would take myself and my children out of the world i dont see how a man can look a child in the face and say such things i cant read any of your scientific friends straight along their jargon is worse than anything but i pick out enough to know that they dont believe in anything they cant see and they wont go out of their way to see things do you suppose im going to believe that robbie is nothing but a little animal and that if he should die his soul would disappear like a vapor  i can only repeat that the converse is unthinkable there is no room in my philosophy for the reentrance of the dead  why not its all very simple were creatures of our surroundings arent we now sitting there in the dark tonight it seemed to me that the people we think of as dead were all about me it scared me at first but really isnt it the most comforting faith in the world ive always liked the idea of the indians happy huntinggroundsand this is something like it  he smiled shrewdly that performance tonight and this conversation would make a pretty story to lay before the president of corlearnow wouldnt it  how do you suppose he will take your going into this investigation  i dont know but i think hell fire me instanter  well let him try it he wouldnt dare  oh yes he would if he thought i was hurting the institution see what they did to poor little combes who mildly claimed to be able to hypnotize people  yes but he made himself ridiculous in the papers  you mean the papers made him ridiculous couldnt they do the same with weissmann and me think of a big sprawling sketchy drawing in the blast with weissmann glaring at a strangely beautiful young lady in scanty gownhis hands spread like claws upon the table while another younger man myself catches at a horn floating overhead oh yes there are great possibilities in tonights entertainment may i ask you mrs rice to be more than usually circumspect  you may dr serviss  he rose gravely very good now i think you would better go to bed  i wish your mr lambert would come  so do i im afraid he is going to ignore my summons unless i hear from him tomorrow i shall consider him craven or indifferent  what will you do then  his brows contracted into a frown i dont know she should be freed from clarkes immediate influence but i dont see how i can interfere  i cant believe that she really cares for him in fact from things she said tonight i think she fears him he was furiously jealous of you i could see that and i must say you gave him cause  he turned and looked at her in affected amazement where are you heading now  she laughed where are you drifting my boy i never saw any one more absorbed and i cant say i blame you she was lovely goodnight and so she left him  sitting thus alone in the deep of the night the flush of his joy at the proof of violas innocence grew gray and cold in a profound disbelief in the reality of his experiences did anything really happen he asked himself returning to the library with intent to study the situation he mused long upon the tumbled books the horn the tables and the chairs he put himself in violas seat in the attempt to conceive of some method whereby even the most skilful magician would be able to pull out tacks rip stitches and break tapeand thenmore difficult than all after manipulating the horn reseat himself and restore his bonds every tack to its precise place and his conversation with loggy most amazing of all came back to plague him what could explain that marvellous simulation of his uncles chuckling laugh  yes viola was clearly innocent it was impossible for her to have lifted a hand that he decided upon finallyand yet it was almost as difficult for clarke or mrs lambert to have performed all the tricks unless katehe brought himself up shortin the end my own sister is involved in the imposture he exclaimed with a sense of bewilderment  when he dwelt on violas delight in her own vindication and remembered her serene sweet trustful glance a shiver of awe went over him and the work of saving her of healing her seemed greater than the discovery of any new principle but whenever his keen definite analytic mind took up the hitormiss absurd caperings of the spirits he paced the floor in revolt of their childish chicanery that the soul survived death he could not for an instant entertain every principle of biology every fibre woven into his system of philosophy repelled the thought to grant one single claim of the spiritists was disaster no the mother and clarke are in league and when the bonds are on one the other acts i see no other explanation i distrust clarke utterlybut the mother is apparently very gentle and candid and yetweissmann may be right maternal love is a very powerful emotion that second voice was like hers and yet and yet to suspect that gentle soul of deliberate deception is a terrible thing what a world of vulgarity and disease and suspicion it all is an accursed world and the history of every medium is filled with these same insane foolish absurd doings  and so he trod in weary circles returning always to the same point with an almost audible groan why why was that charming girl involved in all this uncanny hellish destructive business clarke claims her on him her fate depends perhaps at this moment her name and hideous reproductions of her face are being printed in all the sensational papers of the city oh that crazy preacher it may be that he has already made her rescue impossible and always the dark disturbing thought came at the end to trouble him can she ever regain a normal relation with the worldeven if i should interfere she should have been freed from this traffic long ago can the science of suggestion reach her am i already too late  the conception that sank deepest and remained most abhorrent in his musings was that conveyed in her own tragic words it seems to me i am becoming more and more like a public piano an instrument on which any one can strumand the other world is so crowded you know  if there is any manhood left in lambert he must assert it or i will throttle clarke myself he muttered through clinched teeth i ran away two years agoi evaded my duty yesterday but i do not intend to do so now i will not sit by and see that sweet girls will her very reason overthrown by a fanatic preacher eager for notoriety i will see her again and demand to know from her own lips whether she is in consent to be his wife i cannot believe it till she tells me so and then i can decide as to future action  and at the moment he was comforted by the recollection of something timidly confiding in her parting smile     xv  viola revolts from clarke   no sooner were they seated in their carriage than clarke broke forth in harsh protest you must not think of leaving pratts house at this time  why not asked viola roused by the tone of his voice which was even less considerate than his words  because it will displease himmay possibly alienate him just at a moment when we need him most he will not consent to be shut out from these testsittings on the contrary he is likely to insist on their taking place in his own library furthermore i dont see why you are in haste to leave so sumptuous an abode  because i hate him and all connected with him her voice was colored with a fierce disgust that is the reason and reason enough  you must not let him know that  i dont care if he knows it or not we are not dependent on him or his house  yes we are he is most important to all of us until our tests are over and my book in type i need his indorsement besides he is very bitter and vindictive with those whom he thinks should be very grateful and we must not anger him we cant afford it  mrs lambert mildly protested im sure mr pratt will not think of detaining us if father thinks it best for us to go and i confess i am anxious to get away myself tony he has been very disagreeable lately  clarke went on we must continue to let him think his advice and aid invaluable till our book is out then we can cut loose from him our policy  rebellion was in violas heart as she cuttingly interrupted you speak as if we were in league to cheat him of something you have always told me that my powers were dedicated to the good of the world but lately you talk as if they were dedicated to your personal advancement in some way now which do you really mean  he saw his mistake once or twice before he had met her complete opposition and he feared it his voice suppled became persuasive i mean viola that in entering upon a great contestone whose issue is to electrify the civilized world  i dont believe it what does the world care about a little speck of humanity like me professor serviss is nearer right when he says that converting people to any creed is a thankless task ask grandfather to let me live my own life he listens to you tell him im tired and  he has promised to be easier on you after we have won our battle  but i dread the battleoh how i dread it professor serviss says we will lose  clarke broke in sharply please dont quote what serviss says his view is that of the worldly wise materialist you should listen to my advicenot his  you said you were anxious to have him on the committee  yes because i thought his name would count and that he could bring weissmannbut now i distrust him he is too bigoted  as he continued in this strain he stood in dark contrast to morton and the girl could not but wince under the revelation he was unconsciously making anthony you have talked in that strain ever since we came east nothing but using people using people all the time youve been constantly running after those who could be of use to us and i dont like it every word youre saying now makes me doubt your sincerity i was ashamed of you tonighti am ashamed of you now how can i respect you when you say things like that  he again tacked i do it all for the furtherance of our faith to do our work we must have authority it is always necessary to make a big stir in the world in order to do goodthink of christ defying the moneychangers and making a scene in the temple  she pursued her way its the tone of your voice that scares me youre a different person since we came hereyouve been harsh and cruel to me her voice choked and yielding to a flood of doubt she cried out ive lost faith in you this ends it all i will never marry you i dont care what my guides say i darent trust myself to younow thats the truth  the mother was aghast why viola lambert what a terrible thing to say  i cant help it motherthat is my decision  clarke blundered a third time i wont release you this mood is all the influence of those accursed pagans we have just left that man serviss has been an evil influence upon you from the very first he has no god in his heart you must keep away from that homeit is destructive  it is not she retorted fiercely it is beautiful and honest andsane and im going there as often as they will let meand im going to leave the pratt house tomorrow i will not stay there another day  there are others to be consulted about this he grimly answered you have tried playing truant before  she was now in full tide of revolt i am going to leave that house if i fall dead in the streets i am going if they choke me black in the face  he sneered i know where you are going  at this moment she hated him and everything he stood for and her voice was hoarse with her passion i dont care what you say or what you do i will not be hounded and driven around like a slave by you or simeon pratt any longer im going to have a little life of my own if they tear me in pieces for it  this outburst so much more intense than any which had preceded it alarmed clarke and appalled mrs lambert who took her daughter in her arm with soothing words and caresses there there dearie dont worrydont excite yourself father will not insist on your doing anything that will be harmful he will protect you  the girl sobbing in reaction bowed to the maternal bosom feeling once more her own helplessness receiving no help from her mothers sympathy which was merely superficial her only hope of release lay in the strong bright selfreliant humorous people she had just left those to whom her grandfather and his band were less than shadows they alone could save her from the despairing madness which she felt creeping upon her like a beast in the night her nerves strung to dangerous tension gave away utterly and clarke realizing this ceased to chide and the ride ended without another word  pratt who had been waiting for hours with the angry impatience of senility met them at the door truculent as a terrier what time o night do you call this he asked with insulting inflection  mrs lambert answered im very sorry but we had a sitting and it took longer  a sitting he faced viola what did you do that for i told you i didnt want any sittings given unless i was present and you promised not to give any  i did not she replied lifting a tearstained but imperious face to him  well clarke did  clarke hastily interposed the chief control asked for itsaid he wanted to talk to some of those present  i dont care what the chief control said  viola thoroughly roused now faced him pale and scornful what right have you to ask where ive been or what ive done i am not your servantnor one of your poor relatives you seem to forget that i will not be your guest another day id leave this house this instant if i could i came here against my wish and i will not be insulted by you any longer i wish i had never seen you and with haughty step she started to pass him  he put out a hand to stay her hold on now  with flashing eyes and a voice that smote him like a whip she cried out leave me alone please he fell back against the wall and she passed on and up the stairway leaving him leaning there in dismay his jaw lax  the mother hastily followed and as the door closed behind them viola turned with blazing eyes this is horribledisgraceful i hope you enjoy being treated like that how can you endure it how can you ask me to endure it if anthony clarke possessed one shred of real manhoodbut he hasnt hes so selfishly bent on his own plans hes willing to let me suffer anything im done with him mother you neednt try to find excuse for him i dont see how i endured him so long he must never touch me again  dont do anything rash child  will you submit to more insult you can stay on till you are ordered out of the house if you like but i will not  but you know they advise it  the girl turned a new tone in her voice there now mother we come back to that again im tired of hearing that if they insist on our staying here i will be sure they are the voices of devils and not those they claim to be i dont believe my father would ask me to stay in a house where the very servants sniff at us i dont believe he would let anthony make use of me in this way professor serviss calls our faith a delusion and tonight i almost hope hes right i have lost the spirit of the martyr and everything seems foolish to me  mrs lambert regarded her daughter with horror child some earthbound spirit has surely taken possession of you  i hope it will stay till tomorrowtill i get out of this house she replied and went to her own room without a goodnight kiss leaving her mother hurt and dismayed  a few moments later clarke knocked at the sittingroom door julia here is a message i want you to give to viola  as she opened to him he faced her pale and tremulous all his anger all his resolution gone she was unjust to me he said humbly take her this he extended a folded leaf of paper in a hand that partook of the pallor of his face  you poor boy she exclaimed her heart wrung by his suffering you mustnt mind what she saidit was only a girlish pet  mother he cried passionately to lose her now would kill me she is my hope my stay my god she has stabbed me to the heart tonight did she mean it she cant mean it  she patted him on the shoulder go to bed laddie its only a mood she will be all sunshine tomorrow its only a reaction from a wearisome daybe patient and dont worry  she tortured me deliberately he went on wildly she let that man take her hand she smiled at him in a way that set my brain on fire i tried to be calm i didnt intend to speak harshly but i wanted to kill him when he said goodnight to her may god eternally damn his soul if he tries to steal her from me  she recoiled from his fury tony what are you saying  i mean it do you think i will submit to his treachery i told him she was mine and yet he took her handhe leaned to herhe looked into her face his eyes blazed with such wild light that the gentle woman shrank and shivered  tony you are letting your imagination run away with you go to bed this instant she commanded in a voice that trembled  he went away at last weeping miserably maudlin almost incoherent and when she closed and locked the door upon him she dropped into a chair and for the first time since her husbands death gave way to tears of bewilderment and despair     xvi  the house of discord   surely simeons house that night was a place of tormenting and tumultthe meetingplace of spirits whose dispositions were to evil fully inclined and of mortals whose natures were upon the edge of combat viola in full revolt would not even permit her mother to come to her clarke in an agony of love and hate paced his room or sat in dejected heap before his grate mrs lambert realizing that something sorrowful was advancing upon her lay awake a long time hoping her daughter would relent and steal in to kiss her goodnight but she did not and at last the waters of sleep rolled in to submerge and carry away her cares  viola made restless by her disgust of pratt as well as by her loss of respect and confidence in clarke did not lose herself till nearly dawn her mind was at first busy with the past filled with a procession of the many things he had done to enrich her life she was troubled by the remembrance of the grave sad courtesy of his intercourse in the days just following his wifes death at that time his kindly supervision of her music and his suggestions for her reading had given him dignity and romantic charm he was nice then she said to herself if only he had stopped there when he fell at her feet in the attempt to rouse her pity he had been degraded in her eyes his whole manner towards her became that of suppliantbeseeching the guides to sanction their ultimate union she burned with shame as she thought of her tacit acquiescence in this arrangement you have no right to interfere with mywith such things she now said to the invisible ones i do not love anthony clarke i dont even respect him any longer  he had indeed become almost as offensive to her as pratt and the picturesque soulful presence which he affected was at the moment repugnant in contrast to the young scientist he was mentally and morally sick and the world which he inhabited and which she shared with him hopelessly askew of this she had a clear perception as her mind recalled and dwelt upon the taste the comfort the orderly cheer of the serviss home  we never made the spiritworld so awful mamma did not take such an excited view of it all what has produced this change in us tony has he has carried us out into a nasty world and he has set us among frauds and fanatics and i will not suffer it any longer  she did him an injustice but she was at the same time right mrs lambert left to herself would have kept a serene mind no matter what the manifestations might be with her the world of spirit interpenetrated the world of everyday life and the one was quite as natural as the other and of helpful cheering effect she had remained quite as normal in her ways of thought as when in colorow and aside from her dependence upon the spiritworld for guidance would not have seemed at any point to be akin to either fraud or fanatic  at last the girls restless mind cleared of its anger its doubts and its doles came back to rest upon the handsome humorous refined face of young dr serviss she felt again the touch of his deft strong hands and heard again the tender cadence of his voice as he said i hope you are not in pain we will release you very soon she dwelt long upon the final scene at the table when with a jesting word on his lips but with love in his eyes he took her hand to remove the marks of her bonds and the flush that came to her was not one of angerit rose from the return of her joy of those few moments of sweet companionship  how sane and strong and safe he was he does not believe in our faith but he does not hate me how dr weissmann loves him they are like father and son  thinking upon these people and their home with their griefs their easy offhand penetrating comments their laughter filling her ears the girl grew drowsy with some foreknowledge of happier days to come and fell asleep with a faint smile upon her lips  she woke late to find her mother bending over her and lifting her arms she drew the gray head down to her soft young bosom and penitently said mamma forgive me i am sorry i spoke as i did i am not angry this morning but i am determined we must go away from here this very day  the mother did not at once reply but when she spoke her voice trembled a little i guess youre right dearie this house seems like a prison to me this morning but what troubles me most is this why do maynard and father permit us to stay here i am afraid of mr pratteverybody says he will make us trouble and yet our dear ones urge us to remain  mamma gravely replied viola i want to tell you something that came to me this morning i wonder if what grandfather says is not made up of what pratt and anthony want  what do you mean child asked the mother sitting back into a chair and staring at her daughter with vague alarm  i mean thatthatgrandfather strong as he seems to be is influenced in some way by tony he goes against my wishes and against your wishes but he never goes against tonys  the mother pondered but that is because tony is content to follow his will  the girl lost her firm tone i know that interpretation can be given to it but today i feel that it is the other way and besides it may be that grandfather doesnt realize all our troubles  the mother rose its all very worrisome and i wish some change would come i dread to meet mr pratt but i suppose i must  dont go down i dont intend to see him again if i can avoid it ring for your coffee and take your breakfast here with me this morning  no that would only make him angry ill go down  i dont care what he says mamma i shall do as i like hereafter  with this defiant reply ringing in her ears mrs lambert went slowly down the stairs to find the master of the house sullen sour and vindictive breakfasting alone in his great diningroom as she timidly entered he looked up from his toast with a grunt of greeting and mrs lambert seeing that his resentment still smouldered stopped on the threshold pale with premonition of assault she would have fled had she dared to do so but the maid drew a chair for her and so she seated herself opposite him in silence  wheres that girl he asked harshly  shes not feeling very well this morning so i told her she neednt come down to breakfast  he grunted in scorn what happened over there last night everybody seems upset by it i want to know all about it you had a sitting did you  yes  whose idea was thatclarkes  no father wanted to speak with dr serviss and dr weissmann  weissmann was there was he what did he say  he seemed impressed  what happened  father came as usual  i mean what happened outside the séance something set that girl against me and upset clarke i want to know what it was  i dont think anything was said of you at all  yes there was you cant fool me somebody warned that girl against me the whole thing seems funny to me by funny he meant strange you go away from my house for a dinner against my willleave me in the lurchand come home at one oclock in the morning with faces that would sour milk and now here you are all avoiding me this morning it just convinces me that if were going to carry on this work together weve got to have a definite understanding youve got to stop going to such houses and giving séances without my permission i wont have that under any conditions  clarke who had appeared at the doorway a worn and troubled spectre of dismay now put in a confirmatory word you are quite right simeon that house reeks with the talk of winebibbers and those who make life a witticism such an atmosphere profoundly affects viola  pratt glowered at him with keen contemptuous glance you look as if youd been drawn through a knothole what happened to you as clarke did not reply to this he took another line of inquiry about this sitting what was the upshot  it was a very remarkable testsitting and seemed to make a profound impression the conditions were severe  why was i left out thats what i want to know  thats what puzzles me mcleod who promised us never to have a circle without you insisted on the sitting there  how do you know he did did he write or speak to you  nohe impressed the psychic  i dont trust that girl in such a house did you talk with weissmann about heading the committee  yes buthe hesitatedthey both insisted that if they took the matter up both of us must be excluded  pratt bristled and you consented to that  i did not i insisted that the sittings take place here and that we be present they would not listen to that so i think ill go ahead on my programme and decide upon the personnel of the committee afterwards  pratt regarded him fixedly im not sure i like your programme my friend ive been thinking it over lately and ive just about come to the conclusion that youd better not issue that challenge  why not  pratt snapped like a peevish bulldog because i dont want it donethats all the reason you need ive never made any concessions to reach these damn scientists and i dont intend to begin now you are planning to involve us in a whole lot of noise and sensation and i dont like it furthermore i dont intend to submit to it  clarke was too irritable to take this quietly and his eyes blazed youre very sensitive all at once when did you reach this new point of view  never you mind about that ive reached it and i intend to maintain it why you simpleminded jackass these scientists will eat you up theyll make a monkey of me and disgrace the girl theyll pretend to expose herthe press will be on their sideand i will be made the butt of all their slurring gibes i wont have it  youre too nervous about the press replied clarke loftily youre all wrong about the papers theyll take a malicious joy in girding at the scientists as the men who know it all theyll have their fling at us of course but it wont hurt  oh it wont well it may not hurt youits a fine stroke of advertising for youbut i dont need that kind of publicity thats settled now about this man servisshe turned to mrs lambertis he married  no  i thought not how long has he known viola  its nearly two years since he came to colorow but he has only seen her a few times  pratt cut her short i begin to understand youd better not let him mix in herehes too young and too goodlooking to conduct experiments of this kind with your girl if you had any sense clarke youd see that for yourself  clarkes expression changed his cheeks grew livid with his passion and his eyes burned with the same wild light that had filled them as he looked across the room at morton bending over violas hand pratts brutal frankness had cleared his own thought and rearoused his sense of proprietorship in the girl until that dinner came with its revelation he had thought of serviss merely as the scientist to be used to further his own plans now he knew him for what he wasa young and dangerous rival with a sinking of the heart he suspected him to be a successful rival  he rose from the table and left the room and mrs lambert followed him fearful of what he might do in his rage  tony tony she called  he turned and faced her his face set in horrible lines his fists clinched ive been a fool a fool he declared through set teeth why didnt you warn me i should have made her safely my own before i came east she loves him but he shall not have herby god he shall not where is she tell her i must see her  she pleaded for delay and at last calmed him so that he left her and went to his room she then hastened to viola and locked the door behind her  viola dear get ready we must leave this house at once she said breathlessly  what has happened asked viola  mrs lambert took time to think it was very disagreeable they are wrangling again about that challenge and about you  about me yes thats what wears on methey wrangle about me as if i had no right to say what part i am to take but its all over mother unless grandfather holds me by the throat every mortal minute today im going into the street  a knock at the door startled them both but it proved to be the maid who said here is a note from mr clarke miss he said be sure and bring an answer miss  the note was a passionate appeal for a meeting but viola wrote across it in firm letters no it is useless and returned it to the girl take that to him she said careless of the fact that her refusal was open to the eyes of the messenger  when they were again in private she said well go if we have to telephone the police to help us and im going to wire papajoe to come and take us home  you are cruel to tony child  no im not he must understand once for all that i belong to myself i never really cared for him deep in my heart i was afraid of him and now he has grown so egotistical that he is willing to sacrifice me to his own aims and i hate him i will not see him again if i can avoid it  the mother protested less and less strongly for she was forced to admit that something fine and true had gone out of her idol and that he now stood in a new and harsh light all the hard lines of his face appeared to her and his pallor his deepset eyes were those of a sick and restless soul she no longer rejoiced at the thought of giving her daughter into his hands  clarke was truly in a pitiable state of incertitude and despair his oration his interdicted challenge his book his religion were all swallowed in by the one great passion which now flooded and filled his brainhis love for viola she belongs to me he repeated as he walked his room with shaking limbs a dry hard knot in his throat his eyes hot with tears that would not fall she must surrender herself to mefinally and nowtoday i will wait no longer she must leave this house at oncebut she must go as my wife she is right pratt is a beasta savage he will ragehe will vilify us both but we will defy him our guides will confound him we are after all not dependent upon him we can go on the maid returning handed him violas answer and went hastily out he read it and reread it till its finality burned into his brain then dropped into a deep chair and there lay for a long time in despairing stupor  was it all over then was her final decision in that curt scrawl she had returned his own note as if with intent to emphasize her refusal to see him and yet only a few days ago she had assented to all his plans leaning upon his advice what had produced this antagonism what evil influence was at work  he rose on a sudden fierce return of selfmastery and went to mrs lamberts door and knocked and when she opened to him demanded of her a full explanation what is the matter is she sick or is she hatefully avoiding me  shes all upset anthony dont worry she will see you byandby  she must see me after what she said last night i cant thinki am in agony what is the matter with us all yesterday we were triumphant today i feel as if everything were sinking under my feet she shall not leave me i will not have it so tell her i insist on seeing her i beg her to speak to me if only for a moment  i will tell her you are here she left him at the threshold a haggard and humble suitor while she knocked at her daughters door viola child anthony is here let me in just a moment  as he waited the halffrenzied man noted the absence of certain family portraits and cried aloud poignantly she is packing she is going away and when mrs lambert returned he seized her by the arm his eyes wild and menacing tell me the truth she is preparing to leave  mrs lambert looked away i tried to reason with her anthony i wanted her to sit for council but shes so crazy to get away she will not do it she will hardly speak to me  she must not goshe shall not leave me i will not permit her to go to him his voice rose and his lifted hand shook  hush tony she will hear you please go away and let me deal with her  he lifted his face and spoke with closed eyes donald mcleod if you are present intercede for me bring her to me command her to remain you gave her to me you led us here will you permit her to ruin all our plans stretch out your hand in power do you hear me there was no answer to his appeal neither tap nor rustle of reply in the silence his heart contracted with fear have you deserted me too then his brain waxed hot with mad hate his hand clinched in a savage vow i swear i will kill her before i will let her go to that man together we will enter the spiritworld  he sprang towards the door but mrs lambert with eyes expanded in horror caught him by the arm tony tony what are you doing are you crazy  her hand upon his arm her face drawn and white with fear recalled him to himself he laughed harshly nooh no im not mad but its enough to make me so i didnt mean itof course i didnt mean it  you are dreadfully wrought up tony go out and walk and clear your brain and byandby well sit for council  in the end she again persuaded him to return to his chamber but he did not leave the houseneither could he rest every word the girl had said of his selfishness his egotism burned like poison in his brain had his hold on her been so slight after all she despises me she hates me and in his heart he despised and hated himself he cursed his poverty his lack of resource why am i the evangel of this faith dependent on others for revelation why must i beg and cringe for money for power he was in the full surge of this flood of indignant query when pratt shuffled into his room  some reporters below want to see you i guess you better  clarke turned the glare of madness in his eyes curse you and your reporters go away from me i dont want to be bothered by you nor by them  pratt stared in dull surprise which turned slowly to anger whats the matter with you now he roared damn you anyway youve upset my whole house with your crazy notions everything was moving along nicely till you got this bug of a big speech into your head and then everything in my life turns topsyturvy to hell with you and your book you cant use me to advertise yourself i want you to understand that right now i see your scheme and it dont work with me  he was urging himself into a frenzyhis jaws working his eyes glittering like those of a boar about to charge all his concealed dislike his jealousy of the preachers growing fame and of his control of viola turning rapidly into hate i dont know why youre eating my bread he shouted hoarsely ive put up with you as long as i am going to youre nothing but a renegade preacher a deadbeat and a hypocrite get out before i kick you out  this brought the miserable evangel to a stand ill go he said defiantly but ill take your psychic with mewell go together  go and be damned to the whole tribe of ye retorted pratt purple with fury go and ill publish you for a set o leechesthats what ill do and with this threat he turned on his heel and went out leaving clarke stupefied blinded by the force of his imprecations  the situation had taken another turn for the worse to leave the house of his own will was bad enough to be kicked out by his host and to be followed by his curse was desolating and yet this i could endure if only she would speak to mewould go with me  he fell at last into a deep gulf of selfpity yesterday now so far away so irrevocable was full of faith of promise of happiness of grand purpose now every path was hid by sliding sand the world was a chaos his book his splendid mission his communion with adele his very life depended upon this wondrous psychic without her the world was a chaos life a failure and his faith a bitter mocking lie with a sobbing groan he covered his face his heart utterly gone his brain benumbed his future black as night  and yet outside the window in reach of his hand the spring sunlight vividly fell the waves of the river glittered like glass and ships moved to and fro like butterflies the sky was full of snowy cloudsharbingers of the warm winds of spring sparrows twittered along the eaves and the mighty city with joy in its prosaic heart was pacing majestically into the new and pleasant month     xvii  when doctors disagree   at breakfast next morning morton took up the paper with apprehension and though he found clarkes name spread widely on the page he was relieved to find only one allusion to the unknown psychic on whose mystic power the orator was depending  she has another day of grace he said to himself thinking of lambert  all the way down to his laboratory he pretended to read the news but could not succeed in interesting himself in the wars and famines of the world so much more vital and absorbing were his own passions and retreats so filmy was the abstract so concrete and vital the particular a million children might be starving in india a thousand virgins about to be sold to slavery in turkestan but such intelligence counted little to a man struggling with doubt of the woman he loves and questioning further the right of any philosopher to marry and bring children into a life of bafflement and pain and ultimate annihilation  this must ever be so the particular must outweigh the general and philosophers even the monists must continue to be inconsistent the individual must of necessity consider himself first and humanity afterwards for if all men considered the welfare of the race to the neglect of self the race would die at the root and the individual perish of his toowidely diffused pity to be the altruist one must first be the egoist say the philosophers to give one must first have  the questions which filled this implacable young investigators mind were these is my love worthy and again dare i insisting on mans unity with all other organisms and subject to the same laws of extinction entertain the idea of marriage if the theories i hold are trueif the soul of a child is no more than the animating principle of the ant or the ape and this i cannot denythen of what avail is human life by what right do men bring other organisms into being knowing that they will only flutter a little while in the sun like butterflies and die as unavailingly as moths  up to this time he had accepted with a certain calm pitilessness the most inexorable tenets of the evolutionists and had defended them with remorseless zeal but on this fair spring morning with love for viola stirring in his heart he found himself far less disposed to crush and confound he acknowledged a growing sympathy with those who mourn the tragic fact of death  all that he had read concerning clairvoyance telepathy hypnotism and their allied subjects began to assume new significance and a weightier importance he was annoyed to find himself profoundly concerned as to whether the power of suggestion was anything like as coercive as many eminent men believed it to be and in this awakened interest he phoned tolman upon reaching his desk asking him to lunch with him at the club if there is anything in his philosophy i want to know it he said as he turned to his desk  he found no word from lambert and this troubled him if he does not come today i must act alone he concluded and attempted to take up his work but found his brain preoccupied his hand heavy  weissmann came in late looking old and worn he too had passed a restless night he nodded curtly to his assistant and set to work without reference to the sitting or the psychic and yet morton was very sure his chiefs mind was as profoundly engaged as his own and a little later in the forenoon he stopped at his desk and said lunch with me doctor i have asked tolman and i want to talk things over with you both  weissmann consented in blunt abstraction and the work proceeded quite in the regular routine so far as he was concerned  tolman was the farthest remove from the traditional mesmerist in appearance being a brisk blond man of exceeding neatness and taste in dress he wore the most fashionable clothing his hair and beard were in perfect order and his hands were very beautiful he was indeed vain of his slender fingers and gesticulated overmuch his voice also was a little overassertive but his eyes were clear steady and strong  as they took seats in the cheerful sunlit diningroom of the midday club the three theorists formed a notable group and one that attracted general comment but their conversation would have astonished the easygoing publishers and professional men who were chatting at neighboring tables so full of interrogation and assertion was each specialist  as tolman rose to speak to a friend at a table across the room weissmann confidentially remarked i did not sleep last night not a wink i could not satisfy myself about those performances therefore i smoked and studied last nights test proved nothing to me except that the girl had nothing to do with the phenomena  the young mans heart glowed at these words and he feelingly replied to prove that would mean a great deal to me doctor  weissmanns tired face lighted up so then you are interested in her you love her i was right eh he asked with true german directness  serviss protested oh no i havent said that but it troubled me to think of her as a possible trickster please dont hint such a thing in tolmans hearing  as the hypnotist returned to his seat serviss opened up the special discussion by asking him his opinion of the claims of spiritualists  this question threw tolman into a roar that from you and in the presence of weissmann is a facer what has come over morton serviss that he should invite me to a lunch to talk over a case of hystericoepilepsy and start in by asking my opinion of spiritualism come now out with the real question  serviss perceived the folly of any subterfuge and briefly presented violas history without naming her of course and ended by describing in detail the sitting of the night before while tolman ate imperturbably at his chop and toast with only now and then a word or a keen glance  when the story was finished he looked up like a lawyer assuming charge of a witness now theres a whole volume to say upon what youve told me and our time is limited to a chapter make your questions specific what point do you particularly want my opinion on  first of all has the preacher in this case been controlling the girl  undoubtedly but not to the extent you imagine  has the mother  yes she has been a great and constant source of suggestion  you would advise taking the patient out of her present surroundings would you not  yes that would be helpful but is not absolutely necessary the essential step is to fill her mind with countersuggestions here he launched into an exposition of the principles and potentialities of hypnotism and was in full tide of it when weissmann interrupted to ask  but suppose these phenomena actually and independently exist suppose that they are not illusions but objective realities how then will your suggestion help  this put tolman on his mettle he entered into a discourse filled with phrases like secondary consciousness collective hallucinations nerveforce wherein while admitting that great and good men believed in the phenomena of spiritism he concluded that they were overhasty in assigning causes for his part the realm of hallucination was boundless the mind has the power to create a world of its ownit often does so and  here weissmann again broke in you will enroll yourself with aksakof and von hartmann and lombroso  not precisely they admit the reality of the appearances i do not believe that the mind has power to dematerialize objects as in the case of your wineglass last night which was a trick  but the mind can produce a blister without external cause said serviss you hypnotic sharps have proved that it can also deaden nerves and heal skin diseases if not bone fractures  yes we produce marvellous cures within the organism but we draw the line at the periphery of the body telekinesis is to me the word of a lively fictionist  one is as easy to believe as the other and crookes lodge lombroso tamburini aksakof von hartmann all believe in the reality of these happenings retorted serviss they differ only in their explanations one party believes them due to disembodied spirits the other relates them to the inexplicable action of a certain psychic force generated within the sitters and acting on objects at a distance i am not yet persuaded of the phenomena but i am progressing i am willing to admit that these gentlemen are entitled to a respectful hearing  tolman resumed his own explanation and after several premises and general statements put a case for example take automatic writing you begin by placing a pad and pencil before the mind that suggests writingsets up a certain train of associated ideas these ideas have the innate tendency to realize themselves the will of the subject being weakened this is why the left hand is often used these ideas disassociate themselves from the rest of the mental organism and may in highly developed cases become what is called a secondary personality they may give a weak imitation of discourse they may assume a vague resemblance to some other individual but they can never give a full statement or a new statement this is why all the socalled spirit communications are so fragmentary and so futile the cure of any such state is to set up a strong current of countersuggestion  weissmann asked is it not extravagant to say that there can exist in the unconscious mind of a young girl a skill so great as will enable her to draw intricate patterns manipulate objects at a distance and impersonate dead persons unknown to her  but there you have passed into the region of hallucination or deceit  im not so sure of that i do not see how fraud or hallucination can come into the most of what we saw last night i will admit that coming alone by itself the test would have little weight but it does not come alone the literature of the subject is great and growing  tolman smiled yes the newspapers are filled with accounts of mediums exposed  they entered then upon a discussion of the trance and passed to a consideration of multiple personality which brought out many singular facts we learned also tolman said in discussion of a certain case which he had studied that certain drugs have the power of arousing specific nervecentres and that in cases of alternating personality by flooding the brain with blood we were able to bring back the normal self  doesnt that weaken your argument of the power of mind over matter asked serviss profoundly interested in this assertion  not at all it is my belief in the drug that influences the patient  serviss laughed and weissmanns mouth twitched you cannot head them offthese modern mindspecialists they plunge into the subconscious like prairiedogs into the sod only to come up at a new point  tolmans interest in the unknown psychic was now keen and he asked for a chance to try his powers  to this serviss was strongly averse i have never had a chance at a case of this kind and i would very much like to experiment perhaps i may need you but if suggestion is what you claim it to be if the power is really in the mind of the subject i can arouse it as well as any one but as a believer in matter i would like to ally myself with the drug you mention  very well here is the prescription he jotted down on a card a few hieroglyphic phrases and now i must hurry away im sorry but i have an engagement  serviss took his hand cordially im glad to have had this talk with you it has suggested a new train of thought to me  if you need me on the case you mention be sure to let me know it sounds mighty interesting and id like a hand in it  after tolman left weissmann remarked there is a school of thinkers which believes that exceptional individuals may have the power to effect molecular changes in matter at a distance  yes i know that i spent most of the night reading the proceedings of the society for psychical research in which that theory has a large place  well may it not be that miss lambert has this power may it not be that she is able in some such way as that suggested by lombroso to impart cerebral movements to the ether and so modify matter as to produce movement of objects telekinetic writing and all the rest of it  that is too violent an assumption we might as well surrender to the spiritists at once what evidence have we that clarke did not rise and tiptoe about the room manipulating the horn himself  we have our own observation joined to the report of crookes and richet  but crookes is discredited on this score he belongs to what haeckel calls the imaginative scientists so do von hartmann lombroso wallace and lodge  why should that be why should we accept their testimony on gases and the spectrum and exclude it when it comes to a question of phenomena new to us this man is a great chemist and physicist you saybut a crazy ass when he sets to work to examine the claims of spiritism which is absurd and unjust so far as i can see he examined the phenomena of spiritism quite as a scientist should  morton believed that his chief was taking the opposing side out of perversity and replied i admit that as you read they seem reasonable and i also admit that the experiments with eusapia especially the recent ones ought to be conclusive to my mind but they are not that is the singular thingthey do not convince  that is because we do not clear our minds of prejudice these men are farsighted and profound in their own lines they have exposed themselves to sneers by going into these new fields they are to be honored as pioneers why not believe the phenomena they discuss are at least worth our attention  that is clarkes plea  precisely and he is right i am less critical of him today than i was last night he gave his psychic over into our hands what more could we ask  he might have absented himself  he may do that next time  no he was furious when i suggested the idea  my interest is awakened it may be as clarke says that this young lady is about to give the world of science a new outlook it may be that she is to outdo home and eusapia  mortons face was cold and his voice firm as he said not if i can prevent it my zeal as an investigator does not go so far as that i intend to free her from all connection with this uneasy world and to that end i have wired her stepfather to come on and with his assistance i hope to end clarkes control of her and set to work upon the cure she expects of me  weissmann smiled indulgently the scientist is defeated by the lover i see you would exclude all others from the sitting very well that shall be as you wish but it seems a shame now when we have such a wonderful chance to duplicate the crookes experiments but as you say it would be too much to ask of a young and lovely girl we will sacrifice only men and the ugly crones eh morton smiled faintly and his chief went on well now in case you find yourself sitting he held up a warning handi say if you find yourself unable to stop these trances  i have no doubt of thatprovided i can take her out of her present associations  very good i was about to say that all or nearly all of the phenomena of last night took place within a limited radius of the psychic the books all came from behind her the horn hovered near herall of which would support the arguments of the psychic force advocates lombroso and tamburini both suggest that it is not absurd to say that possibly the subconscious mind may be able not merely to transmit energy but to produce phantasmal forms and i wondered last night whether there might not be some supernormal elongation of the psychics arms which might enable her to seize and manipulate the horn at a distance beyond her normal reach  it is easier for me to believe that mrs lambert did it i am convinced that clarke in some way played us false  im not sure of that i am willing to grant that it is possible for the mind to alter the circulation of the blood even to accelerate or decrease the upbuilding processes among the cells if the mind can produce a pathologic process like a blister it can also remove warts or cancer as the hypnotists of the charcot school claim if the mind can move a book or a pencil without the intervention of any known form of matter then clarke as well as his psychic may be innocent and all that happened last night be due to thoughttransference and telekinesis  the young man shrugged his shoulders to admit a single one of your premises would turn all our science upside down  weissmann smiled musingly so said the ptolmaic philosophers when copernicus came yet nothing was destroyed but errorthey established the truth  i didnt mean what i said exactly i meant that the whole theory is opposed to every known law of physics  im not so certain of that i can imagine a subtler form of force than magnetism i can imagine the mind reacting upon matter creating in its own right by the displacement and rearrangement of the molecules of a substancesay of wood what is a wineglass but an appearance no no it will not do to be dogmatic we must not assume too much we must keep open minds are we not advancing is any one nearing the farther wall no my boy each year should make us less arrogant ten thousand years from now men will still be discovering new laws of nature just as they were ten thousand years ago it is childish to suppose that we or any other generation will know all that is to be known infinite research is before us just as infinite painful groping is behind us i do not assume to say what the future will bring to mankind perhaps soonvery soon science will shift its entire battleline from matter to mind to say the mind is conditioned in a certain way today does not mean that these conditions may not utterly change tomorrow great discoveries wait in the future  but you would not say that a new way of squaring the circle would appearor that perpetual motion  oh no no error is not a product of enlightenment i only say that the problem which is insoluble to you and to me may be quite simple to the biologist of the twentysecond century once i thought i might come to know much of the universe now i am quite certain i shall never know but a few processesnever the mystery itself  as the old man talked with the light of prophecy in his gaunt face the young mans imagination took wing into the future that mighty and alluring void black as night yet teeming with transcendent potential unborn men and women and his brain grew numb with the effort and his heart humble with the moments prophetic glance ay it was true he in his turn would seem a child of the foolish pasta fond old man to the wise future his complacence was lost his faith in his authorities violently shaken he recalled a line from whitman beyond every victory there are other battles to be fought other victories to be won and his eyes grew dim and his thought filled with reverence for those seers of the future and with awe of the inscrutable and everbeckoning and everretiring mystery of life  his chief resumed no we pretend to larger knowledge of living organisms but how will our textbooks be regarded by the teachers of the future will they not read us and smile over us as curious mixtures of truth and errorvaluable as showing the state of science in our day do you dream of solving the mystery of life of bridging the chasm between the crystal and the nonnucleated cell i do not as i sat alone last night unable to sleep my eyes ran over the backs of the books on my shelvesthey were all there all the great ones laplace spinoza descartes goethe spencer hegel kant darwin all the wonderworkers how masterful each had been in his time how complacent of praise how critical of the past but here now they all stood gathering dust and i thought so will the unborn philosophers of the next century fold me up and put me away beside the other mouldy onescurious but no longer useful my book will be but an empty shell on the reef of human history of such cruelty are the makers of scientific advance  morton was profoundly moved by the note of pathos of disillusionment in the old mans voice would you have me believe that these men we doubt today are forerunners of the future  i feel so the materialists have had their day some subtler expression of matter is about to be given to the world not as kant gave it but through experiment and to men like myers and sir william crookes may come great honor some day  you would not have us weaken in our method  weissmanns manner changed he resumed his most peremptory tone by no means we must not relax our vigilant scrutiny of fact one atoms weight but we must keep our minds open to new messagesno matter how repulsive the source  morton sat for a moment in deep study then said if i fail to stop the public announcement of miss lamberts powers if clarkes challenge is issued in spite of my protest i shall ask the privilege of heading the committee in order to be present and shield her if it comes to this will you join me and support me  with pleasure  but suppose the president and our board object  what right have they to object so long as i do not neglect my duties they will not dare to object  they will be scandalized two of us going into an investigation of this sort will seem to involve the whole school and they may insist on our keeping out of it so long as we are connected with the institution if they ask for our resignation the public will side with us but all other institutions and probably the bulk of our colleagues will go against us i hesitate therefore to ask you to take up this work it is not a matter of bread and butter to me i can resign and i am thinking this is my best plan at the same time i hope for miss lamberts sake that the public test will not be made  weissmanns shaggy old head lifted like that of a musing lion what is this opposition to me i too can resign what my colleagues say will not matter if i feel that i am advancing the cause of science their flames will scorch but i have a thick skin besides i am old with only a few more years to work and if i felt i could better serve the world by going into this investigation than by remaining in the one in which i now am i would gladly do it i will not utterly starve  not while i am able to share a crust quickly exclaimed serviss if they ask for your resignation give it and come with me together we will found an institute for the study of the supranormal what do you say  weissmanns eyes glowed with the quenchless zeal of the experimentalist my dear boy i would resign now for that purpose but i hope it will not be necessary for your sake  they shook hands like two adventurers setting out on their joint exploration of a distant and difficult country but this moment of exaltation was followed in servisss mind by a sense of having in some way dedicated viola to the advancement of science rather than to the security of the fireside and to the joys of wife and mother     xviii  lambert intervenes   upon his return to his desk serviss was delighted to find a telegram from lambert stating the time of his arrival and asking for a meeting there was a note of decision almost command in the wording of the despatch which denoted that the miner had taken his warning to heart and was prepared for prompt and authoritative action  the time of the train being near serviss closed the lid of his desk and took a car for the stationimmensely relieved of responsibility yet worn and troubled by a multitude of confused and confusing speculations all the way to the depot and while he stood waiting outside the gates he pondered on the surprising change in weissmanns thought and also upon the momentous covenant between them more than ever before he felt the burden and the mystery of organic life around him flowed an endless stream of humankind rushing spreadingeach drop in the flood an immortal soul according to the spiritist attended by invisible guardians watching upholding warningand the whole earth swarms with a billion other similar creatures with the same needs the same destiny for after all the difference between a zulu and a greek is not much greater than that between a purplegreen hummingbird and a canary and to think that this wave of man appearing today on the staid old earth like the swarms of innumerable insects of june is but one of a million other waves of a million other years to consider furthermore that all those who have lived and died are still sentient what a staggering monstrous conception nor is this all according to the monist conception there is no line at which we can say here the animal stops and the soul of man begins so that ants and apes are claimants for immortality if the individual man persists after death why not his faithful collie no this theory will not do it is far less disturbing to think of all these hurrying bipeds as momentary nodes of forceminute eddies on the boundless stream of ether  the gates opened and another river of travellers presumably from the great plains of the middle west poured forth quite undistinguishable in general appearance from those which had preceded them and dropping his speculation morton peered among these faces not quite sure that he would know lambert if he saw him as a matter of fact he would have missed him had not the miner laid a hand upon his arm saying quaintly howdy professor howdy whats the state of the precinct  he was quite conventional in all outward signs save for his redbrown complexion and the excessive newness of his handbag how are all the folks he went on to ask with a keen glance  they were quite well when i saw them but they need you youre not an hour too soon  is it as bad as that he exclaimed anxiously what is it all about  wait till we reach a carriage then ill put you in possession of all the facts replied serviss and led the way to a cab i am greatly relieved to see you today  i came as soon as your wire reached me but the messenger arrived during a big snowstorm and the trail was impassable for a day now then professor lets have the whole story he said as the driver slammed the door where are they and what is the matter  they are here in new york housed with a man named pratt a wealthy spiritist and they are in excellent bodily health but your daughter is threatened with a publicity which is most dangerous  how is that  clarke has decided to give an oration in the spirit temple announcing his faith and defying the unbeliever as the climax of this discourse he intends to announce your daughters name and her willingness to meet any test she objects to this publicity but pratt your wife and the guides all unite in forcing her into acquiescence  i see said lambert reflectively when does this speech come off  sunday morning at eleven  i reckon i can stop that was the miners laconic comment  but this is not the only danger serviss hurried on to say this man pratt is a rankly selfish old man who is surrounded by flatterers and those who live off his desire to commune with his dead wife and daughters he is accustomed to have his own private mediums and to appropriate their entire time and energy till he is weary of themor till a new one comes to his knowledgethen it is his pitiless habit to expose them and throw them into the street he is the worst possible man for your daughter to know and to be in his house is a misfortune  how does she happen to be there  clarke took them there he was eager to secure pratts endorsement of your daughter and also of the book he is about to publish your daughter hates pratt and is very anxious to leave but is afraid to do so for fear of him and of her controls pratt has threatened to denounce her if she leaves him  is he in love with her  i dont think sonot in the way you mean he is bound up in her powers and would do anything to keep her but she must be taken away at once and clarkes oration stopped i would have interfered but i had no authority to act your wife is satisfied to remain and the chief control her father insists upon their remaining and clarke told me last night that your daughter was his affianced wife you can see how helpless i am even though your daughter in her normal mood begged me to save her from madness i regard her condition as very critical to expose her to a public trial of her powers may unsettle her reason  lambert was profoundly moved by mortons rapid statement what would you advise me to do  take her away from that house and clarkes influence instantly no matter if your wife opposes it  are we on our way there now  yes well be there in a few minutes my sister likes your wife and daughter and has invited them to stay with her for a few days this they have promised to do i suggest therefore that you take them immediately to our home and so get your daughter into a totally different mental atmosphere this plan will give you time to decide on future action  do they know im coming  no i was afraid you might not come and  im glad you didnt tell them i wanted to test whether that ghostly grandfather would inform them im mightily obliged to you professor he said after a pause and his eyes were moist with his emotion i never had a child of my own and im fond of viola ive always resented this mediumistic businessshes too fine to be spoiled by itbut she wasnt mine and julia was so wrapped up in the faith i couldnt stop it then clarke came and julia minded what i said no more than if id been a chipmunk so i climbed into the hills and stayed there  you believe in your daughters powers  in her powers yes but not in every voice that speaks through her have you attended any of her sittings  we had one in my house last night i laid the burden of the performance to clarke he was the juggler  oh no youre wrong there i have cause enough to hate clarke but hes honest no the power is all in viola ive had those things go on with nobody but julia and the girl in the room no clarke is a crazy fool in some ways but he dont cheat  his words were so direct so weighted with conviction that their force staggered serviss causing him to doubt his new explanation tolmans generalizations ceased at the moment to convince  lambert went on i suppose she is committed to him she wrote me that she guessed she might as well so long as she was a medium nobody else would ever want heror something like that i feel guilty ill admit but you see how it was the girl belongs to julia and since clarke came into the family our correspondence has been pretty well confined to checks on my part and receipts on hers but shes had plenty of money professor there wasnt any need of her going into anybodys house she could have gone to the best hotels  i dont see how you could have acted differently said serviss with intent to comfort but i am sure that violahe spoke the name with a little hesitationwill eagerly go with you now she begins to doubt clarke and to realize the fearful mental peril in which she stands  thats what i dont understand professor this spiritualistic faith is mighty pretty on the face of it but it seems to unhinge peoples minds ive known two or three to go locoed with it thats what kept me from interfering it isnt for miners to monkey with but i was in hopes that you would go into it in fact i was in hopes youd got sort o interested in viola and she in you and that youd help her someway  i am interested in her replied serviss quickly and i want to help her but so long as she is where she is and acknowledges clarkes claims i can do nothinghere we are  as they drew up before the looming front of pratts house the miner whistled must be one of those wall street pirates we read about nothing spiritlike about this castle eh  nor about its lord  why this beats the palace hotel in salina he continued his wonder increasing then he smiled whatll you bet i dont catch the guides napping you send up word youre here and leave me out o sight somewhere id like to show julia that her daddy dont know all that blows over the roof  again serviss doubted the husbands ability to dominate the forces in oppositionso small and inoffensive did he seem and so illtimed was his joke  the colored man more funereally dignified than before showed them into the receptionroom im afraid the ladies are out sir but if youll wait a moment ill see  be sure mrs lambert gets my card said serviss with a note of warning in his voice after the man left the room he turned to lambert pratt has a habit of intercepting the cards of visitors and deciding who shall and who shall not see your daughter he hates me and may order me out of the house as they listened the masters deep grumbling vibrated through the ceiling you see my card has gone to him not to your wife the old ruffian is probably giving instructions to have me shown the door  to this lambert made no reply other than to say well soon know the nigger is returning  some shade of the masters mood was reflected in the voice of the servant as he said the ladies are out and mr pratt is engaged he had the air of waiting for them to go  out are they remarked lambert casually then well wait till they come in when did you say theyll return  i didnt say sir probably not till very late  is clarke in  i dont know sir i think not  but your boss is in  the man hesitated yes sir but i told you hes engaged  lambert changed his tone now see here charley you go right back and tell him that joe lambert of fremont basin is here on business and would like to have a word with him if he dont mind  the colored man saw a light and visibly weakened iill tell him he stammered and retired  lambert followed him to the door and called after him in a clear tone you tell him to come down or ill go up now mind you say just those words  morton smiled with joy in lamberts decisive utterance so much for having authority as well as the will to act  pratt appeared at the head of the stairs what is it now jenkins  the gentleman insists on seeing you sir its mr lambert  stay where you are commanded pratt ill come down and see whats wanted  lambert with quiet upturned face watched the master of the house descend slowly step by step and morton contrasting the two men awaited the collision with rising apprehension the western man seemed so small so inoffensive in manner in contrast with the grizzled insolent face of the sullen old man approaching with heavy jaw set at a bulldog angle well sir what is it he contemptuously inquired  lambert waited so long that his questioner began to wonder and then remarked quietly so youre pratt  i am  well im joe lambert of fremont and ive come to relieve you of the keep of my wife and daughter nothing could have been more telling more admirable than his tone every word told and as pratt stood in a daze of surprise lambert turned to the servant now george you try again you tell mrs lambert her husband wants to see her and you may ask clarke to come along i want a word or two with him  wait called pratt i want to know  lambert pointed a finger like a pistol you go and the man went the westerner then turned to the owner of the house and said out where i live a husband has some rights which he can enforce if he is minded to do so i havent looked after my family as closely as i might but im going to do better hereafter i believe my wife and daughter are in this house and i intend to see them and your wishes dont count in the matter id advise you not to interfere  pratt began to retreat i didnt know  but suppose you didntwhat right have you to supervise my wifes affairs why didnt you send professor servisss card to her what business had you to say she was out  pratt came down from his lofty pose so many strangers insist on seeing the psychic  but professor serviss is not a stranger and furthermore unless my wifes mind has weakened shes quite competent to turn down any one she dont want to see i cant understand why she is here but i intend to find out so long as she bears my name i dont want her to be under any obligation to a man of your stamp  there was power and a quiet dignity in the little man and pratt began to plead his case ive tried to make it comfortable for them and help on their work  lambert looked up and down the splendid hall and in a softer tone replied so far im in your debt but i dont like it i am able to provide for my family and i dont intend to share their supervision with you nor any other man so far as i know my wife still considers me the head of the familyanyhow thats what im here to find out  mrs lambert appeared at the head of the stairs and called in a tremulous voice is that you joe  it is julia come down  viola with a cry of joy left her mothers side and running down the steps flung herself into lamberts arms like a frightened child oh papajoeim so glad to see you  lambert was astonished by the warmth of her greeting and while she hid her face on his shoulder patted her awkwardly with soothing words of endearment until at last she lifted her pale and tearwet face and whispered  oh its been a terrible daytake me away quick  lambert looked up at his wife julia whats been going on here you both look like the dead  mrs lamberts face was wrinkled and haggard and wan like that of one grown suddenly old and morton was aware that her serenity was utterly gone before she spoke her voice was weak and piteous i thought it was all for the best joe i followed the guides  follow them a little longer and youll all land in the madhouse he replied then to viola he tenderly said dont you worry any more girlie old papajoes going to take you home  serviss spoke youre to come to us tonight kate expects you both  at the sound of his voice viola turned with an impulsive reaching of the hands oh dr serviss that would be heavenly i love your sister and her beautiful home  lambert issued his command get your outfits together i dont understand how you got here but youre going to get out with me within the next halfhour  violas spirit rose like flame were all readythis moment i sent our trunks away this morning they went to the west park ill be down instantly and she turned to run up the stairs just as clarke appeared at their head his face was white and wild and his voice hoarse with fear and reproach as he intercepted her  what has happened who is below  my stepfather she answered curtly and fled away to her room  mrs lambert was about to follow when she saw clarke descending and drew back with a look of appeal at her husband it was evident to serviss that her confidence in clarke had given place to fear  during all this time pratt had been standing meditatively swaying to and fro on his feet chewing upon something which he held far back in his cheek he resembled a sullen chained and vindictive elephant meditating murder he watched clarke descend the stairs with very little change of expression but lamberts face darkened as the minister called out  what are you going to do  that does not concern you he replied and his voice cut your control of my household stops right here julia go get your things he laid an imperative hand on clarkes arm clear the way for her  with a look of alarm mrs lambert started to follow her daughter dont be harsh joe then to clarke she said pleadingly its best anthony for a little while viola is so nervous and morbid  i know what it means he passionately answered it means the wreck of all my hopes it means ruin to all my plans  lambert again interfered julia get dressed i will attend to mr clarke as she hurried up the stairs he turned to morton in apology ive been to blame for this separation i should have asserted my rights before no man has the right to shirk his family duty my duty was to look after the welfare of my wife and daughter and now see their faces this year has made julia an old woman his voice choked when he could speak he addressed himself to clarke you promised me that you wouldnt use the girls name in any way and yet im told youre about to publish it broadcast  the control consents  here lamberts wrath broke bonds damn the control i dont consent and i serve notice on you and on you toohe directed a menacing look upon prattto respect the name of my wife as well as that of my daughter clarke has lived long enough in the west to know what i mean but ill explain to you he faced pratt and with easy almost gentle utterance continued ive spent some thirtyfive years on the border where a man is called upon now and then to serve as his own judge jury and hangman perhaps were a little prone to take matters into our own hands but be that as it may the professor here has posted me about you and your ways and i merely want to state once for all that if you utter one word public or private against my wife or daughter ill kill you as i would a wolf  the slow pulsing flow of the miners voice the absence of all oaths or justifying gesture froze pratt into immobility and thrilled serviss with joy for he too perceived that every word came from the heart of a very determined and very dangerous man  clarke started forward you wrong me everything i have done has been for their goodfor the good of the world  lambert stopped him with a gesture right here you quit my friend i dont question your good intentions but im sick of the whole crazy business and so is julia why good god man she looks ten years older since she left the valley youve been nothing but a curse to her and the girl from the very start and here is where your trail forks  the preachers hollow cheeks were ashen gray and his throat thick with passion as he cried you cant do that you must not separate us i love hershe is mine the spirit forces have promised her to me they will resent your interference they will override your puny opposition  i take the consequences they go and you stay  clarke turned to morton in a frenzy his eyes flaming his lips dry and contorted i see your hand in this you stand there silent but you are the machinator of this plot you are stealing her away  be quiet commanded morton with a gesture towards the stairway dont you see them coming  viola fully dressed and breathless with eagerness to flee was hurriedly descending  as she neared him clarke cried out with lamentable despairing wail viola you are leaving me  she gave him one awed pitying backward glance and passed on hurrying as if to escape his outspread hand swift to outrun the inevitable tragic shadow of his faith  for an instant he reeled back against the wall then sprang to follow but the young scientist intervened and thrust him back  keep to your own trail he sternly said and as he opened the door for the girl she seemed to pass at once into the sunlit springtime world of common life     xix  serviss assumes control   at the carriagedoor mrs lambert halted her heart sorely smitten by the vision of clarkes agonized face wait a moment she cried out we were too cruel let me say goodbye  no lambert replied firmly you are done with him and with these words he gently assisted her into the coach get in professor he added with a touch of the same command we must be moving  with a succinct phrase of direction to the driver serviss complied taking the front seat opposite viola he was horrified to find her shaking violently as if with cold her face white her eyes big and wild her physical rescue was accomplished but it was immediately made plain to him that the invisible bonds which linked her to clarke were being drawn upon with merciless power for with the first motion of the vehicle she fixed a look of terror and entreaty upon her mother exclaiming huskily they are calling me they will not let me go  lambert stared in helpless dismay as he realized the force of this inner struggle but the young scientist filled with fierce rage at this assertion of the dark forces met them promptly in pride of his own resources his own desire  give me your hands he commanded sharply she obeyed like a child in a stupor of pain her breath coming through her pallid lips with a hissing sound as if she were sinking each moment deeper into an icy flood  with both her inert hands in his with love and mastering will in his eyes he bent a deep piercing gaze upon her with intent to rouse her and sustain her you must not give way you are too strong too brave to yield to this delusion you are clear of it all nowentering upon a free and happy life think of the new conditions into which you are going kate is waiting you no one can control you if you set your will sharply against it remember the marshall basin and the splendid sunshine you are leaving all hateful evil influences behind in this way he labored to fill her mind with new conceptions building up in her a will to resist and as he felt the tremor die out of her hands and saw the color coming back into her face he smiled with a sense of victory you see he resumed in triumph you are better your hands are warmer you are breathing naturally again your enemies are being left behind  it was true the hunted piteous look had left her eyes she seemed drowsy but it was the languor of relief the vital force the sanity the imperious appeal of the man before her had rolled back the cloud of fear which had all but closed over her head he released her hands saying we must have no more backward glances remember lots wife  lambert filled with satisfaction laid a silencing hand upon his wifes arm his faith in science in the force of exact learning was being met and he was resolved to leave the hypnotist free to act to control  roused and confident the young scientist continued his appeal leaving her no time to dwell upon the past you are young he said in effect and it is spring you are false to yourself if you permit yourself to lose through any such morbid imagining a single hour of joy all depends on your own will your own desire to be free henceforth you are never to be sad or afraid i will you to be happy and you must obey  she rose from the deep of her depression as a lily rises from the sod after the trampling stormwind has passed her response to his call filled him with hope as well as with astonishment it was as if he had torn from her throat the hands of some hideous beast halfman halfdevil and they entered kates home in such normal cheerful relationship that no one could possibly have associated any hidden grief with either of them not even with mrs lambert and viola met her hostess with the gay spirits of an unexpected but confident guest  kate was both amazed and delighted by their sudden irruption and being eager to know all the details of their escape from the pratt stronghold hurried viola and her mother away to their rooms leaving lambert in mortons care  well professor said the miner when they were alone we made the break and won out i reckon theyre sidetracked now  yes and i hope we are done with both pratt and clarke but theyll both bear watching pratt i especially fear  hes had his notice lambert grimly replied as for clarke it looks as though even julia had got enough of him he looked like a man on the road to the madhouse and i reckon shes convinced of it now  i pitied him but i do not feel that you are in any sense indebted to him on the contrary a large part of your daughters slavery to the trance is due to his pernicious influence  you must be something of an influence yourself professor it was wonderful the way you brought her out of that trance i never saw that done before i reckon you must have some kind of mesmerism about you  not a particle more than you have however i should like to believe in my power to help her in fact i do believe that it is really a question of her own will the old idea of some subtle physical force or fluid passing from the operator to the subject is no longer held it is not even necessary to make passes nor to put the subject in a trance all we need to do is suggest to her that no one not even her ghostly grandfather can control her against her will we must keep her mind full of bright and cheerful thoughts and convince her that by leaving the pratt house she has attained freedom  i will do what i can said lambert but ive seen her taken down so many times im a little doubtful shes in a bad way i admit it has its bad side as well as its pretty side this religion it unhinges a lot of people and i reckon clarkes a little off or he wouldnt have got my folks into that mess  dont let viola feel your doubt present a confident face to her there is nothing supernatural in the world nothing lying outside of nature or outside of law many diseases which were once considered demoniacal possessions we now know to be quite as natural as any other in fact disease is only health gone wrong and the mental disorder in which viola now stands is certainly curable if we proceed properly and with confidence  i like to have you say these things professor they kind o fit in with what ive thought over all by myself out there in the mountains i like the man who says such and such a thing is soandso because i can prove it thats what science is i take it theres altogether too much guesswork about this spiritualistic religionit needs some engineer like you to get down to the bedrock clarke is the kind of man who thinks hes on the vein when he aint  im giving it a good deal of thought and may be i will some day take up the experimentationbut not with your daughter as a subject however well discuss that later you are tired and ill show you your room and bath and after you freshen up a bit well discuss our next movement  lambert turned as he entered the room assigned to him and said with deep feeling im trusting in you professor im out o my latitude in this spirit enterprise as i say ive neglected my family since clarke came into it and it was all wrong i should have asserted my rights i dont blame julia as much as i did women are kind o weak in some waysmore religious you may sayand clarke got hold of julia in a way that i couldnt understand i didnt mind her thinking more of waldron than of methats natural we all have our first lovesbut i couldnt stand clarkes overbearing ways in my own house his voice grew firm well now here i am with time and money tell me what to do and ill do it  mortons liking for the western man was raised almost to affection as he looked into his earnest remorseful eyes and listened to his lowtoned confession you may depend on my help he responded heartily extending his hand in token your stepdaughter interests me deeply there is something for you to do but i will not ask it now  yes tell me so i can be thinking it over  morton pondered a moment then said i had a consultation today with a great nerve specialist a man who uses hypnotism or suggestion as he calls it in his practice he is perfectly sure that your daughter can be restored to mental health but she must have a complete change of companionship and environment he agrees with me that she must be separated not merely from pratt and clarke but from her mother also i need your help in this  that will be hard on julia lambert slowly responded she hasnt much else but the girl and her religion he looked down at the floor yes that is a rough sentence professor but i shouldnt wonder if you were right  it must be done lambert and the very best service you can render is to take your wife and go home leaving viola here in our carebut that can wait till after you are rested and with this final word he closed the door and returned to his library to await kates return and her inevitable demand for the story of what had taken place  he took up one of the most recent books treating of suggestion and resumed consideration of a paragraph which had arrested him as if a hand had been placed upon his shoulder suggestion does not limit or depress the subconscious self it sets it free exalts its powers making it not something less but something vastly more than the normal and the conscious self  could it be possible that viola in common with hundreds of other apparently wellauthenticated cases possessed the psychic force which maxwell richet and lombroso recognized the hypothesis difficult as it was profoundly inexplicable from every point of view was after all less of a wrench to the reason came closer to the frame of his philosophy than the claims of crookes and wallace to accept the spiritist faith even as a working hypothesis was impossible to his definite type of mind  if these raps movements voices could be related to the working of the subconscious mind or as meyers called it the subliminal self then the power of the hypnotist might be able to control their order and to a certain extent their character they were not signs of a diseased brain according to meyers again but were the manifestations of a power scattered here and there among men without system without known law maxwell agreeing with this ends by saying these mysterious phenomena are due therefore neither to spirits nor disease but to a perfectly natural force lying within the minds of the sitters and exercised by the psychic  he had already derived much hope from the monumental work of meyers and his school hundreds of cases of hallucinations alternating personality hysterioepilepsy and other kindred apparent abnormalities had been studied by means of hypnotism and certain processes inhibited or set going at the will of an operator the latest word of these masters was most heartening they had demonstrated that the trance was no longer a necessary part of hypnotism that the subject would not follow out in trance any improper or criminal suggestion which he would not do in conscious state and there is no great physical difference between the normal and the hypnotic state he read the real mental difference lies in the temporary removal of motives tending to counteract the suggestion and this removal does not imply an inhibition of faculty but an actual extension or liberation of faculty  in fine these men agreed that the mind reaching back by its very structure to the beginning of organic life was limited by consciousness to a comparatively small number of its potentialities whereas its subliminal life on the contrary was infinite and unsearchably subtle all minds partook in varying degrees of these baffling powers but only now and then through unusual favoring circumstances was the brain able to manifest its depth and subtlety sickness sleeplessness physical shock some accidental series of events now and then permitted a display of these hidden acquirements and thereafter the individual was marked as abnormal possessed according to the ancient view by angels or devils  others still by putting themselves deliberately into the study had been able to subordinate the conscious mind little by little liberating their subliminal forces by practice attaining thus almost miraculous powers in this way the medium became clairvoyant clairaudient telekinetic in other cases still as in violas case this subordination of the supraliminal self had been accomplished by the suggestion of others by submission to the will of others  he had been profoundly instructed by tolmans account of a case of alternating personality which he had studied with so much care the fact that the secondary self appeared when the subjects life seemed at a lower ebb and when the cerebral centres were sparsely supplied with the lifecurrent and the further fact that the use of a certain substance which stimulated without poisoning the higher braincentres was able to bring back the primary or supraliminal self was of the utmost value it threw a flood of light upon violas condition for had she not in her trance become inert cold and almost without pulse he had provided himself with this drug and as he studied its appearance in the phial so minute so colorless so helpless in its prison he felt once again the mystery of matter and smiled to think how childish was the popular conception of the physical universe as something dead and inorganic nothing is more mysterious  the office of this drug can be twofold it has the power in itself to flush the cerebral centres with fresh blood and it can also serve as a point of support for the suggestion i am about to give it does not really matter whether she has any phase of what they call mediumistic power or not to rid her of her trances will liberate her from a belief in her ills and that is the main consideration  he found the greatest encouragement at this point in the many cases where perfect mental health had been restored by means of a complete change of mental stimuli all hypnotic methods he read have one thing in common and that is the diversion of attention from the insistency of external surroundings the hypnotic state has one broad characteristic and that is the working of the subliminal consciousness in directions unusual in ordinary life  the way to help her is to cut off every suggestion which leads to the trance and to the thought of the dead to centre her mind on the serene the busy the sunny thus flooding her brain with sights and sounds utterly disassociated with her past  the realization that she was at last domesticated under his roof made her redemption seem easy certain almost accomplished there remained only the painful duty of separating her from her mother he could see that this would bring keen sorrow upon them both but that if she could be brought to consider him in the light of her future husband the change would seem less violent for after all it was the law of life which subordinated the claims of the mother to those of the husband  at any rate the issue is now clear in my mind a powerful chain of suggestion has been formed and fastened upon her by her own mother and by clarke that chain must be broken it is broken in clarkes case and no matter what the pain the fear this course may cause the mother it must be pursued in order to restore viola to health  he passed from this to a forecast of the radical changes in his own life which an avowal of love would make and his mood chilled he had always imagined the announcement of his engagement falling into a sober and decorous paragraph among the society notes and had figured himself receiving with dignified composure the congratulations of his associates and clubfellows he had never considered the possibility of shrinking from these publicities nor fancied himself in the light of finding excuses to justify or explain his marriage he now clearly foresaw foreheard the comment the surprise the opposition of his family  he pulled himself up short with a word of derision at the length to which he had permitted his mind to run all this for the future the immediate question is can she be freed from her bonds  he was deep in his book when kate entered with excited greeting morton do you know that those women have been locked in their rooms all day for fear of clarke and pratt well they were clarke has gone stark mad with jealousy and even that besotted mother was afraid of him and admits it they would be there in that house prisoners this minute only for you  dont lay your wreath on my head keep it for lambert really kate he was magnificent little as he is he towered i had no doubt of his willingness and ability to kill either pratt or clarke and i dont think they questioned the integrity of his promise  kates mind took a new turn shes broken with clarke thank heaven but the mother clings to him in spite of all  i am about to suggest to mrs lambert that she go west with her husband leaving the girl in your care for a little while  i wish they would  she must be freed from even her mothers presence for a whilethat is if they really want to have her cured of her trances  i see said kate thoughtfully the mother is so closely associated with all that tapping  precisely i wish when mrs lambert is rested you would ask her to let me see her here i want to talk these matters over with her in private  theyre both lying down but ill tell her when she rises dont do anything rash she added with a reaction towards caution which amused him  you may trust me  she came back a few steps and hesitatingly said for after all morton the girl is abnormal  so are we allunder abnormal conditions i am going to see if i cant so change the current of her thought that she will forget her besetmentsand you must help me  shes shockingly pretty and it will be very dangerous having her beneath your very roof she gave a warning backward look how dare you permit it  i am a very brave man he replied with a smile and an inflection that puzzled her     xx  the mothers faith   mrs lambert entered timidly her gentle face sadder and its lipline firmer than he had ever seen it it was evident that the experiences of the last few days had touched her and shaken her  up to this time morton had considered her as a genial but rather negative personality a soul naturally subordinate to others but she now rose to an importance in his life which made her real self of the highest significance his first glance was one of sincerest admiration doubtless she had once been as slender and quite as tall as her daughter and though increasing age and weight had combined to rob her of height and grace she was nevertheless still a distinctly commanding figure her head was nobly fashioned her eyes a candid blue and her glance clear and unworn in its appeal  altogether he could not but acknowledge in her a mother of which no man need be ashamed and in this spirit he met her and invited her to a seat mr lambert and i have been talking of the mountains today he began i wish we were on our way out there this moment for i am tired of the city  she brightened under his smile i wouldnt mind going home at once but i know viola would be disappointed she has seen so little of the city and then mr clarke she broke off in some confusion as if in sudden recollection of the chasm which had opened between the young clergyman and her daughter  he seized upon this allusion to say i did not think of including mr clarke mrs lambert i think you and your daughter have both had too much of him i do not doubt his sincerity but i am quite certain that he was leading you both into an abyss i hope you will make the most of this chance to free yourself from his influence i quite stand with your husband in that resolution  her face grew cold again as to that i must wait for further illumination these last few hours have been so disturbed we are quite cut off from our guides  you depend upon themthey are very real to you are they not he spoke musingly  they are just as real to me as you areor any one  did you not doubt their wisdom today  she drew herself up why should i  they knew nothing of your husbands coming  oh yes they did only they couldnt communicate on account of violas mental condition then with unshakable conviction she added if i doubted them i should doubt everything  i am sorry to trouble you i am not one to needlessly destroy a comforting faith and yet i confess i thought the time had come to invoke your husbands aid it was in that spirit i sent the telegram  i am very glad you did although i had no fear i knew my father would find the right way when the time came let me tell you sir she replied expanding in the warmth of his interest before these revelations came to me i had no real faith in god or heaven the world beyond the grave was dark and cold it seemed to me as if my little boy and my husband were in the cruel wet ground i couldnt feel that they had gone to christ but now the tomb is but a portal to the light the spiritplane is as real as the earthplane and filled with joyous souls i can hear them sing sometimes when i hold violas hand and the sound is very beautiful and very comforting  i can understand that he answered but quietly critically still studying her face it has a warmer charm than any other religion i know  she went on eagerly i wish you could come to believe your sister said your mother and your uncle spoke last night why cant you accept the faith  the young philosopher gained as she spoke a new conception of her character and chilled with a growing sense of the difficult and ungracious task which lay before him he began to perceive that her awe of him had kept her silent thus concealing from him the spirit of the evangelist which he now saw she possessed she counted more largely in violas development than he had hitherto granted her faith was solidly based on years of experience and was not to be easily moved as she went on he perceived that her daughters mediumship was much more than a theory in her thought it was a fact and a daily almost an hourly necessity he lost his last suspicion of her and caught a glimpse of the larger aspect of her relationship to his future she was deceived of course but she was honest in every fibre he could not accuse her of the slightest deceit or falsification  in her lame way she tried to argue the question quoting the platitudes of the inspirational speakers as well as the pompous phrases of her spiritfather while he listened courteously  when she paused he said gravely my dear mrs lambert i cant leave you in any doubt of my position i cannot for a single instant accept what happened last night as the manifestation of the disembodied i cannot think that the phenomena exist i must rather think they were performed by clarke or my sister or weissmann in joke she looked at him with an expression of horror of incredulity and he went on quickly even if i admitted the fact of direct writing or the movement of the horn i should not by any means be driven to accept your spirithypothesis there are men and very great investigators who would say that your daughters trances and all phenomena connected therewith were pathologic explainable on the grounds of some obscure neural derangement i do not say this is the case but i do say that if she persists in these practices she will lose control of her mental faculties i have had a consultation today with dr tolman a man who makes a specialty of such cases and when i had laid the whole matter before him he and dr weissmann both advised the immediate stopping of these trances  we cant do that they come from the other side my father induces the trance and it is entirely in his hands  he fixed a keen look upon her did it ever occur to you that the words of your guides were in reality but a reflex of the wishes of pratt or clarke  how could that be when they came to me long before i even knew anthony  but was not the advice of a different quality at that time maybe your father yields to the will of living people when they are strong enough  oh no quite the contrary he opposes mr clarke often sometimes he opposes us all  i am perfectly sure that the voices that spoke to us last night were a subtle delusion an emanation from our own bodiesor the work of a joker my reason repels them as spirits  she smiled a little i think you scientific people go a long way round to explain a very simple thing ive read some of the explanations of the way in which you think these phenomena come but they are harder to understand than the thing itself my father my husband and my little son are alive i know that no one can destroy that faith in me  i do not wish to destroy that faithonly so far as it seems to threaten your daughter  i am perfectly sure they know better what we should do than any one on the earthplane i cannot see why you people oppose the idea of the spiritworld when it is so beautiful and could fill the world with hope the bible teaches it when you read it right it is full of references to spirits did not christ rise from the dead and manifest to his disciples  and did he not cast out devils  she was momentarily at a loss but soon recovered but if you admit there are evil spirits  but i dont i said that merely to show you that a sceptic can quote scripture to his purpose there is no place in my philosophy for the supernatural  that is what we believe she eagerly responded i used to be frightened by the things that happened to viola but now i know they are natural just as natural as anything else my loved ones are not far away they are very near but oh so intangible if i could only touch them in this was the cry of her soul she deeply sighed i am growing old and that means i live in the past more and more when waltie comes i can imagine myself as i was when we first went to the mountains robert means more and more to me and all fear of the change is gone really if it were not for viola i would like to go over to the other side tonight the spiritplane seems so much more carefree and bright this life is but a preparatory school at best  that is all wrong he decisively replied very wrong even if your idea of the other world were right you should not abandon your hold on this till your work was done a general condition of mind like yours would stop all invention all discovery and especially all philanthropy in fact the only philanthropy would be murder to end mans suffering here would be a duty war would be a blessing and disease a rescue no no you must not talk like that  oh im not really thinking of going i feel that i must stay a little while longer to see viola settled in life  what do you mean by that do you mean married and happy or do you mean given over entirely to the trance  i suppose she ought to marryshe is very unhappy as she is  now that is what i especially wanted to talk with you about i have decided to ask your daughter to put herself into my hands and i hope you will give your consent  i shall be glad to have you take charge of her professor and father i know is anxious to have you head the committee  oh i dont mean that i mean something much more intimate much more important this brought him face to face with himself and the decision over which he had agonized for so long and for an instant he hesitated then took the plunge bravely i love your daughter mrs lambert and i want your permission to tell her so  she drew back into her chair with a gasp of surprise and a look of alarm  oh i didnt understand i thought you meanti dont knowi she was utterly at a loss for words but he understood her  your hesitation is not flattering to me i hope you dont absolutely distrust me  her embarrassment was pitiful oh no indeed but you are a sceptic you dont believe in usin her  oh yes i do  and besides she has been promised for two years to tonymr clarke  he grew a little hard at mention of the preachers name but she fears and hates clarke she has broken with him she told my sister that she was done with him forever you will not ask her to marry a man she distrusts  she flew to clarkes defence that was only a mood a lovers quarrel he was all upset by pratt andand other things i will not allow her to desert him when he is in trouble he has been so much to us and he is a noble character in spite of all  all this is very disturbing to me he answered more humorously than he felt but nevertheless i also claim to be a noble character  she began once more to realize his place in the world and his kindness to viola i know that professor i fully recognize the honor you do her and me but she is not like other girls she is set aside to do gods work and ought not to marry at all that is why the guides have given her to anthony he too is consecrated  dear mrs lambert you shock me when you say such things i dont believe it is your daughters duty to convert people to a belief in immortality i dont believe in teaching men and women to depend upon an unseen world for guidance and especially do i despise any faith which makes this life less important than some other just beyond i love this life and do not intend to trouble myself about what lies beyond the grave that is really not my concern to regard this world as a vale of tears leading to a shining heaven is a species of mediævalism from which i revolt  she caught this up that is just the reason why viola would be unhappy with a sceptic  but i am not a sceptic i have the greatest faith i am certain i can make her happy here and now you surely would not permit her to go back to anthony clarke  she was troubled and confused i dont know perhaps it would be best after all a great deal of her power comes from him she brightened but i will leave all that to father  again he leaned to her with tender gravity you must not do that unless you deny the value of all life here on the earth you are an unnatural mother to devote your child to such a career as clarke holds out to her i love your daughter because she is a beautiful girl a charming personality and i am able to give her security and comfort i will be perfectly frank with you i think these trances have been fastened upon her by those about her and if she consents to come to me i shall stop them forever my aim will be to delude her into thinking life with me of more value than the highest eminence as a medium now if this seems treason to you i cannot soften it i want you to fully understand my position my schooling has been all in the exact sciences and what skill i possess i am using to make the world a healthier and happier place to live in your way of life and clarkes philosophy of life seems to me weak and morbid and your treatment of your daughter mistakenly cruel i intend to take her out of it if i can and furthermore dear lady if you withhold your consent which i profoundly hope you will not i must proceed without it if she comes to me she ceases to be a psychic if i can prevent it she will never sit again  the mother sat as if stunned by the weight of his will the rush of his words the decision of his glance she fully understood the situation she knew that viola already leaned upon and trusted this man more than any other being in the world and knowing this she felt the full force of the tragic situation it was not a question of a temporary separation that she foresaw as by some prophetic vision her baby her clinging loving girlchild was about to pass from her arms forever carrying with her all interest in life and all means of communication with her dead with her she was about to lose husband sonand all the blessed music of the happy multitudes of those on the spiritplane it was as if the shining portals to the world of light were about to be closed to her forever closed and barred by the hand of this implacable young lover and with a sudden most lamentable cry she sobbed forth oh i cant consent i cant bear to think of it  the sight of that placid motherly face breaking into lines of anguish while the gray old head bowed in weakness completely unmanned the selfcentred young scientist and bending above her he tenderly pleaded  dear mrs lambert you wring my heart with your weeping dont cry i beg of you i didnt intend to be harsh i only intended to be honest with you i wish you would trust me let me be a son to you even if viola does not care for me as i hope she does i can help you and even if she consents to my treatment the separation will only be for a few months or a year  you would take my hope from me you would rob me she challenged him with white and distorted face you are hard and cruel and i will not give her up i know her nature she is necessary to the spiritworld and you have no right to destroy her power  i am sorry if i seemed to attack your faith it has many beautiful things inwoven with its morbidities i would believe it if i could but i cant and in my present state of mind i can only repeat that however painful it may be to you i see no other way to save your daughter from insanity yes my dear mrs lambert the case is quite as desperate as that to my thinking and as i am beginning to centre my life in her also you will see that i am quite as deeply concerned as any one she has reached a dangerpoint she must not go on in this way another month  again those lines of serene obstinacy came back into her face and the gentle bigot looked from her eyes you are all wrong these trances are as natural as sleep they rest her do her goodfather says so he treats her from that side and is watching over her i admire you professor serviss i appreciate the honor you do me but i cannot consent to have viola go from me i cant endure the thought if you believed in the spiritworld and the guides consented i would be glad but you dont you hate everything concerning our faith and i am afraid of you i wish my girl had never seen you she rose in a panic of growing alarm let me go to her  he detained her gently just a moment remember i have not said a word of all this to her and your alarm may be quite groundless what do you fear if your guides are so wise and powerful where is your proselyting zeal am i not worthy of being converted why not let viola influence me towards your path  she sank back into her chair bewildered by his tone and he went on you considered mr clarke a most important instrument for spreading the light but i am egotistic enough to say that my conversion would mean more to your cause than fifty clarkes you forget also that your father was very anxious to have me brought into the circle you recall that  she faintly answered yes  well then let that count in my favor you call me a sceptic but i am really a slave to evidence i will go wherever the evidence leads i have no proof of the spiritworld but i am of open mind can you ask any more of me than that i have said that i intend to end violas career as a psychic if i can but if i cant if the manifestations go on in spite of me i will study them faithfully glad of any revelation of a new world which they may bring if you are so clear in your confidence so certain of your faith why not consent to let me speak to her  she rose again i cant do that i must not  he offered his hand with a smile your lack of confidence in me i forgive for i think i understand your feeling do not be deceived my suit does not end here i intend at the earliest moment to win your daughters consent to my plan there is only one thing i would like you to promise and that is this dont prejudice her against me let me speak to her first will you promise that  she shook her head i must tell her and we must sit for council  well then will you promise to let me sit with you will you promise to put off that sitting till i can be present it is only fair to me as i am quite as vitally affected as any one in the result come will you promise  she bowed her head in sign of consent and hastened towards the door  he stood aside to let her pass pitying her because understanding her and please dont distress her tonight let her live this evening as a joyous girl undisturbed even by my question  she went out fearstricken by the power of his glance the persuasion of his voice her instinct at the moment was to take her child and flee immuring herself far from those who would rob her of her only remaining interest in the world     xxi  clarke shadows the feast   viola looking up from a piece of antique jewelry which kate was displaying was startled by the sadness of her mothers face and directed her next glance upon morton in the wish to discover the cause of her trouble that the interview had been very grave and personal was evident and with a sense of having been the subject of discussion she rose to meet them  kate did not permit any explanations for dinner was waiting and time limited go fetch mr lambert morton unless we want to be late at the play we must go out at once  morton was glad of the interruption for he was eager to have his understanding with viola before the mother could bring any adverse influence to bear upon her as they went out into the diningroom side by side he found her nearness sweeter and more concerning than ever before and with a realization of having in a very vital way staked his immediate future upon her word he was unusually gay masking his persistent deephid doubt in jocose remarks lambert seconded him with quiet humor and together they caused even the mothers face to relax its troubled lines while viola yielding to a sense of freedom and of youth shook off all constraint responding to mortons unspoken suggestion thinking only of him and of the secure bright world in which he dwelt and in which he seemed so large and so handsome a figure and in this confidence and comfort they came to the mixing of the salad which kate slangily explained to be mortons particular stunt he had fully assembled his ingredients and was about to approach the actual delicate blending when the maid appeared at his elbow to say that he was wanted at the telephone  well tell them to wait he replied testily this is a very precise moment  i told them you were at dinner sir but they said it was important  he rose with a sigh i hope my whiff of garlic wont settle into a steady breeze be patient a moment kind people  with mild wonder as to what the news might be he took a seat at his desk and put the receiver to his ear  hello who is it  a hurried eager almost breathless boyish voice responded is this dr serviss  it is  can you tell me where miss viola lambert and her mother are  i cannot by which he meant he was not empowered to do so  i was told they left pratts house with you sometime this afternoon  have you inquired at the courtleigh  no i was so sure  try either the courtleigh or the colorado replied morton in the tone of authority  the voice then asked can you tell me where clarkes brooklyn relatives can be found  i cannot i know nothing whatever of mr clarkes family  i must find them clarke has committed suicide and it is necessary to notify his friends and  mortons brain blurred with the force of this blow you dont mean it when did it happen  about an hour ago we must find the lamberts and if you can give us any information  who are you  im a representative of the recorder can i see you for a few minutes dr serviss  i am just starting for the theatre hurriedly answered morton his voice as casual as he could make it and i fear it is impossible  it is very important dr serviss for pratt has told me that you know the lamberts and all about their relationship to clarke if you  it is quite impossible replied morton with decision and hung up the receiver for a few moments he sat in deep thought his mind leaping from point to point of this new complication as he analyzed the farreaching consequences of this tragic and terrible deed he bitterly exclaimed youve reached us now anthony clarke you have involved the woman you pretended to love and all her friends in a screaming sensation your name will be writ larger tomorrow than at any time during your whole life you could not have hit upon a more effective revenge  the situation grew each moment more satanic my name will be involved quite as prominently as hers the mother frantic with grief and remorse will hate me and bitterly reproach us all she will accuse us of causing his death but most important of all what will be the effect of this news on violas mental condition his thought ran to her as he had just left her radiant with hope and newfound happiness and it seemed as though the dead man had reached a remorseless clutching hand to regain final dominion over her his shadow hovered in the air above her head ready to envelop her  if i can only keep this from her for a few days till my own control of her has strengthened i must keep it from her she must not see tomorrows papers with their ghastly story he chilled with a fuller sense of the suicides power to torture her she must leave the city tonight she will be called before the coroner her mediumship and clarkes control of her will be howled through the street he groaned with the shame and anguish of the scene his imagination bodied forth pratts hand will also be felt he will have his own tale his own method of evasion and will not hesitate to dishonor her  furthermore this threatening shame so far from arousing a new distrust and a desire to escape further connection with her swept him into a profounder desire to serve and shield her his heart filled with pity and love and into his eyes a stern lightthe light of battlecame she shall not be tortured so if i can defend her or lead the way to escape lambert must leave the city at once and take them both with him  he rose and walked about the room in order to recover command of his face and voice truly the miserable fanatic has wrought well he has promised himself that his spirit freed from the body will be able to possess and control his victim the mother will understand and accept this will viola the thought of her dominated by this new and revolting delusion filled him with dismay and horror she too will be smitten with remorse and the scale may be turned against me and my influence this was indeed the most disturbing consideration of all  realizing at length that every additional minute of absence made his explanation more difficult he returned to his guests with impassive face and resolute determination to control his thought even from violas mindreading power  kate saw at once that some dark thing shadowed him what is it morton  one of my acquaintances has met with troublefinancial troubleand wants my help ill tell you about it later he curtly replied attacking the salad again she was silenced though not satisfied and dinner was resumed in almost painful silence and in general depression  viola was especially troubled by the change in mortons face and with a desire to be of some comfort to him softly said perhaps you would rather not go to the theatre tonight please dont do so on our account  her glance and her tone both more intimately sympathetic than she had hitherto permitted them to be touched him deeply and with an effect of throwing off his gloom he cheerily responded we will not let any outside matter interfere with our happiness there is nothing to be gained by staying at home please forget all about this interruption  as he spoke she sat with hands before her gazing straight at him with eyes that slowly lost their outward look her eyelids fell she began to whiten and to droop and her hands twitched and trembled  seized for an instant with an unreasoning feara belief that she had been able after all to penetrate his mind and read its dreadful secret morton sat irresolute in the grasp of a blind despair a palsy of the will clarkes dead hand seemed at the instant more powerful than the living man had been this stupefaction lasted but a single second for back to the young scientists heart like a swelling wave came the red blood of his anger his love his mastering will rising swiftly but calmly he caught her hands in his saying gently you are forgetting your promise to me look at me i want to see if you are really going to disobey my commands  she slowly raised her face to him but only faintly responded to his voice i cannot permit this he went on you have left this behind you i will not permit you to give way it is a kind of treason to meyour physician for my sake you must put this weakness aside and assert your real self he spoke gently tenderly as the lover rather than as the man of science and the mysterious power of his hand the passionate pity of his eyes restored her to selfmastery and she murmured  please forgive me i didnt mean to do this  i know that but you must not invite your trouble you laid your hands upon the table you must not do that ill order you to eat off the mantelpiece if you do that again he added with intent to make her smile  mrs lambert who had risen to go to violas relief sank back into her seat with a sense of being forgotten at a time when she should have been her daughters first thought she was no longer necessary her place had been taken by another a man and a stranger hostile to her faith and with this knowledge her heart grew cold and bitter with defeat and despair the anguish and the neglect which are to be forevermore the darker side of the mothers glory had come to her at last with cruel force  the entire attack lasted but a few minutes but it served to bring viola nearer to her lover than all the hours of their more formal intercourse though the full revelation of his true relationship was yet to come  she loved and trusted him but as her friend her defender she rose at last to demonstrate that she was entirely herself again i am ashamed of myself she said humbly please dont look so concerned she turned to kate i assure you it was only a little faintness you see i didnt sleep very well last night  lets not try to go out interposed kate youre tired  oh no please please dont let me spoil the evening i will never forgive myself truly i want to go  mortons glance instructed kate and she said very well we will go dress while the men finish their coffee come mrs lambert  mrs lambert rose silently and the three women left the room together with an effect of haste  no sooner were they out of the room than morton turned to his guest with most serious look and tone come to my study mr lambert i want a few very private words with you  the miner followed his host with mild wonder expressed on his face and as the door closed behind them and they were secure of being overheard he remarked with a chuckle you headed off old daddy mcleod out there first it was clarke and then daddy i thought he had her this time  morton ignored this remark and with most decisive utterance said you must take your wife and daughter out of town by the very next train clarke has killed himself and viola will be the centre of a flaming sensation tomorrow morning she must be taken away tonight  lambert remained standing perfectly rigid for a few moments then slowly seated himself was that your trouble over the phone  yes  who told you  a reporter phoning from pratts house apparently  when did it happen  he said an hour ago that may mean more or lessa fiend could not have planned a more inclusive revenge we will all be involved in it if he died by poison we may even be accused of killing him they are already in pursuit of you and the police may arrive at any moment at the least we will all be summoned before the coroner he paused a moment but that isnt all i fear the effect of this news on violas mind  lamberts eyes lost their keen glitter and his facial muscles fell slack he spoke in a low voice weighted with deepest conviction he will manifest then as a light came into his eyes he exclaimed he was trying to control her just now  morton ignored this remark if we can keep this news from her for a few days i defy any of her socalled controls to affect her  lambert stirred uneasily in his chair i dont know about that clarke had a strong hold on her  he is dead he has done his worst responded morton i tell you it is your business to get as far from the city tonight as you can and keep ahead of the news if possible  that wont do any good she is clairvoyant shell know of it  she didnt know you were coming today did she  no  and she has no knowledge yet of clarkes death her attack at the table may have been as she says only a feeling of faintness besides hes been dead two hours and these manifestations always take place at the exact moment of death do they not  lambert brightened thats so but im scared of whatll happen if he should manifest  be assured he can no more manifest as you call it than a dead dog keep the newspapers from your wife and daughter and it will be a long time before they learn of his death through any occult channel i stake my reputation on that  i wish i felt as certain of that as you do the miner answered ive seen so many impossible things happen im kind o shaky i wish i could have your help he rose with a shiver of dread youre right i see that weve got to get out of here but it wont do to go back home  take ship and go abroad  i cant do that i cant leave my business so long he paced up and down suppose i had a telegram to meet a man in montreala mining man  a good idea exclaimed morton you could cross the border before the news could overtake you the canadian papers will make little of the suicide but will your people go  theyll have to go replied lambert firmly leave that to me he took a telegram from among several old ones in his pocket ive just received this you understand  kate knocked and called were all ready morton  he opened the door come in kate i want to talk with you im afraid our theatreparty is off mr lambert has received a very important message which may take him out of town  oh im so sorry cried kate cant you wait till tomorrow  im afraid not replied lambert looks like id have to go tonight and i want the girls to go along with me and so saying with the telegram open in his hand he went out into the sittingroom where viola and her mother were standing dressed for the carriage girls he called persuasively dont you want to go to montreal  when inquired viola  tonight  oh not tonight we want to go to the theatre wait till tomorrow  kate was about to join in this protest when morton drew her into his study and shut the door dont stop them he said almost fiercely they must go  do you mean to escape clarke  yes clarke or rather his ghost  his ghost what do you mean she asked with startled eyes  he has killed himselfhush now they must not know it and they must flee dont you see that this may undo all my plans for the girls redemption and may enslave her more deeply than ever the papers will be full of clarke tomorrow morning pratts wealth my connection with an institution insures a tremendous scarehead the mother will be consciouswrung and the whole weight of the infernal tragedy will crush down on viola the only possible respite for her is to cross the border into canada outrun the newsmongers and trust in time to heal her mental derangements  kates eyes expanded with the same fear that filled lambert you dont suppose he will be able to haunt her was that what happened at the table  no not in the sense you mean he is dead and i have no fear of his ghost but the memory of him will torture her soul and if she believes that he is able to come to her the belief will be almost as tragic as the fact  morton it is a test she exclaimed with breathless solemnity if there is any truth in spiritualism he will manifest himself to her and you cannot prevent it  i know it is a test and i welcome it i stake all that i am on the issue she was at her merriest when he was dying she has no hint of his deed at this moment and with all her clairvoyance i am perfectly certain she will not be able to read what is in our minds if you can restrain your tongue if you cant do that i beg of you to stay in your room he was harsh and curt in his tone and she shrank from him her mental health her sanity may be in peril  i can keep silence she replied but oh morton think of that poor girlup there in some bleak hotel in canada with only these two old people suppose he does come to her there what can they do wouldnt it be better to keep her herelet her learn it herewhere you can help her  and be haled before the coroner to be charged perhaps with poisoning clarke or some other equally monstrous thing no i have been all over the ground and i tell you there is no other way she must go tonight the police may arrive at any moment  then you must go with her she retorted with a decision almost equal to his own she needs you  no no i cant do that he replied impatiently almost angrily i would be accused of abducting her it is utterly out of the question  kate knowing that she was asking a good deal went resolutely on she has no one but you to lean upon she trusts you and she ought to have some strong sane person on whom to rely i would be worse than useless up there i am scared out of my wits at thought of clarkes possible revenge upon her besides by going with her you will escape some of the notoriety about to thrust upon you  he was plainly vacillating think of the fat newsitems my flight will add to the stew  kate shuddered oh i know i hope you dont blame meits true i am to blame i did insist on your going to see her she was beginning to suffer with this thought when he put out his hand and drew her to him with affectionate wish to comfort her  dont assume that worry kit she profoundly interested me from the first and i do not regret my acquaintance with hereven at this moment i believe she is essentially untouched by this business and that she can be cleansed of all clarkes influence his death removes her worst enemy and if i can persuade her parents to leave her with us i am perfectly certain i can root out the deepest of her delusions  then go she said in final surrender conventions ought not to count against saving a sweet good girl go and help her and if you bring her back here ill receive her gladly  morton opened the door and while kate went to viola he said mr lambert if you will add me to your party i will be glad to go with you  lambert seized his hosts hand and wrung it hard my boy you save my life i thought of asking you but i couldnt find the nerve well all need youthe girl worst of all tears were in his eyes as he added huskily yes we need you  viola with shining face came running towards them oh professor serviss is it true are you going  yes if you will let me  let you oh you dont know what it means to have you with us  he looked down upon her with a smile whose full message she could not read but it expressed something very tender and disconcerting you cant know what it means to me to go you see i darent quite trust you alone with these indulgent parents and as your physician it is my duty to see that my prescriptions are fully carried out  during the bustle of preparation for the journey he found opportunity to reassure kate thus far she has no inkling of what is in our minds he closed his fist as if shaking it in the face of an implacable foe and through his set teeth added i accept the challenge i welcome you and all your dark band to the utterance  kate turned pale dont say that she whispered its like tempting providence  i fear neither providence nor demons but i am afraid of you keep away from viola as much as you can if there is any truth in mindreading she is likelier to divine your thought than mine  kates eyes suddenly grew dim morton i brought this on you and im beginning to doubt i dont believe i want you to go with her after all she put her hands on his shoulders and gave way to a feeling of loss and loneliness ive always hopedive always looked forward to your having a splendid dignified wife and though i like her i dont believeshes up to you  now dont trouble about that sis the important thing to me is am i worthy of her she entered my heart the first time i saw her and has never left it she came at a time when i was certain no woman would ever move me again i am indebted to hernow thats the truth and sohe stooped and kissed herif she decides to come to me i shall feel grateful to you if she decides not to comeyou can be grateful to her     xxii  the spiritual rescue   with a conviction that he was entering upon a new order in his life morton serviss opened the door of the coach for viola and her mother never before had he evaded a contest or asked for consideration from authority and deceit had been quite foreign to him but now after a deceptive word to the hallboy he was conscious of furtively scanning the people approaching on the walk aware of his weakness and his doubt for no man of regular and candid life can become a fugitive with entire belief in the righteousness of his flight he must perforce of conscience look back for a moment  once within the carriage he put all question aside and joined lambert in his attempt to keep from the women the slightest suspicion that his sudden departure involved any serious change in their fortunes the miner had taken his place beside his wife thus bringing the young people side by side on the forward seat and this arrangement had much to do with filling mortons mind with a new and delicious content for violas face was almost constantly lifted to his and at every lurch of the vehicle her soft shoulder touched his arm while the faint perfume of her garments rose like some enchanters incense dulling his sense of duties abandoned quickening his delight in her beauty and restoring his joy in his own youth what did the judgment of the world matter at such a time  he said little on the ride just enough to hold the conversation to subjects far removed from the causes of their retreat he was convinced of violas ability to read in a vague way what lay in his thought but he also believed in his power to prevent this by a positive and aggressive attitude of mind beneath his silences as beneath his words ran an undercurrent of suggestion from his subliminal self to hers lambert rose nobly to his duty and directed the conversation to the mine and its increasing generosity of output and to news of the men and their families in whom viola took deep interest in the midst of this most wholesome recollection they ended their drive  at the station morton remained on guard with the women while lambert attended to the trunks and boxes and at the earliest moment with care not to betray haste they passed through the gates and into their car but no feeling of relief came to either of the men till the train began to move then lambert with a profound sigh exclaimed well now were off and weve got the trunks so lets be happy  mrs lambert alone remained sad and distraught and her husband soon drew her away to their own seat leaving the young people together a deed for which morton silently but none the less fervently thanked him affording as it did the chance for his longdesired personal explanation  the car was sparsely occupied and the section opposite was quite empty and with a sense of being quite alone with viola he lightly began i feel like a truant schoolboy and im wondering what weissmann will say tomorrow morning when his firstassistant fails to appear  i hope you are not neglecting your work forfor us she said losing a little of her brightness  nothing will suffer i do not profess to be the main prop of our laboratory and besides i dont care im off for a holiday whether or no at the word holiday clarkes grisly shadow rose between them and would not down to the suicide his holiday was due  viola again seemed to dimly divine his thought for she hesitatingly said i am troubled about mr clarke i must write him a letter and tell him that i dont hate him now i really begin to feel sorry for him and i wish i hadnt been so hard  you have nothing to reproach yourself for and you would better let him pass entirely out of your life and be glad the wrench is over he decisively replied  she sighed and shivered a little he knew we were deserting him his look haunts me i wish i had stopped to say goodbye he will be very lonely without us  he is too fanatic to win my sympathy and he has forfeited yours  but he was sincere professor he really wanted to make the world happier  he was resolute to keep her mind clear of all thought of clarke and imperiously said dont call me professor and lets talk of other and pleasanter things than clarke we are well out of his shadowworld and you are never to reenter it i want you to forget that you ever sat in a circle or heard a voice  oh i cant expect to pass entirely out of that she exclaimed as though the possibility came near her for the first time on mothers account i must continue to sit now and then she couldnt live without her communion with papa and waltie  this brought him face to face with his opportunity and he seized it manfully your saying that gives me opportunity for saying something which has been taking shape in my mind since last night i do not pretend to fully understand the basis of your mothers faith and i do not blame her but i am filled with indignation that you should be called upon to suffer bondage to the dead i rebel against it his voice was tense with feeling and i will not have it so i lunched today with dr tolman of whom youve heard me speak and after describing your case to himwithout using your name of coursei asked his opinion in reply he gave me every encouragement the fact that you are young and in good physical health he said makes it possible for you to become as normal as any other girl  do you believe that dr serviss  i am perfectly certain of it if you will meet my conditions i am confident of my power to free you from your trances and all their phenomena but you must at once and for all time break every tie that binds you to your controls  im afraid they will not consent  you must not say such a thing much less think it he sharply interrupted your soul your mind should be sovereign you should look rather to science for guidancehere he smiled meaninglyand to me of course as a representative of science if you acknowledge the authority of the dead or even that of your mother my power is to that extent curtailed it is to be in effect a war of light and darkness science and superstition we are willing to join issue with your shadow foes provided your best self is with us in the struggle i engage myself to free you if you will permit me to act  she leaned towards him with pale face and limpid heavenly eyes you have been good to me but i cannot ask you to fight my battles you have so much else to do in the world  i have nothing better to do he responded with a lovers glance nothing can interest me so profoundly nothing will give me greater pleasure  she went on fervently i cant tell you how you comfort me when you are near me i have no fear of anything but you oughtnt to give up your work to treat me we can never pay you for what youve already done for us  dont try and pray dont exaggerate my sacrifices you must remember i am an investigator and youare a most absorbing problem she drew away from him slightly and he returned to a more serious tone the influence of mind over mind is the present or at least the coming problem and you have opened a new world to me the question of your future your cure absorbs me and while i am by no means a rich man as money runs these days i am quite able to follow out any line of investigation which may interest me  her face clouded i wish i didnt have to be investigated  so do i and that brings up something which i must say even at the risk of seeming hard and cruel if you wish to live your full free life you must cut yourself off from all of your old associations clarke and pratt have passed out of your life but your mother he paused abruptly when he resumed his tone was almost pleading you have said that you trusted me that you wished for my help did you mean it  i did indeed i did  very well then he went on i will speak my mind i must be very candid even if i seem harsh when i say you must cut yourself off from all the associations of the past i mean your mother also  she started up in dismay understanding his full meaning at last oh no not that  yes just that and finally that she is your mother and you love her but you are a human soul as well as she with a right to healthy normal life it is contrary to the law of progress to sacrifice the young to the old your mothers comfort has been your undoing and i cannot for an instant agree to your submission of this question to her you must assert your right to yourself and she must surrender her authority to me and she must leave you for a time i would say this even if my own mother spoke to me through you your struggles tear my heart and your mothers presence only prolongs your sufferings  you must not blame her she loyally insisted i am to blame my guides tell me that if i would surrender myself completely to them i would find peace she ended slowly sadly as if in confession  peace yes the peace of the epileptic or the mad no no joy and health do not lie that way if i were the scientist merely i would say keep on and i will stand by to observe your struggles but i am not i am something else than scientist it angers and agonizes me to see you tortured i cannot endure it and i will not in order that i may do all that i hope for you must give yourself wholly into my care he was speaking now in a low and throbbing voice oblivious of time and space i must be something more than physician or friend i have been saying must to you but i am after all a very strange autocrat my power is dependent on you then in answer to her questioning eyes he hurried on i love you dear girl and if you find you can trust yourself to me fully in this way then i am sure of victory can you say this i hope you can for then i will have the most powerful magician in all the world fighting on my side are you able to do this can you say you love me and that you will come to me trusting in me as in a husband  no one was astir in the car but the porter but had it been filled with clamoring tongues and seeking impertinent eyes she would have been conscious only of his tender glance his earnest voice and the momentous question being pressed upon her she struggled to speak but could not and he hastened on i will be honest with you your mother does not trust me she knows and resents my feeling towards you she knows also that i consider her separation from you necessary for a time and is hurt and saddened by it but she will come to see the necessity of this measure i do not ask an immediate answerthough i wish your heart were mine this minutebut i do want you to know that from the first moment i saw you your life has been a part of mine i could not forget you though i tried to do so and i will not now give you up  she still sat like an exquisite statue of meditation looking out into the night benumbed and breathless with the passion his words evoked suddenly she turned and vehemently exclaimed you ought not to ask me this im not fit to be your wife  let me be the judge of that     illustration you need not speakjust put your hand in mine    and i will understand  but you dont realize what i am you must not think of me in that way i cant let you i am different from other women you must not deceive yourself  i do not i know to my joy that you are different from other girls that is why i am here and asking you to be my wife that is why i loved you that day on the mountainside because you were different  no no she despairingly exclaimed you dont understand i mean that i am surrounded by spirits and they will make you ashamed of me think what your friends would say  i am not responsible to my friends i dont care what they say they are not choosing my wife for me i do know what you mean and your protest increases my love for you i am not concerned with your ghostsonly with your character  but i am a medium she went on desperately i have this awful power youre all wrong about mother and mr clarke they have nothing to do with what happens her beautiful hands were clinched and her face set in the resolution to force her confession upon him her bosom rose and fell piteously as she struggled for words you must not misunderstand me i believe in the spiritworld sometimes i say i dont but i do  he spoke soothingly there is nothing wrong or disgraceful in your theory it is your practice of trance of mediumship to which i object and which i intend to prevent  i want you to do that i hate my trances and those public circles but will that put an end to the rappings and other things that go on around me when i am awake that is the question  this was the question but he rode sturdily over it resolute to subordinate it if not to trample it under foot  not at all the real question is very simple can you trust yourself to me fully because you love me if you do i will answer for the rest i do not know why you meant so much to me that day i do not know why out of all the women i know you move me most profoundly but so it is and i am glad to have it so he said this with a grave tenderness which moved her like a phrase from some great symphony and as she raised her tearstained timid face to his she saw him as he seemed at that first meeting on the mountainside in the sunset glow so manly so frank so full of power that he conquered her with a glance and with that vision she knew her heart her eyes fell her throat thickened and her bosom throbbed with a strange yearning she loved but the way of confession was hard  understanding her emotion and mindful of the place in which they sat he softly said you need not speakjust put your hand in mine and i will understand  her hand like some shy sentient thing first drew away fell hesitant then leaped to his and nestled in his palm he had planned to be very restrained and very circumspect but the touch of her trembling fingers moved him out of his predetermined selfpossession and careless of all the surroundings he stooped and kissed her then exultantly warningly said remember i am now your chief control and there are to be no other guides but me  with those words all fear all question all care save that vague distrust which the maiden feels when yielding herself to the first caress of the lover dropped from her the powers the hallucinations which had separated her from the world of womankind were forgotten lost in the glow of her confidence and love   the end
