39041536	deep waters  by ww jacobs     paying off  my biggest fault said the nightwatchman gloomily has been good nature  ive spent the best part of my life trying to do my fellow creeturs a good turn  and what do i get for it  if all the people ive helped was to come ere now there wouldnt be standing room for them on this wharf  arf of them would be pushed overboardand a good place for em too  ive been like it all my life  i was goodnatured enough to go to sea as a boy because a skipper took a fancy to me and wanted my elp and when i got older i was goodnatured enough to get married  all my life ive given elp and advice free and only a day or two ago one of em wot i ad given it to came round here with her usband and er two brothers and er mother and two or three people from the same street to see her give me wot for  another fault o mine has been being sharp  most people make mistakes and they cant bear to see anybody as dont  over and over agin i have showed people ow silly they ave been to do certain things and told em wot i should ha done in their place but i cant remember one that ever gave me a thank you for it  there was a man ere arf an hour ago that reminded me of both of these faults  he came in apurpose to remind me and e brought a couple o grinning brassfaced monkeys with im to see im do it  i was sitting on that barrel when he came and arter two minutes i felt as if i was sitting on redot cinders  he purtended he ad come in for the sake of old times and to ask arter my ealth and all the time he was doing is best to upset me to amuse them two pore objecks e ad brought with im  captin mellun is his name and e was always a foolish softeaded sort o man and how he as kept is job i cant think  he used to trade between this wharf and bristol on a little schooner called the firefly and seeing wot a silly foolish kind o man he was i took a little bit o notice of im  many and many a time when e was going to do something hed ha been sorry for arterwards i ave taken im round to the bears head and stood im pint arter pint until he began to see reason and own up that i was in the right  his crew was amost as bad as wot he was and all in one month one o the ands gave a man ten shillings for a dimond ring he saw im pick up wot turned out to be worth fourpence and another one gave five bob for a meerschaum pipe made o chalk  when i pointed out to em wot fools they was they didnt like it and a week arterwards when the skipper gave a man in a pub is watch and chain and two pounds to hold to show is confidence in im and i told im exactly wot i thought of him e didnt like it  youre too sharp bill he says sneering like  my opinion is that the pore man was run over  he told me e should only be away five minutes  and he ad got an honest face nice open blue eyes and a smile that done you good to look at  youve been swindled i ses and you know it  if id been done like that i should never hold up my ead agin  why a child o five would know better  you and your crew all seem to be tarred with the same brush  you aint fit to be trusted out alone  i believe e told his ands wot i said anyway two bits o coke missed me by arf an inch next evening and for some weeks not one of em spoke a word to me  when they see me coming they just used to stand up straight and twist their nose  it didnt urt me o course  i took no notice of em  even when one of em fell over the broom i was sweeping with i took no notice of im  i just went on with my work as if e wasnt there  i suppose they ad been in the sulks about a month and i was sitting ere one evening getting my breath arter a couple o hours ard work when one of em george tebb by name came off the ship and nodded to me as he passed  evening bill he ses  evening i ses rather stiff  i wanted a word with you bill he ses in a low voice  in fact i might go so far as to say i want to ask you to do me a favour  i looked at him so ard that he coughed and looked away  we might talk about it over a arfpint he ses  no thank you i ses  i ad a arfpint the day before yesterday and im not thirsty  he stood there fidgeting about for a bit and then he puts his and on my shoulder  well come to the end of the jetty he ses  ive got something private to say  i got up slowlike and followed im  i wasnt a bit curious  not a bit but if a man asks for my elp i always give it  its like this he ses looking round careful only i dont want the other chaps to hear because i dont want to be laughed at  last week an old uncle o mine died and left me thirty pounds  its just a week ago and ive already got through five of em and besides that the number of chaps that want to borrow ten bob for a couple o days would surprise you  i aint so easy surprised i ses shaking my ead  it aint safe with me he ses and the favour i want you to do is to take care of it for me  i know itll go if i keep it  ive got it locked up in this box  and if you keep the box ill keep the key and when i want a bit ill come and see you about it  he pulled a little box out of is pocket and rattled it in my ear  theres fiveandtwenty golden goblins in there he ses  if you take charge of em theyll be all right  if you dont im pretty certain i shant ave one of em in a week or twos time  at fust i said i wouldnt ave anything to do with it but he begged so ard that i began to alter my mind  youre as honest as daylight bill he ses very earnest  i dont know another man in the world i could trust with twentyfive quid especially myself  now put it in your pocket and look arter it for me one of the quids in it is for you for your trouble  he slipped the box in my coatpocket and then he said is mind was so relieved that e felt like arf a pint  i was for going to the bears head the place i generally go to because it is next door to the wharf so to speak but george wanted me to try the beer at another place he knew of  the wharfs all right he ses  theres one or two ands on the ship and they wont let anybody run away with it  from wot he said i thought the pub was quite close but instead o that i should think we walked pretty nearly a mile afore we got there  nice snug place it was and the beer was all right although as i told george tebb it didnt seem to me any better than the stuff at the bears head  he stood me two arfpints and was just going to order another when e found e adnt got any money left and he wouldnt hear of me paying for it because e said it was his treat  well ave a quid out o the box he ses  i must ave one to go on with anyway  i shook my ead at im  only one he ses and thatll last me a fortnight  besides i want to give you the quid i promised you  i gave way at last and he put his and in is trouserpocket for the key and then found it wasnt there  i must ha left it in my chest he ses  ill op back and get it and afore i could prevent im he ad waved his and at me and gorn  my fust idea was to go arter im but i knew i couldnt catch im and if i tried to meet im coming back i should most likely miss im through the side streets  so i sat there with my pipe and waited  i suppose i ad been sitting down waiting for him for about ten minutes when a couple o sailormen came into the bar and began to make themselves a nuisance  big fat chaps they was and both of em more than arf sprung  and arter calling for a pint apiece they began to take a little notice of me  where dyou come from ses one of em  ome i ses very quiet  its a good placeome ses the chap shaking his ead  can you sing ome sweet ome  you seem to ave got wot i might call a singing face  never mind about my face i ses very sharp  you mind wot youre doing with that beer  youll ave it over in a minute  the words was ardly out of my mouth afore e gave a lurch and spilt his pint all over me  from ead to foot i was dripping with beer and i was in such a temper i wonder i didnt murder im but afore i could move they both pulled out their pocketankerchers and started to rub me down  thatll do i ses at last arter they ad walked round me arfadozen times and patted me all over to see if i was dry  you get off while youre safe  it was my mistake mate ses the chap who ad spilt the beer  you get outside i ses  go on both of you afore i put you out  they gave one look at me standing there with my fists clenched and then they went out like lambs and i eard em trot round the corner as though they was afraid i was following  i felt a little bit damp and chilly but beer is like seawateryou dont catch cold through itand i sat down agin to wait for george tebb  he came in smiling and out o breath in about ten minutes time with the key in is and and as soon as i told im wot had appened to me with the beer he turned to the landlord and ordered me six o rum ot at once  drink that up he ses anding it to me but fust of all give me the box so as i can pay for it  i put my and in my pocket  then i put it in the other one and arter that i stood staring at george tebb and shaking all over  wots the matter  wot are you looking like that for he ses  it must ha been them two i ses choking  while they was purtending to dry me and patting me all over they must ave taken it out of my pocket  wot are you talking about  ses george staring at me  the box as gorn i ses putting down the ot rum and feeling in my trouserpocket  the box as gorn and them two must ave taken it  gorn ses george  gorn  my box with twentyfive pounds in wot i trusted you with gorn  wot are you talking about  it cant beits too crool  he made such a noise that the landlord wot was waiting for is money asked im wot he meant by it and arter he ad explained im blest if the landlord didnt advise him to search me  i stood still and let george go through my pockets and then i told im i ad done with im and i never wanted to see im agin as long as i lived  i dare say ses george i dare say  but youll come along with me to the wharf and see the skipper  im not going to lose fiveandtwenty quid through your carelessness  i marched along in front of im with my ead in the air and when he spoke to me i didnt answer him  he went aboard the ship when we got to the wharf and a minute or two arterwards e came to the side and said the skipper wanted to see me  the airs the skipper gave imself was sickening  he sat down there in is miserable little ratole of a cabin and acted as if e was a judge and i was a prisoner  most of the ands ad squeezed in there too and the things they advised george to do to me was remarkable  silence ses the skipper  now watchman tell me exactly ow this thing appened  ive told you once i ses  i know ses the skipper but i want you to tell me again to see if you contradict yourself  i cant understand ow such a clever man as you could be done so easy  i thought i should ha bust but i kept my face wonderful  i just asked im wot the men was like that got off with is watch and chain and two pounds in case they might be the same  thats different he ses  oh ses i  ow  i lost my own property he ses but you lost georges and ow a man like you thats so much sharper and cleverer than other people could be had so easy i cant think  why a child of five would ha known better  a baby in arms would ha known better ses the man wot ad bought the dimond ring  ow could you ave been so silly bill  at your time o life too  thats neither ere nor there ses the skipper  the watchman has lost twentyfive quid belonging to one o my men  the question is wot is he going to do about it  nothing i ses  i didnt ask im to let me mind the box  he done it of is own free will  its got nothing to do with me  oh hasnt it ses the skipper drawing imself up  i dont want to be too ard on you but at the same time i cant let my man suffer  ill make it as easy as i can and i order you to pay im five shillings a week till the twentyfive pounds is cleared off  i laughed i couldnt elp it  i just stood there and laughed at im  if you dont ses the skipper then i shall lay the facts of the case afore the guvnor  whether hell object to you being in a pub a mile away taking care of a box of gold while you was supposed to be taking care of the wharf is his bisness  my bisness is to see that my man as is rights  ear ear  ses the crew  you please yourself watchman ses the skipper  youre such a clever man that no doubt you could get a better job tomorrow  there must be eaps of people wanting a man like you  its for you to decide  thats all ive got to sayfive bob a week till pore george as got is money back or else i put the case afore the guvnor  wot did you say  i said it agin and as e didnt seem to understand i said it once more  please yourself e ses when i ad finished  youre an old man and five bob a week cant be much loss to you  youve got nothing to spend it on at your time o life  and youve got a very soft job ere  wot  i didnt answer im  i just turned round and arter giving a man wot stood in my way a punch in the chest i got up on deck and on to the wharf and said my little say all alone to myself behind the crane  i paid the fust five bob to george tebb the next time the ship was up and arter biting em over and over agin and then ringing em on the deck e took the other chaps round to the bears head  praps its just as well its appened he ses  five bob a week for nearly two years aint to be sneezed at  its slow but its sure  i thought e was joking at fust but arter working it out in the office with a bit o pencil and paper i thought i should ha gorn crazy  and when i complained about the time to george e said i could make it shorter if i liked by paying ten bob a week but e thought the steady five bob a week was best for both of us  i got to ate the sight of im  every week regular as clockwork he used to come round to me with his and out and then go and treat is mates to beer with my money  if the ship came up in the daytime at six oclock in the evening hed be at the wharf gate waiting for me and if it came up at night she was no sooner made fast than e was over the side patting my trouserpocket and saying wot a good job it was for both of us that i was in steady employment  week arter week and month arter month i went on paying  i amost forgot the taste o beer and if i could manage to get a screw o baccy a week i thought myself lucky  and at last just as i thought i couldnt stand it any longer the end came  i ad just given george is weeks moneyand ow i got it together that week i dont knowwhen one o the chaps came up and said the skipper wanted to see me on board at once  tell im if he wants to see me im to be found on the wharf i ses very sharp  he wants to see you about georges money ses the chap  i should go if i was you  my opinion is he wants to do you a good turn  i ung fire for a bit and then arter sweeping up for a little while deliberatelike i put down my broom and stepped aboard to see the skipper wot was sitting on the cabin skylight purtending to read a newspaper  he put it down when e see me and george and the others wot ad been standing in a little bunch forard came aft and stood looking on  i wanted to see you about this money watchman ses the skipper putting on is beastly frills agin  o course we all feel that to a pore man like you its a bit of a strain and as george ses arter all you have been more foolish than wicked  much more ses george  i find that you ave now paid five bob a week for nineteen weeks ses the skipper and george as been kind enough and generous enough to let you off the rest  theres no need for you to look bashful george its a credit to you  i could ardly believe my ears  george stood there grinning like a stuck fool and two o the chaps was on their best behaviour with their ands over their mouths and their eyes sticking out  thats all watchman ses the skipper and i ope itll be a lesson to you not to neglect your dooty by going into publicouses and taking charge of other peoples money when you aint fit for it  i shant try to do anybody else a kindness agin if thats wot you mean i ses looking at im  no youd better not he ses  this partickler bit o kindness as cost you four pounds fifteen and thats a curious thing when you come to think of it  very curious  wot dye mean  i ses  why he ses grinning like a madman its just wot we lost between us i lost a watch and chain worth two pounds and another couple o pounds besides joe lost ten shillings over is dimond ring and charlie lost five bob over a pipe  thats four pounds fifteenjust the same as you  them silly fools stood there choking and sobbing and patting each other on the back as though theyd never leave off and all of a sudden i ad a orrible suspicion that i ad been done  did you see the sovereigns in the box i ses turning to the skipper  no he ses shaking his ead  ow do you know they was there then  ses i  because you took charge of em said the skipper and i know wot a clever sharp chap you are  it stands to reason that you wouldnt be responsible for a box like that unless you saw inside of it  why a child o five wouldnt  i stood there looking at im but he couldnt meet my eye  none of em could and arter waiting there for a minute or two to give em a chance i turned my back on em and went off to my dooty
