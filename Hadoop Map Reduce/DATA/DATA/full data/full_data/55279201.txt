contented man                                           mountjoy or some passages out of the life of a castlebuilder  i was born among romantic scenery in one of the wildest parts of the hudson which at that time was not so thickly settled as at present my father was descended from one of the old huguenot families that came over to this country on the revocation of the edict of nantz he lived in a style of easy rural independence on a patrimonial estate that had been for two or three generations in the family he was an indolent goodnatured man who took the world as it went and had a kind of laughing philosophy that parried all rubs and mishaps and served him in the place of wisdom this was the part of his character least to my taste for i was of an enthusiastic excitable temperament prone to kindle up with new schemes and projects and he was apt to dash my sallying enthusiasm by some unlucky joke so that whenever i was in a glow with any sudden excitement i stood in mortal dread of his goodhumor  yet he indulged me in every vagary for i was an only son and of course a personage of importance in the household i had two sisters older than myself and one younger the former were educated at new york under the eye of a maiden aunt the latter remained at home and was my cherished playmate the companion of my thoughts we were two imaginative little beings of quick susceptibility and prone to see wonders and mysteries in everything around us scarce had we learned to read when our mother made us holiday presents of all the nursery literature of the day which at that time consisted of little books covered with gilt paper adorned with cuts and filled with tales of fairies giants and enchanters what draughts of delightful fiction did we then inhale my sister sophy was of a soft and tender nature she would weep over the woes of the children in the wood or quake at the dark romance of bluebeard and the terrible mysteries of the blue chamber but i was all for enterprise and adventure i burned to emulate the deeds of that heroic prince who delivered the white cat from her enchantment or he of no less royal blood and doughty enterprise who broke the charmed slumber of the beauty in the wood  the house in which we lived was just the kind of place to foster such propensities it was a venerable mansion half villa half farmhouse the oldest part was of stone with loopholes for musketry having served as a family fortress in the time of the indians to this there had been made various additions some of brick some of wood according to the exigencies of the moment so that it was full of nooks and crooks and chambers of all sorts and sizes it was buried among willows elms and cherry trees and surrounded with roses and hollyhocks with honeysuckle and sweetbrier clambering about every window a brood of hereditary pigeons sunned themselves upon the roof hereditary swallows and martins built about the eaves and chimneys and hereditary bees hummed about the flowerbeds  under the influence of our storybooks every object around us now assumed a new character and a charmed interest the wild flowers were no longer the mere ornaments of the fields or the resorts of the toilful bee they were the lurkingplaces of fairies we would watch the hummingbird as it hovered around the trumpet creeper at our porch and the butterfly as it flitted up into the blue air above the sunny treetops and fancy them some of the tiny beings from fairyland i would call to mind all that i had read of robin goodfellow and his power of transformation oh how i envied him that power how i longed to be able to compress my form into utter littleness to ride the bold dragonfly swing on the tall bearded grass follow the ant into his subterraneous habitation or dive into the cavernous depths of the honeysuckle  while i was yet a mere child i was sent to a daily school about two miles distant the schoolhouse was on the edge of a wood close by a brook overhung with birches alders and dwarf willows we of the school who lived at some distance came with our dinners put up in little baskets in the intervals of school hours we would gather round a spring under a tuft of hazelbushes and have a kind of picnic interchanging the rustic dainties with which our provident mothers had fitted us out then when our joyous repast was over and my companions were disposed for play i would draw forth one of my cherished storybooks stretch myself on the green sward and soon lose myself in its bewitching contents  i became an oracle among my schoolmates on account of my superior erudition and soon imparted to them the contagion of my infected fancy often in the evening after school hours we would sit on the trunk of some fallen tree in the woods and vie with each other in telling extravagant stories until the whippoorwill began his nightly moaning and the fireflies sparkled in the gloom then came the perilous journey homeward what delight we would take in getting up wanton panics in some dusky part of the wood scampering like frightened deer pausing to take breath renewing the panic and scampering off again wild with fictitious terror  our greatest trial was to pass a dark lonely pool covered with pondlilies peopled with bullfrogs and water snakes and haunted by two white cranes oh the terrors of that pond how our little hearts would beat as we approached it what fearful glances we would throw around and if by chance a plash of a wild duck or the guttural twang of a bullfrog struck our ears as we stole quietly byaway we sped nor paused until completely out of the woods then when i reached home what a world of adventures and imaginary terrors would i have to relate to my sister sophy  as i advanced in years this turn of mind increased upon me and became more confirmed i abandoned myself to the impulses of a romantic imagination which controlled my studies and gave a bias to all my habits my father observed me continually with a book in my hand and satisfied himself that i was a profound student but what were my studies works of fiction tales of chivalry voyages of discovery travels in the east everything in short that partook of adventure and romance i well remember with what zest i entered upon that part of my studies which treated of the heathen mythology and particularly of the sylvan deities then indeed my school books became dear to me the neighborhood was well calculated to foster the reveries of a mind like mine it abounded with solitary retreats wild streams solemn forests and silent valleys i would ramble about for a whole day with a volume of ovids metamorphoses in my pocket and work myself into a kind of selfdelusion so as to identify the surrounding scenes with those of which i had just been reading i would loiter about a brook that glided through the shadowy depths of the forest picturing it to myself the haunt of naiads i would steal round some bushy copse that opened upon a glade as if i expected to come suddenly upon diana and her nymphs or to behold pan and his satyrs bounding with whoop and halloo through the woodland i would throw myself during the panting heats of a summer noon under the shade of some widespreading tree and muse and dream away the hours in a state of mental intoxication i drank in the very light of day as nectar and my soul seemed to bathe with ecstasy in the deep blue of a summer sky  in these wanderings nothing occurred to jar my feelings or bring me back to the realities of life there is a repose in our mighty forests that gives full scope to the imagination now and then i would hear the distant sound of the woodcutters ax or the crash of some tree which he had laid low but these noises echoing along the quiet landscape could easily be wrought by fancy into harmony with its illusions in general however the woody recesses of the neighborhood were peculiarly wild and unfrequented i could ramble for a whole day without coming upon any traces of cultivation the partridge of the wood scarcely seemed to shun my path and the squirrel from his nuttree would gaze at me for an instant with sparkling eye as if wondering at the unwonted intrusion  i cannot help dwelling on this delicious period of my life when as yet i had known no sorrow nor experienced any worldly care i have since studied much both of books and men and of course have grown too wise to be so easily pleased yet with all my wisdom i must confess i look back with a secret feeling of regret to the days of happy ignorance before i had begun to be a philosopher                                       it must be evident that i was in a hopeful training for one who was to descend into the arena of life and wrestle with the world the tutor also who superintended my studies in the more advanced stage of my education was just fitted to complete the fata morgana which was forming in my mind his name was glencoe he was a pale melancholylooking man about forty years of age a native of scotland liberally educated and who had devoted himself to the instruction of youth from taste rather than necessity for as he said he loved the human heart and delighted to study it in its earlier impulses my two elder sisters having returned home from a city boardingschool were likewise placed under his care to direct their reading in history and belleslettres  we all soon became attached to glencoe it is true we were at first somewhat prepossessed against him his meager pallid countenance his broad pronunciation his inattention to the little forms of society and an awkward and embarrassed manner on first acquaintance were much against him but we soon discovered that under this unpromising exterior existed the kindest urbanity of temper the warmest sympathies the most enthusiastic benevolence his mind was ingenious and acute his reading had been various but more abstruse than profound his memory was stored on all subjects with facts theories and quotations and crowded with crude materials for thinking these in a moment of excitement would be as it were melted down and poured forth in the lava of a heated imagination at such moments the change in the whole man was wonderful his meager form would acquire a dignity and grace his long pale visage would flash with a hectic glow his eyes would beam with intense speculation and there would be pathetic tones and deep modulations in his voice that delighted the ear and spoke movingly to the heart  but what most endeared him to us was the kindness and sympathy with which he entered into all our interests and wishes instead of curbing and checking our young imaginations with the reins of sober reason he was a little too apt to catch the impulse and be hurried away with us he could not withstand the excitement of any sally of feeling or fancy and was prone to lend heightening tints to the illusive coloring of youthful anticipation  under his guidance my sisters and myself soon entered upon a more extended range of studies but while they wandered with delighted minds through the wide field of history and belleslettres a nobler walk was opened to my superior intellect  the mind of glencoe presented a singular mixture of philosophy and poetry he was fond of metaphysics and prone to indulge in abstract speculations though his metaphysics were somewhat fine spun and fanciful and his speculations were apt to partake of what my father most irreverently termed humbug for my part i delighted in them and the more especially because they set my father to sleep and completely confounded my sisters i entered with my accustomed eagerness into this new branch of study metaphysics were now my passion my sisters attempted to accompany me but they soon faltered and gave out before they had got half way through smiths theory of the moral sentiments i however went on exulting in my strength glencoe supplied me with books and i devoured them with appetite if not digestion we walked and talked together under the trees before the house or sat apart like miltons angels and held high converse upon themes beyond the grasp of ordinary intellects glencoe possessed a kind of philosophic chivalry in imitation of the old peripatetic sages and was continually dreaming of romantic enterprises in morals and splendid systems for the improvement of society he had a fanciful mode of illustrating abstract subjects peculiarly to my taste clothing them with the language of poetry and throwing round them almost the magic hues of fiction how charming thought i is divine philosophy not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose    but a perpetual feast of nectard sweets    where no crude surfeit reigns  i felt a wonderful selfcomplacency at being on such excellent terms with a man whom i considered on a parallel with the sages of antiquity and looked down with a sentiment of pity on the feebler intellects of my sisters who could comprehend nothing of metaphysics it is true when i attempted to study them by myself i was apt to get in a fog but when glencoe came to my aid everything was soon as clear to me as day my ear drank in the beauty of his words my imagination was dazzled with the splendor of his illustrations it caught up the sparkling sands of poetry that glittered through his speculations and mistook them for the golden ore of wisdom struck with the facility with which i seemed to imbibe and relish the most abstract doctrines i conceived a still higher opinion of my mental powers and was convinced that i also was a philosopher                                       i was now verging toward mans estate and though my education had been extremely irregularfollowing the caprices of my humor which i mistook for the impulses of my geniusyet i was regarded with wonder and delight by my mother and sisters who considered me almost as wise and infallible as i considered myself this high opinion of me was strengthened by a declamatory habit which made me an oracle and orator at the domestic board the time was now at hand however that was to put my philosophy to the test  we had passed through a long winter and the spring at length opened upon us with unusual sweetness the soft serenity of the weather the beauty of the surrounding country the joyous notes of the birds the balmy breath of flower and blossom all combined to fill my bosom with indistinct sensations and nameless wishes amid the soft seductions of the season i lapsed into a state of utter indolence both of body and mind  philosophy had lost its charms for me metaphysicsfaugh i tried to study took down volume after volume ran my eye vacantly over a few pages and threw them by with distaste i loitered about the house with my hands in my pockets and an air of complete vacancy something was necessary to make me happy but what was that something i sauntered to the apartments of my sisters hoping their conversation might amuse me they had walked out and the room was vacant on the table lay a volume which they had been reading it was a novel i had never read a novel having conceived a contempt for works of the kind from hearing them universally condemned it is true i had remarked that they were as universally read but i considered them beneath the attention of a philosopher and never would venture to read them lest i should lessen my mental superiority in the eyes of my sisters nay i had taken up a work of the kind now and then when i knew my sisters were observing me looked into it for a moment and then laid it down with a slight supercilious smile on the present occasion out of mere listlessness i took up the volume and turned over a few of the first pages i thought i heard some one coming and laid it down i was mistaken no one was near and what i had read tempted my curiosity to read a little further i leaned against a windowframe and in a few minutes was completely lost in the story how long i stood there reading i know not but i believe for nearly two hours suddenly i heard my sisters on the stairs when i thrust the book into my bosom and the two other volumes which lay near into my pockets and hurried out of the house to my beloved woods here i remained all day beneath the trees bewildered bewitched devouring the contents of these delicious volumes and only returned to the house when it was too dark to peruse their pages  this novel finished i replaced it in my sisters apartment and looked for others their stock was ample for they had brought home all that were current in the city but my appetite demanded an immense supply all this course of reading was carried on clandestinely for i was a little ashamed of it and fearful that my wisdom might be called in question but this very privacy gave it additional zest it was bread eaten in secret it had the charm of a private amour  but think what must have been the effect of such a course of reading on a youth of my temperament and turn of mind indulged too amid romantic scenery and in the romantic season of the year it seemed as if i had entered upon a new scene of existence a train of combustible feelings were lighted up in me and my soul was all tenderness and passion never was youth more completely lovesick though as yet it was a mere general sentiment and wanted a definite object unfortunately our neighborhood was particularly deficient in female society and i languished in vain for some divinity to whom i might offer up this most uneasy burden of affections i was at one time seriously enamored of a lady whom i saw occasionally in my rides reading at the window of a countryseat and actually serenaded her with my flute when to my confusion i discovered that she was old enough to be my mother it was a sad damper to my romance especially as my father heard of it and made it the subject of one of those household jokes which he was apt to serve up at every mealtime  i soon recovered from this check however but it was only to relapse into a state of amorous excitement i passed whole days in the fields and along the brooks for there is something in the tender passion that makes us alive to the beauties of nature a soft sunshiny morning infused a sort of rapture into my breast i flung open my arms like the grecian youth in ovid as if i would take in and embrace the balmy atmosphere footnote ovids metamorphoses book vii the song of the birds melted me to tenderness i would lie by the side of some rivulet for hours and form garlands of the flowers on its banks and muse on ideal beauties and sigh from the crowd of undefined emotions that swelled my bosom  in this state of amorous delirium i was strolling one morning along a beautiful wild brook which i had discovered in a glen there was one place where a small waterfall leaping from among rocks into a natural basin made a scene such as a poet might have chosen as the haunt of some shy naiad it was here i usually retired to banquet on my novels in visiting the place this morning i traced distinctly on the margin of the basin which was of fine clear sand the prints of a female foot of the most slender and delicate proportions this was sufficient for an imagination like mine robinson crusoe himself when he discovered the print of a savage foot on the beach of his lonely island could not have been more suddenly assailed with thickcoming fancies  i endeavored to track the steps but they only passed for a few paces along the fine sand and then were lost among the herbage i remained gazing in reverie upon this passing trace of loveliness it evidently was not made by any of my sisters for they knew nothing of this haunt besides the foot was smaller than theirs it was remarkable for its beautiful delicacy  my eye accidentally caught two or three halfwithered wild flowers lying on the ground the unknown nymph had doubtless dropped them from her bosom here was a new document of taste and sentiment i treasured them up as invaluable relics the place too where i found them was remarkably picturesque and the most beautiful part of the brook it was overhung with a fine elm entwined with grapevines she who could select such a spot who could delight in wild brooks and wild flowers and silent solitudes must have fancy and feeling and tenderness and with all these qualities she must be beautiful  but who could be this unknown that had thus passed by as in a morning dream leaving merely flowers and fairy footsteps to tell of her loveliness there was a mystery in it that bewildered me it was so vague and disembodied like those airy tongues that syllable mens names in solitude every attempt to solve the mystery was vain i could hear of no being in the neighborhood to whom this trace could be ascribed i haunted the spot and became daily more and more enamored never surely was passion more pure and spiritual and never lover in more dubious situation my case could be compared only to that of the amorous prince in the fairy tale of cinderella but he had a glass slipper on which to lavish his tenderness i alas was in love with a footstep  the imagination is alternately a cheat and a dupe nay more it is the most subtle of cheats for it cheats itself and becomes the dupe of its own delusions it conjures up airy nothings gives to them a local habitation and a name and then bows to their control as implicitly as though they were realities such was now my case the good numa could not more thoroughly have persuaded himself that the nymph egeria hovered about her sacred fountain and communed with him in spirit than i had deceived myself into a kind of visionary intercourse with the airy phantom fabricated in my brain i constructed a rustic seat at the foot of the tree where i had discovered the footsteps i made a kind of bower there where i used to pass my mornings reading poetry and romances i carved hearts and darts on the tree and hung it with garlands my heart was full to overflowing and wanted some faithful bosom into which it might relieve itself what is a lover without a confidante i thought at once of my sister sophy my early playmate the sister of my affections she was so reasonable too and of such correct feelings always listening to my words as oracular sayings and admiring my scraps of poetry as the very inspirations of the muse from such a devoted such a rational being what secrets could i have  i accordingly took her one morning to my favorite retreat she looked around with delighted surprise upon the rustic seat the bower the tree carved with emblems of the tender passion she turned her eyes upon me to inquire the meaning  oh sophy exclaimed i clasping both her hands in mine and looking earnestly in her face i am in love  she started with surprise  sit down said i and i will tell you all  she seated herself upon the rustic bench and i went into a full history of the footstep with all the associations of idea that had been conjured up by my imagination  sophy was enchanted it was like a fairy tale she had read of such mysterious visitations in books and the loves thus conceived were always for beings of superior order and were always happy she caught the illusion in all its force her cheek glowed her eye brightened  i daresay shes pretty said sophy  pretty echoed i she is beautiful i went through all the reasoning by which i had logically proved the fact to my own satisfaction i dwelt upon the evidences of her taste her sensibility to the beauties of nature her soft meditative habit that delighted in solitude oh said i clasping my hands to have such a companion to wander through these scenes to sit with her by this murmuring stream to wreathe garlands round her brows to hear the music of her voice mingling with the whisperings of these groves to  delightful delightful cried sophy what a sweet creature she must be she is just the friend i want how i shall dote upon her oh my dear brother you must not keep her all to yourself you must let me have some share of her  i caught her to my bosom you shallyou shall cried i my dear sophy we will all live for each other                                       the conversation with sophy heightened the illusions of my mind and the manner in which she had treated my daydream identified it with facts and persons and gave it still more the stamp of reality i walked about as one in a trance heedless of the world around and lapped in an elysium of the fancy  in this mood i met one morning with glencoe he accosted me with his usual smile and was proceeding with some general observations but paused and fixed on me an inquiring eye  what is the matter with you said he you seem agitated has anything in particular happened  nothing said i hesitating at least nothing worth communicating to you  nay my dear young friend said he whatever is of sufficient importance to agitate you is worthy of being communicated to me  well but my thoughts are running on what you would think a frivolous subject  no subject is frivolous that has the power to awaken strong feelings  what think you said i hesitating what think you of love  glencoe almost started at the question do you call that a frivolous subject replied he believe me there is none fraught with such deep such vital interest if you talk indeed of the capricious inclination awakened by the mere charm of perishable beauty i grant it to be idle in the extreme but that love which springs from the concordant sympathies of virtuous hearts that love which is awakened by the perception of moral excellence and fed by meditation on intellectual as well as personal beauty that is a passion which refines and ennobles the human heart oh where is there a sight more nearly approaching to the intercourse of angels than that of two young beings free from the sins and follies of the world mingling pure thoughts and looks and feelings and becoming as it were soul of one soul and heart of one heart how exquisite the silent converse that they hold the soft devotion of the eye that needs no words to make it eloquent yes my friend if there be anything in this weary world worthy of heaven it is the pure bliss of such a mutual affection  the words of my worthy tutor overcame all further reserve mr glencoe cried i blushing still deeper i am in love  and is that what you were ashamed to tell me oh never seek to conceal from your friend so important a secret if your passion be unworthy it is for the steady hand of friendship to pluck it forth if honorable none but an enemy would seek to stifle it on nothing does the character and happiness so much depend as on the first affection of the heart were you caught by some fleeting and superficial charma bright eye a blooming cheek a soft voice or a voluptuous formi would warn you to beware i would tell you that beauty is but a passing gleam of the morning a perishable flower that accident may becloud and blight it and that at best it must soon pass away but were you in love with such a one as i could describe young in years but still younger in feelings lovely in person but as a type of the minds beauty soft in voice in token of gentleness of spirit blooming in countenance like the rosy tints of morning kindling with the promise of a genial day an eye beaming with the benignity of a happy heart a cheerful temper alive to all kind impulses and frankly diffusing its own felicity a selfpoised mind that needs not lean on others for support an elegant taste that can embellish solitude and furnish out its own enjoyments  my dear sir cried i for i could contain myself no longer you have described the very person  why then my dear young friend said he affectionately pressing my hand in gods name love on                                       for the remainder of the day i was in some such state of dreamy beatitude as a turk is said to enjoy when under the influence of opium it must be already manifest how prone i was to bewilder myself with picturings of the fancy so as to confound them with existing realities in the present instance sophy and glencoe had contributed to promote the transient delusion sophy dear girl had as usual joined with me in my castlebuilding and indulged in the same train of imaginings while glencoe duped by my enthusiasm firmly believed that i spoke of a being i had seen and known by their sympathy with my feelings they in a manner became associated with the unknown in my mind and thus linked her with the circle of my intimacy  in the evening our family party was assembled in the hall to enjoy the refreshing breeze sophy was playing some favorite scotch airs on the piano while glencoe seated apart with his forehead resting on his hand was buried in one of those pensive reveries that made him so interesting to me  what a fortunate being i am thought i blessed with such a sister and such a friend i have only to find out this amiable unknown to wed her and be happy what a paradise will be my home graced with a partner of such exquisite refinement it will be a perfect fairy bower buried among sweets and roses sophy shall live with us and be the companion of all our enjoyments glencoe too shall no more be the solitary being that he now appears he shall have a home with us he shall have his study where when he pleases he may shut himself up from the world and bury himself in his own reflections his retreat shall be sacred no one shall intrude there no one but myself who will visit him now and then in his seclusion where we will devise grand schemes together for the improvement of mankind how delightfully our days will pass in a round of rational pleasures and elegant employments sometimes we will have music sometimes we will read sometimes we will wander through the flower garden when i will smile with complacency on every flower my wife has planted while in the long winter evenings the ladies will sit at their work and listen with hushed attention to glencoe and myself as we discuss the abstruse doctrines of metaphysics  from this delectable reverie i was startled by my fathers slapping me on the shoulder what possesses the lad cried he here have i been speaking to you half a dozen times without receiving an answer  pardon me sir replied i i was so completely lost in thought that i did not hear you  lost in thought and pray what were you thinking of some of your philosophy i suppose  upon my word said my sister charlotte with an arch laugh i suspect harrys in love again  and if were in love charlotte said i somewhat nettled and recollecting glencoes enthusiastic eulogy of the passion if i were in love is that a matter of jest and laughter is the tenderest and most fervid affection that can animate the human breast to be made a matter of coldhearted ridicule  my sister colored certainly not brothernor did i mean to make it so or to say anything that should wound your feelings had i really suspected you had formed some genuine attachment it would have been sacred in my eyes butbut said she smiling as if at some whimsical recollection i thought that youyou might be indulging in another little freak of the imagination  ill wager any money cried my father he has fallen in love again with some old lady at a window  oh no cried my dear sister sophy with the most gracious warmth she is young and beautiful  from what i understand said glencoe rousing himself she must be lovely in mind as in person  i found my friends were getting me into a fine scrape i began to perspire at every pore and felt my ears tingle  well but cried my father who is shewhat is she let us hear something about her  this was no time to explain so delicate a matter i caught up my hat and vanished out of the house  the moment i was in the open air and alone my heart upbraided me was this respectful treatment to my fatherto such a father toowho had always regarded me as the pride of his agethe staff of his hopes it is true he was apt sometimes to laugh at my enthusiastic flights and did not treat my philosophy with due respect but when had he ever thwarted a wish of my heart was i then to act with reserve toward him in a matter which might affect the whole current of my future life i have done wrong thought i but it is not too late to remedy it i will hasten back and open my whole heart to my father  i returned accordingly and was just on the point of entering the house with my heart full of filial piety and a contrite speech upon my lips when i heard a burst of obstreperous laughter from my father and a loud titter from my two elder sisters  a footstep shouted he as soon as he could recover himself in love with a footstep why this beats the old lady at the window and then there was another appalling burst of laughter had it been a clap of thunder it could hardly have astounded me more completely sophy in the simplicity of her heart had told all and had set my fathers risible propensities in full action  never was poor mortal so thoroughly crestfallen as myself the whole delusion was at an end i drew off silently from the house shrinking smaller and smaller at every fresh peal of laughter and wandering about until the family had retired stole quietly to my bed scarce any sleep however visited my eyes that night i lay overwhelmed with mortification and meditating how i might meet the family in the morning the idea of ridicule was always intolerable to me but to endure it on a subject by which my feelings had been so much excited seemed worse than death i almost determined at one time to get up saddle my horse and ride off i knew not whither  at length i came to a resolution before going down to breakfast i sent for sophy and employed her as embassador to treat formally in the matter i insisted that the subject should be buried in oblivion otherwise i would not show my face at table it was readily agreed to for not one of the family would have given me pain for the world they faithfully kept their promise not a word was said of the matter but there were wry faces and suppressed titters that went to my soul and whenever my father looked me in the face it was with such a tragicomical leersuch an attempt to pull down a serious brow upon a whimsical mouththat i had a thousand times rather he had laughed outright                                       for a day or two after the mortifying occurrence just related i kept as much as possible out of the way of the family and wandered about the fields and woods by myself i was sadly out of tune my feelings were all jarred and unstrung the birds sang from every grove but i took no pleasure in their melody and the flowers of the field bloomed unheeded around me to be crossed in love is bad enough but then one can fly to poetry for relief and turn ones woes to account in soulsubduing stanzas but to have ones whole passion object and all annihilated dispelled proved to be such stuff as dreams are made ofor worse than all to be turned into a proverb and a jestwhat consolation is there in such a case  i avoided the fatal brook where i had seen the footstep my favorite resort was now the banks of the hudson where i sat upon the rocks and mused upon the current that dimpled by or the waves that laved the shore or watched the bright mutations of the clouds and the shifting lights and shadows of the distant mountain by degrees a returning serenity stole over my feelings and a sigh now and then gentle and easy and unattended by pain showed that my heart was recovering its susceptibility  as i was sitting in this musing mood my eye became gradually fixed upon an object that was borne along by the tide it proved to be a little pinnace beautifully modeled and gayly painted and decorated it was an unusual sight in this neighborhood which was rather lonely indeed it was rare to see any pleasurebarks in this part of the river as it drew nearer i perceived that there was no one on board it had apparently drifted from its anchorage there was not a breath of air the little bark came floating along on the glassy stream wheeling about with the eddies at length it ran aground almost at the foot of the rock on which i was seated i descended to the margin of the river and drawing the bark to shore admired its light and elegant proportions and the taste with which it was fitted up the benches were covered with cushions and its long streamer was of silk on one of the cushions lay a ladys glove of delicate size and shape with beautifully tapered fingers i instantly seized it and thrust it in my bosom it seemed a match for the fairy footstep that had so fascinated me  in a moment all the romance of my bosom was again in a glow here was one of the very incidents of fairy tale a bark sent by some invisible power some good genius or benevolent fairy to waft me to some delectable adventure i recollected something of an enchanted bark drawn by white swans that conveyed a knight down the current of the rhine on some enterprise connected with love and beauty the glove too showed that there was a lady fair concerned in the present adventure it might be a gauntlet of defiance to dare me to the enterprise  in the spirit of romance and the whim of the moment i sprang on board hoisted the light sail and pushed from shore as if breathed by some presiding power a light breeze at that moment sprang up swelled out the sail and dallied with the silken streamer for a time i glided along under steep umbrageous banks or across deep sequestered bays and then stood out over a wide expansion of the river toward a high rocky promontory it was a lovely evening the sun was setting in a congregation of clouds that threw the whole heavens in a glow and were reflected in the river i delighted myself with all kinds of fantastic fancies as to what enchanted island or mystic bower or necromantic palace i was to be conveyed by the fairy bark  in the revel of my fancy i had not noticed that the gorgeous congregation of clouds which had so much delighted me was in fact a gathering thunder gust i perceived the truth too late the clouds came hurrying on darkening as they advanced the whole face of nature was suddenly changed and assumed that baleful and livid tint predictive of a storm i tried to gain the shore but before i could reach it a blast of wind struck the water and lashed it at once into foam the next moment it overtook the boat alas i was nothing of a sailor and my protecting fairy forsook me in the moment of peril i endeavored to lower the sail but in so doing i had to quit the helm the bark was overturned in an instant and i was thrown into the water i endeavored to cling to the wreck but missed my hold being a poor swimmer i soon found myself sinking but grasped a light oar that was floating by me it was not sufficient for my support i again sank beneath the surface there was a rushing and bubbling sound in my ears and all sense forsook me  how long i remained insensible i know not i had a confused notion of being moved and tossed about and of hearing strange beings and strange voices around me but all this was like a hideous dream when i at length recovered full consciousness and perception i found myself in bed in a spacious chamber furnished with more taste than i had been accustomed to the bright rays of a morning sun were intercepted by curtains of a delicate rose color that gave a soft voluptuous tinge to every object not far from my bed on a classic tripod was a basket of beautiful exotic flowers breathing the sweetest fragrance  where am i how came i here  i tasked my mind to catch at some previous event from which i might trace up the thread of existence to the present moment by degrees i called to mind the fairy pinnace my daring embarkation my adventurous voyage and my disastrous shipwreck beyond that all was chaos how came i here what unknown region had i landed upon the people that inhabited it must be gentle and amiable and of elegant tastes for they loved downy beds fragrant flowers and rosecolored curtains  while i lay thus musing the tones of a harp reached my ear presently they were accompanied by a female voice it came from the room below but in the profound stillness of my chamber not a modulation was lost my sisters were all considered good musicians and sang very tolerably but i had never heard a voice like this there was no attempt at difficult execution or striking effect but there were exquisite inflections and tender turns which art could not reach nothing but feeling and sentiment could produce them it was soul breathed forth in sound i was always alive to the influence of music indeed i was susceptible of voluptuous influences of every kindsounds colors shapes and fragrant odors i was the very slave of sensation  i lay mute and breathless and drank in every note of this siren strain it thrilled through my whole frame and filled my soul with melody and love i pictured to myself with curious logic the form of the unseen musician such melodious sounds and exquisite inflections could only be produced by organs of the most delicate flexibility such organs do not belong to coarse vulgar forms they are the harmonious results of fair proportions and admirable symmetry a being so organized must be lovely  again my busy imagination was at work i called to mind the arabian story of a prince borne away during sleep by a good genius to the distant abode of a princess of ravishing beauty i do not pretend to say that i believed in having experienced a similar transportation but it was my inveterate habit to cheat myself with fancies of the kind and to give the tinge of illusion to surrounding realities  the witching sound had ceased but its vibrations still played round my heart and filled it with a tumult of soft emotions at this moment a selfupbraiding pang shot through my bosom ah recreant a voice seemed to exclaim is this the stability of thine affections what hast thou so soon forgotten the nymph of the fountain has one song idly piped in thine ear been sufficient to charm away the cherished tenderness of a whole summer  the wise may smilebut i am in a confiding mood and must confess my weakness i felt a degree of compunction at this sudden infidelity yet i could not resist the power of present fascination my peace of mind was destroyed by conflicting claims the nymph of the fountain came over my memory with all the associations of fairy footsteps shady groves soft echoes and wild streamlets but this new passion was produced by a strain of soulsubduing melody still lingering in my ear aided by a downy bed fragrant flowers and rosecolored curtains unhappy youth sighed i to myself distracted by such rival passions and the empire of thy heart thus violently contested by the sound of a voice and the print of a footstep                                       i had not remained long in this mood when i heard the door of the room gently opened i turned my head to see what inhabitant of this enchanted palace should appear whether page in green a hideous dwarf or haggard fairy it was my own man scipio he advanced with cautious step and was delighted as he said to find me so much myself again my first questions were as to where i was and how i came there scipio told me a long story of his having been fishing in a canoe at the time of my harebrained cruise of his noticing the gathering squall and my impending danger of his hastening to join me but arriving just in time to snatch me from a watery grave of the great difficulty in restoring me to animation and of my being subsequently conveyed in a state of insensibility to this mansion  but where am i was the reiterated demand  in the house of mr somerville  somervillesomerville i recollected to have heard that a gentleman of that name had recently taken up his residence at some distance from my fathers abode on the opposite side of the hudson he was commonly known by the name of french somerville from having passed part of his early life in france and from his exhibiting traces of french taste in his mode of living and the arrangements of his house in fact it was in his pleasureboat which had got adrift that i had made my fanciful and disastrous cruise all this was simple straightforward matter of fact and threatened to demolish all the cobweb romance i had been spinning when fortunately i again heard the tinkling of a harp i raised myself in bed and listened  scipio said i with some little hesitation i heard some one singing just now who was it  oh that was miss julia  julia julia delightful what a name and scipiois sheis she pretty  scipio grinned from ear to ear except miss sophy she was the most beautiful young lady he had ever seen  i should observe that my sister sophia was considered by all the servants a paragon of perfection  scipio now offered to remove the basket of flowers he was afraid their odor might be too powerful but miss julia had given them that morning to be placed in my room  these flowers then had been gathered by the fairy fingers of my unseen beauty that sweet breath which had filled my ear with melody had passed over them i made scipio hand them to me culled several of the most delicate and laid them on my bosom  mr somerville paid me a visit not long afterward he was an interesting study for me for he was the father of my unseen beauty and probably resembled her i scanned him closely he was a tall and elegant man with an open affable manner and an erect and graceful carriage his eyes were bluishgray and though not dark yet at times were sparkling and expressive his hair was dressed and powdered and being lightly combed up from his forehead added to the loftiness of his aspect he was fluent in discourse but his conversation had the quiet tone of polished society without any of those bold flights of thought and picturings of fancy which i so much admired  my imagination was a little puzzled at first to make out of this assemblage of personal and mental qualities a picture that should harmonize with my previous idea of the fair unseen by dint however of selecting what it liked and giving a touch here and a touch there it soon furnished out a satisfactory portrait  julia must be tall thought i and of exquisite grace and dignity she is not quite so courtly as her father for she has been brought up in the retirement of the country neither is she of such vivacious deportment for the tones of her voice are soft and plaintive and she loves pathetic music she is rather pensiveyet not too pensive just what is called interesting her eyes are like her fathers except that they are of a purer blue and more tender and languishing she has light hairnot exactly flaxen for i do not like flaxen hair but between that and auburn in a word she is a tall elegant imposing languishing blueeyed romanticlooking beauty and having thus finished her picture i felt ten times more in love with her than ever                                       i felt so much recovered that i would at once have left my room but mr somerville objected to it he had sent early word to my family of my safety and my father arrived in the course of the morning he was shocked at learning the risk i had run but rejoiced to find me so much restored and was warm in his thanks to mr somerville for his kindness the other only required in return that i might remain two or three days as his guest to give time for my recovery and for our forming a closer acquaintance a request which my father readily granted scipio accordingly accompanied my father home and returned with a supply of clothes and with affectionate letters from my mother and sisters  the next morning aided by scipio i made my toilet with rather more care than usual and descended the stairs with some trepidation eager to see the original of the portrait which had been so completely pictured in my imagination  on entering the parlor i found it deserted like the rest of the house it was furnished in a foreign style the curtains were of french silk there were grecian couches marble tables pierglasses and chandeliers what chiefly attracted my eye were documents of female taste that i saw around me a piano with an ample stock of italian music a book of poetry lying on the sofa a vase of fresh flowers on a table and a portfolio open with a skillful and halffinished sketch of them in the window was a canary bird in a gilt cage and near by the harp that had been in julias arms happy harp but where was the being that reigned in this little empire of delicaciesthat breathed poetry and song and dwelt among birds and flowers and rosecolored curtains  suddenly i heard the hall door fly open the quick pattering of light steps a wild capricious strain of music and the shrill barking of a dog a light frolic nymph of fifteen came tripping into the room playing on a flageolet with a little spaniel romping after her her gypsy hat had fallen back upon her shoulders a profusion of glossy brown hair was blown in rich ringlets about her face which beamed through them with the brightness of smiles and dimples  at sight of me she stopped short in the most beautiful confusion stammered out a word or two about looking for her father glided out of the door and i heard her bounding up the staircase like a frightened fawn with the little dog barking after her  when miss somerville returned to the parlor she was quite a different being she entered stealing along by her mothers side with noiseless step and sweet timidity her hair was prettily adjusted and a soft blush mantled on her damask cheek mr somerville accompanied the ladies and introduced me regularly to them there were many kind inquiries and much sympathy expressed on the subject of my nautical accident and some remarks upon the wild scenery of the neighborhood with which the ladies seemed perfectly acquainted  you must know said mr somerville that we are great navigators and delight in exploring every nook and corner of the river my daughter too is a great hunter of the picturesque and transfers every rock and glen to her portfolio by the way my dear show mr mountjoy that pretty scene you have lately sketched julia complied blushing and drew from her portfolio a colored sketch i almost started at the sight it was my favorite brook a sudden thought darted across my mind i glanced down my eye and beheld the divinest little foot in the world oh blissful conviction the struggle of my affections was at an end the voice and the footstep were no longer at variance julia somerville was the nymph of the fountain                                       what conversation passed during breakfast i do not recollect and hardly was conscious of at the time for my thoughts were in complete confusion i wished to gaze on miss somerville but did not dare once indeed i ventured a glance she was at that moment darting a similar one from under a covert of ringlets our eyes seemed shocked by the rencontre and fell hers through the natural modesty of her sex mine through a bashfulness produced by the previous workings of my imagination that glance however went like a sunbeam to my heart  a convenient mirror favored my diffidence and gave me the reflection of miss somervilles form it is true it only presented the back of her head but she had the merit of an ancient statue contemplate her from any point of view she was beautiful and yet she was totally different from everything i had before conceived of beauty she was not the serene meditative maid that i had pictured the nymph of the fountain nor the tall soft languishing blueeyed dignified being that i had fancied the minstrel of the harp there was nothing of dignity about her she was girlish in her appearance and scarcely of the middle size but then there was the tenderness of budding youth the sweetness of the halfblown rose when not a tint of perfume has been withered or exhaled there were smiles and dimples and all the soft witcheries of evervarying expression i wondered that i could ever have admired any other style of beauty  after breakfast mr somerville departed to attend to the concerns of his estate and gave me in charge of the ladies mrs somerville also was called away by her household cares and i was left alone with julia here then was the situation which of all others i had most coveted i was in the presence of the lovely being that had so long been the desire of my heart we were alone propitious opportunity for a lover did i seize upon it did i break out in one of my accustomed rhapsodies no such thing never was being more awkwardly embarrassed  what can be the cause of this thought i surely i cannot stand in awe of this young girl i am of course her superior in intellect and am never embarrassed in company with my tutor notwithstanding all his wisdom  it was passing strange i felt that if she were an old woman i should be quite at my ease if she were even an ugly woman i should make out very well it was her beauty that overpowered me how little do lovely women know what awful beings they are in the eyes of inexperienced youth young men brought up in the fashionable circles of our cities will smile at all this accustomed to mingle incessantly in female society and to have the romance of the heart deadened by a thousand frivolous flirtations women are nothing but women in their eyes but to a susceptible youth like myself brought up in the country they are perfect divinities  miss somerville was at first a little embarrassed herself but somehow or other women have a natural adroitness in recovering their selfpossession they are more alert in their minds and graceful in their manners besides i was but an ordinary personage in miss somervilles eyes she was not under hie influence of such a singular course of imaginings as had surrounded her in my eyes with the illusions of romance perhaps too she saw the confusion in the opposite camp and gained courage from the discovery at any rate she was the first to take the field  her conversation however was only on commonplace topics and in an easy wellbred style i endeavored to respond in the same manner but i was strangely incompetent to the task my ideas were frozen up even words seemed to fail me i was excessively vexed at myself for i wished to be uncommonly elegant i tried two or three times to turn a pretty thought or to utter a fine sentiment but it would come forth so trite so forced so mawkish that i was ashamed of it my very voice sounded discordantly though i sought to modulate it into the softest tones the truth is thought i to myself i cannot bring my mind down to the small talk necessary for young girls it is too masculine and robust for the mincing measure of parlor gossip i am a philosopherand that accounts for it  the entrance of mrs somerville at length gave me relief i at once breathed freely and felt a vast deal of confidence come over me this is strange thought i that the appearance of another woman should revive my courage that i should be a better match for two women than one however since it is so i will take advantage of the circumstance and let this young lady see that i am not so great a simpleton as she probably thinks me  i accordingly took up the book of poetry which lay upon the sofa it was miltons paradise lost nothing could have been more fortunate it afforded a fine scope for my favorite vein of grandiloquence i went largely into a discussion of its merits or rather an enthusiastic eulogy of them my observations were addressed to mrs somerville for i found i could talk to her with more ease than to her daughter she appeared alive to the beauties of the poet and disposed to meet me in the discussion but it was not my object to hear her talk it was to talk myself i anticipated all she had to say overpowered her with the copiousness of my ideas and supported and illustrated them by long citations from the author  while thus holding forth i cast a side glance to see how miss somerville was affected she had some embroidery stretched on a frame before her but had paused in her labor and was looking down as if lost in mute attention i felt a glow of selfsatisfaction but i recollected at the same time with a kind of pique the advantage she had enjoyed over me in our teteatete i determined to push my triumph and accordingly kept on with redoubled ardor until i had fairly exhausted my subject or rather my thoughts  i had scarce come to a full stop when miss somerville raised her eyes from the work on which they had been fixed and turning to her mother observed i have been considering mamma whether to work these flowers plain or in colors  had an icebolt shot to my heart it could not have chilled me more effectually what a fool thought i have i been making myselfsquandering away fine thoughts and fine language upon a light mind and an ignorant ear this girl knows nothing of poetry she has no soul i fear for its beauties can any one have real sensibility of heart and not be alive to poetry however she is young this part of her education has been neglected there is time enough to remedy it i will be her preceptor i will kindle in her mind the sacred flame and lead her through the fairy land of song but after all it is rather unfortunate that i should have fallen in love with a woman who knows nothing of poetry                                       i passed a day not altogether satisfactory i was a little disappointed that miss somerville did not show more poetical feeling i am afraid after all said i to myself she is light and girlish and more fitted to pluck wild flowers play on the flageolet and romp with little dogs than to converse with a man of my turn  i believe however to tell the truth i was more out of humor with myself i thought i had made the worst first appearance that ever hero made either in novel or fairy tale i was out of all patience when i called to mind my awkward attempts at ease and elegance in the teteatete and then my intolerable long lecture about poetry to catch the applause of a heedless auditor but there i was not to blame i had certainly been eloquent it was her fault that the eloquence was wasted to meditate upon the embroidery of a flower when i was expatiating on the beauties of milton she might at least have admired the poetry if she did not relish the manner in which it was delivered though that was not despicable for i had recited passages in my best style which my mother and sisters had always considered equal to a play oh it is evident thought i miss somerville has very little soul  such were my fancies and cogitations during the day the greater part of which was spent in my chamber for i was still languid my evening was passed in the drawingroom where i overlooked miss somervilles portfolio of sketches they were executed with great taste and showed a nice observation of the peculiarities of nature they were all her own and free from those cunning tints and touches of the drawingmaster by which young ladies drawings like their heads are dressed up for company there was no garish and vulgar trick of colors either all was executed with singular truth and simplicity  and yet thought i this little being who has so pure an eye to take in as in a limpid brook all the graceful forms and magic tints of nature has no soul for poetry  mr somerville toward the latter part of the evening observing my eye to wander occasionally to the harp interpreted and met my wishes with his accustomed civility  julia my dear said he mr mountjoy would like to hear a little music from your harp let us hear too the sound of your voice  julia immediately complied without any of that hesitation and difficulty by which young ladies are apt to make company pay dear for bad music she sang a sprightly strain in a brilliant style that came trilling playfully over the ear and the bright eye and dimpling smile showed that her little heart danced with the song her pet canary bird who hung close by was awakened by the music and burst forth into an emulating strain julia smiled with a pretty air of defiance and played louder  after some time the music changed and ran into a plaintive strain in a minor key then it was that all the former witchery of her voice came over me then it was that she seemed to sing from the heart and to the heart her fingers moved about the chords as if they scarcely touched them her whole manner and appearance changed her eyes beamed with the softest expression her countenance her frame all seemed subdued into tenderness she rose from the harp leaving it still vibrating with sweet sounds and moved toward her father to bid him goodnight  his eyes had been fixed on her intently during her performance as she came before him he parted her shining ringlets with both his hands and looked down with the fondness of a father on her innocent face the music seemed still lingering in its lineaments and the action of her father brought a moist gleam in her eye he kissed her fair forehead after the french mode of parental caressing goodnight and god bless you said he my good little girl  julia tripped away with a tear in her eye a dimple in her cheek and a light heart in her bosom i thought it the prettiest picture of paternal and filial affection i had ever seen  when i retired to bed a new train of thoughts crowded into my brain after all said i to myself it is clear this girl has a soul though she was not moved by my eloquence she has all the outward signs and evidences of poetic feeling she paints well and has an eye for nature she is a fine musician and enters into the very soul of song what a pity that she knows nothing of poetry but we will see what is to be done i am irretrievably in love with her what then am i to do come down to the level of her mind or endeavor to raise her to some kind of intellectual equality with myself that is the most generous course she will look up to me as a benefactor i shall become associated in her mind with the lofty thoughts and harmonious graces of poetry she is apparently docile besides the difference of our ages will give me an ascendency over her she cannot be above sixteen years of age and i am full turned to twenty so having built this most delectable of air castles i fell asleep                                       the next morning i was quite a different being i no longer felt fearful of stealing a glance at julia on the contrary i contemplated her steadily with the benignant eye of a benefactor shortly after breakfast i found myself alone with her as i had on the preceding morning but i felt nothing of the awkwardness of our previous teteatete i was elevated by the consciousness of my intellectual superiority and should almost have felt a sentiment of pity for the ignorance of the lovely little being if i had not felt also the assurance that i should be able to dispel it but it is time thought i to open school  julia was occupied in arranging some music on her piano i looked over two or three songs they were moores irish melodies  these are pretty things said i flirting the leaves over lightly and giving a slight shrug by way of qualifying the opinion  oh i love them of all things said julia theyre so touching  then you like them for the poetry said i with an encouraging smile  oh yes she thought them charmingly written  now was my time poetry said i assuming a didactic attitude and air poetry is one of the most pleasing studies that can occupy a youthful mind it renders us susceptible of the gentle impulses of humanity and cherishes a delicate perception of all that is virtuous and elevated in morals and graceful and beautiful in physics it  i was going on in a style that would have graced a professor of rhetoric when i saw a light smile playing about miss somervilles mouth and that she began to turn over the leaves of a musicbook i recollected her inattention to my discourse of the preceding morning there is no fixing her light mind thought i by abstract theory we will proceed practically as it happened the identical volume of miltons paradise lost was lying at hand  let me recommend to you my young friend said i in one of those tones of persuasive admonition which i had so often loved in glencoe let me recommend to you this admirable poem you will find in it sources of intellectual enjoyment far superior to those songs which have delighted you julia looked at the book and then at me with a whimsically dubious air miltons paradise lost said she oh i know the greater part of that by heart  i had not expected to find my pupil so far advanced however the paradise lost is a kind of school book and its finest passages are given to young ladies as tasks  i find said i to myself i must not treat her as so complete a novice her inattention yesterday could not have proceeded from absolute ignorance but merely from a want of poetic feeling ill try her again  i now determined to dazzle her with my own erudition and launched into a harangue that would have done honor to an institute pope spenser chaucer and the old dramatic writers were all dipped into with the excursive flight of a swallow i did not confine myself to english poets but gave a glance at the french and italian schools i passed over ariosto in full wing but paused on tassos jerusalem delivered i dwelt on the character of clorinda theres a character said i that you will find well worthy a womans study it shows to what exalted heights of heroism the sex can rise how gloriously they may share even in the stern concerns of men  for my part said julia gently taking advantage of a pause for my part i prefer the character of sophronia  i was thunderstruck she then had read tasso this girl that i had been treating as an ignoramus in poetry she proceeded with a slight glow of the cheek summoned up perhaps by a casual glow of feeling  i do not admire those masculine heroines said she who aim at the bold qualities of the opposite sex now sophronia only exhibits the real qualities of a woman wrought up to their highest excitement she is modest gentle and retiring as it becomes a woman to be but she has all the strength of affection proper to a woman she cannot fight for her people as clorinda does but she can offer herself up and die to serve them you may admire clorinda but you surely would be more apt to love sophronia at least added she suddenly appearing to recollect herself and blushing at having launched into such a discussion at least that is what papa observed when we read the poem together  indeed said i dryly for i felt disconcerted and nettled at being unexpectedly lectured by my pupil indeed i do not exactly recollect the passage  oh said julia i can repeat it to you and she immediately gave it in italian  heavens and earthhere was a situation i knew no more of italian than i did of the language of psalmanazar what a dilemma for a wouldbewise man to be placed in i saw julia waited for my opinion  in fact said i hesitating ii do not exactly understand italian  oh said julia with the utmost naivete i have no doubt it is very beautiful in the translation  i was glad to break up school and get back to my chamber full of the mortification which a wise man in love experiences on finding his mistress wiser than himself translation translation muttered i to myself as i jerked the door shut behind me i am surprised my father has never had me instructed in the modern languages they are all important what is the use of latin and greek no one speaks them but here the moment i make my appearance in the world a little girl slaps italian in my face however thank heaven a language is easily learned the moment i return home ill set about studying italian and to prevent future surprise i will study spanish and german at the same time and if any young lady attempts to quote italian upon me again ill bury her under a heap of high dutch poetry                                       i felt now like some mighty chieftain who has carried the war into a weak country with full confidence of success and been repulsed and obliged to draw off his forces from before some inconsiderable fortress  however thought i i have as yet brought only my light artillery into action we shall see what is to be done with my heavy ordnance julia is evidently well versed in poetry but it is natural she should be so it is allied to painting and music and is congenial to the light graces of the female character we will try her on graver themes  i felt all my pride awakened it even for a time swelled higher than my love i was determined completely to establish my mental superiority and subdue the intellect of this little being it would then be time to sway the scepter of gentle empire and win the affections of her heart  accordingly at dinner i again took the field en potence i now addressed myself to mr somerville for i was about to enter upon topics in which a young girl like her could not be well versed i led or rather forced the conversation into a vein of historical erudition discussing several of the most prominent facts of ancient history and accompanying them with sound indisputable apothegms  mr somerville listened to me with the air of a man receiving information i was encouraged and went on gloriously from theme to theme of school declamation i sat with marius on the ruins of carthage i defended the bridge with horatius cocles thrust my hand into the flame with martius scaevola and plunged with curtius into the yawning gulf i fought side by side with leonidas at the straits of thermopylae and was going full drive into the battle of plataea when my memory which is the worst in the world failed me just as i wanted the name of the lacedemonian commander  julia my dear said mr somerville perhaps you may recollect the name of which mr mountjoy is in quest  julia colored slightly i believe said she in a low voice i believe it was pausanius  this unexpected sally instead of reenforcing me threw my whole scheme of battle into confusion and the athenians remained unmolested in the field  i am half inclined since to think mr somerville meant this as a sly hit at my schoolboy pedantry but he was too well bred not to seek to relieve me from my mortification oh said he julia is our family book of reference for names dates and distances and has an excellent memory for history and geography  i now became desperate as a last resource i turned to metaphysics if she is a philosopher in petticoats thought i it is all over with me here however i had the field to myself i gave chapter and verse of my tutors lectures heightened by all his poetical illustrations i even went further than he had ever ventured and plunged into such depths of metaphysics that i was in danger of sticking in the mire at the bottom fortunately i had auditors who apparently could not detect my flounderings neither mr somerville nor his daughter offered the least interruption  when the ladies had retired mr somerville sat some time with me and as i was no longer anxious to astonish i permitted myself to listen and found that he was really agreeable he was quite communicative and from his conversation i was enabled to form a juster idea of his daughters character and the mode in which she had been brought up mr somerville had mingled much with the world and with what is termed fashionable society he had experienced its cold elegances and gay insincerities its dissipation of the spirits and squanderings of the heart like many men of the world though he had wandered too far from nature ever to return to it yet he had the good taste and good feeling to look back fondly to its simple delights and to determine that his child if possible should never leave them he had superintended her education with scrupulous care storing her mind with the graces of polite literature and with such knowledge as would enable it to furnish its own amusement and occupation and giving her all the accomplishments that sweeten and enliven the circle of domestic life he had been particularly sedulous to exclude all fashionable affectations all false sentiment false sensibility and false romance whatever advantages she may possess said he she is quite unconscious of them she is a capricious little being in everything but her affections she is however free from art simple ingenuous amiable and i thank god happy  such was the eulogy of a fond father delivered with a tenderness that touched me i could not help making a casual inquiry whether among the graces of polite literature he had included a slight tincture of metaphysics he smiled and told me he had not  on the whole when as usual that night i summed up the days observations on my pillow i was not altogether dissatisfied miss somerville said i loves poetry and i like her the better for it she has the advantage of me in italian agreed what is it to know a variety of languages but merely to have a variety of sounds to express the same idea original thought is the ore of the mind language is but the accidental stamp and coinage by which it is put into circulation if i can furnish an original idea what care i how many languages she can translate it into she may be able also to quote names and dates and latitudes better than i but that is a mere effort of the memory i admit she is more accurate in history and geography than i but then she knows nothing of metaphysics  i had now sufficiently recovered to return home yet i could not think of leaving mr somervilles without having a little further conversation with him on the subject of his daughters education  this mr somerville thought i is a very accomplished elegant man he has seen a good deal of the world and upon the whole has profited by what he has seen he is not without information and as far as he thinks appears to think correctly but after all he is rather superficial and does not think profoundly he seems to take no delight in those metaphysical abstractions that are the proper aliment of masculine minds i called to mind various occasions in which i had indulged largely in metaphysical discussions but could recollect no instance where i had been able to draw him out he had listened it is true with attention and smiled as if in acquiescence but had always appeared to avoid reply besides i had made several sad blunders in the glow of eloquent declamation but he had never interrupted me to notice and correct them as he would have done had he been versed in the theme  now it is really a great pity resumed i that he should have the entire management of miss somervilles education what a vast advantage it would be if she could be put for a little time under the superintendence of glencoe he would throw some deeper shades of thought into her mind which at present is all sunshine not but that mr somerville has done very well as far as he has gone but then he has merely prepared the soil for the strong plants of useful knowledge she is well versed in the leading facts of history and the general course of belleslettres said i a little more philosophy would do wonders  i accordingly took occasion to ask mr somerville for a few moments conversation in his study the morning i was to depart when we were alone i opened the matter fully to him i commenced with the warmest eulogium of glencoes powers of mind and vast acquirements and ascribed to him all my proficiency in the higher branches of knowledge i begged therefore to recommend him as a friend calculated to direct the studies of miss somerville to lead her mind by degrees to the contemplation of abstract principles and to produce habits of philosophical analysis which added i gently smiling are not often cultivated by young ladies i ventured to hint in addition that he would find mr glencoe a most valuable and interesting acquaintance for himself one who would stimulate and evolve the powers of his mind and who might open to him tracts of inquiry and speculation to which perhaps he had hitherto been a stranger  mr somerville listened with grave attention when i had finished he thanked me in the politest manner for the interest i took in the welfare of his daughter and himself he observed that as it regarded himself he was afraid he was too old to benefit by the instruction of mr glencoe and that as to his daughter he was afraid her mind was but little fitted for the study of metaphysics i do not wish continued he to strain her intellects with subjects they cannot grasp but to make her familiarly acquainted with those that are within the limits of her capacity i do not pretend to prescribe the boundaries of female genius and am far from indulging the vulgar opinion that women are unfitted by nature for the highest intellectual pursuits i speak only with reference to my daughters tastes and talents she will never make a learned woman nor in truth do i desire it for such is the jealousy of our sex as to mental as well as physical ascendency that a learned woman is not always the happiest i do not wish my daughter to excite envy or to battle with the prejudices of the world but to glide peaceably through life on the good will and kind opinions of her friends she has ample employment for her little head in the course i have marked out for her and is busy at present with some branches of natural history calculated to awaken her perceptions to the beauties and wonders of nature and to the inexhaustible volume of wisdom constantly spread open before her eyes i consider that woman most likely to make an agreeable companion who can draw topics of pleasing remark from every natural object and most likely to be cheerful and contented who is continually sensible of the order the harmony and the invariable beneficence that reign throughout the beautiful world we inhabit  but added he smiling i am betraying myself into a lecture instead of merely giving a reply to your kind offer permit me to take the liberty in return of inquiring a little about your own pursuits you speak of having finished your education but of course you have a line of private study and mental occupation marked out for you must know the importance both in point of interest and happiness of keeping the mind employed may i ask what system you observe in your intellectual exercises  oh as to system i observed i could never bring myself into anything of the kind i thought it best to let my genius take it own course as it always acted the most vigorously when stimulated by inclination  mr somerville shook his head this same genius said he is a wild quality that runs away with our most promising young men it has become so much the fashion too to give it the reins that it is now thought an animal of too noble and generous a nature to be brought to harness but it is all a mistake nature never designed these high endowments to run riot through society and throw the whole system into confusion no my dear sir genius unless it acts upon system is very apt to be a useless quality to society sometimes an injurious and certainly a very uncomfortable one to its possessor i have had many opportunities of seeing the progress through life of young men who were accounted geniuses and have found it too often end in early exhaustion and bitter disappointment and have as often noticed that these effects might be traced to a total want of system there were no habits of business of steady purpose and regular application superinduced upon the mind everything was left to chance and impulse and native luxuriance and everything of course ran to waste and wild entanglement excuse me if i am tedious on this point for i feel solicitous to impress it upon you being an error extremely prevalent in our country and one into which too many of our youth have fallen i am happy however to observe the zeal which still appears to actuate you for the acquisition of knowledge and augur every good from the elevated bent of your ambition may i ask what has been your course of study for the last six months  never was question more unluckily timed for the last six months i had been absolutely buried in novels and romances  mr somerville perceived that the question was embarrassing and with his invariable good breeding immediately resumed the conversation without waiting for a reply he took care however to turn it in such a way as to draw from me an account of the whole manner in which i had been educated and the various currents of reading into which my mind had run he then went on to discuss briefly but impressively the different branches of knowledge most important to a young man in my situation and to my surprise i found him a complete master of those studies on which i had supposed him ignorant and on which i had been descanting so confidently  he complimented me however very graciously upon the progress i had made but advised me for the present to turn my attention to the physical rather than the moral sciences these studies said he store a mans mind with valuable facts and at the same time repress selfconfidence by letting him know how boundless are the realms of knowledge and how little we can possibly know whereas metaphysical studies though of an ingenious order of intellectual employment are apt to bewilder some minds with vague speculations they never know how far they have advanced or what may be the correctness of their favorite theory they render many of our young men verbose and declamatory and prone to mistake the aberrations of their fancy for the inspirations of divine philosophy  i could not but interrupt him to assent to the truth of these remarks and to say that it had been my lot in the course of my limited experience to encounter young men of the kind who had overwhelmed me by their verbosity  mr somerville smiled i trust said he kindly that you will guard against these errors avoid the eagerness with which a young man is apt to hurry into conversation and to utter the crude and illdigested notions which he has picked up in his recent studies be assured that extensive and accurate knowledge is the slow acquisition of a studious lifetime that a young man however pregnant his wit and prompt his talent can have mastered but the rudiments of learning and in a manner attained the implements of study whatever may have been your past assiduity you must be sensible that as yet you have but reached the threshold of true knowledge but at the same time you have the advantage that you are still very young and have ample time to learn  here our conference ended i walked out of the study a very different being from what i was on entering it i had gone in with the air of a professor about to deliver a lecture i came out like a student who had failed in his examination and been degraded in his class  very young and on the threshold of knowledge this was extremely flattering to one who had considererd himself an accomplished scholar and a profound philosopher  it is singular thought i there seems to have been a spell upon my faculties ever since i have been in this house i certainly have not been able to do myself justice whenever i have undertaken to advise i have had the tables turned upon me it must be that i am strange and diffident among people i am not accustomed to i wish they could hear me talk at home  after all added i on further reflection after all there is a great deal of force in what mr somerville has said somehow or other these men of the world do now and then hit upon remarks that would do credit to a philosopher some of his general observations came so home that i almost thought they were meant for myself his advice about adopting a system of study is very judicious i will immediately put it hi practice my mind shall operate henceforward with the regularity of clockwork  how far i succeeded in adopting this plan how i fared in the further pursuit of knowledge and how i succeeded in my suit to julia somerville may afford matter for a further communication to the public if this simple record of my early life is fortunate enough to excite any curiosity      the great mississippi bubble  a time of unexampled prosperity   in the course of a voyage from england i once fell in with a convoy of merchant ships bound for the west indies the weather was uncommonly bland and the ships vied with each other in spreading sail to catch a light favoring breeze until their hulls were almost hidden beneath a cloud of canvas the breeze went down with the sun and his last yellow rays shone upon a thousand sails idly flapping against the masts  i exulted in the beauty of the scene and augured a prosperous voyage but the veteran master of the ship shook his head and pronounced this halcyon calm a weatherbreeder and so it proved a storm burst forth in the night the sea roared and raged and when the day broke i beheld the late gallant convoy scattered in every direction some dismasted others scudding under bare poles and many firing signals of distress  i have since been occasionally reminded of this scene by those calm sunny seasons in the commercial world which are known by the name of times of unexampled prosperity they are the sure weatherbreeders of traffic every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons when the credit system as it is called expands to full luxuriance everybody trusts everybody a bad debt is a thing unheard of the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open and men are tempted to dash forward boldly from the facility of borrowing  promissory notes interchanged between scheming individuals are liberally discounted at the banks which become so many mints to coin words into cash and as the supply of words is inexhaustible it may readily be supposed what a vast amount of promissory capital is soon in circulation every one now talks in thousands nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade great purchases and sales of real property and immense sums made at every transfer all to be sure as yet exists in promise but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital and falls back in amazement at the amount of public wealth the unexampled state of public prosperity  now is the time for speculative and dreaming or designing men they relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous dazzle them with golden visions and set them madding after shadows the example of one stimulates another speculation rises on speculation bubble rises on bubble every one helps with his breath to swell the windy superstructure and admires and wonders at the magnitude of the inflation he has contributed to produce  speculation is the romance of trade and casts contempt upon all its sober realities it renders the stockjobber a magician and the exchange a region of enchantment it elevates the merchant into a kind of knighterrant or rather a commercial quixote the slow but sure gains of snug percentage become despicable in his eyes no operation is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment no business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune as he sits musing over his ledger with pen behind his ear he is like la manchas hero in his study dreaming over his books of chivalry his dusty countinghouse fades before his eyes or changes into a spanish mine he gropes after diamonds or dives after pearls the subterranean garden of aladdin is nothing to the realms of wealth that break upon his imagination  could this delusion always last the life of a merchant would indeed be a golden dream but it is as short as it is brilliant let but a doubt enter and the season of unexampled prosperity is at end the coinage of words is suddenly curtailed the promissory capital begins to vanish into smoke a panic succeeds and the whole superstructure built upon credit and reared by speculation crumbles to the ground leaving scarce a wreck behind    it is such stuff as dreams are made of  when a man of business therefore hears on every side rumors of fortunes suddenly acquired when he finds banks liberal and brokers busy when he sees adventurers flush of paper capital and full of scheme and enterprise when he perceives a greater disposition to buy than to sell when trade overflows its accustomed channels and deluges the country when he hears of new regions of commercial adventure of distant marts and distant mines swallowing merchandise and disgorging gold when he finds jointstock companies of all kinds forming railroads canals and locomotive engines springing up on every side when idlers suddenly become men of business and dash into the game of commerce as they would into the hazards of the faro table when he beholds the streets glittering with new equipages palaces conjured up by the magic of speculation tradesmen flushed with sudden success and vying with each other in ostentatious expense in a word when he hears the whole community joining in the theme of unexampled prosperity let him look upon the whole as a weatherbreeder and prepare for the impending storm  the foregoing remarks are intended merely as a prelude to a narrative i am about to lay before the public of one of the most memorable instances of the infatuation of gain to be found in the whole history of commerce i allude to the famous mississippi bubble it is a matter that has passed into a proverb and become a phrase in every ones mouth yet of which not one merchant in ten has probably a distinct idea i have therefore thought that an authentic account of it would be interesting and salutary at the present moment when we are suffering under the effects of a severe access of the credit system and just recovering from one of its ruinous delusions  before entering into the story of this famous chimera it is proper to give a few particulars concerning the individual who engendered it john law was born in edinburgh in 1671 his father william law was a rich goldsmith and left his son an estate of considerable value called lauriston situated about four miles from edinburgh goldsmiths in those days acted occasionally as bankers and his fathers operations under this character may have originally turned the thoughts of the youth to the science of calculation in which he became an adept so that at an early age he excelled in playing at all games of combination  in 1694 he appeared in london where a handsome person and an easy and insinuating address gained him currency in the first circles and the nickname of beau law the same personal advantages gave him success in the world of gallantry until he became involved in a quarrel with beau wilson his rival in fashion whom he killed in a duel and then fled to france to avoid prosecution  he returned to edinburgh in 1700 and remained there several years during which time he first broached his great credit system offering to supply the deficiency of coin by the establishment of a bank which according to his views might emit a paper currency equivalent to the whole landed estate of the kingdom  his scheme excited great astonishment in edinburgh but though the government was not sufficiently advanced in financial knowledge to detect the fallacies upon which it was founded scottish caution and suspicion served in the place of wisdom and the project was rejected law met with no better success with the english parliament and the fatal affair of the death of wilson still hanging over him for which he had never been able to procure a pardon he again went to france  the financial affairs of france were at this time in a deplorable condition the wars the pomp and profusion of louis xiv and his religious persecutions of whole classes of the most industrious of his subjects had exhausted his treasury and overwhelmed the nation with debt the old monarch clung to his selfish magnificence and could not be induced to diminish his enormous expenditure and his minister of finance was driven to his wits end to devise all kinds of disastrous expedients to keep up the royal state and to extricate the nation from its embarrassments  in this state of things law ventured to bring forward his financial project it was founded on the plan of the bank of england which had already been in successful operation several years he met with immediate patronage and a congenial spirit in the duke of orleans who had married a natural daughter of the king the duke had been astonished at the facility with which england had supported the burden of a public debt created by the wars of anne and william and which exceeded in amount that under which france was groaning the whole matter was soon explained by law to his satisfaction the latter maintained that england had stopped at the mere threshold of an art capable of creating unlimited sources of national wealth the duke was dazzled with his splendid views and specious reasonings and thought he clearly comprehended his system demarets the comptrollergeneral of finance was not so easily deceived he pronounced the plan of law more pernicious than any of the disastrous expedients that the government had yet been driven to the old king also louis xiv detested all innovations especially those which came from a rival nation the project of a bank therefore was utterly rejected  law remained for a while in paris leading a gay and affluent existence owing to his handsome person easy manners flexible temper and a farobank which he had set up his agreeable career was interrupted by a message from dargenson lieutenantgeneral of police ordering him to quit paris alleging that he was rather too skillful at the game which he had introduced  for several succeeding years he shifted his residence from state to state of italy and germany offering his scheme of finance to every court that he visited but without success the duke of savoy victor amadeus afterward king of sardinia was much struck with his project but after considering it for a time replied i am not sufficiently powerful to ruin myself  the shifting adventurous life of law and the equivocal means by which he appeared to live playing high and always with great success threw a cloud of suspicion over him wherever he went and caused him to be expelled by the magistracy from the semicommercial semiaristocratical cities of venice and genoa  the events of 1715 brought law back again to paris louis xiv was dead louis xv was a mere child and during his minority the duke of orleans held the reins of government as regent law had at length found his man  the duke of orleans has been differently represented by different contemporaries he appears to have had excellent natural qualities perverted by a bad education he was of the middle size easy and graceful with an agreeable countenance and open affable demeanor his mind was quick and sagacious rather than profound and his quickness of intellect and excellence of memory supplied the lack of studious application his wit was prompt and pungent he expressed himself with vivacity and precision his imagination was vivid his temperament sanguine and joyous his courage daring his mother the duchess of orleans expressed his character in a jeu desprit the fairies said she were invited to be present at his birth and each one conferring a talent on my son he possesses them all unfortunately we had forgotten to invite an old fairy who arriving after all the others exclaimed he shall have all the talents excepting that to make a good use of them  under proper tuition the duke might have risen to real greatness but in his early years he was put under the tutelage of the abbe dubois one of the subtlest and basest spirits that ever intrigued its way into eminent place and power the abbe was of low origin and despicable exterior totally destitute of morals and perfidious in the extreme but with a supple insinuating address and an accommodating spirit tolerant of all kinds of profligacy in others conscious of his own inherent baseness he sought to secure an influence over his pupil by corrupting his principles and fostering his vices he debased him to keep himself from being despised unfortunately he succeeded to the early precepts of this infamous pander have been attributed those excesses that disgraced the manhood of the regent and gave a licentious character to his whole course of government his love of pleasure quickened and indulged by those who should have restrained it led him into all kinds of sensual indulgence he had been taught to think lightly of the most serious duties and sacred ties to turn virtue into a jest and consider religion mere hypocrisy he was a gay misanthrope that had a sovereign but sportive contempt for mankind believed that his most devoted servant would be his enemy if interest prompted and maintained that an honest man was he who had the art to conceal that he was the contrary  he surrounded himself with a set of dissolute men like himself who let loose from the restraint under which they had been held during the latter hypocritical days of louis xiv now gave way to every kind of debauchery with these men the regent used to shut himself up after the hours of business and excluding all graver persons and graver concerns celebrate the most drunken and disgusting orgies where obscenity and blasphemy formed the seasoning of conversation for the profligate companions of these revels he invented the appellation of his rou√©s the literal meaning of which is men broken on the wheel intended no doubt to express their brokendown characters and dislocated fortunes although a contemporary asserts that it designated the punishment that most of them merited madame de labran who was present at one of the regents suppers was disgusted by the conduct and conversation of the host and his guests and observed at table that god after he had created man took the refuse clay that was left and made of it the souls of lackeys and princes  such was the man that now ruled the destinies of france law found him full of perplexities from the disastrous state of the finances he had already tampered with the coinage calling in the coin of the nation restamping it and issuing it at a nominal increase of onefifth thus defrauding the nation out of twenty per cent of its capital he was not likely therefore to be scrupulous about any means likely to relieve him from financial difficulties he had even been led to listen to the cruel alternative of a national bankruptcy  under these circumstances law confidently brought forward his scheme of a bank that was to pay off the national debt increase the revenue and at the same time diminish the taxes the following is stated as the theory by which he recommended his system to the regent the credit enjoyed by a banker or a merchant he observed increases his capital tenfold that is to say he who has a capital of one thousand livres may if he possess sufficient credit extend his operations to a million and reap profits to that amount in like manner a state that can collect into a bank all the current coin of the kingdom would be as powerful as if its capital were increased tenfold the specie must be drawn into the bank not by way of loan or by taxations but in the way of deposit this might be effected in different modes either by inspiring confidence or by exerting authority one mode he observed had already been in use each time that a state makes a recoinage it becomes momentarily the depositary of all the money called in belonging to the subjects of that state his bank was to effect the same purpose that is to say to receive in deposit all the coin of the kingdom but to give in exchange its bills which being of an invariable value bearing an interest and being payable on demand would not only supply the place of coin but prove a better and more profitable currency  the regent caught with avidity at the scheme it suited his bold reckless spirit and his grasping extravagance not that he was altogether the dupe of laws specious projects still he was apt like many other men unskilled in the arcana of finance to mistake the multiplication of money for the multiplication of wealth not understanding that it was a mere agent or instrument in the interchange of traffic to represent the value of the various productions of industry and that an increased circulation of coin or bank bills in the shape of currency only adds a proportionably increased and fictitious value to such productions law enlisted the vanity of the regent in his cause he persuaded him that he saw more clearly than others into sublime theories of finance which were quite above the ordinary apprehension he used to declare that excepting the regent and the duke of savoy no one had thoroughly comprehended his system  it is certain that it met with strong opposition from the regents ministers the duke de noailles and the chancellor danguesseau and it was no less strenuously opposed by the parliament of paris law however had a potent though secret coadjutor in the abbe dubois now rising during the regency into great political power and who retained a baneful influence over the mind of the regent this wily priest as avaricious as he was ambitious drew large sums from law as subsidies and aided him greatly in many of his most pernicious operations he aided him in the present instance to fortify the mind of the regent against all the remonstrances of his ministers and the parliament  accordingly on the 2d of may 1716 letters patent were granted to law to establish a bank of deposit discount and circulation under the firm of law  company to continue for twenty years the capital was fixed at six millions of livres divided into shares of five hundred livres each which were to be sold for twentyfive per cent of the regents debased coin and seventyfive per cent of the public securities which were then at a great reduction from their nominal value and which then amounted to nineteen hundred millions the ostensible object of the bank as set forth in the patent was to encourage the commerce and manufactures of france the louis dors and crowns of the bank were always to retain the same standard of value and its bills to be payable in them on demand  at the outset while the bank was limited in its operations and while its paper really represented the specie in its vaults it seemed to realize all that had been promised from it it rapidly acquired public confidence and an extended circulation and produced an activity in commerce unknown under the baneful government of louis xiv as the bills of the bank bore an interest and as it was stipulated they would be of invariable value and as hints had been artfully circulated that the coin would experience successive diminution everybody hastened to the bank to exchange gold and silver for paper so great became the throng of depositors and so intense their eagerness that there was quite a press and struggle at the bank door and a ludicrous panic was awakened as if there was danger of their not being admitted an anecdote of the time relates that one of the clerks with an ominous smile called out to the struggling multitude have a little patience my friends we mean to take all your money an assertion disastrously verified in the sequel  thus by the simple establishment of a bank law and the regent obtained pledges of confidence for the consummation of further and more complicated schemes as yet hidden from the public in a little while the bank shares rose enormously and the amount of its notes in circulation exceeded one hundred and ten millions of livres a subtle stroke of policy had rendered it popular with the aristocracy louis xiv had several years previously imposed an income tax of a tenth giving his royal word that it should cease in 1717 this tax had been exceedingly irksome to the privileged orders and in the present disastrous times they had dreaded an augmentation of it in consequence of the successful operation of laws scheme however the tax was abolished and now nothing was to be heard among the nobility and clergy but praises of the regent and the bank  hitherto all had gone well and all might have continued to go well had not the paper system been further expanded but law had yet the grandest part of his scheme to develop he had to open his ideal world of speculation his el dorado of unbounded wealth the english had brought the vast imaginary commerce of the south seas in aid of their banking operations law sought to bring as an immense auxiliary of his bank the whole trade of the mississippi under this name was included not merely the river so called but the vast region known as louisiana extending from north latitude 29¬∞ up to canada in north latitude 40¬∞ this country had been granted by louis xiv to the sieur crozat but he had been induced to resign his patent in conformity to the plea of mr law letters patent were granted in august 1717 for the creation of a commercial company which was to have the colonizing of this country and the monopoly of its trade and resources and of the beaver or fur trade with canada it was called the western but became better known as the mississippi company the capital was fixed at one hundred millions of livres divided into shares bearing an interest of four per cent which were subscribed for in the public securities as the bank was to cooperate with the company the regent ordered that its bills should be received the same as coin in all payments of the public revenue law was appointed chief director of this company which was an exact copy of the earl of oxfords south sea company set on foot in 1711 and which distracted all england with the frenzy of speculation in like manner with the delusive picturings given in that memorable scheme of the sources of rich trade to be opened in the south sea countries law held forth magnificent prospects of the fortunes to be made in colonizing louisiana which was represented as a veritable land of promise capable of yielding every variety of the most precious produce reports too were artfully circulated with great mystery as if to the chosen few of mines of gold and silver recently discovered in louisiana and which would insure instant wealth to the early purchasers these confidential whispers of course soon became public and were confirmed by travelers fresh from the mississippi and doubtless bribed who had seen the mines in question and declared them superior in richness to those of mexico and peru nay more ocular proof was furnished to public credulity in ingots of gold conveyed to the mint as if just brought from the mines of louisiana  extraordinary measures were adopted to force a colonization an edict was issued to collect and transport settlers to the mississippi the police lent its aid the streets and prisons of paris and of the provincial cities were swept of mendicants and vagabonds of all kinds who were conveyed to havre de grace about six thousand were crowded into ships where no precautions had been taken for their health or accommodation instruments of all kinds proper for the working of mines were ostentatiously paraded in public and put on board the vessels and the whole set sail for this fabled el dorado which was to prove the grave of the greater part of its wretched colonists  danguesseau the chancellor a man of probity and integrity still lifted his voice against the paper system of law and his project of colonization and was eloquent and prophetic in picturing the evils they were calculated to produce the private distress and public degradation the corruption of morals and manners the triumph of knaves and schemers the ruin of fortunes and downfall of families he was incited more and more to this opposition by the duke de noailles the minister of finance who was jealous of the growing ascendency of law over the mind of the regent but was less honest than the chancellor in his opposition the regent was excessively annoyed by the difficulties they conjured up in the way of his darling schemes of finance and the countenance they gave to the opposition of parliament which body disgusted more and more with the abuses of the regency and the system of law had gone so far as to carry its remonstrances to the very foot of the throne  he determined to relieve himself from these two ministers who either through honesty or policy interfered with all his plans accordingly on the 28th of january 1718 he dismissed the chancellor from office and exiled him to his estate in the country and shortly afterward removed the duke de noailles from the administration of the finances  the opposition of parliament to the regent and his measures was carried on with increasing violence that body aspired to an equal authority with the regent in the administration of affairs and pretended by its decree to suspend an edict of the regency ordering a new coinage and altering the value of the currency but its chief hostility was leveled against law a foreigner and a heretic and one who was considered by a majority of the members in the light of a malefactor in fact so far was this hostility carried that secret measures were taken to investigate his malversations and to collect evidence against him and it was resolved in parliament that should the testimony collected justify their suspicions they would have him seized and brought before them would give him a brief trial and if convicted would hang him in the courtyard of the palace and throw open the gates after the execution that the public might behold his corpse  law received intimation of the danger hanging over him and was in terrible trepidation he took refuge in the palais royal the residence of the regent and implored his protection the regent himself was embarrassed by the sturdy opposition of parliament which contemplated nothing less than a decree reversing most of his public measures especially those of finance his indecision kept law for a time in an agony of terror and suspense finally by assembling a board of justice and bringing to his aid the absolute authority of the king he triumphed over parliament and relieved law from his dread of being hanged  the system now went on with flowing sail the western or mississippi company being identified with the bank rapidly increased in power and privileges one monopoly after another was granted to it the trade of the indian seas the slave trade with senegal and guinea the farming of tobacco the national coinage etc each new privilege was made a pretext for issuing more bills and caused an immense advance in the price of stock at length on the 4th of december 1718 the regent gave the establishment the imposing title of the royal bank and proclaimed that he had effected the purchase of all the shares the proceeds of which he had added to its capital this measure seemed to shock the public feeling more than any other connected with the system and roused the indignation of parliament the french nation had been so accustomed to attach an idea of everything noble lofty and magnificent to the royal name and person especially during the stately and sumptuous reign of louis xiv that they could not at first tolerate the idea of royalty being in any degree mingled with matters of traffic and finance and the king being in a manner a banker it was one of the downward steps however by which royalty lost its illusive splendor in france and became gradually cheapened in the public mind  arbitrary measures now began to be taken to force the bills of the bank into artificial currency on the 27th of december appeared an order in council forbidding under severe penalties the payment of any sum above six hundred livres in gold or silver this decree rendered bank bills necessary in all transactions of purchase and sale and called for a new emission the prohibition was occasionally evaded or opposed confiscations were the consequence informers were rewarded and spies and traitors began to spring up in all the domestic walks of life  the worst effect of this illusive system was the mania for gain or rather for gambling in stocks that now seized upon the whole nation under the exciting effects of lying reports and the forcing effects of government decrees the shares of the company went on rising in value until they reached thirteen hundred per cent nothing was now spoken of but the price of shares and the immense fortunes suddenly made by lucky speculators those whom law had deluded used every means to delude others the most extravagant dreams were indulged concerning the wealth to flow in upon the company from its colonies its trade and its various monopolies it is true nothing as yet had been realized nor could in some time be realized from these distant sources even if productive but the imaginations of speculators are ever in the advance and their conjectures are immediately converted into facts lying reports now flew from mouth to month of sure avenues to fortune suddenly thrown open the more extravagant the fable the more readily was it believed to doubt was to awaken anger or incur ridicule in a time of public infatuation it requires no small exercise of courage to doubt a popular fallacy  paris now became the center of attraction for the adventurous and the avaricious who flocked to it not merely from the provinces but from neighboring countries a stock exchange was established in a house in the rue quincampoix and became immediately the gathering place of stockjobbers the exchange opened at seven oclock with the beat of drum and sound of bell and closed at night with the same signals guards were stationed at each end of the street to maintain order and exclude carriages and horses the whole street swarmed throughout the day like a beehive bargains of all kinds were seized upon with avidity shares of stock passed from hand to hand mounting in value one knew not why fortunes were made in a moment as if by magic and every lucky bargain prompted those around to a more desperate throw of the die the fever went on increasing in intensity as the day declined and when the drum beat and the bell rang at night to close the exchange there were exclamations of impatience and despair as if the wheel of fortune had suddenly been stopped when about to make its luckiest evolution  to engulf all classes in this ruinous vortex law now split the shares of fifty millions of stock each into one hundred shares thus as in the splitting of lottery tickets accommodating the venture to the humblest purse society was thus stirred up to its very dregs and adventurers of the lowest order hurried to the stock market all honest industrious pursuits and modest gains were now despised wealth was to be obtained instantly without labor and without stint the upper classes were as base in their venality as the lower the highest and most powerful nobles abandoning all generous pursuits and lofty aims engaged in the vile scuffle for gam they were even baser than the lower classes for some of them who were members of the council of the regency abused their station and their influence and promoted measures by which shares rose while in their hands and they made immense profits  the duke de bourbon the prince of conti the dukes de la force and dantin were among the foremost of these illustrious stockjobbers they were nicknamed the mississippi lords and they smiled at the sneering title in fact the usual distinctions of society had lost their consequence under the reign of this new passion bank talent military fame no longer inspired deference all respect for others all selfrespect were forgotten in the mercenary struggle of the stockmarket even prelates and ecclesiastical corporations forgetting their true objects of devotion mingled among the votaries of mammon they were not behind those who wielded the civil power in fabricating ordinances suited to their avaricious purposes theological decisions forthwith appeared in which the anathema launched by the church against usury was conveniently construed as not extending to the traffic in bank shares  the abbe dubois entered into the mysteries of stockjobbing with all the zeal of an apostle and enriched himself by the spoils of the credulous and he continually drew large sums from law as considerations for his political influence faithless to his country in the course of his gambling speculations he transferred to england a great amount of specie which had been paid into the royal treasury thus contributing to the subsequent dearth of the precious metals  the female sex participated in this sordid frenzy princesses of the blood and ladies of the highest nobility were among the most rapacious of stockjobbers the regent seemed to have the riches of croesus at his command and lavished money by hundreds of thousands upon his female relatives and favorites as well as upon his rou√©s the dissolute companions of his debauches my son writes the regents mother in her correspondence gave me shares to the amount of two millions which i distributed among my household the king also took several millions for his own household all the royal family have had them all the children and grandchildren of france and the princes of the blood  luxury and extravagance kept pace with this sudden inflation of fancied wealth the hereditary palaces of nobles were pulled down and rebuilt on a scale of augmented splendor entertainments were given of incredible cost and magnificence never before had been such display in houses furniture equipages and amusements this was particularly the case among persons of the lower ranks who had suddenly become possessed of millions ludicrous anecdotes are related of some of these upstarts one who had just launched a splendid carriage when about to use it for the first time instead of getting in at the door mounted through habitude to his accustomed place behind some ladies of quality seeing a welldressed woman covered with diamonds but whom nobody knew alight from a very handsome carriage inquired who she was of the footman he replied with a sneer it is a lady who has recently tumbled from a garret into this carriage mr laws domestics were said to become in like manner suddenly enriched by the crumbs that fell from his table his coachman having made his fortune retired from his service mr law requested him to procure a coachman in his place he appeared the next day with two whom he pronounced equally good and told mr law take which of them you choose and i will take the other  nor were these novi homini treated with the distance and disdain they would formerly have experienced from the haughty aristocracy of france the pride of the old noblesse had been stifled by the stronger instinct of avarice they rather sought the intimacy and confidence of these lucky upstarts and it has been observed that a nobleman would gladly take his seat at the table of the fortunate lackey of yesterday in hopes of learning from him the secret of growing rich  law now went about with a countenance radiant with success and apparently dispensing wealth on every side he is admirably skilled in all that relates to finance writes the duchess of orleans the regents mother and has put the affairs of the state in such good order that all the kings debts have been paid he is so much run after that he has no repose night or day a duchess even kissed his hand publicly if a duchess can do this what will other ladies do  wherever he went his path we are told was beset by a sordid throng who waited to see him pass and sought to obtain the favor of a word a nod or smile as if a mere glance from him would bestow fortune when at home his house was absolutely besieged by furious candidates for fortune they forced the doors says the duke de st simon they scaled his windows from the garden they made their way into his cabinet down the chimney  the same venal court was paid by all classes to his family the highest ladies of the court vied with each other in meannesses to purchase the lucrative friendship of mrs law and her daughter they waited upon them with as much assiduity and adulation as if they had been princesses of the blood the regent one day expressed a desire that some duchess should accompany his daughter to genoa my lord said some one present if you would have a choice from among the duchesses you need but send to mrs laws you will find them all assembled there  the wealth of law rapidly increased with the expansion of the bubble in the course of a few months he purchased fourteen titled estates paying for them in paper and the public hailed these sudden and vast acquisitions of landed property as so many proofs of the soundness of his system in one instance he met with a shrewd bargainer who had not the general faith in his paper money the president de novion insisted on being paid for an estate in hard coin law accordingly brought the amount four hundred thousand livres in specie saying with a sarcastic smile that he preferred paying in money as its weight rendered it a mere encumbrance as it happened the president could give no clear title to the land and the money had to be refunded he paid it back in paper which law dared not refuse lest he should depreciate it in the market  the course of illusory credit went on triumphantly for eighteen months law had nearly fulfilled one of his promises for the greater part of the public debt had been paid off but how paid in bank shares which had been trumped up several hundred per cent above their value and which were to vanish like smoke in the hands of the holders  one of the most striking attributes of law was the imperturbable assurance and selfpossession with which he replied to every objection and found a solution for every problem he had the dexterity of a juggler in evading difficulties and what was peculiar made figures themselves which are the very elements of exact demonstration the means to dazzle and bewilder  toward the latter end of 1719 the mississippi scheme had reached its highest point of glory half a million of strangers had crowded into paris in quest of fortune the hotels and lodginghouses were overflowing lodgings were procured with excessive difficulty granaries were turned into bedrooms provisions had risen enormously in price splendid houses were multiplying on every side the streets were crowded with carriages above a thousand new equipages had been launched  on the eleventh of december law obtained another prohibitory decree for the purpose of sweeping all the remaining specie in circulation into the bank by this it was forbidden to make any payment in silver above ten livres or in gold above three hundred  the repeated decrees of this nature the object of which was to depreciate the value of gold and increase the illusive credit of paper began to awaken doubts of a system which required such bolstering capitalists gradually awoke from their bewilderment sound and able financiers consulted together and agreed to make common cause against this continual expansion of a paper system the shares of the bank and of the company began to decline in value wary men took the alarm and began to realize a word now first brought into use to express the conversion of ideal property into something real  the prince of conti one of the most prominent and grasping of the mississippi lords was the first to give a blow to the credit of the bank there was a mixture of ingratitude in his conduct that characterized the venal baseness of the times he had received from time to time enormous sums from law as the price of his influence and patronage his avarice had increased with every acquisition until law was compelled to refuse one of his exactions in revenge the prince immediately sent such an amount of paper to the bank to be cashed that it required four wagons to bring away the silver and he had the meanness to loll out of the window of his hotel and jest and exult as it was trundled into his portecoch√®re  this was the signal for other drains of like nature the english and dutch merchants who had purchased a great amount of bank paper at low prices cashed them at the bank and carried the money out of the country other strangers did the like thus draining the kingdom of its specie and leaving paper in its place  the regent perceiving these symptoms of decay in the system sought to restore it to public confidence by conferring marks of confidence upon its author  he accordingly resolved to make law comptroller general of the finances of france there was a material obstacle in his way law was a protestant and the regent unscrupulous as he was himself did not dare publicly to outrage the severe edicts which louis xiv in his bigot days had fulminated against all heretics law soon let him know that there would be no difficulty on that head he was ready at any moment to abjure his religion in the way of business for decencys sake however it was judged proper he should previously be convinced and converted a ghostly instructor was soon found ready to accomplish his conversion in the shortest possible time this was the abbe tencin a profligate creature of the profligate dubois and like him working his way to ecclesiastical promotion and temporal wealth by the basest means  under the instructions of the abbe tencin law soon mastered the mysteries and dogmas of the catholic doctrine and after a brief course of ghostly training declared himself thoroughly convinced and converted to avoid the sneers and jests of the parisian public the ceremony of abjuration took place at melun law made a pious present of one hundred thousand livres to the church of st roque and the abbe tencin was rewarded for his edifying labors by sundry shares and bank bills which he shrewdly took care to convert into cash having as little faith in the system as in the piety of his new convert a more grave and moral community might have been outraged by this scandalous farce but the parisians laughed at it with their usual levity and contented themselves with making it the subject of a number of songs and epigrams  law now being orthodox in his faith took out letters of naturalization and having thus surmounted the intervening obstacles was elevated by the regent to the post of comptrollergeneral so accustomed had the community become to all juggles and transmutations in this hero of finance that no one seemed shocked or astonished at his sudden elevation on the contrary being now considered perfectly established in place and power he became more than ever the object of venal adoration men of rank and dignity thronged his antechamber waiting patiently their turn for an audience and titled dames demeaned themselves to take the front seats of the carriages of his wife and daughter as if they had been riding with princesses of the blood royal laws head grew giddy with his elevation and he began to aspire after aristocratical distinction there was to be a court ball at which several of the young noblemen were to dance in a ballet with the youthful king law requested that his son might be admitted into the ballet and the regent consented the young scions of nobility however were indignant and scouted the intruding upstart their more worldly parents fearful of displeasing the modern midas reprimanded them in vain the striplings had not yet imbibed the passion for gain and still held to their high blood the son of the banker received slights and annoyances on all sides and the public applauded them for their spirit a fit of illness came opportunely to relieve the youth from an honor which would have cost him a world of vexations and affronts  in february 1720 shortly after laws installment in office a decree came out uniting the bank to the india company by which last name the whole establishment was now known the decree stated that as the bank was royal the king was bound to make good the value of its bills that he committed to the company the government of the bank for fifty years and sold to it fifty millions of stock belonging to him for nine hundred millions a simple advance of eighteen hundred per cent the decree further declared in the kings name that he would never draw on the bank until the value of his drafts had first been lodged in it by his receiversgeneral  the bank it was said had by this time issued notes to the amount of one thousand millions being more paper than all the banks of europe were able to circulate to aid its credit the receivers of the revenue were directed to take bank notes of the subreceivers all payments also of one hundred livres and upward were ordered to be made in banknotes these compulsory measures for a short time gave a false credit to the bank which proceeded to discount merchants notes to lend money on jewels plate and other valuables as well as on mortgages  still further to force on the system an edict next appeared forbidding any individual or any corporate body civil or religious to hold in possession more than five hundred livres in current coin that is to say about seven louis dors the value of the louisdor in paper being at the time seventytwo livres all the gold and silver they might have above this pittance was to be brought to the royal bank and exchanged either for shares or bills  as confiscation was the penalty of disobedience to this decree and informers were assured a share of the forfeitures a bounty was in a manner held out to domestic spies and traitors and the most odious scrutiny was awakened into the pecuniary affairs of families and individuals the very confidence between friends and relatives was unpaired and all the domestic ties and virtues of society were threatened until a general sentiment of indignation broke forth that compelled the regent to rescind the odious decree lord stairs the british embassador speaking of the system of espionage encouraged by this edict observed that it was impossible to doubt that law was a thorough catholic since he had thus established the inquisition after having already proved transubstantiation by changing specie into paper  equal abuses had taken place under the colonizing project in his thousand expedients to amass capital law had sold parcels of land in mississippi at the rate of three thousand livres for a league square many capitalists had purchased estates large enough to constitute almost a principality the only evil was law had sold a property which he could not deliver the agents of police who aided in recruiting the ranks of the colonists had been guilty of scandalous impositions under pretense of taking up mendicants and vagabonds they had scoured the streets at night seizing upon honest mechanics or their sons and hurrying them to their crimpinghouses for the sole purpose of extorting money from them as a ransom the populace was roused to indignation by these abuses the officers of police were mobbed in the exercise of their odious functions and several of them were killed which put an end to this flagrant abuse of power  in march a most extraordinary decree of the council fixed the price of shares of the india company at nine thousand livres each all ecclesiastical communities and hospitals were now prohibited from investing money at interest in anything but india stock with all these props and stays the system continued to totter how could it be otherwise under a despotic government that could alter the value of property at every moment the very compulsory measures that were adopted to establish the credit of the bank hastened its fall plainly showing there was a want of solid security  law caused pamphlets to be published setting forth in eloquent language the vast profits that must accrue to holders of the stock and the impossibility of the kings ever doing it any harm on the very back of these assertions came forth an edict of the king dated the 22d of may wherein under pretense of having reduced the value of his coin it was declared necessary to reduce the value of his banknotes onehalf and of the india shares from nine thousand to five thousand livres  this decree came like a clap of thunder upon shareholders they found onehalf of the pretended value of the paper in their hands annihilated in an instant and what certainty had they with respect to the other half the rich considered themselves ruined those in humbler circumstances looked forward to abject beggary  the parliament seized the occasion to stand forth as the protector of the public and refused to register the decree it gained the credit of compelling the regent to retrace his step though it is more probable he yielded to the universal burst of public astonishment and reprobation on the 27th of may the edict was revoked and bank bills were restored to their previous value but the fatal blow had been struck the delusion was at an end government itself had lost all public confidence equally with the bank it had engendered and which its own arbitrary acts had brought into discredit all paris says the regents mother in her letters has been mourning at the cursed decree which law has persuaded my son to make i have received anonymous letters stating that i have nothing to fear on my own account but that my son shall be pursued with fire and sword  the regent now endeavored to avert the odium of his ruinous schemes from himself he affected to have suddenly lost confidence in law and on the 29th of may discharged bin from his employ as comptrollergeneral and stationed a swiss guard of sixteen men in his house he even refused to see him when on the following day he applied at the portal of the palais royal for admission but having played off this farce before the public he admitted him secretly the same night by a private door and continued as before to cooperate with him in his financial schemes  on the first of june the regent issued a decree permitting persons to have as much money as they pleased in their possession few however were in a state to benefit by this permission there was a run upon the bank but a royal ordinance immediately suspended payment until further orders to relieve the public mind a city stock was created of twentyfive millions bearing an interest of two and a half per cent for which bank notes were taken in exchange the bank notes thus withdrawn from circulation were publicly burned before the hotel de ville the public however had lost confidence in everything and everybody and suspected fraud and collusion in those who pretended to burn the bills  a general confusion now took place hi the financial world families who had lived in opulence found themselves suddenly reduced to indigence schemers who had been reveling in the delusion of princely fortune found their estates vanishing into thin air those who had any property remaining sought to secure it against reverses cautious persons found there was no safety for property in a country where the coin was continually shifting in value and where a despotism was exercised over public securities and even over the private purses of individuals they began to send their effects into other countries when lo on the 20th of june a royal edict commanded them to bring back their effects under penalty of forfeiting twice their value and forbade them under like penalty from investing their money in foreign stocks this was soon followed by another decree forbidding any one to retain precious stones in his possession or to sell them to foreigners all must be deposited in the bank in exchange for depreciating paper  execrations were now poured out on all sides against law and menaces of vengeance what a contrast in a short time to the venal incense that was offered up to him this person writes the regents mother who was formerly worshiped as a god is now not sure of his life it is astonishing how greatly terrified he is he is as a dead man he is pale as a sheet and it is said he can never get over it my son is not dismayed though he is threatened on all sides and is very much amused with laws terrors  about the middle of july the last grand attempt was made by law and the regent to keep up the system and provide for the immense emission of paper a decree was fabricated giving the india company the entire monopoly of commerce on condition that it would in the course of a year reimburse six hundred millions of livres of its bills at the rate of fifty millions per month  on the 17th this decree was sent to parliament to be registered it at once raised a storm of opposition in that assembly and a vehement discussion took place while that was going on a disastrous scene was passing out of doors  the calamitous effects of the system had reached the humblest concerns of human life provisions had risen to an enormous price paper money was refused at all the shops the people had not wherewithal to buy bread it had been found absolutely indispensable to relax a little from the suspension of specie payments and to allow small sums to be scantily exchanged for paper the doors of the bank and the neighboring streets were immediately thronged with a famishing multitude seeking cash for bank notes of ten livres so great was the press and struggle that several persons were stifled and crushed to death the mob carried three of the bodies to the courtyard of the palais royal some cried for the regent to come forth and behold the effect of his system others demanded the death of law the impostor who had brought this misery and rum upon the nation  the moment was critical the popular fury was rising to a tempest when le blanc the secretary of state stepped forth he had previously sent for the military and now only sought to gain tune singling out six or seven stout fellows who seemed to be the ringleaders of the mob my good fellows said he calmly carry away these bodies and place them in some church and then come back quickly to me for your pay they immediately obeyed a kind of funeral procession was formed the arrival of troops dispersed those who lingered behind and paris was probably saved from an insurrection  about ten oclock in the morning all being quiet law ventured to go in his carriage to the palais royal he was saluted with cries and curses as he passed along the streets and he reached the palais royal in a terrible fright the regent amused himself with his fears but retained him with him and sent off his carriage which was assailed by the mob pelted with stones and the glasses shivered the news of this outrage was communicated to parliament in the midst of a furious discussion of the decree for the commercial monopoly the first president who had been absent for a short time reentered and communicated the tidings in a whimsical couplet    messieurs messieurs bonne nouvelle   le carrosse de law est reduite en carrelle    gentlemen gentlemen good news   the carriage of law is shivered to atoms  the members sprang up with joy and law exclaimed they has he been torn to pieces the president was ignorant of the result of the tumult whereupon the debate was cut short the decree rejected and the house adjourned the members hurrying to learn the particulars such was the levity with which public affairs were treated at that dissolute and disastrous period  on the following day there was an ordinance from the king prohibiting all popular assemblages and troops were stationed at various points and in all public places the regiment of guards was ordered to hold itself in readiness and the musketeers to be at their hotels with their horses ready saddled a number of small offices were opened where people might cash small notes though with great delay and difficulty an edict was also issued declaring that whoever should refuse to take bank notes in the course of trade should forfeit double the amount  the continued and vehement opposition of parliament to the whole delusive system of finance had been a constant source of annoyance to the regent but this obstinate rejection of his last grand expedient of a commercial monopoly was not to be tolerated he determined to punish that intractable body the abbe dubois and law suggested a simple mode it was to suppress the parliament altogether being as they observed so far from useful that it was a constant impediment to the march of public affairs the regent was half inclined to listen to their advice but upon calmer consideration and the advice of friends he adopted a more moderate course on the 20th of july early in the morning all the doors of the parliamenthouse were taken possession of by troops others were sent to surround the house of the first president and others to the houses of the various members who were all at first in great alarm until an order from the king was put into their hands to render themselves at pontoise in the course of two days to which place the parliament was thus suddenly and arbitrarily transferred  this despotic act says voltaire would at any other time have caused an insurrection but one half of the parisians were occupied by their ruin and the other half by their fancied riches which were soon to vanish the president and members of parliament acquiesced in the mandate without a murmur they even went as if on a party of pleasure and made every preparation to lead a joyous life in their exile the musketeers who held possession of the vacated parliamenthouse a gay corps of fashionable young fellows amused themselves with making songs and pasquinades at the expense of the exiled legislators and at length to pass away time formed themselves into a mock parliament elected their presidents kings ministers and advocates took their seats in due form arraigned a cat at their bar in place of the sieur law and after giving it a fair trial condemned it to be hanged in this manner public affairs and public institutions were lightly turned to jest  as to the exiled parliament it lived gayly and luxuriously at pontoise at the public expense for the regent had furnished funds as usual with a lavish hand the first president had the mansion of the duke de bouillon put at his disposal already furnished with a vast and delightful garden on the borders of a river there he kept open house to all the members of parliament several tables were spread every day all furnished luxuriously and splendidly the most exquisite wines and liqueurs the choicest fruits and refreshments of all kinds abounded a number of small chariots for one and two horses were always at hand for such ladies and old gentlemen as wished to take an airing after dinner and card and billiard tables for such as chose to amuse themselves in that way until supper the sister and the daughter of the first president did the honors of the house and he himself presided there with an air of great ease hospitality and magnificence it became a party of pleasure to drive from paris to pontoise which was six leagues distant and partake of the amusements and festivities of the place business was openly slighted nothing was thought of but amusement the regent and his government were laughed at and made the subjects of continual pleasantries while the enormous expenses incurred by this idle and lavish course of life more than doubled the liberal sums provided this was the way in which the parliament resented their exile  during all this time the system was getting more and more involved the stock exchange had some time previously been removed to the place vendome but the tumult and noise becoming intolerable to the residents of that polite quarter and especially to the chancellor whose hotel was there the prince and princess carignan both deep gamblers in mississippi stock offered the extensive garden of the hotel de soissons as a rallyingplace for the worshipers of mammon the offer was accepted a number of barracks were immediately erected in the garden as offices for the stockbrokers and an order was obtained from the regent under pretext of police regulations that no bargain should be valid unless concluded in these barracks the rent of them immediately mounted to a hundred livres a month for each and the whole yielded these noble proprietors an ignoble revenue of half a million of livres  the mania for gain however was now at an end a universal panic succeeded sauve qui peut was the watchword every one was anxious to exchange falling paper for something of intrinsic and permanent value since money was not to be had jewels precious stones plate porcelain trinkets of gold and silver all commanded any price in paper land was bought at fifty years purchase and he esteemed himself happy who could get it even at this price monopolies now became the rage among the noble holders of paper the duke de la force bought up nearly all the tallow grease and soap others the coffee and spices others hay and oats foreign exchanges were almost impracticable the debts of dutch and english merchants were paid in this fictitious money all the coin of the realm having disappeared all the relations of debtor and creditor were confounded with one thousand crowns one might pay a debt of eighteen thousand livres  the regents mother who once exulted in the affluence of bank paper now wrote in a very different tone i have often wished said she in her letters that these banknotes were in the depths of the infernal regions they have given my son more trouble than relief nobody in france has a penny my son was once popular but since the arrival of this cursed law he is hated more and more not a week passes without my receiving letters filled with frightful threats and speaking of him as a tyrant i have just received one threatening him with poison when i showed it to him he did nothing but laugh  in the meantime law was dismayed by the increasing troubles and terrified at the tempest he had raised he was not a man of real courage and fearing for his personal safety from popular tumult or the despair of ruined individuals he again took refuge in the palace of the regent the latter as usual amused himself with his terrors and turned every new disaster into a jest but he too began to think of his own security  in pursuing the schemes of law he had no doubt calculated to carry through his term of government with ease and splendor and to enrich himself his connections and his favorites and had hoped that the catastrophe of the system would not take place until after the expiration of the regency  he now saw his mistake that it was impossible much longer to prevent an explosion and he determined at once to get law out of the way and then to charge him with the whole tissue of delusions of this paper alchemy he accordingly took occasion of the recall of parliament in december 1720 to suggest to law the policy of his avoiding an encounter with that hostile and exasperated body law needed no urging to the measure his only desire was to escape from paris and its tempestuous populace two days before the return of parliament he took his sudden and secret departure he traveled in a chaise bearing the arms of the regent and was escorted by a kind of safeguard of servants in the dukes livery his first place of refuge was an estate of the regents about six leagues from paris from whence he pushed forward to bruxelles  as soon as law was fairly out of the way the duke of orleans summoned a council of the regency and informed them that they were assembled to deliberate on the state of the finances and the affairs of the india company accordingly la houssaye comptrollergeneral rendered a perfectly clear statement by which it appeared that there were bank bills in circulation to the amount of two milliards seven hundred millions of livres without any evidence that this enormous sum had been emitted in virtue of any ordinance from the general assembly of the india company which alone had the right to authorize such emissions  the council was astonished at this disclosure and looked to the regent for explanation pushed to the extreme the regent avowed that law had emitted bills to the amount of twelve hundred millions beyond what had been fixed by ordinances and in contradiction to express prohibitions that the thing being done he the regent had legalized or rather covered the transaction by decrees ordering such emissions which decrees he had antedated  a stormy scene ensued between the regent and the duke de bourbon little to the credit of either both having been deeply implicated in the cabalistic operations of the system in fact the several members of the council had been among the most venal beneficiaries of the scheme and had interests at stake which they were anxious to secure from all the circumstances of the case i am inclined to think that others were more to blame than law for the disastrous effects of his financial projects his bank had it been confined to its original limits and left to the control of its own internal regulations might have gone on prosperously and been of great benefit to the nation it was an institution fitted for a free country but unfortunately it was subjected to the control of a despotic government that could at its pleasure alter the value of the specie within its vaults and compel the most extravagant expansions of its paper circulation the vital principle of a bank is security in the regularity of its operations and the immediate convertibility of its paper into coin and what confidence could be reposed in an institution or its paper promises when the sovereign could at any moment centuple those promises in the market and seize upon all the money in the bank the compulsory measures used likewise to force banknotes into currency against the judgment of the public was fatal to the system for credit must be free and uncontrolled as the common air the regent was the evil spirit of the system that forced law on to an expansion of his paper currency far beyond what he had ever dreamed of he it was that in a manner compelled the unlucky projector to devise all kinds of collateral companies and monopolies by which to raise funds to meet the constantly and enormously increasing emissions of shares and notes law was but like a poor conjurer in the hands of a potent spirit that he has evoked and that obliges him to go on desperately and ruinously with his conjurations he only thought at the outset to raise the wind but the regent compelled him to raise the whirlwind  the investigation of the affairs of the company by the council resulted in nothing beneficial to the public the princes and nobles who had enriched themselves by all kinds of juggles and extortions escaped unpunished and retained the greater part of their spoils many of the suddenly rich who had risen from obscurity to a giddy height of imaginary prosperity and had indulged in all kinds of vulgar and ridiculous excesses awoke as out of a dream in their original poverty now made more galling and humiliating by their transient elevation  the weight of the evil however fell on more valuable classes of society honest tradesmen and artisans who had been seduced away from the safe pursuits of industry to the specious chances of speculation thousands of meritorious families also once opulent had been reduced to indigence by a too great confidence in government there was a general derangement in the finances that long exerted a baneful influence over the national prosperity but the most disastrous effects of the system were upon the morals and manners of the nation the faith of engagements the sanctity of promises in affairs of business were at an end every expedient to grasp present profit or to evade present difficulty was tolerated while such deplorable laxity of principle was generated in the busy classes the chivalry of france had soiled their pennons and honor and glory so long the idols of the gallic nobility had been tumbled to the earth and trampled in the dirt of the stockmarket  as to law the originator of the system he appears eventually to have profited but little by his schemes he was a quack says voltaire to whom the state was given to be cured but who poisoned it with his drugs and who poisoned himself the effects which he left behind in france were sold at a low price and the proceeds dissipated his landed estates were confiscated he carried away with him barely enough to maintain himself his wife and daughter with decency the chief relic of his immense fortune was a great diamond which he was often obliged to pawn he was in england in 1721 and was presented to george the first he returned shortly afterward to the continent shifting about from place to place and died in venice in 1729 his wife and daughter accustomed to live with the prodigality of princesses could not conform to their altered fortunes but dissipated the scanty means left to them and sank into abject poverty i saw his wife says voltaire at bruxelles as much humiliated as she had been haughty and triumphant in paris an elder brother of law remained in france and was protected by the duchess of bourbon his descendants have acquitted themselves honorably in various public employments and one of them is the marquis lauriston some time lieutenantgeneral and peer of france                                           don juan  a spectral research     i have heard of spirits walking with aerial bodies and have been   wondered at by others but i must only wonder at myself for if they   be not mad ime come to my own buriallshirleys witty fairie   one  everybody has heard of the fate of don juan the famous libertine of seville who for his sins against the fair sex and other minor peccadilloes was hurried away to the infernal regions his story has been illustrated in play in pantomime and farce on every stage in christendom until at length it has been rendered the theme of the operas and embalmed to endless duration in the glorious music of mozart i well recollect the effect of this story upon my feelings in my boyish days though represented in grotesque pantomime the awe with which i contemplated the monumental statue on horseback of the murdered commander gleaming by pale moonlight in the convent cemetery how my heart quaked as he bowed his marble head and accepted the impious invitation of don juan how each footfall of the statue smote upon my heart as i heard it approach step by step through the echoing corridor and beheld it enter and advance a moving figure of stone to the supper table but then the convivial scene in the charnelhouse where don juan returned the visit of the statue was offered a banquet of skulls and bones and on refusing to partake was hurled into a yawning gulf under a tremendous shower of fire these were accumulated horrors enough to shake the nerves of the most pantomimeloving schoolboy many have supposed the story of don juan a mere fable i myself thought so once but seeing is believing i have since beheld the very scene where it took place and now to indulge any doubt on the subject would be preposterous  i was one night perambulating the streets of seville in company with a spanish friend a curious investigator of the popular traditions and other goodfornothing lore of the city and who was kind enough to imagine he had met in me with a congenial spirit in the course of our rambles we were passing by a heavy dark gateway opening into the courtyard of a convent when he laid his hand upon my arm stop said he this is the convent of san francisco there is a story connected with it which i am sure must be known to you you cannot but have heard of don juan and the marble statue  undoubtedly replied i it has been familiar to me from childhood  well then it was in the cemetery of this very convent that the events took place  why you do not mean to say that the story is founded on fact  undoubtedly it is the circumstances of the case are said to have occurred during the reign of alfonso xi don juan was of the noble family of tenorio one of the most illustrious houses of andalusia his father don diego tenorio was a favorite of the king and his family ranked among the deintecuatros or magistrates of the city presuming on his high descent and powerful connections don juan set no bounds to his excesses no female high or low was sacred from his pursuit and he soon became the scandal of seville one of his most daring outrages was to penetrate by night into the palace of don gonzalo de ulloa commander of the order of calatrava and attempt to carry off his daughter the household was alarmed a scuffle in the dark took place don juan escaped but the unfortunate commander was found weltering in his blood and expired without being able to name his murderer suspicions attached to don juan he did not stop to meet the investigations of justice and the vengeance of the powerful family of ulloa but fled from seville and took refuge with his uncle don pedro tenorio at that time embassador at the court of naples here he remained until the agitation occasioned by the murder of don gonzalo had time to subside and the scandal which the affair might cause to both the families of ulloa and tenorio had induced them to hush it up don juan however continued his libertine career at naples until at length his excesses forfeited the protection of his uncle the embassador and obliged him again to flee he had made his way back to seville trusting that his past misdeeds were forgotten or rather trusting to his daredevil spirit and the power of his family to carry him through all difficulties  it was shortly after his return and while in the height of his arrogance that on visiting this very convent of francisco he beheld on a monument the equestrian statue of the murdered commander who had been buried within the walls of this sacred edifice where the family of ulloa had a chapel it was on this occasion that don juan in a moment of impious levity invited the statue to the banquet the awful catastrophe of which has given such celebrity to his story  and pray how much of this story said i is believed in seville  the whole of it by the populace with whom it has been a favorite tradition since time immemorial and who crowd to the theaters to see it represented in dramas written long since by tyrso de molina and another of our popular writers many in our higher ranks also accustomed from childhood to this story would feel somewhat indignant at hearing it treated with contempt an attempt has been made to explain the whole by asserting that to put an end to the extravagances of don juan and to pacify the family of ulloa without exposing the delinquent to the degrading penalties of justice he was decoyed into this convent under a false pretext and either plunged into a perpetual dungeon or privately hurried out of existence while the story of the statue was circulated by the monks to account for his sudden disappearance the populace however are not to be cajoled out of a ghost story by any of these plausible explanations and the marble statue still strides the stage and don juan is still plunged into the infernal regions as an awful warning to all rakehelly youngsters in like case offending  while my companion was relating these anecdotes we had entered the gateway traversed the exterior courtyard of the convent and made our way into a great interior court partly surrounded by cloisters and dormitories partly by chapels and having a large fountain in the center the pile had evidently once been extensive and magnificent but it was for the greater part in ruins by the light of the stars and of twinkling lamps placed here and there in the chapels and corridors i could see that many of the columns and arches were broken the walls were rent and riven white burned beams and rafters showed the destructive effects of fire the whole place had a desolate air the night breeze rustled through grass and weeds flaunting out of the crevices of the walls or from the shattered columns the bat flitted about the vaulted passages and the owl hooted from the ruined belfry never was any scene more completely fitted for a ghost story  while i was indulging in picturings of the fancy proper to such a place the deep chant of the monks from the convent church came swelling upon the ear it is the vesper service said my companion follow me  leading the way across the court of the cloisters and through one or two ruined passages he reached the distant portal of the church and pushing open a wicket cut in the folding doors we found ourselves in the deep arched vestibule of the sacred edifice to our left was the choir forming one end of the church and having a low vaulted ceiling which gave it the look of a cavern about this were ranged the monks seated on stools and chanting from immense books placed on musicstands and having the notes scored in such gigantic characters as to be legible from every part of the choir a few lights on these musicstands dimly illumined the choir gleamed on the shaven heads of the monks and threw their shadows on the walls they were gross bluebearded bulletheaded men with bass voices of deep metallic tone that reverberated out of the cavernous choir  to our right extended the great body of the church it was spacious and lofty some of the side chapels had gilded grates and were decorated with images and paintings representing the sufferings of our saviour aloft was a great painting by murillo but too much in the dark to be distinguished the gloom of the whole church was but faintly relieved by the reflected light from the choir and the glimmering here and there of a votive lamp before the shrine of a saint  as my eye roamed about the shadowy pile it was struck with the dimly seen figure of a man on horseback near a distant altar i touched my companion and pointed to it the specter statue said i  no replied he it is the statue of the blessed st iago the statue of the commander was in the cemetery of the convent and was destroyed at the tune of the conflagration but added he as i see you take a proper interest in these kind of stories come with me to the other end of the church where our whisperings will not disturb these holy fathers at their devotions and i will tell you another story that has been current for some generations in our city by which you will find that don juan is not the only libertine that has been the object of supernatural castigation in seville  i accordingly followed him with noiseless tread to the further part of the church where we took our seats on the steps of an altar opposite to the suspiciouslooking figure on horseback and there in a low mysterious voice he related to me the following narration  there was once in seville a gay young fellow don manuel de manara by name who having come to a great estate by the death of his father gave the reins to his passions and plunged into all kinds of dissipation like don juan whom he seemed to have taken for a model he became famous for his enterprises among the fair sex and was the cause of doors being barred and windows grated with more than usual strictness all in vain no balcony was too high for him to scale no bolt nor bar was proof against his efforts and his very name was a word of terror to all the jealous husbands and cautious fathers of seville his exploits extended to country as well as city and in the village dependent on his castle scarce a rural beauty was safe from his arts and enterprises  as he was one day ranging the streets of seville with several of his dissolute companions he beheld a procession about to enter the gate of a convent in the center was a young female arrayed in the dress of a bride it was a novice who having accomplished her year of probation was about to take the black veil and consecrate herself to heaven the companions of don manuel drew back out of respect to the sacred pageant but he pressed forward with his usual impetuosity to gain a near view of the novice he almost jostled her in passing through the portal of the church when on her turning round he beheld the countenance of a beautiful village girl who had been the object of his ardent pursuit but who had been spirited secretly out of his reach by her relatives she recognized him at the same moment and fainted but was borne within the grate of the chapel it was supposed the agitation of the ceremony and the heat of the throng had overcome her after some time the curtain which hung within the grate was drawn up there stood the novice pale and trembling surrounded by the abbess and the nuns the ceremony proceeded the crown of flowers was taken from her head she was shorn of her silken tresses received the black veil and went passively through the remainder of the ceremony  don manuel de manara on the contrary was roused to fury at the sight of this sacrifice his passion which had almost faded away in the absence of the object now glowed with tenfold ardor being inflamed by the difficulties placed in his way and piqued by the measures which had been taken to defeat him never had the object of his pursuit appeared so lovely and desirable as when within the grate of the convent and he swore to have her in defiance of heaven and earth by dint of bribing a female servant of the convent he contrived to convey letters to her pleading his passion in the most eloquent and seductive terms how successful they were is only matter of conjecture certain it is he undertook one night to scale the garden wall of the convent either to carry off the nun or gain admission to her cell just as he was mounting the wall he was suddenly plucked back and a stranger muffled in a cloak stood before him  rash man forbear cried he is it not enough to have violated all human ties wouldst thou steal a bride from heaven  the sword of don manuel had been drawn on the instant and furious at this interruption he passed it through the body of the stranger who fell dead at his feet hearing approaching footsteps he fled the fatal spot and mounting his horse which was at hand retreated to his estate in the country at no great distance from seville here he remained throughout the next day full of horror and remorse dreading lest he should be known as the murderer of the deceased and fearing each moment the arrival of the officers of justice  the day passed however without molestation and as the evening approached unable any longer to endure this state of uncertainty and apprehension he ventured back to seville irresistibly his footsteps took the direction of the convent but he paused and hovered at a distance from the scene of blood several persons were gathered round the place one of whom was busy nailing something against the convent wall after a while they dispersed and one passed near to don manuel the latter addressed him with a hesitating voice  se√±or said he may i ask the reason of yonder throng  a cavalier replied the other has been murdered  murdered echoed don manuel and can you tell me his name  don manuel de manara replied the stranger and passed on  don manuel was startled at this mention of his own name especially when applied to the murdered man he ventured when it was entirely deserted to approach the fatal spot a small cross had been nailed against the wall as is customary in spain to mark the place where a murder has been committed and just below it he read by the twinkling light of a lamp here was murdered don manuel de manara pray to god for his soul  still more confounded and perplexed by this inscription he wandered about the streets until the night was far advanced and all was still and lonely as he entered the principal square the light of torches suddenly broke on him and he beheld a grand funeral procession moving across it there was a great train of priests and many persons of dignified appearance in ancient spanish dresses attending as mourners none of whom he knew accosting a servant who followed in the train he demanded the name of the defunct  don manuel de manara was the reply and it went cold to his heart he looked and indeed beheld the armorial bearings of his family emblazoned on the funeral escutcheons yet not one of his family was to be seen among the mourners the mystery was more and more incomprehensible  he followed the procession as it moved on to the cathedral the bier was deposited before the high altar the funeral service was commenced and the grand organ began to peal through the vaulted aisles  again the youth ventured to question this awful pageant father said he with trembling voice to one of the priests who is this you are about to inter  don manuel de manara replied the priest  father cried don manuel impatiently you are deceived this is some imposture know that don manuel de manara la alive and well and now stands before you i am don manuel de manara  avaunt rash youth cried the priest know that don manuel de manara is deadis deadis deadand we are all souls from purgatory his deceased relatives and ancestors and others that have been aided by masses of his family who are permitted to come here and pray for the repose of his soul  don manuel cast round a fearful glance upon the assemblage in antiquated spanish garbs and recognized in their pale and ghastly countenances the portraits of many an ancestor that hung in the family picturegallery he now lost all selfcommand rushed up to the bier and beheld the counterpart of himself but in the fixed and livid lineaments of death just at that moment the whole choir burst forth with a requiescat in pace that shook the vaults of the cathedral don manuel sank senseless on the pavement he was found there early the next morning by the sacristan and conveyed to his home when sufficiently recovered he sent for a friar and made a full confession of all that had happened  my son said the friar all this is a miracle and a mystery intended for thy conversion and salvation the corpse thou hast seen was a token that thou hadst died to sin and the world take warning by it and henceforth live to righteousness and heaven  don manuel did take warning by it guided by the counsels of the worthy friar he disposed of all his temporal affairs dedicated the greater part of his wealth to pious uses especially to the performance of masses for souls in purgatory and finally entering a convent became one of the most zealous and exemplary monks in seville                                       while my companion was relating this story my eyes wandered from time to time about the dusky church methought the burly countenances of the monks in their distant choir assumed a pallid ghastly hue and their deep metallic voices had a sepulchral sound by the time the story was ended they had ended their chant and extinguishing their lights glided one by one like shadows through a small door in the side of the choir a deeper gloom prevailed over the church the figure opposite me on horseback grew more and more spectral and i almost expected to see it bow its head  it is time to be off said my companion unless we intend to sup with the statue  i have no relish for such fare or such company replied i and following my companion we groped our way through the mouldering cloisters as we passed by the ruined cemetery keeping up a casual conversation by way of dispelling the loneliness of the scene i called to mind the words of the poet                       the tombs   and monumental caves of death look cold   and shoot a chillness to my trembling heart   give me thy hand and let me hear thy voice   nay speakand let me hear thy voice   my own affrights me with its echoes  there wanted nothing but the marble statue of the commander striding along the echoing cloisters to complete the haunted scene  since that time i never fail to attend the theater whenever the story of don juan is represented whether in pantomime or opera in the sepulchral scene i feel myself quite at home and when the statue makes his appearance i greet him as an old acquaintance when the audience applaud i look round upon them with a degree of compassion poor souls i say to myself they think they are pleased they think they enjoy this piece and yet they consider the whole as a fiction how much more would they enjoy it if like me they knew it to be trueand had seen the very place                                          broek  of the dutch paradise   it has long been a matter of discussion and controversy among the pious and the learned as to the situation of the terrestrial paradise from whence our first parents were exiled this question has been put to rest by certain of the faithful in holland who have decided in favor of the village of broek about six miles from amsterdam it may not they observe correspond in all respects to the description of the garden of eden handed down from days of yore but it comes nearer to their ideas of a perfect paradise than any other place on earth  this eulogium induced me to make some inquiries as to this favored spot in the course of a sojourn at the city of amsterdam and the information i procured fully justified the enthusiastic praises i had heard the village of broek is situated in waterland in the midst of the greenest and richest pastures of holland i may say of europe these pastures are the source of its wealth for it is famous for its dairies and for those oval cheeses which regale and perfume the whole civilized world the population consists of about six hundred persons comprising several families which have inhabited the place since time immemorial and have waxed rich on the products of their meadows they keep all their wealth among themselves intermarrying and keeping all strangers at a wary distance they are a hard money people and remarkable for turning the penny the right way it is said to have been an old rule established by one of the primitive financiers and legislators of broek that no one should leave the village with more than six guilders in his pocket or return with less than ten a shrewd regulation well worthy the attention of modern political economists who are so anxious to fix the balance of trade  what however renders broek so perfect an elysium in the eyes of all true hollanders is the matchless height to which the spirit of cleanliness is carried there it amounts almost to a religion among the inhabitants who pass the greater part of their time rubbing and scrubbing and painting and varnishing each housewife vies with her neighbor in her devotion to the scrubbingbrush as zealous catholics do in their devotion to the cross and it is said a notable housewife of the place in days of yore is held in pious remembrance and almost canonized as a saint for having died of pure exhaustion and chagrin in an ineffectual attempt to scour a black man white  these particulars awakened my ardent curiosity to see a place which i pictured to myself the very fountainhead of certain hereditary habits and customs prevalent among the descendants of the original dutch settlers of my native state i accordingly lost no time in performing a pilgrimage to broek  before i reached the place i beheld symptoms of the tranquil character of its inhabitants a little clumpbuilt boat was in full sail along the lazy bosom of a canal but its sail consisted of the blades of two paddles stood on end while the navigator sat steering with a third paddle in the stern crouched down like a toad with a slouched hat drawn over his eyes i presumed him to be some nautical lover on the way to his mistress after proceeding a little further i came in sight of the harbor or port of destination of this drowsy navigator this was the broekenmeer an artificial basin or sheet of olivegreen water tranquil as a millpond on this the village of broek is situated and the borders are laboriously decorated with flowerbeds boxtrees clipped into all kinds of ingenious shapes and fancies and little lust houses or pavilions  i alighted outside of the village for no horse nor vehicle is permitted to enter its precincts lest it should cause defilement of the wellscoured pavements shaking the dust off my feet therefore i prepared to enter with due reverence and circumspection this sanctum sanctorum of dutch cleanliness i entered by a narrow street paved with yellow bricks laid edgewise and so clean that one might eat from them indeed they were actually worn deep not by the tread of feet but by the friction of the scrubbingbrush  the houses were built of wood and all appeared to have been freshly painted of green yellow and other bright colors they were separated from each other by gardens and orchards and stood at some little distance from the street with wide areas or courtyards paved in mosaic with variegated stones polished by frequent rubbing the areas were divided from the street by curiouslywrought railings or balustrades of iron surmounted with brass and copper balls scoured into dazzling effulgence the very trunks of the trees in front of the houses were by the same process made to look as if they had been varnished the porches doors and windowframes of the houses were of exotic woods curiously carved and polished like costly furniture the front doors are never opened excepting on christenings marriages or funerals on all ordinary occasions visitors enter by the back door in former times persons when admitted had to put on slippers but this oriental ceremony is no longer insisted upon  a poor devil frenchman who attended upon me as cicerone boasted with some degree of exultation of a triumph of his countrymen over the stern regulations of the place during the time that holland was overrun by the armies of the french republic a french general surrounded by his whole √©tat major who had come from amsterdam to view the wonders of broek applied for admission at one of these tabood portals the reply was that the owner never received any one who did not come introduced by some friend very well said the general take my compliments to your master and tell him i will return here tomorrow with a company of soldiers pour parler raison avec mon ami hollandais terrified at the idea of having a company of soldiers billeted upon him the owner threw open his house entertained the general and his retinue with unwonted hospitality though it is said it cost the family a months scrubbing and scouring to restore all things to exact order after this military invasion my vagabond informant seemed to consider this one of the greatest victories of the republic  i walked about the place in mute wonder and admiration a dead stillness prevailed around like that in the deserted streets of pompeii no sign of life was to be seen excepting now and then a hand and a long pipe and an occasional puff of smoke out of the window of some lusthaus overhanging a miniature canal and on approaching a little nearer the periphery in profile of some robustious burgher  among the grand houses pointed out to me were those of claes bakker and cornelius bakker richly carved and gilded with flower gardens and clipped shrubberies and that of the great ditmus who my poor devil cicerone informed me in a whisper was worth two millions all these were mansions shut up from the world and only kept to be cleaned after having been conducted from one wonder to another of the village i was ushered by my guide into the grounds and gardens of mynheer broekker another mighty cheesemanufacturer worth eighty thousand guilders a year i had repeatedly been struck with the similarity of all that i had seen in this amphibious little village to the buildings and landscapes on chinese platters and teapots but here i found the similarity complete for i was told that these gardens were modeled upon van bramms description of those of yuen min yuen in china here were serpentine walks with trellised borders winding canals with fanciful chinese bridges flowerbeds resembling huge baskets with the flower of love lies bleeding falling over to the ground but mostly had the fancy of mynheer broekker been displayed about a stagnant little lake on which a corpulent little pinnace lay at anchor on the border was a cottage within which were a wooden man and woman seated at table and a wooden dog beneath all the size of life on pressing a spring the woman commenced spinning and the dog barked furiously on the lake were wooden swans painted to the life some floating others on the nest among the rushes while a wooden sportsman crouched among the bushes was preparing his gun to take deadly aim in another part of the garden was a dominie in his clerical robes with wig pipe and cocked hat and mandarins with nodding heads amid red lions green tigers and blue hares last of all the heathen deities in wood and plaster male and female naked and barefaced as usual and seeming to stare with wonder at finding themselves in such strange company  my shabby french guide while he pointed out all these mechanical marvels of the garden was anxious to let me see that he had too polite a taste to be pleased with them at every new knickknack he would screw down his mouth shrug up his shoulders take a pinch of snuff and exclaim ma foi monsieur ces hollandais sont forts pour ces b√©tises l√†  to attempt to gain admission to any of these stately abodes was out of the question having no company of soldiers to enforce a solicitation i was fortunate enough however through the aid of my guide to make my way into the kitchen of the illustrious ditmus and i question whether the parlor would have proved more worthy of observation the cook a little wiry hooknosed woman worn thin by incessant action and friction was bustling about among her kettles and saucepans with the scullion at her heels both clattering in wooden shoes which were as clean and white as the milkpails rows of vessels of brass and copper regiments of pewter dishes and portly porringers gave resplendent evidence of the intensity of their cleanliness the very trammels and hangers in the fireplace were highly scoured and the burnished face of the good saint nicholas shone forth from the iron plate of the chimney back  among the decorations of the kitchen was a printed sheet of woodcuts representing the various holiday customs of holland with explanatory rhymes here i was delighted to recognize the jollities of new years day the festivities of pa√§s and pinkster and all the other merrymakings handed down in my native place from the earliest times of new amsterdam and which had been such bright spots in the year in my childhood i eagerly made myself master of this precious document for a trifling consideration and bore it off as a memento of the place though i question if in so doing i did not carry off with me the whole current literature of broek  i must not omit to mention that this village is the paradise of cows as well as men indeed you would almost suppose the cow to be as much an object of worship here as the bull was among the ancient egyptians and well does she merit it for she is in fact the patroness of the place the same scrupulous cleanliness however which pervades everything else is manifested in the treatment of this venerated animal she is not permitted to perambulate the place but in winter when she forsakes the rich pasture a wellbuilt house is provided for her well painted and maintained in the most perfect order her stall is of ample dimensions the floor is scrubbed and polished her hide is daily curried and brushed and sponged to her hearts content and her tail is daintily tucked up to the ceiling and decorated with a ribbon  on my way back through the village i passed the house of the prediger or preacher a very comfortable mansion which led me to augur well of the state of religion in the village on inquiry i was told that for a long time the inhabitants lived in a great state of indifference as to religious matters it was in vain that their preachers endeavored to arouse their thoughts as to a future state the joys of heaven as commonly depicted were but little to their taste at length a dominie appeared among them who struck out in a different vein he depicted the new jerusalem as a place all smooth and level with beautiful dykes and ditches and canals and houses all shining with paint and varnish and glazed tiles and where there should never come horse or ass or cat or dog or anything that could make noise or dirt but there should be nothing but rubbing and scrubbing and washing and painting and gilding and varnishing for ever and ever amen since that time the good housewives of broek have all turned their faces zionward                                          sketches in paris in 1825  from the traveling notebook of geoffrey crayon gent   a parisian hotel is a street set on end the grand staircase forming the highway and every floor a separate habitation let me describe the one in which i am lodged which may serve as a specimen of its class it is a huge quadrangular pile of stone built round a spacious paved court the ground floor is occupied by shops magazines and domestic offices then comes the entresol with low ceilings short windows and dwarf chambers then succeed a succession of floors or stories rising one above the other to the number of mahomets heavens each floor is like a distinct mansion complete in itself with antechamber saloons dining and sleeping rooms kitchen and other conveniences for the accommodation of a family some floors are divided into two or more suites of apartments each apartment has its main door of entrance opening upon the staircase or landingplaces and locked like a street door thus several families and numerous single persons live under the same roof totally independent of each other and may live so for years without holding more intercourse than is kept up in other cities by residents in the same street  like the great world this little microcosm has its gradations of rank and style and importance the premier or first floor with its grand saloons lofty ceilings and splendid furniture is decidedly the aristocratical part of the establishment the second floor is scarcely less aristocratical and magnificent the other floors go on lessening in splendor as they gain in altitude and end with the attics the region of petty tailors clerks and sewinggirls to make the filling up of the mansion complete every odd nook and corner is fitted up as a joli petit appartement √† gar√ßon a pretty little bachelors apartment that is to say some little dark inconvenient nestlingplace for a poor devil of a bachelor  the whole domain is shut up from the street by a great portecoch√®re or portal calculated for the admission of carriages this consists of two massy foldingdoors that swing heavily open upon a spacious entrance passing under the front of the edifice into the courtyard on one side is a spacious staircase leading to the upper apartments immediately without the portal is the porters lodge a small room with one or two bedrooms adjacent for the accommodation of the concierge or porter and his family this is one of the most important functionaries of the hotel he is in fact the cerberus of the establishment and no one can pass in or out without his knowledge and consent the portecoch√®re in general is fastened by a sliding bolt from which a cord or wire passes into the porters lodge whoever wishes to go out must speak to the porter who draws the bolt a visitor from without gives a single rap with the massive knocker the bolt is immediately drawn as if by an invisible hand the door stands ajar the visitor pushes it open and enters a face presents itself at the glass door of the porters little chamber the stranger pronounces the name of the person he comes to seek if the person or family is of importance occupying the first or second floor the porter sounds a bell once or twice to give notice that a visitor is at hand the stranger in the meantime ascends the great staircase the highway common to all and arrives at the outer door equivalent to a street door of the suite of rooms inhabited by his friends  beside this hangs a bellcord with which he rings for admittance  when the family or person inquired for is of less importance or lives in some remote part of the mansion less easy to be apprised no signal is given the applicant pronounces the name at the porters door and is told montez au troisi√®me au quatri√®me sonnez √† la porte √† droite ou √† gauche ascend to the third or fourth story ring the bell on the right or left hand door as the case may be  the porter and his wife act as domestics to such of the inmates of the mansion as do not keep servants making their beds arranging their rooms lighting their fires and doing other menial offices for which they receive a monthly stipend they are also in confidential intercourse with the servants of the other inmates and having an eye on all the incomers and outgoers are thus enabled by hook and by crook to learn the secrets and domestic history of every member of the little territory within the portecoch√®re  the porters lodge is accordingly a great scene of gossip where all the private affairs of this interior neighborhood are discussed the courtyard also is an assembling place in the evenings for the servants of the different families and a sisterhood of sewing girls from the entresols and the attics to play at various games and dance to the music of their own songs and the echoes of their feet at which assemblages the porters daughter takes the lead a fresh pretty buxom girl generally called la petite though almost as tall as a grenadier these little evening gatherings so characteristic of this gay country are countenanced by the various families of the mansion who often look down from their windows and balconies on moonlight evenings and enjoy the simple revels of their domestics i must observe however that the hotel i am describing is rather a quiet retired one where most of the inmates are permanent residents from year to year so that there is more of the spirit of neighborhood than in the bustling fashionable hotels in the gay parts of paris which are continually changing their inhabitants  my french neighbor  i often amuse myself by watching from my window which by the bye is tolerably elevated the movements of the teeming little world below me and as i am on sociable terms with the porter and his wife i gather from them as they light my fire or serve my breakfast anecdotes of all my fellow lodgers i have been somewhat curious in studying a little antique frenchman who occupies one of the jolie chambres √† gar√ßon already mentioned he is one of those superannuated veterans who flourished before the revolution and have weathered all the storms of paris in consequence very probably of being fortunately too insignificant to attract attention he has a small income which he manages with the skill of a french economist appropriating so much for his lodgings so much for his meals so much for his visits to st cloud and versailles and so much for his seat at the theater he has resided in the hotel for years and always in the same chamber which he furnishes at his own expense the decorations of the room mark his various ages there are some gallant pictures which he hung up in his younger days with a portrait of a lady of rank whom he speaks tenderly of dressed in the old french taste and a pretty opera dancer pirouetting in a hoop petticoat who lately died at a good old age in a corner of this picture is stuck a prescription for rheumatism and below it stands an easychair he has a small parrot at the window to amuse him when within doors and a pug dog to accompany him in his daily peregrinations while i am writing he is crossing the court to go out he is attired in his best coat of skyblue and is doubtless bound for the tuileries his hair is dressed in the old style with powdered earlocks and a pigtail his little dog trips after him sometimes on four legs sometimes on three and looking as if his leather smallclothes were too tight for him now the old gentleman stops to have a word with an old crony who lives in the entresol and is just returning from his promenade now they take a pinch of snuff together now they pull out huge red cotton handkerchiefs those flags of abomination as they have well been called and blow their noses most sonorously now they turn to make remarks upon their two little dogs who are exchanging the mornings salutation now they part and my old gentleman stops to have a passing word with the porters wife and now he sallies forth and is fairly launched upon the town for the day  no man is so methodical as a complete idler and none so scrupulous in measuring and portioning out his time as he whose time is worth nothing the old gentleman in question has his exact hour for rising and for shaving himself by a small mirror hung against his casement he sallies forth at a certain hour every morning to take his cup of coffee and his roll at a certain cafe where he reads the papers he has been a regular admirer of the lady who presides at the bar and always stops to have a little badinage with her en passant he has his regular walks on the boulevards and in the palais royal where he sets his watch by the petard fired off by the sun at midday he has his daily resort in the garden of the tuileries to meet with a knot of veteran idlers like himself who talk on pretty much the same subjects whenever they meet he has been present at all the sights and shows and rejoicings of paris for the last fifty years has witnessed the great events of the revolution the guillotining of the king and queen the coronation of bonaparte the capture of paris and the restoration of the bourbons all these he speaks of with the coolness of a theatrical critic and i question whether he has not been gratified by each in its turn not from any inherent love of tumult but from that insatiable appetite for spectacle which prevails among the inhabitants of this metropolis i have been amused with a farce in which one of these systematic old triflers is represented he sings a song detailing his whole days round of insignificant occupations and goes to bed delighted with the idea that his next day will be an exact repetition of the same routine    je me couche le soir    enchant√© de pouvoir    recommencer mon train       le lendemain          matin                                        the englishman at paris  in another part of the hotel a handsome suite of rooms is occupied by an old english gentleman of great probity some understanding and very considerable crustiness who has come to france to live economically he has a very fair property but his wife being of that blessed kind compared in scripture to the fruitful vine has overwhelmed him with a family of buxom daughters who hang clustering about him ready to be gathered by any hand he is seldom to be seen in public without one hanging on each arm and smiling on all the world while his own mouth is drawn down at each corner like a mastiffs with internal growling at everything about him he adheres rigidly to english fashion in dress and trudges about in long gaiters and broadbrimmed hat while his daughters almost overshadow him with feathers flowers and french bonnets  he contrives to keep up an atmosphere of english habits opinions and prejudices and to carry a semblance of london into the very heart of paris his mornings are spent at galignanis newsroom where he forms one of a knot of inveterate quidnuncs who read the same articles over a dozen times in a dozen different papers he generally dines in company with some of his own countrymen and they have what is called a comfortable sitting after dinner in the english fashion drinking wine discussing the news of the london papers and canvassing the french character the french metropolis and the french revolution ending with a unanimous admission of english courage english morality english cookery english wealth the magnitude of london and the ingratitude of the french  his evenings are chiefly spent at a club of his countrymen where the london papers are taken sometimes his daughters entice him to the theaters but not often he abuses french tragedy as all fustian and bombast talma as a ranter and duchesnois as a mere termagant it is true his ear is not sufficiently familiar with the language to understand french verse and he generally goes to sleep during the performance the wit of the french comedy is flat and pointless to him he would not give one of mundens wry faces or listons inexpressible looks for the whole of it  he will not admit that paris has any advantage over london the seine is a muddy rivulet in comparison with the thames the west end of london surpasses the finest parts of the french capital and on some ones observing that there was a very thick fog out of doors pish said he crustily its nothing to the fogs we have in london  he has infinite trouble in bringing his table into anything like conformity to english rule with his liquors it is true he is tolerably successful he procures london porter and a stock of port and sherry at considerable expense for he observes that he cannot stand those cursed thin french wines they dilute his blood so much as to give him the rheumatism as to their white wines he stigmatizes them as mere substitutes for cider and as to claret why it would be port if it could he has continual quarrels with his french cook whom he renders wretched by insisting on his conforming to mrs glass for it is easier to convert a frenchman from his religion than his cookery the poor fellow by dint of repeated efforts once brought himself to serve up ros bif sufficiently raw to suit what he considered the cannibal taste of his master but then he could not refrain at the last moment adding some exquisite sauce that put the old gentleman in a fury  he detests woodfires and has procured a quantity of coal but not having a grate he is obliged to burn it on the hearth here he sits poking and stirring the fire with one end of a tongs while the room is as murky as a smithy railing at french chimneys french masons and french architects giving a poke at the end of every sentence as though he were stirring up the very bowels of the delinquents he is anathematizing he lives in a state militant with inanimate objects around him gets into high dudgeon with doors and casements because they will not come under english law and has implacable feuds with sundry refractory pieces of furniture among these is one in particular with which he is sure to have a high quarrel every tune he goes to dress it is a commode one of those smooth polished plausible pieces of french furniture that have the perversity of five hundred devils each drawer has a will of its own will open or not just as the whim takes it and sets lock and key at defiance sometimes a drawer will refuse to yield to either persuasion or force and will part with both handles rather than yield another will come out in the most coy and coquettish manner imaginable elbowing along zigzag one corner retreating as the other advances making a thousand difficulties and objections at every move until the old gentleman out of all patience gives a sudden jerk and brings drawer and contents into the middle of the floor his hostility to this unlucky piece of furniture increases every day as if incensed that it does not grow better he is like the fretful invalid who cursed his bed that the longer he lay the harder it grew the only benefit he has derived from the quarrel is that it has furnished him with a crusty joke which he utters on all occasions he swears that a french commode is the most incommodious thing in existence and that although the nation cannot make a jointstool that will stand steady yet they are always talking of everythings being perfection√©e  his servants understand his humor and avail themselves of it he was one day disturbed by a pertinacious rattling and shaking at one of the doors and bawled out in an angry tone to know the cause of the disturbance sir said the footman testily its this confounded french lock ah said the old gentleman pacified by this hit at the nation i thought there was something french at the bottom of it                                           english and french character   as i am a mere looker on in europe and hold myself as much as possible aloof from its quarrels and prejudices i feel something like one overlooking a game who without any great skill of his own can occasionally perceive the blunders of much abler players this neutrality of feeling enables me to enjoy the contrasts of character presented in this time of general peace when the various peoples of europe who have so long been sundered by wars are brought together and placed side by side in this great gatheringplace of nations no greater contrast however is exhibited than that of the french and english the peace has deluged this gay capital with english visitors of all ranks and conditions they throng every place of curiosity and amusement fill the public gardens the galleries the cafes saloons theaters always herding together never associating with the french the two nations are like two threads of different colors tangled together but never blended  in fact they present a continual antithesis and seem to value themselves upon being unlike each other yet each have their peculiar merits which should entitle them to each others esteem the french intellect is quick and active it flashes its way into a subject with the rapidity of lightning seizes upon remote conclusions with a sudden bound and its deductions are almost intuitive the english intellect is less rapid but more persevering less sudden but more sure in its deductions the quickness and mobility of the french enable them to find enjoyment in the multiplicity of sensations they speak and act more from immediate impressions than from reflection and meditation they are therefore more social and communicative more fond of society and of places of public resort and amusement an englishman is more reflective in his habits he lives in the world of his own thoughts and seems more selfexistent and selfdependent he loves the quiet of his own apartment even when abroad he in a manner makes a little solitude around him by his silence and reserve he moves about shy and solitary and as it were buttoned up body and soul  the french are great optimists they seize upon every good as it flies and revel in the passing pleasure the englishman is too apt to neglect the present good in preparing against the possible evil however adversities may lower let the sun shine but for a moment and forth sallies the mercurial frenchman in holiday dress and holiday spirits gay as a butterfly as though his sunshine were perpetual but let the sun beam never so brightly so there be but a cloud in the horizon the wary englishman ventures forth distrustfully with his umbrella in his hand  the frenchman has a wonderful facility at turning small things to advantage no one can be gay and luxurious on smaller means no one requires less expense to be happy he practices a kind of gilding in his style of living and hammers out every guinea into gold leaf the englishman on the contrary is expensive in his habits and expensive in his enjoyments he values everything whether useful or ornamental by what it costs he has no satisfaction in show unless it be solid and complete everything goes with him by the square foot whatever display he makes the depth is sure to equal the surface  the frenchmans habitation like himself is open cheerful bustling and noisy he lives in a part of a great hotel with wide portal paved court a spacious dirty stone staircase and a family on every floor all is clatter and chatter he is goodhumored and talkative with his servants sociable with his neighbors and complaisant to all the world anybody has access to himself and his apartments his very bedroom is open to visitors whatever may be its state of confusion and all this not from any peculiarly hospitable feeling but from that communicative habit which predominates over his character  the englishman on the contrary ensconces himself in a snug brick mansion which he has all to himself locks the front door puts broken bottles along his walls and spring guns and mantraps in his gardens shrouds himself with trees and windowcurtains exults in his quiet and privacy and seems disposed to keep out noise daylight and company his house like himself has a reserved inhospitable exterior yet whoever gains admittance is apt to find a warm heart and warm fireside within  the french excel in wit the english in humor the french have gayer fancy the english richer imagination the former are full of sensibility easily moved and prone to sudden and great excitement but their excitement is not durable the english are more phlegmatic not so readily affected but capable of being aroused to great enthusiasm the faults of these opposite temperaments are that the vivacity of the french is apt to sparkle up and be frothy the gravity of the english to settle down and grow muddy when the two characters can be fixed in a medium the french kept from effervescence and the english from stagnation both will be found excellent  this contrast of character may also be noticed in the great concerns of the two nations the ardent frenchman is all for military renown he fights for glory that is to say for success in arms for provided the national flag is victorious he cares little about the expense the injustice or the inutility of the war it is wonderful how the poorest frenchman will revel on a triumphant bulletin a great victory is meat and drink to him and at the sight of a military sovereign bringing home captured cannon and captured standards he throws up his greasy cap in the air and is ready to jump out of his wooden shoes for joy  john bull on the contrary is a reasoning considerate person if he does wrong it is in the most rational way imaginable he fights because the good of the world requires it he is a moral person and makes war upon his neighbor for the maintenance of peace and good order and sound principles he is a moneymaking personage and fights for the prosperity of commerce and manufactures thus the two nations have been fighting time out of mind for glory and good the french in pursuit of glory have had their capital twice taken and john in pursuit of good has run himself over head and ears in debt                                          the tuileries and windsor castle   i have sometimes fancied i could discover national characteristics in national edifices in the chateau of the tuileries for instance i perceive the same jumble of contrarieties that marks the french character the same whimsical mixture of the great and the little the splendid and the paltry the sublime and the grotesque on visiting this famous pile the first thing that strikes both eye and ear is military display the courts glitter with steelclad soldiery and resound with the tramp of horse the roll of drum and the bray of trumpet dismounted guardsmen patrol its arcades with loaded carbines jingling spears and clanking sabers gigantic grenadiers are posted about its staircases young officers of the guards loll from the balconies or lounge in groups upon the terraces and the gleam of bayonet from window to window shows that sentinels are pacing up and down the corridors and antechambers the first floor is brilliant with the splendors of a court french taste has tasked itself in adorning the sumptuous suites of apartments nor are the gilded chapel and the splendid theater forgotten where piety and pleasure are nextdoor neighbors and harmonize together with perfect french bienseance  mingled up with all this regal and military magnificence is a world of whimsical and makeshift detail a great part of the huge edifice is cut up into little chambers and nestlingplaces for retainers of the court dependents on retainers and hangerson of dependents some are squeezed into narrow entresols those low dark intermediate slices of apartments between floors the inhabitants of which seem shoved in edgewise like books between narrow shelves others are perched like swallows under the eaves the high roofs too which are as tall and steep as a french cocked hat have rows of little dormant windows tier above tier just large enough to admit light and air for some dormitory and to enable its occupant to peep out at the sky even to the very ridge of the roof may be seen here and there one of these airholes with a stove pipe beside it to carry off the smoke from the handful of fuel with which its weazenfaced tenant simmers his demitasse of coffee  on approaching the palace from the pont royal you take in at a glance all the various strata of inhabitants the garreteer in the roof the retainer in the entresol the courtiers at the casements of the royal apartments while on the groundfloor a steam of savory odors and a score or two of cooks in white caps bobbing their heads about the windows betray that scientific and allimportant laboratory the royal kitchen  go into the grand antechamber of the royal apartments on sunday and see the mixture of old and new france the old emigr√©s returned with the bourbons little withered spindleshanked old noblemen clad in court dresses that figured in these saloons before the revolution and have been carefully treasured up during their exile with the solitaires and ailes de pigeon of former days and the court swords strutting out behind like pins stuck through dry beetles see them haunting the scenes of their former splendor in hopes of a restitution of estates like ghosts haunting the vicinity of buried treasure while around them you see the young france that have grown up in the fighting school of napoleon all equipped en militaire tall hardy frank vigorous sunburned fiercewhiskered with tramping boots towering crests and glittering breastplates  it is incredible the number of ancient and hereditary feeders on royalty said to be housed in this establishment indeed all the royal palaces abound with noble families returned from exile and who have nestlingplaces allotted them while they await the restoration of their estates or the muchtalkedof law indemnity some of them have fine quarters but poor living some families have but five or six hundred francs a year and all their retinue consists of a servantwoman with all this they maintain their old aristocratical hauteur look down with vast contempt upon the opulent families which have risen since the revolution stigmatize them all as parvenues or upstarts and refuse to visit them  in regarding the exterior of the tuileries with all its outward signs of internal populousness i have often thought what a rare sight it would be to see it suddenly unroofed and all its nooks and corners laid open to the day it would be like turning up the stump of an old tree and dislodging the world of grubs and ants and beetles lodged beneath indeed there is a scandalous anecdote current that in the time of one of the petty plots when petards were exploded under the windows of the tuileries the police made a sudden investigation of the palace at four oclock in the morning when a scene of the most whimsical confusion ensued hosts of supernumerary inhabitants were found foisted into the huge edifice every rathole had its occupant and places which had been considered as tenanted only by spiders were found crowded with a surreptitious population it is added that many ludicrous accidents occurred great scampering and slamming of doors and whisking away in nightgowns and slippers and several persons who were found by accident in their neighbors chambers evinced indubitable astonishment at the circumstance  as i have fancied i could read the french character in the national palace of the tuileries so i have pictured to myself some of the traits of john bull in his royal abode of windsor castle the tuileries outwardly a peaceful palace is in effect a swaggering military hold while the old castle on the contrary in spite of its bullying look is completely under petticoat government every corner and nook is built up into some snug cozy nestling place some procreant cradle not tenanted by meager expectants or whiskered warriors but by sleek placemen knowing realizers of present pay and present pudding who seem placed there not to kill and destroy but to breed and multiply nursery maids and children shine with rosy faces at the windows and swarm about the courts and terraces the very soldiers have a pacific look and when off duty may be seen loitering about the place with the nurserymaids not making love to them in the gay gallant style of the french soldiery but with infinite bonhomie aiding them to take care of the broods of children  though the old castle is in decay everything about it thrives the very crevices of the walls are tenanted by swallows rooks and pigeons all sure of quiet lodgment the ivy strikes its roots deep in the fissures and flourishes about the mouldering tower footnote the above sketch was written before the thorough repairs and magnificent additions that have been made of late years to windsor castle thus it is with honest john according to his own account he is ever going to ruin yet everything that lives on him thrives and waxes fat he would fain be a soldier and swagger like his neighbors but his domestic quietloving uxorious nature continually gets the upper hand and though he may mount his helmet and gird on his sword yet he is apt to sink into the plodding painstaking father of a family with a troop of children at his heels and his womenkind hanging on each arm      the field of waterloo   i have spoken heretofore with some levity of the contrast that exists between the english and french character but it deserves more serious consideration they are the two great nations of modern times most diametrically opposed and most worthy of each others rivalry essentially distinct in their characters excelling in opposite qualities and reflecting luster on each other by their very opposition in nothing is this contrast more strikingly evinced than in their military conduct for ages have they been contending and for ages have they crowded each others history with acts of splendid heroism take the battle of waterloo for instance the last and most memorable trial of their rival prowess nothing could surpass the brilliant daring on the one side and the steadfast enduring on the other the french cavalry broke like waves on the compact squares of english infantry they were seen galloping round those serried walls of men seeking in vain for an entrance tossing their arms in the air in the heat of their enthusiasm and braving the whole front of battle the british troops on the other hand forbidden to move or fire stood firm and enduring their columns were ripped up by cannonry whole rows were swept down at a shot the survivors closed their ranks and stood firm in this way many columns stood through the pelting of the iron tempest without firing a shot without any action to stir their blood or excite their spirits death thinned their ranks but could not shake their souls  a beautiful instance of the quick and generous impulses to which the french are prone is given in the case of a french cavalier in the hottest of the action charging furiously upon a british officer but perceiving in the moment of assault that his adversary had lost his swordarm dropping the point of his saber and courteously riding on peace be with that generous warrior whatever were his fate if he went down in the storm of battle with the foundering fortunes of his chieftain may the turf of waterloo grow green above his grave and happier far would be the fate of such a spirit to sink amid the tempest unconscious of defeat than to survive and mourn over the blighted laurels of his country  in this way the two armies fought through a long and bloody day the french with enthusiastic valor the english with cool inflexible courage until fate as if to leave the question of superiority still undecided between two such adversaries brought up the prussians to decide the fortunes of the field  it was several years afterward that i visited the field of waterloo the plowshare had been busy with its oblivious labors and the frequent harvest had nearly obliterated the vestiges of war still the blackened ruins of hoguemont stood a monumental pile to mark the violence of this vehement struggle its broken walls pierced by bullets and shattered by explosions showed the deadly strife that had taken place within when gaul and briton hemmed in between narrow walls hand to hand and foot to foot fought from garden to courtyard from courtyard to chamber with intense and concentrated rivalship columns of smoke turned from this vortex of battle as from a volcano it was said my guide like a little hell upon earth not far off two or three broad spots of rank unwholesome green still marked the places where these rival warriors after their fierce and fitful struggle slept quietly together in the lap of their common mother earth over all the rest of the field peace had resumed its sway the thoughtless whistle of the peasant floated on the air instead of the trumpets clangor the team slowly labored up the hillside once shaken by the hoofs of rushing squadrons and wide fields of corn waved peacefully over the soldiers graves as summer seas dimple over the place where many a tall ship lies buried                                       to the foregoing desultory notes on the french military character let me append a few traits which i picked up verbally in one of the french provinces they may have already appeared in print but i have never met with them  at the breaking out of the revolution when so many of the old families emigrated a descendant of the great turenne by the name of de latour dauvergne refused to accompany his relations and entered into the republican army he served in all the campaigns of the revolution distinguished himself by his valor his accomplishments and his generous spirit and might have risen to fortune and to the highest honors he refused however all rank in the army above that of captain and would receive no recompense for his achievements but a sword of honor napoleon in testimony of his merits gave him the title of premier grenadier de france first grenadier of france which was the only title he would ever bear he was killed in germany in 1809 or 10 to honor his memory his place was always retained in his regiment as if he still occupied it and whenever the regiment was mustered and the name of de latour dauvergne was called out the reply was dead on the field of honor                                          paris at the restoration   paris presented a singular aspect just after the downfall of napoleon and the restoration of the bourbons it was filled with a restless roaming population a dark sallow race with fierce mustaches black cravats and feverish menacing looks men suddenly thrown out of employ by the return of peace officers cut short in their career and cast loose with scanty means many of them in utter indigence upon the world the broken elements of armies they haunted the places of public resort like restless unhappy spirits taking no pleasure hanging about like lowering clouds that linger after a storm and giving a singular air of gloom to this otherwise gay metropolis  the vaunted courtesy of the old school the smooth urbanity that prevailed in former days of settled government and longestablished aristocracy had disappeared amid the savage republicanism of the revolution and the military furor of the empire recent reverses had stung the national vanity to the quick and english travelers who crowded to paris on the return of peace expecting to meet with a gay goodhumored complaisant populace such as existed in the time of the sentimental journey were surprised at finding them irritable and fractious quick at fancying affronts and not unapt to offer insults they accordingly inveighed with heat and bitterness at the rudeness they experienced in the french metropolis yet what better had they to expect had charles ii been reinstated in his kingdom by the valor of french troops had he been wheeled triumphantly to london over the trampled bodies and trampled standards of englands bravest sons had a french general dictated to the english capital and a french army been quartered in hyde park had paris poured forth its motley population and the wealthy bourgeoise of every french trading town swarmed to london crowding its squares filling its streets with their equipages thronging its fashionable hotels and places of amusements elbowing its impoverished nobility out of their palaces and operaboxes and looking down on the humiliated inhabitants as a conquered people in such a reverse of the case what degree of courtesy would the populace of london have been apt to exercise toward their visitors footnote the above remarks were suggested by a conversation with the late mr canning whom the author met in paris and who expressed himself in the most liberal way concerning the magnanimity of the french on the occupation of their capital by strangers  on the contrary i have always admired the degree of magnanimity exhibited by the french on the occupation of their capital by the english when we consider the military ambition of this nation its love of glory the splendid height to which its renown in arms had recently been carried and with these the tremendous reverses it had just undergone its armies shattered annihilated its capital captured garrisoned and overrun and that too by its ancient rival the english toward whom it had cherished for centuries a jealous and almost religious hostility could we have wondered if the tiger spirit of this fiery people had broken out in bloody feuds and deadly quarrels and that they had sought to rid themselves in any way of their invaders but it is cowardly nations only those who dare not wield the sword that revenge themselves with the lurking dagger there were no assassinations in paris the french had fought valiantly desperately in the field but when valor was no longer of avail they submitted like gallant men to a fate they could not withstand some instances of insult from the populace were experienced by their english visitors some personal rencontres which led to duels did take place but these smacked of open and honorable hostility no instances of lurking and perfidious revenge occurred and the british soldier patroled the streets of paris safe from treacherous assault  if the english met with harshness and repulse in social intercourse it was in some degree a proof that the people are more sincere than has been represented the emigrants who had just returned were not yet reinstated society was constituted of those who had flourished under the late regime the newly ennobled the recently enriched who felt their prosperity and their consequence endangered by this change of things the brokendown officer who saw his glory tarnished his fortune ruined his occupation gone could not be expected to look with complacency upon the authors of his downfall the english visitor flushed with health and wealth and victory could little enter into the feelings of the blighted warrior scarred with a hundred battles an exile from the camp broken in constitution by the wars impoverished by the peace and cast back a needy stranger in the splendid but captured metropolis of his country    oh who can tell what heroes feel    when all but life and honors lost  and here let me notice the conduct of the french soldiery on the dismemberment of the army of the loire when two hundred thousand men were suddenly thrown out of employ men who had been brought up to the camp and scarce knew any other home few in civil peaceful life are aware of the severe trial to the feelings that takes place on the dissolution of a regiment there is a fraternity in arms the community of dangers hardships enjoyments the participation in battles and victories the companionship in adventures at a time of life when mens feelings are most fresh susceptible and ardent all these bind the members of a regiment strongly together to them the regiment is friends family home they identify themselves with its fortunes its glories its disgraces imagine this romantic tie suddenly dissolved the regiment broken up the occupation of its members gone their military pride mortified the career of glory closed behind them that of obscurity dependence want neglect perhaps beggary before them such was the case with the soldiers of the army of the loire they were sent off in squads with officers to the principal towns where they were to be disarmed and discharged in this way they passed through the country with arms in their hands often exposed to slights and scoffs to hunger and various hardships and privations but they conducted themselves magnanimously without any of those outbreaks of violence and wrong that so often attend the dismemberment of armies                                       the few years that have elapsed since the time above alluded to have already had their effect the proud and angry spirits which then roamed about paris unemployed begins to recover its old channels though worn deeper by recent torrents the natural urbanity of the french begins to find its way like oil to the surface though there still remains a degree of roughness and bluntness of manner partly real and partly affected by such as imagine it to indicate force and frankness the events of the last thirty years have rendered the french a more reflecting people they have acquired greater independence of mind and strength of judgment together with a portion of that prudence which results from experiencing the dangerous consequences of excesses however that period may have been stained by crimes and filled with extravagances the french have certainly come out of it a greater nation than before one of their own philosophers observes that in one or two generations the nation will probably combine the ease and elegance of the old character with force and solidity they were light he says before the revolution then wild and savage they have become more thoughtful and reflective it is only old frenchmen nowadays that are gay and trivial the young are very serious personages                                       psin the course of a mornings walk about the time the above remarks were written i observed the duke of wellington who was on a brief visit to paris he was alone simply attired in a blue frock with an umbrella under his arm and his hat drawn over his eyes and sauntering across the place vendome close by the column of napoleon he gave a glance up at the column as he passed and continued his loitering way up the rue de la paix stopping occasionally to gaze in at the shopwindows elbowed now and then by other gazers who little suspected that the quiet lounging individual they were jostling so unceremoniously was the conqueror who had twice entered their capital victoriously had controlled the destinies of the nation and eclipsed the glory of the military idol at the base of whose column he was thus negligently sauntering  some years afterward i was at an evenings entertainment given by the duke at apsley house to william iv the duke had manifested his admiration of his great adversary by having portraits of him in different parts of the house at the bottom of the grand staircase stood the colossal statue of the emperor by canova it was of marble in the antique style with one arm partly extended holding a figure of victory over this arm the ladies in tripping upstairs to the ball had thrown their shawls it was a singular office for the statue of napoleon to perform in the mansion of the duke of wellington    imperial caesar dead and turned to clay etc etc                                          american researches in italy  life of tasso recovery of a lost portrait of dante  to the editor of the knickerbocker  sirpermit me through the pages of your magazine to call the attention of the public to the learned and elegant researches in europe of one of our countrymen mr r h wilde of georgia formerly a member of the house of representatives after leaving congress mr wilde a few years since spent about eighteen months in traveling through different parts of europe until he became stationary for a time in tuscany here he occupied himself with researches concerning the private life of tasso whose mysterious and romantic love for the princess leonora his madness and imprisonment had recently become the theme of a literary controversy not yet ended curious in itself and rendered still more curious by some alleged manuscripts of the poets brought forward by count alberti mr wilde entered into the investigation with the enthusiasm of a poet and the patience and accuracy of a casehunter and has produced a work now in the press in which the vexed questions concerning tasso are most ably discussed and lights thrown upon them by his letters and by various of his sonnets which last are rendered into english with rare felicity while mr wilde was occupied upon this work he became acquainted with signer carlo liverati an artist of considerable merit and especially well versed in the antiquities of florence this gentleman mentioned incidentally one day in the course of conversation that there once and probably still existed in the bargello anciently both the prison and the palace of the republic an authentic portrait of dante it was believed to be in fresco on a wall which afterward by some strange neglect or inadvertency had been covered with whitewash signor liverati mentioned the circumstance merely to deplore the loss of so precious a portrait and to regret the almost utter hopelessness of its recovery  as mr wilde had not as yet imbibed that enthusiastic admiration for dante which possesses all italians by whom the poet is almost worshiped this conversation made but a slight impression on him at the time subsequently however his researches concerning tasso being ended he began to amuse his leisure hours with attempts to translate some specimens of italian lyric poetry and to compose very short biographical sketches of the authors in these specimens which as yet exist only in manuscript he has shown the same critical knowledge of the italian language and admirable command of the english that characterize his translations of tasso he had not advanced far in these exercises when the obscure and contradictory accounts of many incidents in the life of dante caused him much embarrassment and sorely piqued his curiosity about the same time he received through the courtesy of don neri dei principi corsini what he had long most fervently desired a permission from the grandduke to pursue his investigations in the secret archives of florence with power to obtain copies therefrom this was a rich and almost unwrought mine of literary research for to italians themselves as well as to foreigners their archives for the most part have been long inaccessible for two years mr wilde devoted himself with indefatigable ardor to explore the records of the republic during the time of dante these being written in barbarous latin and semigothic characters on parchment more or less discolored and mutilated with ink sometimes faded were rendered still more illegible by the arbitrary abbreviations of the notaries they require in fact an especial study few even of the officers employed in the archivio delle riformagione can read them currently and correctly  mr wilde however persevered in his laborious task with a patience severely tried but invincible being without an index each file each book required to be examined page by page to ascertain whether any particular of the immortal poets political life had escaped the untiring industry of his countrymen this toil was not wholly fruitless and several interesting facts obscurely known and others utterly unknown by the italians themselves are drawn forth by mr wilde from the oblivion of these archives  while thus engaged the circumstance of the lost portrait of dante was again brought to mr wildes mind but now excited intense interest in perusing the notes of the late learned canonico moreri on filelfos life of dante he found it stated that a portrait of the poet by giotto was formerly to be seen in the bargello he learned also that signer scotti who has charge of the original drawings of the old masters in the imperial and royal gallery had made several years previously an ineffectual attempt to set on foot a project for the recovery of the lost treasure here was a new vein of inquiry which mr wilde followed up with his usual energy and sagacity he soon satisfied himself by reference to vasari and to the still more ancient and decisive authority of filippo villari who lived shortly after the poet that giotto the friend and contemporary of dante did undoubtedly paint his likeness in the place indicated giotto died in 1336 but as dante was banished and was even sentenced to be burned in 1302 it was obvious the work must have been executed before that time since the portrait of one outlawed and capitally convicted as an enemy to the commonwealth would never have been ordered or tolerated in the chapel of the royal palace it was clear then that the portrait must have been painted between 1290 and 1302  mr wilde now revolved in his own mind the possibility that this precious relic might remain undestroyed under its coat of whitewash and might yet be restored to the world for a moment he felt an impulse to undertake the enterprise but feared that in a foreigner from a new world any part of which is unrepresented at the tuscan court it might appear like an intrusion he soon however found a zealous coadjutor this was one giovanni aubrey bezzi a piedmontese exile who had long been a resident in england and was familiar with its language and literature he was now on a visit to florence which liberal and hospitable city is always open to men of merit who for political reasons have been excluded from other parts of italy signer bezzi partook deeply of the enthusiasm of his countrymen for the memory of dante and sympathized with mr wilde in his eagerness to retrieve if possible the lost portrait they had several consultations as to the means to be adopted to effect their purpose without incurring the charge of undue officiousness to lessen any objections that might occur they resolved to ask for nothing but permission to search for the fresco painting at their own expense and should any remains of it be found then to propose to the nobility and gentry of florence an association for the purpose of completing the undertaking and effectually recovering the lost portrait  for the same reason the formal memorial addressed to the grandduke was drawn up in the name of florentines among whom were the celebrated bartolini now president of the school of sculpture in the imperial and royal academy signor paolo ferroni of the noble family of that name who has exhibited considerable talent for painting and signor gasparini also an artist this petition was urged and supported with indefatigable zeal by signor bezzi and being warmly countenanced by count nerli and other functionaries met with more prompt success than had been anticipated signor marini a skillful artist who had succeeded in similar operations was now employed to remove the whitewash by a process of his own by which any fresco painting that might exist beneath would be protected from injury he set to work patiently and cautiously in a short time he met with evidence of the existence of the fresco from under the coat of whitewash the head of an angel gradually made its appearance and was pronounced to be by the pencil of giotto  the enterprise was now prosecuted with increased ardor several months were expended on the task and three sides of the chapel wall were uncovered they were all painted in fresco by giotto with the history of the magdalen exhibiting her conversion her penance and her beatification the figures however were all those of saints and angels no historical portraits had yet been discovered and doubts began to be entertained whether there were any still the recovery of an indisputable work of giottos was considered an ample reward for any toil and the ministers of the grandduke acting under his directions assumed on his behalf the past charges and future management of the enterprise  at length on the uncovering of the fourth wall the undertaking was crowned with complete success a number of historical figures were brought to light and among them the undoubted likeness of dante he was represented in full length in the garb of the time with a book under his arm designed most probably to represent the vita nuova for the comedia was not yet composed and to all appearance from thirty to thirtyfive years of age the face was in profile and in excellent preservation excepting that at some former period a nail had unfortunately been driven into the eye the outline of the eyelid was perfect so that the injury could easily be remedied the countenance was extremely handsome yet bore a strong resemblance to the portraits of the poet taken later in life  it is not easy to appreciate the delight of mr wilde and his coadjutors at this triumphant result of their researches nor the sensation produced not merely in florence but throughout italy by this discovery of a veritable portrait of dante in the prime of his days it was some such sensation as would be produced in england by the sudden discovery of a perfectly well authenticated likeness of shakespeare with a difference in intensity proportioned to the superior sensitiveness of the italians  the recovery of this portrait of the divine poet has occasioned fresh inquiry into the origin of the masks said to have been made from a cast of his face taken after death one of these masks in the possession of the marquess of torrigiani has been pronounced as certainly the original several artists of high talent have concurred in this opinion among these may be named jesi the first engraver in florence seymour kirkup esq a painter and antiquary and our own countryman powers whose genius by the way is very highly appreciated by the italians  we may expect from the accomplished pen of carlo torrigiani son of the marquess and who is advantageously known in this country from having traveled here an account of this curious and valuable relic which has been upward of a century in the possession of his family  should mr wilde finish his biographical work concerning dante which promises to be a proud achievement in american literature he intends i understand to apply for permission to have both likenesses copied and should circumstances warrant the expense to have them engraved by eminent artists we shall then have the features of dante while in the prime of life as well as at the moment of his death  g c     the taking of the veil   one of the most remarkable personages in parisian society during the last century was ren√©e charlotte victoire de froulay de tesse marchioness de crequi she sprang from the highest and proudest of the old french nobility and ever maintained the most exalted notions of the purity and antiquity of blood looking upon all families that could not date back further than three or four hundred years as mere upstarts when a beautiful girl fourteen years of age she was presented to louis xiv at versailles and the ancient monarch kissed her hand with great gallantry after an interval of about eightyfive years when nearly a hundred years old the same testimonial of respect was paid her at the tuileries by bonaparte then first consul who promised her the restitution of the confiscated forests formerly belonging to her family she was one of the most celebrated women of her time for intellectual grace and superiority and had the courage to remain at paris and brave all the horrors of the revolution which laid waste the aristocratical world around her  the memoirs she has left behind abound with curious anecdotes and vivid pictures of parisian life during the latter days of louis xiv the regency of the duke of orleans and the residue of the last century and are highly illustrative of the pride splendor and licentiousness of the french nobility on the very eve of their tremendous downfall  i shall draw forth a few scenes from her memoirs taken almost at random and which though given as actual and wellknown circumstances have quite the air of romance                                       all the great world of paris were invited to be present at a grand ceremonial to take place in the church of the abbey royal of panthemont henrietta de lenoncour a young girl of a noble family of great beauty and heiress to immense estates was to take the black veil invitations had been issued in grand form by her aunt and guardian the countess brigitte de rupelmonde canoness of mauberge the circumstance caused great talk and wonder in the fashionable circles of paris everybody was at a loss to imagine why a young girl beautiful and rich in the very springtime of her charms should renounce a world which she was so eminently qualified to embellish and enjoy  a lady of high rank who visited the beautiful novice at the grate of her conventparlor got a clew to the mystery she found her in great agitation for a time she evidently repressed her feelings but they at length broke forth in passionate exclamations heaven grant me grace said she some day or other to pardon my cousin gondrecourt the sorrows he has caused me  what do you meanwhat sorrows my child inquired her visitor what has your cousin done to affect you  he is married cried she in accents of despair but endeavoring to repress her sobs  married i have heard nothing of the kind my dear are you perfectly sure of it  alas nothing is more certain my aunt de rupelmonde informed me of it  the lady retired full of surprise and commiseration she related the scene in a circle of the highest nobility in the saloon of the marshal prince of beauvau where the unaccountable selfsacrifice of the beautiful novice was under discussion  alas said she the poor girl is crossed in love she is about to renounce the world in despair at the marriage of her cousin de gondrecourt  what cried a gentleman present the viscount de gondrecourt married never was there a greater falsehood and her aunt told her so oh i understand the plot the countess is passionately fond of gondrecourt and jealous of her beautiful niece but her schemes are vain the viscount holds her in perfect detestation  there was a mingled expression of ridicule disgust and indignation at the thought of such a rivalry the countess rupelmonde was old enough to be the grandmother of the viscount she was a woman of violent passions and imperious temper robust in person with a masculine voice a dusky complexion green eyes and powerful eyebrows  it is impossible cried one of the company that a woman of the countesss age and appearance can be guilty of such folly no no you mistake the aim of this detestable woman she is managing to get possession of the estate of her lovely niece  this was admitted to be the most probable and all concurred in believing the countess to be at the bottom of the intended sacrifice for although a canoness a dignitary of a religious order she was pronounced little better than a devil incarnate  the princess de beauvau a woman of generous spirit and intrepid zeal suddenly rose from the chair in which she had been reclining my prince said she addressing her husband if you approve of it i will go immediately and have a conversation on this subject with the archbishop there is not a moment to spare it is now past midnight the ceremony is to take place in the morning a few hours and the irrevocable vows will be pronounced  the prince inclined his head in respectful assent the princess set about her generous enterprise with a womans promptness within a short time her carriage was at the iron gate of the archiepiscopal palace and her servants rang for admission two switzers who had charge of the gate were fast asleep in the porters lodge for it was halfpast two in the morning it was some time before they could be awakened and longer before they could be made to come forth  the princess de beauvau is at the gate  such a personage was not to be received in deshabille her dignity and the dignity of the archbishop demanded that the gate should be served in full costume for half an hour therefore had the princess to wait in feverish impatience until the two dignitaries of the porters lodge arrayed themselves and three oclock sounded from the tower of notre dame before they came forth they were in grand livery of a buff color with amaranth galloons plaited with silver and fringed swordbelts reaching to their knees in which were suspended long rapiers they had small threecornered hats surmounted with plumes and each bore in his hand a halbert thus equipped at all points they planted themselves before the door of the carriage struck the ends of their halberts on the ground with emphasis and stood waiting with official importance but profound respect to know the pleasure of the princess  she demanded to speak with the archbishop a most reverential bow and shrug accompanied the reply that his grandeur was not at home  not at home where was he to be found another bow and shrug his grandeur either was or ought to be in retirement in the seminary of st magloire unless he had gone to pass the fete of st bruno with the reverend carthusian fathers of the rue denfer or perhaps he might have gone to repose himself in his castle of conflanssurseine though on further thought it was not unlikely he might have gone to sleep at st cyr where the bishop of chartres never failed to invite him for the anniversary soiree of madame de maintenon  the princess was in despair at this multiplicity of crossroads pointed out for the chase the brief interval of time was rapidly elapsing day already began to dawn she saw there was no hope of finding the archbishop before the moment of his entrance into the church for the mornings ceremony so she returned home quite distressed  at seven oclock in the morning the princess was in the parlor of the monastery of de panthemont and sent in an urgent request for a moments conversation with the lady abbess the reply brought was that the abbess could not come to the parlor being obliged to attend in the choir at the canonical hours the princess entreated permission to enter the convent to reveal to the lady abbess in two words something of the greatest importance the abbess sent word in reply that the thing was impossible until she had obtained permission from the archbishop of paris the princess retired once more to her carriage and now as a forlorn hope took her station at the door of the church to watch for the arrival of the prelate  after a while the splendid company invited to this great ceremony began to arrive the beauty rank and wealth of the novice had excited great attention and as everybody was expected to be present on the occasion everybody pressed to secure a place the street reverberated with the continual roll of gilded carriages and chariots coaches of princes and dukes designated by imperials of crimson velvet and magnificent equipages of six horses decked out with nodding plumes and sumptuous harnessing at length the equipages ceased to arrive empty vehicles filled the street and with a noisy and partycolored crowd of lackeys in rich liveries obstructed all the entrances to de panthemont  eleven oclock had struck the last auditor had entered the church the deep tones of the organ began to swell through the sacred pile yet still the archbishop came not the heart of the princess beat quicker and quicker with vague apprehension when a valet dressed in cloth of silver trimmed with crimson velvet approached her carriage precipitately madame said he the archbishop is in the church he entered by the portal of the cloister he is already in the sanctuary the ceremony is about to commence  what was to be done to speak with the archbishop was now impossible and yet on the revelation she was to make to him depended the fate of the lovely novice the princess drew forth her tablets of enameled gold wrote a few lines therein with a pencil and ordered her lackey to make way for her through the crowd and conduct her with all speed to the sacristy  the description given of the church and the assemblage on this occasion presents an idea of the aristocratical state of the times and of the high interest awakened by the affecting sacrifice about to take place the church was hung with superb tapestry above which extended a band of white damask fringed with gold and covered with armorial escutcheons a large pennon emblazoned with the arms and alliances of the highborn damsel was suspended according to custom in place of the lamp of the sanctuary the lusters girandoles and candelabras of the king had been furnished in profusion to decorate the sacred edifice and the pavements were all covered with rich carpets  the sanctuary presented a reverend and august assemblage of bishops canons and monks of various orders benedictines bernardines raccollets capuchins and others all in their appropriate robes and dresses in the midst presided the archbishop of paris christopher de beaumont surrounded by his four arch priests and his vicarsgeneral he was seated with his back against the altar when his eyes were cast down his countenance pale and severe is represented as having been somewhat sepulchral and deathlike but the moment he raised his large dark sparkling eyes the whole became animated beaming with ardor and expressive of energy penetration and firmness  the audience that crowded the church was no less illustrious excepting the royal family all that was elevated in rank and title was there never had a ceremonial of the kind attracted an equal concourse of the high aristocracy of paris  at length the grated gates of the choir creaked on their hinges and madame de richelieu the high and noble abbess of de panthemont advanced to resign the novice into the hands of her aunt the countess canoness de rupelmonde every eye was turned with intense curiosity to gain a sight of the beautiful victim she was sumptuously dressed but her paleness and languor accorded but little with her brilliant attire the canoness de rupelmonde conducted her niece to her prayingdesk where as soon as the poor girl knelt down she sank as if exhausted just then a sort of murmur was heard at the lower end of the church where the servants in livery were gathered a young man was borne forth struggling in convulsions he was in the uniform of an officer of the guards of king stanislaus duke of lorraine a whisper circulated that it was the young viscount de gondrecourt and that he was a lover of the novice almost all the young nobles present hurried forth to proffer him sympathy and assistance  the archbishop of paris remained all this time seated before the altar his eyes cast down his pallid countenance giving no signs of interest or participation in the scene around him it was noticed that in one of his hands which was covered with a violet glove he grasped firmly a pair of tablets of enameled gold  the canoness de rupelmonde conducted her niece to the prelate to make her profession of selfdevotion and to utter the irrevocable vow as the lovely novice knelt at his feet the archbishop fixed on her his dark beaming eyes with a kind but earnest expression sister said he in the softest and most benevolent tone of voice what is your age  nineteen years monseigneur eagerly interposed the countess de rupelmonde  you will reply to me byandby madame said the archbishop dryly he then repeated his question to the novice who replied in a faltering voice seventeen years  in what diocese did you take the white veil  in the diocese of toul  how exclaimed the archbishop vehemently in the diocese of toul the chair of toul is vacant the bishop of toul died fifteen months since and those who officiate in the chapter are not authorized to receive novices your novitiate mademoiselle is null and void and we cannot receive your profession  the archbishop rose from his chair resumed his miter and took the crozier from the hands of an attendant  my dear brethren said he addressing the assembly there is no necessity for our examining and interrogating mademoiselle de lenoncour on the sincerity of her religious vocation there is a canonical impediment to her professing for the present and as to the future we reserve to ourselves the consideration of the matter interdicting to all other ecclesiastical persons the power of accepting her vows under penalty of interdiction of suspension and of nullification all which is in virtue of our metropolitan rights contained in the terms of the bull cum proximis adjutorium nostrum in nomine domini pursued he chanting in a grave and solemn voice and turning toward the altar to give the benediction of the holy sacrament  the noble auditory had that habitude of reserve that empire or rather tyranny over all outward manifestations of internal emotions which belongs to high aristocratical breeding the declaration of the archbishop therefore was received as one of the most natural and ordinary things in the world and all knelt down and received the pontifical benediction with perfect decorum as soon however as they were released from the selfrestraint imposed by etiquette they amply indemnified themselves and nothing was talked of for a month in the fashionable saloons of paris but the loves of the handsome viscount and the charming henrietta the wickedness of the canoness the active benevolence and admirable address of the princess de beauvau and the great wisdom of the archbishop who was particularly extolled for his delicacy in defeating this maneuver without any scandal to the aristocracy or public stigma on the name of de rupelmonde and without any departure from pastoral gentleness by adroitly seizing upon an informality and turning it to beneficial account with as much authority as charitable circumspection  as to the canoness de rupelmonde she was defeated at all points in her wicked plans against her beautiful niece in consequence of the caveat of the archbishop her superior ecclesiastic the abbess de panthemont formally forbade mademoiselle de lenoncour to resume the white veil and the dress of a novitiate and instead of a novices cell established her in a beautiful apartment as a boarder the next morning the canoness de rupelmonde called at the convent to take away her niece but to her confusion the abbess produced a lettredecachet which she had just received and which forbade mademoiselle to leave the convent with any other person save the prince de beauvau  under the auspices and the vigilant attention of the prince the whole affair was wound up in the most technical and circumstantial manner the countess de rupelmonde by a decree of the grand council was divested of the guardianship of her niece all the arrears of revenues accumulated during mademoiselle de lenoncours minority were rigorously collected the accounts scrutinized and adjusted and her noble fortune placed safely and entirely in her hands  in a little while the noble personages who had been invited to the ceremony of taking the veil received another invitation on the part of the countess dowager de gondrecourt and the marshal prince de beauvau to attend the marriage of adrien de gondrecourt viscount of jeansurmoselle and henrietta de lenoncour countess de hevouwal etc which duly took place in the chapel of the archiepiscopal palace at paris                                       so much for the beautiful henrietta de lenoncour we will now draw forth a companion picture of a handsome young cavalier who figured in the gay world of paris about the same time and concerning whom the ancient marchioness writes with the lingering feeling of youthful romance                                          the charming letori√àres   a good face is a letter of recommendation says an old proverb and it was never more verified than in the case of the chevalier letorieres he was a young gentleman of good family but who according to the spanish phrase had nothing but his cloak and sword capa y espada that is to say his gentle blood and gallant bearing to help him forward in the world through the interest of an uncle who was an abbe he received a gratuitous education at a fashionable college but finding the terms of study too long and the vacations too short for his gay and indolent temper he left college without saying a word and launched himself upon paris with a light heart and still lighter pocket here he led a life to his humor it is true he had to make scanty meals and to lodge in a garret but what of that he was his own master free from all task or restraint when cold or hungry he sallied forth like others of the chameleon order and banqueted on pure air and warm sunshine in the public walks and gardens drove off the thoughts of a dinner by amusing himself with the gay and grotesque throngs of the metropolis and if one of the poorest was one of the merriest gentlemen upon town wherever he went his good looks and frank graceful demeanor had an instant and magical effect in securing favor there was but one word to express his fascinating powershe was charming  instances are given of the effect of his winning qualities upon minds of coarse ordinary mold he had once taken shelter from a heavy shower under a gateway a hackney coachman who was passing by pulled up and asked him if he wished a cast in his carriage letorieres declined with a melancholy and dubious shake of the head the coachman regarded him wistfully repeared his solicitations and wished to know what place he was going to to the palace of justice to walk in the galleries but i will wait here until the rain is over  and why so inquired the coachman pertinaciously  because ive no money do let me be quiet  the coachman jumped down and opening the door of his carriage it shall never be said cried he that i left so charming a young gentleman to weary himself and catch cold merely for the sake of twentyfour sous  arrived at the palace of justice he stopped before the saloon of a famous restaurateur opened the door of the carriage and taking off his hat very respectfully begged the youth to accept of a louisdor you will meet with some young gentlemen within said he with whom you may wish to take a hand at cards the number of my coach is 144 you can find me out and repay me whenever you please  the worthy jehu was some years afterward made coachman to the princess sophia of france through the recommendation of the handsome youth he had so generously obliged  another instance in point is given with respect to his tailor to whom he owed four hundred livres the tailor had repeatedly dunned him but was always put off with the best grace in the world the wife of the tailor urged her husband to assume a harsher tone he replied that he could not find it in his heart to speak roughly to so charming a young gentleman  ive no patience with such want of spirit cried the wife you have not the courage to show your teeth but im going out to get change for this note of a hundred crowns before i come home ill seek this charming youth myself and see whether he has the power to charm me ill warrant he wont be able to put me off with fine looks and fine speeches  with these and many more vaunts the good dame sallied forth when she returned home however she wore quite a different aspect  well said her husband how much have you received from the charming young man  let me alone replied the wife i found him playing on the guitar and he looked so handsome and was so amiable and genteel that i had not the heart to trouble him  and the change for the hundredcrown note said the tailor  the wife hesitated a moment faith cried she youll have to add the amount to your next bill against him the poor young gentleman had such a melancholy air thati know not how it was buti left the hundred crowns on his mantelpiece in spite of him  the captivating looks and manners of letorieres made his way with equal facility in the great world his high connections entitled him to presentation at court but some questions arose about the sufficiency of his proofs of nobility whereupon the king who had seen him walking in the gardens of versailles and had been charmed with his appearance put an end to all demurs of etiquette by making him a viscount  the same kind of fascination is said to have attended him throughout his career he succeeded in various difficult family suits on questions of honors and privileges he had merely to appear in court to dispose the judges in his favor he at length became so popular that on one occasion when he appeared at the theater on recovering from a wound received in a duel the audience applauded him on his entrance nothing it is said could have been in more perfect good taste and high breeding than his conduct on this occasion when he heard the applause he rose in his box stepped forward and surveyed both sides of the house as if he could not believe that it was himself they were treating like a favorite actor or a prince of the blood  his success with the fair sex may easily be presumed but he had too much honor and sensibility to render his intercourse with them a series of cold gallantries and heartless triumphs in the course of his attendance upon court where he held a post of honor about the king he fell deeply in love with the beautiful princess julia of savoy carignan she was young tender and simplehearted and returned his love with equal fervor her family took the alarm at this attachment and procured an order that she should inhabit the abbey of montmartre where she was treated with all befitting delicacy and distinction but not permitted to go beyond the convent walls the lovers found means to correspond one of their letters was intercepted and it is even hinted that a plan of elopement was discovered a duel was the consequence with one of the fiery relations of the princess letorieres received two swordthrusts in his right side his wounds were serious yet after two or three days confinement he could not resist his impatience to see the princess he succeeded in scaling the walls of the abbey and obtaining an interview in an arcade leading to the cloister of the cemetery the interview of the lovers was long and tender they exchanged vows of eternal fidelity and flattered themselves with hopes of future happiness which they were never to realize after repeated farewells the princess reentered the convent never again to behold the charming letorieres on the following morning his corpse was found stiff and cold on the pavement of the cloister  it would seem that the wounds of the unfortunate youth had been reopened by his efforts to get over the wall that he had refrained from calling assistance lest he should expose the princess and that he had bled to death without any one to aid him or to close his dying eyes     the early experiences of ralph ringwood footnote ralph ringwood though a fictitious name is a real personage the worthy original is now living and flourishing in honorable station i have given some anecdotes of his early and eccentric career in as nearly as i can recollect the very words in which he related them they certainly afforded strong temptations to the embellishments of fiction but i thought them so strikingly characteristic of the individual and of the scenes and society into which his peculiar humors carried him that i preferred giving them in their original simplicityg c   noted down from his conversations  i am a kentuckian by residence and choice but a virginian by birth the cause of my first leaving the ancient dominion and emigrating to kentucky was a jackass you stare but have a little patience and ill soon show you how it came to pass my father who was of one of the old virginian families resided in richmond he was a widower and his domestic affairs were managed by a housekeeper of the old school such as used to administer the concerns of opulent virginian households she was a dignitary that almost rivaled my father in importance and seemed to think everything belonged to her in fact she was so considerate in her economy and so careful of expense as sometimes to vex my father who would swear she was disgracing him by her meanness she always appeared with that ancient insignia of housekeeping trust and authority a great bunch of keys jingling at her girdle she superintended the arrangement of the table at every meal and saw that the dishes were all placed according to her primitive notions of symmetry in the evening she took her stand and served out tea with a mingled respectfulness and pride of station truly exemplary her great ambition was to have everything in order and that the establishment under her sway should be cited as a model of good housekeeping if anything went wrong poor old barbara would take it to heart and sit in her room and cry until a few chapters in the bible would quiet her spirits and make all calm again the bible in fact was her constant resort in time of trouble she opened it indiscriminately and whether she chanced among the lamentations of jeremiah the canticles of solomon or the rough enumeration of the tribes in deuteronomy a chapter was a chapter and operated like balm to her soul such was our good old housekeeper barbara who was destined unwittingly to have a most important effect upon my destiny  it came to pass during the days of my juvenility while i was yet what is termed an unlucky boy that a gentleman of our neighborhood a great advocate for experiments and improvements of all kinds took it into his head that it would be an immense public advantage to introduce a breed of mules and accordingly imported three jacks to stock the neighborhood this in a part of the country where the people cared for nothing but blood horses why sir they would have considered their mares disgraced and their whole stud dishonored by such a misalliance the whole matter was a town talk and a town scandal the worthy amalgamator of quadrupeds found himself in a dismal scrape so he backed out in time abjured the whole doctrine of amalgamation and turned his jacks loose to shift for themselves upon the town common there they used to run about and lead an idle goodfornothing holiday life the happiest animals in the country  it so happened that my way to school lay across this common the first time that i saw one of these animals it set up a braying and frightened me confoundedly however i soon got over my fright and seeing that it had something of a horse look my virginian love for anything of the equestrian species predominated and i determined to back it i accordingly applied at a grocers shop procured a cord that had been round a loaf of sugar and made a kind of halter then summoning some of my schoolfellows we drove master jack about the common until we hemmed him in an angle of a worm fence after some difficulty we fixed the halter round his muzzle and i mounted up flew his heels away i went over his head and off he scampered however i was on my legs in a twinkling gave chase caught him and remounted by dint of repeated tumbles i soon learned to stick to his back so that he could no more cast me than he could his own skin from that time master jack and his companions had a scampering life of it for we all rode them between school hours and on holiday afternoons and you may be sure schoolboys nags are never permitted to suffer the grass to grow under their feet they soon became so knowing that they took to their heels at the very sight of a schoolboy and we were generally much longer in chasing than we were in riding them  sunday approached on which i projected an equestrian excursion on one of these longeared steeds as i knew the jacks would be in great demand on sunday morning i secured one overnight and conducted him home to be ready for an early outset but where was i to quarter him for the night i could not put him in the stable our old black groom george was as absolute in that domain as barbara was within doors and would have thought his stable his horses and himself disgraced by the introduction of a jackass i recollected the smokehouse an outbuilding appended to all virginian establishments for the smoking of hams and other kinds of meat so i got the key put master jack in locked the door returned the key to its place and went to bed intending to release my prisoner at an early hour before any of the family were awake i was so tired however by the exertions i had made in catching the donkey that i fell into a sound sleep and the morning broke without my awaking  not so with dame barbara the housekeeper as usual to use her own phrase she was up before the crow put his shoes on and bustled about to get things in order for breakfast her first resort was to the smokehouse scarce had she opened the door when master jack tired of his confinement and glad to be released from darkness gave a loud bray and rushed forth down dropped old barbara the animal trampled over her and made off for the common poor barbara she had never before seen a donkey and having read in the bible that the devil went about like a roaring lion seeking whom he might devour she took it for granted that this was beelzebub himself the kitchen was soon in a hubbub the servants hurried to the spot there lay old barbara in fits as fast as she got out of one the thoughts of the devil came over her and she fell into another for the good soul was devoutly superstitious  as ill luck would have it among those attracted by the noise was a little cursed fidgety crabbed uncle of mine one of those uneasy spirits that cannot rest quietly in their beds in the morning but must be up early to bother the household he was only a kind of halfuncle after all for he had married my fathers sister yet be assumed great authority on the strength of this lefthanded relationship and was a universal intermeddler and family pest this prying little busybody soon ferreted out the truth of the story and discovered by hook and by crook that i was at the bottom of the affair and had locked up the donkey in the smokehouse he stopped to inquire no further for he was one of those testy curmudgeons with whom unlucky boys are always in the wrong leaving old barbara to wrestle in imagination with the devil he made for my bedchamber where i still lay wrapped in rosy slumbers little dreaming of the mischief i had done and the storm about to break over me  in an instant i was awakened by a shower of thwacks and started up in wild amazement i demanded the meaning of this attack but received no other reply than that i had murdered the housekeeper while my uncle continued whacking away during my confusion i seized a poker and put myself on the defensive i was a stout boy for my years while my uncle was a little wiffet of a man one that in kentucky we would not call even an individual nothing more than a remote circumstance i soon therefore brought him to a parley and learned the whole extent of the charge brought against me i confessed to the donkey and the smokehouse but pleaded not guilty of the murder of the housekeeper i soon found out that old barbara was still alive she continued under the doctors hands however for several days and whenever she had an ill turn my uncle would seek to give me another flogging i appealed to my father but got no redress i was considered an unlucky boy prone to all kinds of mischief so that prepossessions were against me in all cases of appeal  i felt stung to the soul at all this i had been beaten degraded and treated with slighting when i complained i lost my usual good spirits and good humor and being out of temper with everybody fancied everybody out of temper with me a certain wild roving spirit of freedom which i believe is as inherent in me as it is in the partridge was brought into sudden activity by the checks and restraints i suffered ill go from home thought i and shift for myself perhaps this notion was quickened by the rage for emigrating to kentucky which was at that time prevalent in virginia i had heard such stories of the romantic beauties of the country of the abundance of game of all kinds and of the glorious independent life of the hunters who ranged its noble forests and lived by the rifle that i was as much agog to get there as boys who live in seaports are to launch themselves among the wonders and adventures of the ocean  after a time old barbara got better in mind and body and matters were explained to her and she became gradually convinced that it was not the devil she had encountered when she heard how harshly i had been treated on her account the good old soul was extremely grieved and spoke warmly to my father in my behalf he had himself remarked the change in my behavior and thought punishment might have been carried too far he sought therefore to have some conversation with me and to soothe my feelings but it was too late i frankly told him the course of mortification that i had experienced and the fixed determination i had made to go from home  and where do you mean to go  to kentucky  to kentucky why you know nobody there  no matter i can soon make acquaintances  and what will you do when you get there  hunt  my father gave a long low whistle and looked in my face with a seriocomic expression i was not far in my teens and to talk of setting off alone for kentucky to turn hunter seemed doubtless the idle prattle of a boy he was little aware of the dogged resolution of my character and his smile of incredulity but fixed me more obstinately in my purpose i assured him i was serious in what i said and would certainly set off for kentucky in the spring  month after month passed away my father now and then adverted slightly to what had passed between us doubtless for the purpose of sounding me i always expressed the same grave and fixed determination by degrees he spoke to me more directly on the subject endeavoring earnestly but kindly to dissuade me my only reply was i had made up my mind  accordingly as soon as the spring had fairly opened i sought him one day in his study and informed him i was about to set out for kentucky and had come to take my leave he made no objection for he had exhausted persuasion and remonstrance and doubtless thought it best to give way to my humor trusting that a little rough experience would soon bring me home again i asked money for my journey he went to a chest took out a long green silk purse well filled and laid it on the table i now asked for a horse and servant  a horse said my father sneeringly why you would not go a mile without racing him and breaking your neck and as to a servant you cannot take care of yourself much less of him  how am i to travel then  why i suppose you are man enough to travel on foot  he spoke jestingly little thinking i would take him at his word but i was thoroughly piqued in respect to my enterprise so i pocketed the purse went to my room tied up three or four shirts in a pockethandkerchief put a dirk in my bosom girt a couple of pistols round my waist and felt like a knight errant armed cap apie and ready to rove the world in quest of adventures  my sister i had but one hung round me and wept and entreated me to stay i felt my heart swell in my throat but i gulped it back to its place and straightened myself up i would not suffer myself to cry i at length disengaged myself from her and got to the door  when will you come back cried she  never by heavens cried i until i come back a member of congress from kentucky i am determined to show that i am not the tailend of the family  such was my first outset from home you may suppose what a greenhorn i was and how little i knew of the world i was launching into  i do not recollect any incident of importance until i reached the borders of pennsylvania i had stopped at an inn to get some refreshment and as i was eating in the back room i overheard two men in the barroom conjecture who and what i could be one determined at length that i was a runaway apprentice and ought to be stopped to which the other assented when i had finished my meal and paid for it i went out at the back door lest i should be stopped by my supervisors scorning however to steal off like a culprit i walked round to the front of the house one of the men advanced to the front door he wore his hat on one side and had a consequential air that nettled me  where are you going youngster demanded he  thats none of your business replied i rather pertly  yes but it is though you have run away from home and must give an account of yourself  he advanced to seize me when i drew forth a pistol if you advance another step ill shoot you  he sprang back as if he had trodden upon a rattlesnake and his hat fell off in the movement  let him alone cried his companion hes a foolish madheaded boy and dont know what hes about hell shoot you you may rely on it  he did not need any caution in the matter he was afraid even to pick up his hat so i pushed forward on my way without molestation this incident however had its effect upon me i became fearful of sleeping in any house at night lest i should be stopped i took my meals in the houses in the course of the day but would turn aside at night into some wood or ravine make a fire and sleep before it this i considered was true hunters style and i wished to inure myself to it  at length i arrived at brownsville legweary and wayworn and in a shabby plight as you may suppose having been camping out for some nights past i applied at some of the inferior inns but could gain no admission i was regarded for a moment with a dubious eye and then informed they did not receive footpassengers at last i went boldly to the principal inn the landlord appeared as unwilling as the rest to receive a vagrant boy beneath his roof but his wife interfered in the midst of his excuses and half elbowing him aside  where are you going my lad said she  to kentucky  what are you going there for  to hunt  she looked earnestly at me for a moment or two have you a mother living said she at length  no madam she has been dead for some time  i thought so cried she warmly i knew if you had a mother living you would not be here from that moment the good woman treated me with a mothers kindness  i remained several days beneath her roof recovering from the fatigue of my journey while here i purchased a rifle and practiced daily at a mark to prepare myself for a hunters life when sufficiently recruited in strength i took leave of my kind host and hostess and resumed my journey  at wheeling i embarked in a flat bottomed family boat technically called a broadhorn a prime river conveyance in those days in this ark for two weeks i floated down the ohio the river was as yet in all its wild beauty its loftiest trees had not been thinned out the forest overhung the waters edge and was occasionally skirted by immense canebrakes wild animals of all kinds abounded we heard them rushing through the thickets and plashing in the water deer and bears would frequently swim across the river others would come down to the bank and gaze at the boat as it passed i was incessantly on the alert with my rifle but somehow or other the game was never within shot sometimes i got a chance to land and try my skill on shore i shot squirrels and small birds and even wild turkeys but though i caught glimpses of deer bounding away through the woods i never could get a fair shot at them  in this way we glided in our broadhorn past cincinnati the queen of the west as she is now called then a mere group of log cabins and the site of the bustling city of louisville then designated by a solitary house as i said before the ohio was as yet a wild river all was forest forest forest near the confluence of green river with the ohio i landed bade adieu to the broadhorn and struck for the interior of kentucky i had no precise plan my only idea was to make for one of the wildest parts of the country i had relatives in lexington and other settled places to whom i thought it probable my father would write concerning me so as i was full of manhood and independence and resolutely bent on making my way in the world without assistance or control i resolved to keep clear of them all  in the course of my first days trudge i shot a wild turkey and slung it on my back for provisions the forest was open and clear from underwood i saw deer in abundance but always running running it seemed to me as if these animals never stood still  at length i came to where a gang of halfstarved wolves were feasting on the carcass of a deer which they had run down and snarling and snapping and fighting like so many dogs they were all so ravenous and intent upon their prey that they did not notice me and i had time to make my observations one larger and fiercer than the rest seemed to claim the larger share and to keep the others in awe if any one came too near him while eating he would fly off seize and shake him and then return to his repast this thought i must be the captain if i can kill him i shall defeat the whole army i accordingly took aim fired and down dropped the old fellow he might be only shamming dead so i loaded and put a second ball through him he never budged all the rest ran off and my victory was complete  it would not be easy to describe my triumphant feelings on this great achievement i marched on with renovated spirit regarding myself as absolute lord of the forest as night drew near i prepared for camping my first care was to collect dry wood and make a roaring fire to cook and sleep by and to frighten off wolves and bears and panthers i then began to pluck my turkey for supper i had camped out several times in the early part of my expedition but that was in comparatively more settled and civilized regions where there were no wild animals of consequence in the forest this was my first camping out in the real wilderness and i was soon made sensible of the loneliness and wildness of my situation  in a little while a concert of wolves commenced there might have been a dozen or two but it seemed to me as if there were thousands i never heard such howling and whining having prepared my turkey i divided it into two parts thrust two sticks into one of the halves and planted them on end before the fire the hunters mode of roasting the smell of roast meat quickened the appetites of the wolves and their concert became truly infernal they seemed to be all around me but i could only now and then get a glimpse of one of them as he came within the glare of the light  i did not much care for the wolves who i knew to be a cowardly race but i had heard terrible stories of panthers and began to fear their stealthy prowlings in the surrounding darkness i was thirsty and heard a brook bubbling and tinkling along at no great distance but absolutely dared not go there lest some panther might lie in wait and spring upon me byandby a deer whistled i had never heard one before and thought it must be a panther i now felt uneasy lest he might climb the trees crawl along the branches overhead and plump down upon me so i kept my eyes fixed on the branches until my head ached i more than once thought i saw fiery eyes glaring down fromamong the leaves at length i thought of my supper and turned to see if my halfturkey was cooked in crowding so near the fire i had pressed the meat into the flames and it was consumed i had nothing to do but toast the other half and take better care of it on that half i made my supper without salt or bread i was still so possessed with the dread of panthers that i could not close my eyes all night but lay watching the trees until daybreak when all my fears were dispelled with the darkness and as i saw the morning sun sparkling down through the branches of the trees i smiled to think how i had suffered myself to be dismayed by sounds and shadows but i was a young woodsman and a stranger in kentucky  having breakfasted on the remainder of my turkey and slaked my thirst at the bubbling stream without further dread of panthers i resumed my wayfaring with buoyant feelings i again saw deer but as usual running running i tried in vain to get a shot at them and began to fear i never should i was gazing with vexation after a herd in full scamper when i was startled by a human voice turning round i saw a man at a short distance from me in a hunting dress  what are you after my lad cried he  those deer replied i pettishly but it seems as if they never stand still  upon that he burst out laughing where are you from said he  from richmond  what in old virginny  the same  and how on earth did you get here  i landed at green river from a broadhorn  and where are your companions   i have none  whatall alone  yes  where are you going  anywhere  and what have you come here for  to hunt  well said he laughingly youll make a real hunter theres no mistaking that have you killed anything  nothing but a turkey i cant get within shot of a deer they are always running  oh ill tell you the secret of that youre always pushing forward and starting the deer at a distance and gazing at those that are scampering but you must step as slow and silent and cautious as a cat and keep your eyes close around you and lurk from tree to tree if you wish to get a chance at deer but come go home with me my name is bill smithers i live not far off stay with me a little while and ill teach you how to hunt  i gladly accepted the invitation of honest bill smithers we soon reached his habitation a mere log hut with a square hole for a window and a chimney made of sticks and clay here he lived with a wife and child he had girdled the trees for an acre or two around preparatory to clearing a space for corn and potatoes in the meantime he maintained his family entirely by his rifle and i soon found him to be a firstrate huntsman under his tutelage i received my first effective lessons in woodcraft  the more i knew of a hunters life the more i relished it the country too which had been the promised land of my boyhood did not like most promised lands disappoint me no wilderness could be more beautiful than this part of kentucky in those times the forests were open and spacious with noble trees some of which looked as if they had stood for centuries there were beautiful prairies too diversified with groves and clumps of trees which looked like vast parks and in which you could see the deer running at a great distance in the proper season these prairies would be covered in many places with wild strawberries where your horses hoofs would be dyed to the fetlock i thought there could not be another place in the world equal to kentuckyand i think so still  after i had passed ten or twelve days with bill smithers i thought it time to shift my quarters for his house was scarce large enough for his own family and i had no idea of being an encumbrance to any one i accordingly made up my bundle shouldered my rifle took a friendly leave of smithers and his wife and set out in quest of a nimrod of the wilderness one john miller who lived alone nearly forty miles off and who i hoped would be well pleased to have a hunting companion  i soon found out that one of the most important items in woodcraft in a new country was the skill to find ones way in the wilderness there were no regular roads in the forests but they were cut up and perplexed by paths leading in all directions some of these were made by the cattle of the settlers and were called stocktracks but others had been made by the immense droves of buffaloes which roamed about the country from the flood until recent times these were called buffalotracks and traversed kentucky from end to end like highways traces of them may still be seen in uncultivated parts or deeply worn in the rocks where they crossed the mountains i was a young woodman and sorely puzzled to distinguish one kind of track from the other or to make out my course through this tangled labyrinth while thus perplexed i heard a distant roaring and rushing sound a gloom stole over the forest on looking up when i could catch a stray glimpse of the sky i beheld the clouds rolled up like balls the lower parts as black as ink there was now and then an explosion like a burst of cannonry afar off and the crash of a falling tree i had heard of hurricanes in the woods and surmised that one was at hand it soon came crashing its way the forest writhing and twisting and groaning before it the hurricane did not extend far on either side but in a manner plowed a furrow through the woodland snapping off or uprooting trees that had stood for centuries and filling the air with whirling branches i was directly in its course and took my stand behind an immense poplar six feet in diameter it bore for a time the full fury of the blast but at length began to yield seeing it falling i scrambled nimbly round the trunk like a squirrel down it went bearing down another tree with it i crept under the trunk as a shelter and was protected from other trees which fell around me but was sore all over from the twigs and branches driven against me by the blast  this was the only incident of consequence that occurred on my way to john millers where i arrived on the following day and was received by the veteran with the rough kindness of a backwoodsman he was a grayhaired man hardy and weatherbeaten with a blue wart like a great beard over one eye whence he was nicknamed by the hunters bluebeard miller he had been in these parts from the earliest settlements and had signalized himself in the hard conflicts with the indians which gained kentucky the appellation of the bloody ground in one of these fights he had had an arm broken in another he had narrowly escaped when hotly pursued by jumping from a precipice thirty feet high into a river  miller willingly received me into his house as an inmate and seemed pleased with the idea of making a hunter of me his dwelling was a small loghouse with a loft or garret of boards so that there was ample room for both of us under his instruction i soon made a tolerable proficiency in hunting my first exploit of any consequence was killing a bear i was hunting in company with two brothers when we came upon the track of bruin in a wood where there was an undergrowth of canes and grapevines he was scrambling up a tree when i shot him through the breast he fell to the ground and lay motionless the brothers sent in their dog who seized the bear by the throat bruin raised one arm and gave the dog a hug that crushed his ribs one yell and all was over i dont know which was first dead the dog or the bear the two brothers sat down and cried like children over their unfortunate dog yet they were mere rough huntsmen almost as wild and untamable as indians but they were fine fellows  by degrees i became known and somewhat of a favorite among the hunters of the neighborhood that is to say men who lived within a circle of thirty or forty miles and came occasionally to see john miller who was a patriarch among them they lived widely apart in log huts and wigwams almost with the simplicity of indians and wellnigh as destitute of the comforts and inventions of civilized life they seldom saw each other weeks and even months would elapse without their visiting when they did meet it was very much after the manner of indians loitering about all day without having much to say but becoming communicative as evening advanced and sitting up half the night before the fire telling hunting stories and terrible tales of the fights of the bloody ground  sometimes several would join in a distant hunting expedition or rather campaign expeditions of this kind lasted from november until april during which we laid up our stock of summer provisions we shifted our hunting camps from place to place according as we found the game they were generally pitched near a run of water and close by a canebrake to screen us from the wind one side of our lodge was open toward the fire our horses were hoppled and turned loose in the canebrakes with bells round their necks one of the party stayed at home to watch the camp prepare the meals and keep off the wolves the others hunted when a hunter killed a deer at a distance from the camp he would open it and take out the entrails then climbing a sapling he would bend it down tie the deer to the top and let it spring up again so as to suspend the carcass out of reach of the wolves at night he would return to the camp and give an account of his luck the next morning early he would get a horse out of the canebrake and bring home his game that day he would stay at home to cut up the carcass while the others hunted  our days were thus spent in silent and lonely occupations it was only at night that we would gather together before the fire and be sociable i was a novice and used to listen with open eyes and ears to the strange and wild stories told by the old hunters and believed everything i heard some of their stories bordered upon the supernatural they believed that their rifles might be spellbound so as not to be able to kill a buffalo even at armslength this superstition they had derived from the indians who often think the white hunters have laid a spell upon their rifles miller partook of this superstition and used to tell of his rifles having a spell upon it but it often seemed to me to be a shuffling way of accounting for a bad shot if a hunter grossly missed his aim he would ask who shot last with this rifleand hint that he must have charmed it the sure mode to disenchant the gun was to shoot a silver bullet out of it  by the opening of spring we would generally have quantities of bearsmeat and venison salted dried and smoked and numerous packs of skins we would then make the best of our way home from our distant huntinggrounds transporting our spoils sometimes in canoes along the rivers sometimes on horseback over land and our return would often be celebrated by feasting and dancing in true backwoods style i have given you some idea of our hunting let me now give you a sketch of our frolicking  it was on our return from a winters hunting in the neighborhood of green river when we received notice that there was to be a grand frolic at bob moselys to greet the hunters this bob mosely was a prime fellow throughout the country he was an indifferent hunter it is true and rather lazy to boot but then he could play the fiddle and that was enough to make him of consequence there was no other man within a hundred miles that could play the fiddle so there was no having a regular frolic without bob mosely the hunters therefore were always ready to give him a share of their game in exchange for his music and bob was always ready to get up a carousal whenever there was a party returning from a hunting expedition the present frolic was to take place at bob moselys own house which was on the pigeon roost fork of the muddy which is a branch of rough creek which is a branch of green river  everybody was agog for the revel at bob moselys and as all the fashion of the neighborhood was to be there i thought i must brush up for the occasion my leathern huntingdress which was the only one i had was somewhat the worse for wear it is true and considerably japanned with blood and grease but i was up to hunting expedients getting into a periogue i paddled off to a part of the green river where there was sand and clay that might serve for soap then taking off my dress i scrubbed and scoured it until i thought it looked very well i then put it on the end of a stick and hung it out of the periogue to dry while i stretched myself very comfortably on the green bank of the river unluckily a flaw struck the periogue and tipped over the stick down went my dress to the bottom of the river and i never saw it more here was i left almost in a state of nature i managed to make a kind of robinson crusoe garb of undressed skins with the hair on which enabled me to get home with decency but my dream of gayety and fashion was at an end for how could i think of figuring in high life at the pigeon roost equipped like a mere orson  old miller who really began to take some pride in me was confounded when he understood that i did not intend to go to bob moselys but when i told him my misfortune and that i had no dress by the powers cried he but you shall go and you shall be the best dressed and the best mounted lad there  he immediately set to work to cut out and make up a huntingshirt of dressed deerskin gayly fringed at the shoulders with leggings of the same fringed from hip to heel he then made me a rakish raccooncap with a flaunting tail to it mounted me on his best horse and i may say without vanity that i was one of the smartest fellows that figured on that occasion at the pigeon roost fork of the muddy  it was no small occasion either let me tell you bob moselys house was a tolerably large bark shanty with a clapboard roof and there were assembled all the young hunters and pretty girls of the country for many a mile round the young men were in their best huntingdresses but not one could compare with mine and my raccooncap with its flowing tail was the admiration of everybody the girls were mostly in doeskin dresses for there was no spinning and weaving as yet in the woods nor any need of it i never saw girls that seemed to me better dressed and i was somewhat of a judge having seen fashions at richmond we had a hearty dinner and a merry one for there was jemmy kiel famous for raccoonhunting and bob tarleton and wesley pigman and joe taylor and several other prime fellows for a frolic that made all ring again and laughed that you might have heard them a mile  after dinner we began dancing and were hard at it when about three oclock in the afternoon there was a new arrivalthe two daughters of old simon schultz two young ladies that affected fashion and late hours their arrival had nearly put an end to all our merriment i must go a little roundabout in my story to explain to you how that happened  as old schultz the father was one day looking in the canebrakes for his cattle he came upon the track of horses he knew they were none of his and that none of his neighbors had horses about that place they must be stray horses or must belong to some traveler who had lost his way as the track led nowhere he accordingly followed it up until he came to an unlucky peddler with two or three packhorses who had been bewildered among the cattletracks and had wandered for two or three days among woods and canebrakes until he was almost famished  old schultz brought him to his house fed him on venison bearsmeat and hominy and at the end of a week put him in prime condition the peddler could not sufficiently express his thankfulness and when about to depart inquired what he had to pay old schultz stepped back with surprise stranger said he you have been welcome under my roof ive given you nothing but wild meat and hominy because i had no better but have been glad of your company you are welcome to stay as long as you please but by zounds if any one offers to pay simon schultz for food he affronts him so saying he walked out in a huff  the peddler admired the hospitality of his host but could not reconcile it to his conscience to go away without making some recompense there were honest simons two daughters two strapping redhaired girls he opened his packs and displayed riches before them of which they had no conception for in those days there were no country stores in those parts with their artificial finery and trinketry and this was the first peddler that had wandered into that part of the wilderness the girls were for a time completely dazzled and knew not what to choose but what caught their eyes most were two lookingglasses about the size of a dollar set in gilt tin they had never seen the like before having used no other mirror than a pail of water the peddler presented them these jewels without the least hesitation nay he gallantly hung them round their necks by red ribbons almost as fine as the glasses themselves this done he took his departure leaving them as much astonished as two princesses in a fairy tale that have received a magic gift from an enchanter  it was with these lookingglasses hung round their necks as lockets by red ribbons that old schultzs daughters made their appearance at three oclock in the afternoon at the frolic at bob moselys on the pigeon roost fork of the muddy  by the powers but it was an event such a thing had never before been seen in kentucky bob tarleton a strapping fellow with a head like a chestnutburr and a look like a boar in an apple orchard stepped up caught hold of the lookingglass of one of the girls and gazing at it for a moment cried out joe taylor come here come here ill be darnd if patty schultz aint got a locket that you can see your face in as clear as in a spring of water  in a twinkling all the young hunters gathered round old schultzs daughters i who knew what lookingglasses were did not budge some of the girls who sat near me were excessively mortified at finding themselves thus deserted i heard peggy pugh say to sally pigman goodness knows its well schultzs daughters is got them things round their necks for its the first time the young men crowded round them  i saw immediately the danger of the case we were a small community and could not afford to be split up by feuds so i stepped up to the girls and whispered to them polly said i those lockets are powerful fine and become you amazingly but you dont consider that the country is not advanced enough in these parts for such things you and i understand these matters but these people dont fine things like these may do very well in the old settlements but they wont answer at the pigeon roost fork of the muddy you had better lay them aside for the present or we shall have no peace  polly and her sister luckily saw their error they took off the lockets laid them aside and harmony was restored otherwise i verily believe there would have been an end of our community indeed notwithstanding the great sacrifice they made on this occasion i do not think old schultzs daughters were ever much liked afterward among the young women  this was the first time that lookingglasses were ever seen in the green river part of kentucky  i had now lived some time with old miller and had become a tolerably expert hunter game however began to grow scarce the buffalo had gathered together as if by universal understanding and had crossed the mississippi never to return strangers kept pouring into the country clearing away the forests and building in all directions the hunters began to grow restive jemmy kiel the same of whom i have already spoken for his skill in raccoon catching came to me one day i cant stand this any longer said he were getting too thick here simon schultz crowds me so that i have no comfort of my life  why how you talk said i simon schultz lives twelve miles off  no matter his cattle run with mine and ive no idea of living where another mans cattle can run with mine thats too close neighborhood i want elbowroom this country too is growing too poor to live in theres no game so two or three of us have made up our minds to follow the buffalo to the missouri and we should like to have you of the party other hunters of my acquaintance talked in the same manner this set me thinking but the more i thought the more i was perplexed i had no one to advise with old miller and his associates knew but of one mode of life and i had had no experience in any other but i had a wide scope of thought when out hunting alone i used to forget the sport and sit for hours together on the trunk of a tree with rifle in hand buried in thought and debating with myself shall i go with jemmy kiel and his company or shall i remain here if i remain here there will soon be nothing left to hunt but am i to be a hunter all my life have not i something more in me than to be carrying a rifle on my shoulder day after day and dodging about after bears and deer and other brute beasts my vanity told me i had and i called to mind my boyish boast to my sister that i would never return home until i returned a member of congress from kentucky but was this the way to fit myself for such a station  various plans passed through my mind but they were abandoned almost as soon as formed at length i determined on becoming a lawyer true it is i knew almost nothing i had left school before i had learned beyond the rule of three never mind said i to myself resolutely i am a terrible fellow for hanging on to anything when ive once made up my mind and if a man has but ordinary capacity and will set to work with heart and soul and stick to it he can do almost anything with this maxim which has been pretty much my mainstay throughout life i fortified myself in my determination to attempt the law but how was i to set about it i must quit this forest life and go to one or other of the towns where i might be able to study and to attend the courts this too required funds i examined into the state of my finances the purse given me by my father had remained untouched in the bottom of an old chest up in the loft for money was scarcely needed in these parts i had bargained away the skins acquired in hunting for a horse and various other matters on which in case of need i could raise funds i therefore thought i could make shift to maintain myself until i was fitted for the bar  i informed my worthy host and patron old miller of my plan he shook his head at my turning my back upon the woods when i was in a fair way of making a firstrate hunter but he made no effort to dissuade me i accordingly set off in september on horseback intending to visit lexington frankfort and other of the principal towns in search of a favorable place to prosecute my studies my choice was made sooner than i expected i had put up one night at bardstown and found on inquiry that i could get comfortable board and accommodation in a private family for a dollar and a half a week i liked the place and resolved to look no further so the next morning i prepared to turn my face homeward and take my final leave of forest life  i had taken my breakfast and was waiting for my horse when in pacing up and down the piazza i saw a young girl seated near a window evidently a visitor she was very pretty with auburn hair and blue eyes and was dressed in white i had seen nothing of the kind since i had left richmond and at that time i was too much of a boy to be much struck by female charms she was so delicate and daintylooking so different from the hale buxom brown girls of the woods and then her white dressit was perfectly dazzling never was poor youth more taken by surprise and suddenly bewitched my heart yearned to know her but how was i to accost her i had grown wild in the woods and had none of the habitudes of polite life had she been like peggy pugh or sally pigman or any other of my leatherndressed belles of the pigeon roost i should have approached her without dread nay had she been as fair as schultzs daughters with their lookingglass lockets i should not have hesitated but that white dress and those auburn ringlets and blue eyes and delicate looks quite daunted while they fascinated me i dont know what put it into my head but i thought all at once that i would kiss her it would take a long acquaintance to arrive at such a boon but i might seize upon it by sheer robbery nobody knew me here i would just step in snatch a kiss mount my horse and ride off she would not be the worse for it and that kissoh i should die if i did not get it  i gave no time for the thought to cool but entered the house and stepped lightly into the room she was seated with her back to the door looking out at the window and did not hear my approach i tapped her chair and as she turned and looked up i snatched as sweet a kiss as ever was stolen and vanished in a twinkling the next moment i was on horseback galloping homeward my very ears tingling at what i had done  on my return home i sold my horse and turned everything to cash and found with the remains of the paternal purse that i had nearly four hundred dollars a little capital which i resolved to manage with the strictest economy  it was hard parting with old miller who had been like a father to me it cost me too something of a struggle to give up the free independent wildwood life i had hitherto led but i had marked out my course and had never been one to flinch or turn back  i footed it sturdily to bardstown took possession of the quarters for which i had bargained shut myself up and set to work with might and main to study but what a task i had before me i had everything to learn not merely law but all the elementary branches of knowledge i read and read for sixteen hours out of the fourandtwenty but the more i read the more i became aware of my own ignorance and shed bitter tears over my deficiency it seemed as if the wilderness of knowledge expanded and grew more perplexed as i advanced every height gained only revealed a wider region to be traversed and nearly filled me with despair i grew moody silent and unsocial but studied on doggedly and incessantly the only person with whom i held any conversation was the worthy man in whose house i was quartered he was honest and well meaning but perfectly ignorant and i believe would have liked me much better if i had not been so much addicted to reading he considered all books filled with lies and impositions and seldom could look into one without finding something to rouse his spleen nothing put him into a greater passion than the assertion that the world turned on its own axis every fourandtwenty hours he swore it was an outrage upon common sense why if it did said he there would not be a drop of water in the well by morning and all the milk and cream in the dairy would be turned topsyturvy and then to talk of the earth going round the sun how do they know it ive seen the sun rise every morning and set every evening for more than thirty years they must not talk to me about the earths going round the sun  at another time he was in a perfect fret at being told the distance between the sun and moon how can any one tell the distance cried he who surveyed it who carried the chain by jupiter they only talk this way before me to annoy me but then theres some people of sense who give in to this cursed humbug theres judge broadnax now one of the best lawyers we have isnt it surprising he should believe in such stuff why sir the other day i heard him talk of the distance from a star he called mars to the sun he must have got it out of one or other of those confounded books hes so fond of reading a book some impudent fellow has written who knew nobody could swear the distance was more or less  for my own part feeling my own deficiency in scientific lore i never ventured to unsettle his conviction that the sun made his daily circuit round the earth and for aught i said to the contrary he lived and died in that belief  i had been about a year at bardstown living thus studiously and reclusely when as i was one day walking the street i met two young girls in one of whom i immediately recalled the little beauty whom i had kissed so impudently she blushed up to the eyes and so did i but we both passed on with further sign of recognition this second glimpse of her however caused an odd fluttering about my heart i could not get her out of my thoughts for days she quite interfered with my studies i tried to think of her as a mere child but it would not do she had improved in beauty and was tending toward womanhood and then i myself was but little better than a stripling however i did not attempt to seek after her or even to find out who she was but returned doggedly to my books by degrees she faded from my thoughts or if she did cross them occasionally it was only to increase my despondency for i feared that with all my exertions i should never be able to fit myself for the bar or enable myself to support a wife  one cold stormy evening i was seated in dumpish mood in the barroom of the inn looking into the fire and turning over uncomfortable thoughts when i was accosted by some one who had entered the room without my perceiving it i looked up and saw before me a tall and as i thought pompouslooking man arrayed in small clothes and kneebuckles with powdered head and shoes nicely blacked and polished a style of dress unparalleled in those days in that rough country i took a pique against him from the very portliness of his appearance and stateliness of his manner and bristled up as he accosted me he demanded if my name was not ringwood  i was startled for i supposed myself perfectly incog but i answered in the affirmative  your family i believe lives in richmond  my gorge began to rise yes sir replied i sulkily my family does live in richmond  and what may i ask has brought you into this part of the country  zounds sir cried i starting on my feet what business is it of yours how dare you to question me in this manner  the entrance of some persons prevented a reply but i walked up and down the barroom fuming with conscious independence and insulted dignity while the pompouslooking personage who had thus trespassed upon my spleen retired without proffering another word  the next day while seated in my room some one tapped at the door and on being bid to enter the stranger in the powdered head smallclothes and shining shoes and buckles walked in with ceremonious courtesy  my boyish pride was again in arms but he subdued me he was formal but kind and friendly he knew my family and understood my situation and the dogged struggle i was making a little conversation when my jealous pride was once put to rest drew everything from me he was a lawyer of experience and of extensive practice and offered at once to take me with him and direct my studies the offer was too advantageous and gratifying not to be immediately accepted from that time i began to look up i was put into a proper track and was enabled to study to a proper purpose i made acquaintance too with some of the young men of the place who were in the same pursuit and was encouraged at finding that i could hold my own in argument with them we instituted a debating club in which i soon became prominent and popular men of talents engaged in other pursuits joined it and this diversified our subjects and put me on various tracks of inquiry ladies too attended some of our discussions and this gave them a polite tone and had an influence on the manners of the debaters my legal patron also may have had a favorable effect in correcting any roughness contracted in my hunters life he was calculated to bend me in an opposite direction for he was of the old school quoted chesterfield on all occasions and talked of sir charles grandison who was his beau ideal it was sir charles grandison however kentuckyized  i had always been fond of female society my experience however had hitherto been among the rough daughters of the backwoodsmen and i felt an awe of young ladies in store clothes and delicately brought up two or three of the married ladies of bardstown who had heard me at the debating club determined that i was a genius and undertook to bring me out i believe i really improved under their hands became quiet where i had been shy or sulky and easy where i had been impudent  i called to take tea one evening with one of these ladies when to my surprise and somewhat to my confusion i found with her the identical blueeyed little beauty whom i had so audaciously kissed i was formally introduced to her but neither of us betrayed any sign of previous acquaintance except by blushing to the eyes while tea was getting ready the lady of the house went out of the room to give some directions and left us alone  heavens and earth what a situation i would have given all the pittance i was worth to have been in the deepest dell of the forest i felt the necessity of saying something in excuse of my former rudeness but i could not conjure up an idea nor utter a word every moment matters were growing worse i felt at one time tempted to do as i had done when i robbed her of the kiss bolt from the room and take to flight but i was chained to the spot for i really longed to gain her goodwill  at length i plucked up courage on seeing that she was equally confused with myself and walking desperately up to her i exclaimed  i have been trying to muster up something to say to you but i cannot i feel that i am in a horrible scrape do have pity on me and help me out of it  a smile dimpled about her mouth and played among the blushes of her cheek she looked up with a shy but arch glance of the eye that expressed a volume of comic recollection we both broke into a laugh and from that moment all went on well  a few evenings afterward i met her at a dance and prosecuted the acquaintance i soon became deeply attached to her paid my court regularly and before i was nineteen years of age had engaged myself to marry her i spoke to her mother a widow lady to ask her consent she seemed to demur upon which with my customary haste i told her there would be no use in opposing the match for if her daughter chose to have me i would take her in defiance of her family and the whole world  she laughed and told me i need not give myself any uneasiness there would be no unreasonable opposition she knew my family and all about me the only obstacle was that i had no means of supporting a wife and she had nothing to give with her daughter  no matter at that moment everything was bright before me i was in one of my sanguine moods i feared nothing doubted nothing so it was agreed that i should prosecute my studies obtain a license and as soon as i should be fairly launched in business we would be married  i now prosecuted my studies with redoubled ardor and was up to my ears in law when i received a letter from my father who had heard of me and my whereabout he applauded the course i had taken but advised me to lay a foundation of general knowledge and offered to defray my expenses if i would go to college i felt the want of a general education and was staggered with this offer it militated somewhat against the selfdependent course i had so proudly or rather conceitedly marked out for myself but it would enable me to enter more advantageously upon my legal career i talked over the matter with the lovely girl to whom i was engaged she sided in opinion with my father and talked so disinterestedly yet tenderly that if possible i loved her more than ever i reluctantly therefore agreed to go to college for a couple of years though it must necessarily postpone our union  scarcely had i formed this resolution when her mother was taken ill and died leaving her without a protector this again altered all my plans i felt as if i could protect her i gave up all idea of collegiate studies persuaded myself that by dint of industry and application i might overcome the deficiencies of education and resolved to take out a license as soon as possible  that very autumn i was admitted to the bar and within a month afterward was married we were a young couple she not much above sixteen i not quite twenty and both almost without a dollar in the world the establishment which we set up was suited to our circumstances a loghouse with two small rooms a bed a table a half dozen chairs a half dozen knives and forks a half dozen spoons everything by half dozens a little delf ware everything in a small way we were so poor but then so happy  we had not been married many days when court was held at a county town about twentyfive miles distant it was necessary for me to go there and put myself in the way of business but how was i to go i had expended all my means on our establishment and then it was hard parting with my wife so soon after marriage however go i must money must be made or we should soon have the wolf at the door i accordingly borrowed a horse and borrowed a little cash and rode off from my door leaving my wife standing at it and waving her hand after me her last look so sweet and beaming went to my heart i felt as if i could go through fire and water for her  i arrived at the county town on a cool october evening the inn was crowded for the court was to commence on the following day i knew no one and wondered how i a stranger and a mere youngster was to make my way in such a crowd and to get business the public room was thronged with the idlers of the country who gather together on such occasions there was some drinking going forward with much noise and a little altercation just as i entered the room i saw a rough bully of a fellow who was partly intoxicated strike an old man he came swaggering by me and elbowed me as he passed i immediately knocked him down and kicked him into the street i needed no better introduction in a moment i had a dozen rough shakes of the hand and invitations to drink and found myself quite a personage in this rough assembly  the next morning the court opened i took my seat among the lawyers but felt as a mere spectator not having a suit in progress or prospect nor having any idea where business was to come from in the course of the morning a man was put at the bar charged with passing counterfeit money and was asked if he was ready for trial he answered in the negative he had been confined in a place where there were no lawyers and had not had an opportunity of consulting any he was told to choose counsel from the lawyers present and to be ready for trial on the following day he looked round the court and selected me i was thunderstruck i could not tell why he should make such a choice i a beardless youngster unpracticed at the bar perfectly unknown i felt diffident yet delighted and could have hugged the rascal  before leaving the court he gave me one hundred dollars in a bag as a retaining fee i could scarcely believe my senses it seemed like a dream the heaviness of the fee spoke but lightly in favor of his innocence but that was no affair of mine i was to be advocate not judge nor jury i followed him to jail and learned from him all the particulars of his case from thence i went to the clerks office and took minutes of the indictment i then examined the law on the subject and prepared my brief in my room all this occupied me until midnight when i went to bed and tried to sleep it was all in vain never in my life was i more wideawake a host of thoughts and fancies kept rushing through my mind the shower of gold that had so unexpectedly fallen into my lap the idea of my poor little wife at home that i was to astonish with my good fortune but then the awful responsibility i had undertakento speak for the first time in a strange court the expectations the culprit had evidently formed of my talents all these and a crowd of similar notions kept whirling through my mind i tossed about all night fearing the morning would find me exhausted and incompetent in a word the day dawned on me a miserable fellow  i got up feverish and nervous i walked out before breakfast striving to collect my thoughts and tranquilize my feelings it was a bright morning the air was pure and frosty i bathed my forehead and my hands in a beautiful running stream but i could not allay the fever heat that raged within i returned to breakfast but could not eat a single cup of coffee formed my repast it was time to go to court and i went there with a throbbing heart i believe if it had not been for the thoughts of my little wife in her lonely log house i should have given back to the man his hundred dollars and relinquished the cause i took my seat looking i am convinced more like a culprit than the rogue i was to defend  when the time came for me to speak my heart died within me i rose embarrassed and dismayed and stammered in opening my cause i went on from bad to worse and felt as if i was going down hill just then the public prosecutor a man of talents but somewhat rough in his practice made a sarcastic remark on something i had said it was like an electric spark and ran tingling through every vein in my body in an instant my diffidence was gone my whole spirit was in arms i answered with promptness and bitterness for i felt the cruelty of such an attack upon a novice in my situation the public prosecutor made a kind of apology this from a man of his redoubted powers was a vast concession i renewed my argument with a fearless glow carried the case through triumphantly and the man was acquitted  this was the making of me everybody was curious to know who this new lawyer was that had thus suddenly risen among them and bearded the attorneygeneral at the very outset the story of my debut at the inn on the preceding evening when i had knocked down a bully and kicked him out of doors for striking an old man was circulated with favorable exaggerations even my very beardless chin and juvenile countenance were in my favor for people gave me far more credit than i really deserved the chance business which occurs in our country courts came thronging upon me i was repeatedly employed in other causes and by saturday night when the court closed and i had paid my bill at the inn i found myself with a hundred and fifty dollars in silver three hundred dollars in notes and a horse that i afterward sold for two hundred dollars more  never did miser gloat on his money with more delight i locked the door of my room piled the money in a heap upon the table walked round it sat with my elbows on the table and my chin upon my hands and gazed upon it was i thinking of the money no i was thinking of my little wife at home another sleepless night ensued but what a night of golden fancies and splendid aircastle as soon as morning dawned i was up mounted the borrowed horse with which i had come to court and led the other which i had received as a fee all the way i was delighting myself with the thoughts of the surprise i had in store for my little wife for both of us had expected nothing but that i should spend all the money i had borrowed and should return in debt  our meeting was joyous as you may suppose but i played the part of the indian hunter who when he returns from the chase never for a time speaks of his success she had prepared a snug little rustic meal for me and while it was getting ready i seated myself at an oldfashioned desk in one corner and began to count over my money and put it away she came to me before i had finished and asked who i had collected the money for  for myself to be sure replied i with affected coolness i made it at court  she looked me for a moment in the face incredulously i tried to keep my countenance and to play indian but it would not do my muscles began to twitch my feelings all at once gave way i caught her in my arms laughed cried and danced about the room like a crazy man from that time forward we never wanted for money  i had not been long in successful practice when i was surprised one day by a visit from my woodland patron old miller the tidings of my prosperity had reached him in the wilderness and he had walked one hundred and fifty miles on foot to see me by that tame i had improved my domestic establishment and had all things comfortable about me he looked around him with a wondering eye at what he considered luxuries and superfluities but supposed they were all right in my altered circumstances he said he did not know upon the whole but that i had acted for the best it is true if game had continued plenty it would have been a folly for me to quit a hunters life but hunting was pretty nigh done up in kentucky the buffalo had gone to missouri the elk were nearly gone also deer too were growing scarce they might last out his time as he was growing old but they were not worth setting up life upon he had once lived on the borders of virginia game grew scarce there he followed it up across kentucky and now it was again giving him the slip but he was too old to follow it further  he remained with us three days my wife did everything in her power to make him comfortable but at the end of that time he said he must be off again to the woods he was tired of the village and of having so many people about him he accordingly returned to the wilderness and to hunting life but i fear he did not make a good end of it for i understand that a few years before his death he married sukey thomas who lived at the white oak run     the seminoles   from the time of the chimerical cruising of old ponce de leon in search of the fountain of youth the avaricious expedition of pamphilo de narvaez in quest of gold and the chivalrous enterprise of hernando de soto to discover and conquer a second mexico the natives of florida have been continually subjected to the invasions and encroachments of white men they have resisted them perseveringly but fruitlessly and are now battling amid swamps and morasses for the last foothold of their native soil with all the ferocity of despair can we wonder at the bitterness of a hostility that has been handed down from father to son for upward of three centuries and exasperated by the wrongs and miseries of each succeeding generation the very name of the savages with which we are fighting betokens their fallen and homeless condition formed of the wrecks of once powerful tribes and driven from their ancient seats of prosperity and dominion they are known by the name of the seminoles or wanderers  bartram who traveled through florida in the latter part of the last century speaks of passing through a great extent of ancient indian fields now silent and deserted overgrown with forests orange groves and rank vegetation the site of the ancient alachua the capital of a famous and powerful tribe who in days of old could assemble thousands at bullplay and other athletic exercises over these then happy fields and green plains almost every step we take adds he over these fertile heights discovers the remains and traces of ancient human habitations and cultivation  about the year 1763 when florida was ceded by the spaniards to the english we are told that the indians generally retired from the towns and the neighborhood of the whites and burying themselves in the deep forests intricate swamps and hommocks and vast savannas of the interior devoted themselves to a pastoral life and the rearing of horses and cattle these are the people that received the name of the seminoles or wanderers which they still retain  bartram gives a pleasing picture of them at the time he visited them in their wilderness where their distance from the abodes of the white man gave them a transient quiet and security this handful of people says he possesses a vast territory all east and the greatest part of west florida which being naturally cut and divided into thousands of islets knolls and eminences by the innumerable rivers lakes swamps vast savannas and ponds form so many secure retreats and temporary dwellingplaces that effectually guard them from any sudden invasions or attacks from their enemies and being such a swampy hommocky country furnishes such a plenty and variety of supplies for the nourishment of varieties of animals that i can venture to assert that no part of the globe so abounds with wild game or creatures fit for the food of man  thus they enjoy a superabundance of the necessaries and conveniences of life with the security of person and property the two great concerns of mankind the hides of deer bears tigers and wolves together with honey wax and other productions of the country purchase their clothing equipage and domestic utensils from the whites they seem to be free from want or desires no cruel enemy to dread nothing to give them disquietude but the gradual encroachments of the white people thus contented and undisturbed they appear as blithe and free as the birds of the air and like them as volatile and active tuneful and vociferous the visage action and deportment of the seminoles form the most striking picture of happiness in this life joy contentment love and friendship without guile or affectation seem inherent in them or predominant in their vital principle for it leaves them with but the last breath of life they are fond of games and gambling and amuse themselves like children in relating extravagant stories to cause surprise and mirth footnote bartrams travels in north america  the same writer gives an engaging picture of his treatment by these savages  soon after entering the forests we were met in the path by a small company of indians smiling and beckoning to us long before we joined them this was a family of talahasochte who had been out on a hunt and were returning home loaded with barbecued meat hides and honey their company consisted of the man his wife and children well mounted on fine horses with a number of packhorses the man offered us a fawn skin of honey which i accepted and at parting presented him with some fishhooks sewingneedles etc  on our return to camp in the evening we were saluted by a party of young indian warriors who had pitched their tents on a green eminence near the lake at a small distance from our camp under a little grove of oaks and palms this company consisted of seven young seminoles under the conduct of a young prince or chief of talahasochte a town southward in the isthmus they were all dressed and painted with singular elegance and richly ornamented with silver plates chains etc after the seminole mode with waving plumes of feathers on their crests on our coming up to them they arose and shook hands we alighted and sat a while with them by their cheerful fire  the young prince informed our chief that he was in pursuit of a young fellow who had fled from the town carrying off with him one of his favorite young wives he said merrily he would have the ears of both of them before he returned he was rather above the middle stature and the most perfect human figure i ever saw of an amiable engaging countenance air and deportment free and familiar in conversation yet retaining a becoming gracefulness and dignity we arose took leave of them and crossed a little vale covered with a charming green turf already illuminated by the soft light of the full moon  soon after joining our companions at camp our neighbors the prince and his associates paid us a visit we treated them with the best fare we had having till this time preserved our spirituous liquors they left us with perfect cordiality and cheerfulness wishing us a good repose and retired to their own camp having a band of music with them consisting of a drum flutes and a rattlegourd they entertained us during the night with their music vocal and instrumental  there is a languishing softness and melancholy air in the indian convivial songs especially of the amorous class irresistibly moving attention and exquisitely pleasing especially in their solitary recesses when all nature is silent  travelers who have been among them in more recent times before they had embarked in their present desperate struggle represent them in much the same light as leading a pleasant indolent life in a climate that required little shelter or clothing and where the spontaneous fruits of the earth furnished subsistence without toil a cleanly race delighting in bathing passing much of their time under the shade of their trees with heaps of oranges and other fine fruits for their refreshment talking laughing dancing and sleeping every chief had a fan hanging to his side made of feathers of the wild turkey the beautiful pinkcolored crane or the scarlet flamingo with this he would sit and fan himself with great stateliness while the young people danced before him the women joined in the dances with the men excepting the wardances they wore strings of tortoiseshells and pebbles round their legs which rattled in cadence to the music they were treated with more attention among the seminoles than among most indian tribes     origin of the white the red and the black men  a seminole tradition   when the floridas were erected into a territory of the united states one of the earliest cares of the governor william p duval was directed to the instruction and civilization of the natives for this purpose he called a meeting of the chiefs in which he informed them of the wish of their great father at washington that they should have schools and teachers among them and that their children should be instructed like the children of white men the chiefs listened with their customary silence and decorum to a long speech setting forth the advantages that would accrue to them from this measure and when he had concluded begged the interval of a day to deliberate on it  on the following day a solemn convocation was held at which one of the chiefs addressed the governor in the name of all the rest my brother said he we have been thinking over the proposition of our great father at washington to send teachers and set up schools among us we are very thankful for the interest be takes in our welfare but after much deliberation have concluded to decline his offer what will do very well for white men will not do for red men i know you white men say we all come from the same father and mother but you are mistaken we have a tradition handed down from our forefathers and we believe it that the great spirit when he undertook to make men made the black man it was his first attempt and pretty well for a beginning but he soon saw he had bungled so he determined to try his hand again he did so and made the red man he liked him much better than the black man but still he was not exactly what he wanted so he tried once more and made the white man and then he was satisfied you see therefore that you were made last and that is the reason i call you my youngest brother  when the great spirit had made the three men he called them together and showed them three boxes the first was filled with books and maps and papers the second with bows and arrows knives and tomahawks the third with spades axes hoes and hammers these my sons said he are the means by which you are to live choose among them according to your fancy  the white man being the favorite had the first choice he passed by the box of workingtools without notice but when he came to the weapons for war and hunting he stopped and looked hard at them the red man trembled for he had set his heart upon that box the white man however after looking upon it for a moment passed on and chose the box of books and papers the red mans turn came next and you may be sure he seized with joy upon the bows and arrows and tomahawks as to the black man he had no choice left but to put up with the box of tools  from this it is clear that the great spirit intended the white man should learn to read and write to understand all about the moon and stars and to make everything even rum and whisky that the red man should be a firstrate hunter and a mighty warrior but he was not to learn anything from books as the great spirit had not given him any nor was he to make rum and whisky lest he should kill himself with drinking as to the black man as he had nothing but workingtools it was clear he was to work for the white and red man which he has continued to do  we must go according to the wishes of the great spirit or we shall get into trouble to know how to read and write is very good for white men but very bad for red men it makes white men better but red men worse some of the creeks and cherokees learned to read and write and they are the greatest rascals among all the indians they went on to washington and said they were going to see their great father to talk about the good of the nation and when they got there they all wrote upon a little piece of paper without the nation at home knowing anything about it and the first thing the nation at home knew of the matter they were called together by the indian agent who showed them a little piece of paper which he told them was a treaty which their brethren had made in their name with their great father at washington and as they knew not what a treaty was he held up the little piece of paper and they looked under it and lo it covered a great extent of country and they found that their brethren by knowing how to read and write had sold their houses and their lands and the graves of their fathers and that the white man by knowing how to read and write had gained them tell our great father at washington therefore that we are very sorry we cannot receive teachers among us for reading and writing though very good for white men is very bad for the indians     the conspiracy of neamathla  an authentic sketch   in the autumn of 1823 governor duval and other commissioners on the part of the united states concluded a treaty with the chiefs and warriors of the florida indians by which the latter for certain considerations ceded all claims to the whole territory excepting a district in the eastern part to which they were to remove and within which they were to reside for twenty years several of the chiefs signed the treaty with great reluctance but none opposed it more strongly than neamathla principal chief of the mickasookies a fierce and warlike people many of them creeks by origin who lived about the mickasookie lake neamathla had always been active in those depredations on the frontiers of georgia which had brought vengeance and ruin on the seminoles he was a remarkable man upward of sixty years of age about six feet high with a fine eye and a strongly marked countenance over which he possessed great command his hatred of the white men appeared to be mixed with contempt on the common people he looked down with infinite scorn he seemed unwilling to acknowledge any superiority of rank or dignity in governor duval claiming to associate with him on terms of equality as two great chieftains though he had been prevailed upon to sign the treaty his heart revolted at it in one of his frank conversations with governor duval he observed this country belongs to the red man and if i had the number of warriors at my command that this nation once had i would not leave a white man on my lands i would exterminate the whole i can say this to you for you can understand me you are a man but i would not say it to your people theyd cry out i was a savage and would take my life they cannot appreciate the feelings of a man that loves his country  as florida had but recently been erected into a territory everything as yet was in rude and simple style the governor to make himself acquainted with the indians and to be near at hand to keep an eye upon them fixed his residence at tallahassee near the fowel towns inhabited by the mickasookies his government palace for a time was a mere log house and he lived on hunters fare the village of neamathla was but about three miles off and thither the governor occasionally rode to visit the old chieftain in one of these visits he found neamathla seated in his wigwam in the center of the village surrounded by his warriors the governor had brought him some liquor as a present but it mounted quickly into his brain and rendered him quite boastful and belligerent the theme ever uppermost in his mind was the treaty with the whites it was true he said the red men had made such a treaty but the white men had not acted up to it the red men had received none of the money and the cattle that had been promised them the treaty therefore was at an end and they did not mean to be bound by it  governor duval calmly represented to him that the time appointed in the treaty for the payment and delivery of the money and the cattle had not yet arrived this the old chieftain knew full well but he chose for the moment to pretend ignorance he kept on drinking and talking his voice growing louder and louder until it resounded all over the village he held in his hand a long knife with which he had been rasping tobacco this he kept flourishing backward and forward as he talked by way of giving effect to his words brandishing it at times within an inch of the governors throat he concluded his tirade by repeating that the country belonged to the red men and that sooner than give it up his bones and the bones of his people should bleach upon its soil  duval saw that the object of all this bluster was to see whether he could be intimidated he kept his eye therefore fixed steadily on the chief and the moment he concluded with his menace seized him by the bosom of his hunting shirt and clinching his other fist  ive heard what you have said replied he you have made a treaty yet you say your bones shall bleach before you comply with it as sure as there is a sun in heaven your bones shall bleach if you do not fulfill every article of that treaty i ill let you know that i am first here and will see that you do your duty  upon this the old chieftain threw himself back burst into a fit of laughing and declared that all he had said was in joke the governor suspected however that there was a grave meaning at the bottom of this jocularity  for two months everything went on smoothly the indians repaired daily to the logcabin palace of the governor at tallahassee and appeared perfectly contented all at once they ceased their visits and for three or four days not one was to be seen governor duval began to apprehend that some mischief was brewing on the evening of the fourth day a chief named yellowhair a resolute intelligent fellow who had always evinced an attachment for the governor entered his cabin about twelve oclock at night and informed him that between four and five hundred warriors painted and decorated were assembled to hold a secret wartalk at neamathlas town he had slipped off to give intelligence at the risk of his life and hastened back lest his absence should be discovered  governor duval passed an anxious night after this intelligence he knew the talent and the daring character of neamathla he recollected the threats he had thrown out he reflected that about eighty white families were scattered widely apart over a great extent of country and might be swept away at once should the indians as he feared determine to clear the country that he did not exaggerate the dangers of the case has been proved by the horrid scenes of indian warfare that have since desolated that devoted region after a night of sleepless cogitation duval determined on a measure suited to his prompt and resolute character knowing the admiration of the savages for personal courage he determined by a sudden surprise to endeavor to overawe and check them it was hazarding much but where so many lives were in jeopardy he felt bound to incur the hazard  accordingly on the next morning he set off on horseback attended merely by a white man who had been reared among the seminoles and understood their language and manners and who acted as interpreter they struck into an indian trail leading to neamathlas village after proceeding about half a mile governor duval informed the interpreter of the object of his expedition the latter though a bold man paused and remonstrated the indians among whom they were going were among the most desperate and discontented of the nation many of them were veteran warriors impoverished and exasperated by defeat and ready to set their lives at any hazard he said that if they were holding a war council it must be with desperate intent and it would be certain death to intrude among them  duval made light of his apprehensions he said he was perfectly well acquainted with the indian character and should certainly proceed so saying he rode on when within half a mile of the village the interpreter addressed him again in such a tremulous tone that duval turned and looked him in the face he was deadly pale and once more urged the governor to return as they would certainly be massacred if they proceeded  duval repeated his determination to go on but advised the other to return lest his pale face should betray fear to the indians and they might take advantage of it the interpreter replied that he would rather die a thousand deaths than have it said he had deserted his leader when in peril  duval then told him he must translate faithfully all he should say to the indians without softening a word the interpreter promised faithfully to do so adding that he well knew when they were once in the town nothing but boldness could save them  they now rode into the village and advanced to the council house this was rather a group of four houses forming a square in the center of which was a great councilfire the houses were open in front toward the fire and closed in the rear at each corner of the square there was an interval between the houses for ingress and egress in these houses sat the old men and the chiefs the young men were gathered round the fire neamathla presided at the council elevated on a higher seat than the rest  governor duval entered by one of the corner intervals and rode boldly into the center of the square the young men made way for him an old man who was speaking paused in the midst of his harangue in an instant thirty or forty rifles were cocked and leveled never had duval heard so loud a click of triggers it seemed to strike on his heart he gave one glance at the indians and turned off with an air of contempt he did not dare he says to look again lest it might affect his nerves and on the firmness of his nerves everything depended  the chief threw up his arm the rifles were lowered duval breathed more freely he felt disposed to leap from his horse but restrained himself and dismounted leisurely he then walked deliberately up to neamathla and demanded in an authoritative tone what were his motives for holding that council the moment he made this demand the orator sat down the chief made no reply but hung his head in apparent confusion after a moments pause duval proceeded  i am well aware of the meaning of this warcouncil and deem it my duty to warn you against prosecuting the schemes you have been devising if a single hair of a white man in this country falls to the ground i will hang you and your chiefs on the trees around your council house you cannot pretend to withstand the power of the white men you are in the palm of the hand of your great father at washington who can crush you like an eggshell you may kill me i am but one man but recollect white men are numerous as the leaves on the trees remember the fate of your warriors whose bones are whitening in battlefields remember your wives and children who perished in swamps do you want to provoke more hostilities another war with the white men and there will not be a seminole left to tell the story of his race  seeing the effect of his words he concluded by appointing a day for the indians to meet him at st marks and give an account of their conduct he then rode off without giving them time to recover from their surprise that night he rode forty miles to apalachicola river to the tribe of the same name who were in feud with the seminoles they promptly put two hundred and fifty warriors at his disposal whom he ordered to be at st marks at the appointed day he sent out runners also and mustered one hundred of the militia to repair to the same place together with a number of regulars from the army all his arrangements were successful  having taken these measures he returned to tallahassee to the neighborhood of the conspirators to show them that he was not afraid here he ascertained through yellowhair that nine towns were disaffected and had been concerned in the conspiracy he was careful to inform himself from the same source of the names of the warriors in each of those towns who were most popular though poor and destitute of rank and command  when the appointed day was at hand for the meeting at st marks governor duval set off with neamathla who was at the head of eight or nine hundred warriors but who feared to venture into the fort without him as they entered the fort and saw troops and militia drawn up there and a force of apalachicola soldiers stationed on the opposite bank of the river they thought they were betrayed and were about to fly but duval assured them they were safe and that when the talk was over they might go home unmolested  a grand talk was now held in which the late conspiracy was discussed as he had foreseen neamathla and the other old chiefs threw all the blame upon the young men well replied duval with us white men when we find a man incompetent to govern those under him we put him down and appoint another in his place now as you all acknowledge you cannot manage your young men we must put chiefs over them who can  so saying he deposed neamathla first appointing another in his place and so on with all the rest taking care to substitute the warriors who had been pointed out to him as poor and popular putting medals round their necks and investing them with great ceremony the indians were surprised and delighted at finding the appointments fall upon the very men they would themselves have chosen and hailed them with acclamations the warriors thus unexpectedly elevated to command and clothed with dignity were secured to the interests of the governor and sure to keep an eye on the disaffected as to the great chief neamathla he left the country in disgust and returned to the creek nation who elected him a chief of one of their towns thus by the resolute spirit and prompt sagacity of one man a dangerous conspiracy was completely defeated governor duval was afterward enabled to remove the whole nation through his own personal influence without the aid of the general government  to the editor of the knickerbocker  sirthe following letter was scribbled to a friend during my sojourn in the alhambra in 1828 as it presents scenes and impressions noted down at the time i venture to offer it for the consideration of your readers should it prove acceptable i may from tune to time give other letters written in the course of my various ramblings and which have been kindly restored to me by my friends  yours g c     letter from granada  granada 1828   my dear religious festivals furnish in all catholic countries occasions of popular pageant and recreation but in none more so than in spain where the great end of religion seems to be to create holidays and ceremonials for two days past granada has been in a gay turmoil with the great annual fete of corpus christi this most eventful and romantic city as you well know has ever been the rallying point of a mountainous region studded with small towns and villages hither during the time that granada was the splendid capital of a moorish kingdom the moslem youth repaired from all points to participate in chivalrous festivities and hither the spanish populace at the present day throng from all parts of the surrounding country to attend the festivals of the church  as the populace like to enjoy things from the very commencement the stir of corpus christ began in granada on the preceding evening before dark the gates of the city were thronged with the picturesque peasantry from the mountain villages and the brown laborers from the vega or vast fertile plain as the evening advanced the vivarambla thickened and swarmed with a motley multitude this is the great square in the center of the city famous for tilts and tourneys during the times of moorish domination and incessantly mentioned in all the old moorish ballads of love and chivalry for several days the hammer had resounded throughout this square a gallery of wood had been erected all round it forming a covered way for the grand procession of corpus christi on this eve of the ceremonial this gallery was a fashionable promenade it was brilliantly illuminated bands of music were stationed in balconies on the four sides of the square and all the fashion and beauty of granada and all its population that could boast a little finery of apparel together with the majos and majas the beaux and belles of the villages in their gay andalusian costumes thronged this covered walk anxious to see and to be seen as to the sturdy peasantry of the vega and such of the mountaineers as did not pretend to display but were content with hearty enjoyment they swarmed in the center of the square some in groups listening to the guitar and the traditional ballad some dancing their favorite bolero some seated on the ground making a merry though frugal supper and some stretched out for their nights repose  the gay crowd of the gallery dispersed gradually toward midnight but the center of the square resembled the bivouac of an army for hundreds of the peasantry men women and children passed the night there sleeping soundly on the bare earth under the open canopy of heaven a summers night requires no shelter in this genial climate and with a great part of the hardy peasantry of spain a bed is a superfluity which many of them never enjoy and which they affect to despise the common spaniard spreads out his manta or mulecloth or wraps himself in his cloak and lies on the ground with his saddle for a pillow  the next morning i revisited the square at sunrise it was still strewed with groups of sleepers some were reposing from the dance and revel of the evening others had left their villages after work on the preceding day and having trudged on foot the greater part of the night were taking a sound sleep to freshen them for the festivities of the day numbers from the mountains and the remote villages of the plain who had set out in the night continued to arrive with their wives and children all were in high spirits greeting each other and exchanging jokes and pleasantries the gay tumult thickened as the day advanced now came pouring in at the city gates and parading through the streets the deputations from the various villages destined to swell the grand procession these village deputations were headed by their priests bearing their respective crosses and banners and images of the blessed virgin and of patron saints all which were matters of great rivalship and jealousy among the peasantry it was like the chivalrous gatherings of ancient days when each town and village sent its chiefs and warriors and standards to defend the capital or grace its festivities  at length all these various detachments congregated into one grand pageant which slowly paraded round the vivarambla and through the principal streets where every window and balcony was hung with tapestry in this procession were all the religious orders the civil and military authorities and the chief people of the parishes and villages every church and convent had contributed its banners its images its relics and poured forth its wealth for the occasion in the center of the procession walked the archbishop under a damask canopy and surrounded by inferior dignitaries and their dependents the whole moved to the swell and cadence of numerous bands of music and passing through the midst of a countless yet silent multitude proceeded onward to the cathedral  i could not but be struck with the changes of times and customs as i saw this monkish pageant passing through the vivarambla the ancient seat of moslem pomp and chivalry the contrast was indeed forced upon the mind by the decorations of the square the whole front of the wooden gallery erected for the procession extending several hundred feet was faced with canvas on which some humble though patriotic artist had painted by contract a series of the principal scenes and exploits of the conquest as recorded in chronicle and romance it is thus the romantic legends of granada mingle themselves with everything and are kept fresh in the public mind another great festival at granada answering in its popular character to our fourth of july is el dia de la toma the day of the capture that is to say the anniversary of the capture of the city by ferdinand and isabella on this day all granada is abandoned to revelry the alarmbell on the terre de la campana or watchtower of the alhambra keeps up a clangor from morn till night and happy is the damsel that can ring that bell it is a charm to secure a husband in the course of the year  the sound which can be heard over the whole vega and to the top of the mountains summons the peasantry to the festivities throughout the day the alhambra is thrown open to the public the halls and courts of the moorish monarchs resound with the guitar and castanet and gay groups in the fanciful dresses of andalusia perform those popular dances which they have inherited from the moors  in the meantime a grand procession moves through the city the banner of ferdinand and isabella that precious relic of the conquest is brought forth from its depository and borne by the alferez mayor or grand standardbearer through the principal streets the portable campaltar which was carried about with them in all their campaigns is transported into the chapel royal and placed before their sepulcher where their effigies lie in monumental marble the procession fills the chapel high mass is performed in memory of the conquest and at a certain part of the ceremony the alferez mayor puts on his hat and waves the standard above the tomb of the conquerors  a more whimsical memorial of the conquest is exhibited on the same evening at the theater where a popular drama is performed entitled ave maria this turns on the oftsung achievement of hernando del pulgar surnamed el de las hazanas he of the exploits the favorite hero of the populace of granada  during the time that ferdinand and isabella besieged the city the young moorish and spanish knights vied with each other in extravagant bravadoes on one occasion hernando del pulgar at the head of a handful of youthful followers made a dash into granada at the dead of night nailed the inscription of ave maria with his dagger to the gate of the principal mosque as a token of having consecrated it to the virgin and effected his retreat in safety  while the moorish cavaliers admired this daring exploit they felt bound to revenge it on the following day therefore tarfe one of the stoutest of the infidel warriors paraded in front of the christian army dragging the sacred inscription of ave maria at his horses tail the cause of the virgin was eagerly vindicated by garcilaso de la vega who slew the moor in single combat and elevated the inscription of ave maria in devotion and triumph at the end of his lance  the drama founded on this exploit is prodigiously popular with the common people although it has been acted time out of mind and the people have seen it repeatedly it never fails to draw crowds and so completely to engross the feelings of the audience as to have almost the effect on them of reality when their favorite pulgar strides about with many a mouthy speech in the very midst of the moorish capital he is cheered with enthusiastic bravoes and when he nails the tablet of ave maria to the door of the mosque the theater absolutely shakes with shouts and thunders of applause on the other hand the actors who play the part of the moors have to bear the brunt of the temporary indignation of their auditors and when the infidel tarfe plucks down the tablet to tie it to his horses tail many of the people absolutely rise in fury and are ready to jump upon the stage to revenge this insult to the virgin  besides this annual festival at the capital almost every village of the vega and the mountains has its own anniversary wherein its own deliverance from the moorish yoke is celebrated with uncouth ceremony and rustic pomp  on these occasions a kind of resurrection takes place of ancient spanish dresses and armor great twohanded swords ponderous arquebuses with matchlocks and other weapons and accouterments once the equipments of the village chivalry and treasured up from generation to generation since the time of the conquest in these hereditary and historical garbs some of the most sturdy of the villagers array themselves as champions of the faith while its ancient opponents are represented by another band of villagers dressed up as moorish warriors a tent is pitched in the public square of the village within which is an altar and an image of the virgin the spanish warriors approach to perform their devotions at this shrine but are opposed by the infidel moslems who surround the tent a mock fight succeeds in the course of which the combatants sometimes forget that they are merely playing a part and exchange dry blows of grievous weight the fictious moors especially are apt to bear away pretty evident marks of the pious zeal of their antagonists the contest however invariably terminates in favor of the good cause the moors are defeated and taken prisoners the image of the virgin rescued from thralldom is elevated in triumph and a grand procession succeeds in which the spanish conquerors figure with great vainglory and applause and their captives are led in chains to the infinite delight and edification of the populace these annual festivals are the delight of the villagers who expend considerable sums in their celebration in some villages they are occasionally obliged to suspend them for want of funds but when times grow better or they have been enabled to save money for the purpose they are revived with all their grotesque pomp and extravagance  to recur to the exploit of hernando del pulgar however extravagant and fabulous it may seem it is authenticated by certain traditional usages and shows the vainglorious daring that prevailed between the youthful warriors of both nations in that romantic war the mosque thus consecrated to the virgin was made the cathedral of the city after the conquest and there is a painting of the virgin beside the royal chapel which was put there by hernando del pulgar the lineal representative of the harebrained cavalier has the right to this day to enter the church on certain occasions on horseback to sit within the choir and to put on his hat at the elevation of the host though these privileges have often been obstinately contested by the clergy  the present lineal representative of hernando del pulgar is the marquis de salar whom i have met occasionally in society he is a young man of agreeable appearance and manners and his bright black eyes would give indication of his inheriting the fire of his ancestor when the paintings were put up in the vivarambla illustrating the scenes of the conquest an old grayheaded family servant of the pulgars was so delighted with those which related to the family hero that he absolutely shed tears and hurrying home to the marquis urged him to hasten and behold the family trophies the sudden zeal of the old man provoked the mirth of his young master upon which turning to the brother of the marquis with that freedom allowed to family servants in spain come se√±or cried he you are more grave and considerate than your brother come and see your ancestor in all his glory                                       within two or three years after the above letter was written the marquis de salar was married to the beautiful daughter of the count  mentioned by the author in his anecdotes of the alhambra the match was very agreeable to all parties and the nuptials were celebrated with great festivity     abderahman  founder of the dynasty of the ommiades of spain   to the editor of the knickerbocker  sirin the following memoir i have conformed to the facts furnished by the arabian chroniclers as cited by the learned conde the story of abderahman has almost the charm of romance but it derives a higher interest from the heroic yet gentle virtues which it illustrates and from recording the fortunes of the founder of that splendid dynasty which shed such a luster upon spain during the domination of the arabs abderahman may in some respects be compared to our own washington he achieved the independence of moslem spain freeing it from subjection to the caliphs he united its jarring parts under one government he ruled over it with justice clemency and moderation his whole course of conduct was distinguished by wonderful forbearance and magnanimity and when he died he left a legacy of good example and good counsel to his successors  gc                                       blessed be god exclaims an arabian historian in his hands alone is the destiny of princes he overthrows the mighty and humbles the haughty to the dust and he raises up the persecuted and afflicted from the very depths of despair  the illustrious house of omeya had swayed the scepter at damascus for nearly a century when a rebellion broke out headed by aboul abbas safah who aspired to the throne of the caliphs as being descended from abbas the uncle of the prophet the rebellion was successful marvau the last caliph of the house of omeya was defeated and slain a general proscription of the ommiades took place many of them fell in battle many were treacherously slain in places where they had taken refuge above seventy most noble and distinguished were murdered at a banquet to which they had been invited and their dead bodies covered with cloths and made to serve as tables for the horrible festivity others were driven forth forlorn and desolate wanderers in various parts of the earth and pursued with relentless hatred for it was the determination of the usurper that not one of the persecuted family should escape aboul abbas took possession of three stately palaces and delicious gardens and founded the powerful dynasty of the abbassides which for several centuries maintained dominion in the east  blessed be god again exclaims the arabian historian it was written in his eternal decrees that notwithstanding the fury of the abbassides the noble stock of omeya should not be destroyed one fruitful branch remained to nourish with glory and greatness in another land  when the sanguinary proscription of the ommiades took place two young princes of that line brothers by the names of solyman and abderahman were spared for a time their personal graces noble demeanor and winning affability had made them many friends while their extreme youth rendered them objects of but little dread to the usurper their safety however was but transient in a little while the suspicions of aboul abbas were aroused the unfortunate solyman fell beneath the scimiter of the executioner his brother abderahman was warned of his danger in time several of his friends hastened to him bringing him jewels a disguise and a fleet horse the emissaries of the caliph said they are in search of thee thy brother lies weltering in his blood fly to the desert there is no safety for thee in the habitations of man  abderahman took the jewels clad himself in the disguise and mounting his steed fled for his life as he passed a lonely fugitive by the palaces of his ancestors in which his family had long held sway their very walls seemed disposed to betray him as they echoed the swift clattering of his steed  abandoning his native country syria where he was liable at each moment to be recognized and taken he took refuge among the bedouin arabs a halfsavage race of shepherds his youth his inborn majesty and grace and the sweetness and affability that shone forth in his azure eyes won the hearts of these wandering men he was but twenty years of age and had been reared in the soft luxury of a palace but he was tall and vigorous and in a little while hardened himself so completely to the rustic life of the fields that it seemed as though he had passed all his days in the rude simplicity of a shepherds cabin  his enemies however were upon his traces and gave him but little rest by day he scoured the plain with the bedouins hearing in every blast the sound of pursuit and fancying in every distant cloud of dust a troop of the caliphs horsemen that night was passed in broken sleep and frequent watchings and at the earliest dawn he was the first to put the bridle to his steed  wearied by these perpetual alarms he bade farewell to his friendly bedouins and leaving egypt behind sought a safer refuge in western africa the province of barea was at that time governed by aben habib who had risen to rank and fortune under the fostering favor of the ommiades surely thought the unhappy prince i shall receive kindness and protection from this man he will rejoice to show his gratitude for the benefits showered upon him by my kindred  abderahman was young and as yet knew little of mankind none are so hostile to the victim of power as those whom he has befriended they fear being suspected of gratitude by his persecutors and involved in his misfortunes  the unfortunate abderahman had halted for a few days to repose himself among a horde of bedouins who had received him with their characteristic hospitality they would gather round him in the evenings to listen to his conversation regarding with wonder this gentlyspoken stranger from the more refined country of egypt the old men marveled to find so much knowledge and wisdom in such early youth and the young men won by his frank and manly carriage entreated him to remain among them  one night when all were buried in sleep they were roused by the tramp of horsemen the wali aben habib who like all the governors of distant ports had received orders from the caliph to be on the watch for the fugitive prince had heard that a young man answering the description had entered the province alone from the frontiers of egypt on a steed worn down by travel he had immediately sent forth horsemen in his pursuit with orders to bring him to him dead or alive the emissaries of the wali had traced him to his restingplace and demanded of the arabs whether a young man a stranger from syria did not sojourn among their tribe the bedouins knew by the description that the stranger must be their guest and feared some evil was intended him such a youth said they has indeed sojourned among us but he has gone with some of our young men to a distant valley to hunt the lion the emissaries inquired the way to the place and hastened on to surprise their expected prey  the bedouins repaired to abderahman who was still sleeping if thou hast aught to fear from man in power said they arise and fly for the horsemen of the wali are in quest of thee we have sent them off for a time on a wrong errand but they will soon return  alas whither shall i fly cried the unhappy prince my enemies hunt me like the ostrich of the desert they follow me like the wind and allow me neither safety nor repose  six of the bravest youth of the tribe stepped forward we have steeds said they that can outstrip the wind and hands that can hurl the javelin we will accompany thee in thy flight and will fight by thy side while life lasts and we have weapons to wield  abderahman embraced them with tears of gratitude they mounted their steeds and made for the most lonely parts of the desert by the faint light of the stars they passed through dreary wastes and over hills of sand the lion roared and the hyena howled unheeded for they fled from man more cruel and relentless when in pursuit of blood than the savage beasts of the desert  at sunrise they paused to refresh themselves beside a scanty well surrounded by a few palmtrees one of the young arabs climbed a tree and looked in every direction but not a horseman was to be seen  we have outstripped pursuit said the bedouins whither shall we conduct thee where is thy home and the land of thy people  home have i none replied abderahman mournfully nor family nor kindred my native land is to me a land of destruction and my people seek my life  the hearts of the youthful bedouins were touched with compassion at these words and they marveled that one so young and gentle should have suffered such great sorrow and persecution  abderahman sat by the well and mused for a time at length breaking silence in the midst of mauritania said he dwells the tribe of zeneta my mother was of that tribe and perhaps when her son presents himself a persecuted wanderer at their door they will not turn him from the threshold  the zenetes replied the bedouins are among the bravest and most hospitable of the people of africa never did the unfortunate seek refuge among them in vain nor was the stranger repulsed from their door so they mounted their steeds with renewed spirits and journeyed with all speed to tahart the capital of the zenetes  when abderahman entered the place followed by his six rustic arabs all wayworn and travelstained his noble and majestic demeanor shone through the simple garb of a bedouin a crowd gathered around him as he alighted from his weary steed confiding in the well known character of the tribe he no longer attempted concealment  you behold before you said he one of the proscribed house of omeya i am that abderahman upon whose head a price has been set and who has been driven from land to land i come to you as my kindred my mother was of your tribe and she told me with her dying breath that in all time of need i would find a home and friends among the zenetes  the words of abderahman went straight to the hearts of his hearers they pitied his youth and his great misfortunes while they were charmed by his frankness and by the manly graces of his person the tribe was of a bold and generous spirit and not to be awed by the frown of power evil be upon us and upon our children said they if we deceive the trust thou hast placed in us  then one of the noblest xeques took abderahman to his house and treated him as his own child and the principal people of the tribe strove who most should cherish him and do him honor endeavoring to obliterate by their kindness the recollection of his past misfortunes  abderahman had resided some time among the hospitable zenetes when one day two strangers of venerable appearance attended by a small retinue arrived at tahart they gave themselves out as merchants and from the simple style in which they traveled excited no attention in a little while they sought out abderahman and taking him apart hearken said they abderahman of the royal line of omeya we are embassadors sent on the part of the principal moslems of spain to offer thee not merely an asylum for that thou hast already among these brave zenetes but an empire spain is a prey to distracting factions and can no longer exist as a dependency upon a throne too remote to watch over its welfare it needs to be independent of asia and africa and to be under the government of a good prince who shall reside within it and devote himself entirely to its prosperity a prince with sufficient title to silence all rival claims and bring the warring parties into unity and peace and at the same time with sufficient ability and virtue to insure the welfare of his dominions for this purpose the eyes of all the honorable leaders in spain have been turned to thee as a descendant of the royal line of omeya and an offset from the same stock as our holy prophet they have heard of thy virtues and of thy admirable constancy under misfortunes and invite thee to accept the sovereignty of one of the noblest countries in the world thou wilt have some difficulties to encounter from hostile men but thou wilt have on thy side the bravest captains that have signalized themselves in the conquest of the unbelievers  the embassadors ceased and abderahman remained for a time lost in wonder and admiration god is great exclaimed he at length there is but one god who is god and mahomet is his prophet illustrious embassadors you have put new life into my soul for you have shown me something to live for in the few years that i have lived troubles and sorrows have been heaped upon my head and i have become inured to hardships and alarms since it is the wish of the valiant moslems of spain i am willing to become their leader and defender and devote myself to their cause be it happy or disastrous  the embassadors now cautioned him to be silent as to their errand and to depart secretly for spain the seaboard of africa said they swarms with your enemies and a powerful faction in spain would intercept you on landing did they know your name and rank and the object of your coming  but abderahman replied i have been cherished in adversity by these brave zenetes i have been protected and honored by them when a price was set upon my head and to harbor me was great peril how can i keep my good fortune from my benefactors and desert their hospitable roofs in silence he is unworthy of friendship who withholds confidence from his friend  charmed with the generosity of his feelings the embassadors made no opposition to his wishes the zenetes proved themselves worthy of his confidence they hailed with joy the great change in his fortunes the warriors and the young men pressed forward to follow and aid them with horse and weapon for the honor of a noble house and family said they can be maintained only by lances and horsemen in a few days he set forth with the embassadors at the head of nearly a thousand horsemen skilled in war and exercised in the desert and a large body of infantry armed with lances the venerable xeque with whom he had resided blessed him and shed tears over him at parting as though he had been his own child and when the youth passed over the threshold the house was filled with lamentations  abderahman reached spain in safely and landed at almanecar with his little band of warlike zenetes spain was at that time in a state of great confusion upward of forty years had elapsed since the conquest the civil wars in syria and egypt had prevented the main government at damascus from exercising control over this distant and recently acquired territory every moslem commander considered the town or province committed to his charge an absolute property and accordingly exercised the most arbitrary extortions these excesses at length became insupportable and at a convocation of many of the principal leaders it was determined as a means to end these dissensions to unite all the moslem provinces of spain under one emir or general governor yusuf el fehri an ancient man of honorable lineage was chosen for this station he began his reign with policy and endeavored to conciliate all parties but the distribution of offices soon created powerful enemies among the disappointed leaders a civil war was the consequence and spain was deluged with blood the troops of both parties burned and ravaged and laid every thing waste to distress their antagonists the villages were abandoned by their inhabitants who fled to the cities for refuge and flourishing towns disappeared from the face of the earth or remained mere heaps of rubbish and ashes at the time of the landing of abderahman in spain the old emir yusuf had obtained a signal victory he had captured saragossa in which was ameer ben amru his principal enemy together with his son and secretary loading his prisoners with chains and putting them on camels he set out in triumph for cordova considering himself secure in the absolute domination of spain  he had halted one day in a valley called wadarambla and was reposing with his family in his pavilion while his people and the prisoners made a repast in the open air in the midst of his repose his confidential adherent and general the wali samael galloped into the camp covered with dust and exhausted with fatigue he brought tidings of the arrival of abderahman and that the whole seaboard was flocking to his standard messenger after messenger came hurrying into the camp confirming the fearful tidings and adding that this descendant of the omeyas had secretly been invited to spain by amru and his followers yusuf waited not to ascertain the truth of this accusation giving way to a transport of fury he ordered that amru his son and secretary should be cut to pieces his commands were instantly executed and this cruelty says the arabian chronicler lost him the favor of allah for from that time success deserted his standard  abderahman had indeed been hailed with joy on his landing in spain the old people hoped to find tranquillity under the sway of one supreme chieftain descended from their ancient caliphs the young men were rejoiced to have a youthful warrior to lead them on to victories and the populace charmed with his freshness and manly beauty his majestic yet gracious and affable demeanor shouted long live abderahman ben moavia meramamolin of spain  in a few days the youthful sovereign saw himself at the head of more than twenty thousand men from the neighborhood of elvira almeria malaga xeres and sidonia fair seville threw open its gates at his approach and celebrated his arrival with public rejoicings he continued his march into the country vanquished one of the eons of yusuf before the gates of cordova and obliged him to take refuge within its walls where he held him in close siege hearing however of the approach of yusuf the father with a powerful army he divided his forces and leaving ten thousand men to press the siege he hastened with the other ten to meet the coming foe  yusuf had indeed mustered a formidable force from the east and south of spain and accompanied by his veteran general samael came with confident boasting to drive this intruder from the land his confidence increased on beholding the small army of abderahman turning to samael he repeated with a scornful sneer a verse from an arabian poetess which says  how hard is our lot we come a thirsty multitude and lo but this cup of water to share among us  there was indeed a fearful odds on the one side were two veteran generals grown gray in victory with a mighty host of warriors seasoned in the wars of spain on the other side was a mere youth scarce attained to manhood with a hasty levy of halfdisciplined troops but the youth was a prince flushed with hope and aspiring after fame and empire and surrounded by a devoted band of warriors from africa whose example infused desperate zeal into the little army  the encounter took place at daybreak the impetuous valor of the zenetes carried everything before it the cavalry of yusuf was broken and driven back upon the infantry and before noon the whole host was put to headlong flight yusuf and samael were borne along in the torrent of the fugitives raging and storming and making ineffectual efforts to rally them they were separated widely in the confusion of the flight one taking refuge in the algarves the other in the kingdom of murcia they afterward rallied reunited their forces and made another desperate stand near almunecar the battle was obstinate and bloody but they were again defeated and driven with a handful of followers to take refuge in the rugged mountains adjacent to elvira  the spirit of the veteran samael gave way before these fearful reverses in vain oh yusuf said he do we contend with the prosperous star of this youthful conqueror the will of allah be done let us submit to our fate and sue for favorable terms while we have yet the means of capitulation  it was a hard trial for the proud spirit of yusuf that had once aspired to uncontrolled sway but he was compelled to capitulate abderahman was as generous as brave he granted the two grayheaded generals the most honorable conditions and even took the veteran samael into favor employing him as a mark of confidence to visit the eastern provinces of spain and restore them to tranquillity yusuf having delivered up elvira and granada and complied with other articles of his capitulation was permitted to retire to murcia and rejoin his son muhamad a general amnesty to all chiefs and soldiers who should yield up their strongholds and lay down their arms completed the triumph of abderahman and brought all hearts into obedience  thus terminated this severe struggle for the domination of spain and thus the illustrious family of omeya after having been cast down and almost exterminated in the east took new root and sprang forth prosperously in the west  wherever abderahman appeared he was received with rapturous acclamations as he rode through the cities the populace rent the air with shouts of joy the stately palaces were crowded with spectators eager to gain a sight of his graceful form and beaming countenance and when they beheld the mingled majesty and benignity of their new monarch and the sweetness and gentleness of his whole conduct they extolled him as something more than mortal as a beneficent genius sent for the happiness of spain  in the interval of peace which now succeeded abderahman occupied himself in promoting the useful and elegant arts and in introducing into spain the refinements of the east considering the building and ornamenting of cities as among the noblest employments of the tranquil hours of princes he bestowed great pains upon beautifying the city of cordova and its environs he reconstructed banks and dikes to keep the guadalquivir from overflowing its borders and on the vast terraces thus formed he planted delightful gardens in the midst of these he erected a lofty tower commanding a view of the vast and fruitful valley enlivened by the windings of the river in this tower he would pass hours of meditation gazing on the soft and varied landscape and inhaling the bland and balmy airs of that delightful region at such times his thoughts would recur to the past and the misfortunes of his youth the massacre of his family would rise to view mingled with tender recollections of his native country from which he was exiled in these melancholy musings he would sit with his eyes fixed upon a palmtree which he had planted in the midst of his garden it is said to have been the first ever planted in spain and to have been the parent stock of all the palmtrees which grace the southern provinces of the peninsula the heart of abderahman yearned toward this tree it was the offspring of his native country and like him an exile in one of his moods of tenderness he composed verses upon it which have since become famous throughout the world the following is a rude but literal translation  beauteous palm thou also wert hither brought a stranger but thy roots have found a kindly soil thy head is lifted to the skies and the sweet airs of algarve fondle and kiss thy branches  thou hast known like me the storms of adverse fortune bitter tears wouldst thou shed couldst thou feel my woes repeated griefs have overwhelmed me with early tears i bedewed the palms on the banks of the euphrates but neither tree nor river heeded my sorrows when driven by cruel fate and the ferocious aboul abbas from the scenes of my childhood and the sweet objects of my affection  to thee no remembrance remains of my beloved country i unhappy can never recall it without tears  the generosity of abderahman to his vanquished foes was destined to be abused the veteran yusuf in visiting certain of the cities which he had surrendered found himself surrounded by zealous partisans ready to peril life in his service the love of command revived in his bosom and he repented the facility with which he had suffered himself to be persuaded to submission flushed with new hopes of success he caused arms to be secretly collected and deposited in various villages most zealous in their professions of devotion and raising a considerable body of troops seized upon the castle of almodovar the rash rebellion was shortlived at the first appearance of an army sent by abderahman and commanded by abdelmelee governor of seville the villages which had so recently professed loyalty to yusuf hastened to declare their attachment to the monarch and to give up the concealed arms almodovar was soon retaken and yusuf driven to the environs of lorea was surrounded by the cavalry of abdelmelee the veteran endeavored to cut a passage through the enemy but after fighting with desperate fury and with a force of arm incredible in one of his age he fell beneath blows from weapons of all kinds so that after the battle his body could scarcely be recognized so numerous were the wounds his head was cut off and sent to cordova where it was placed in an iron cage over the gate of the city  the old lion was dead but his whelps survived yusuf had left three sons who inherited his warlike spirit and were eager to revenge his death collecting a number of the scattered adherents of their house they surprised and seized upon toledo during the absence of temam its wali or commander in this old warrior city built upon a rock and almost surrounded by the tagus they set up a kind of robber hold scouring the surrounding country levying tribute seizing upon horses and compelling the peasantry to join their standard every day cavalcades of horses and mules laden with spoil with flocks of sheep and droves of cattle came pouring over the bridges on either side of the city and thronging in at the gates the plunder of the surrounding country those of the inhabitants who were still loyal to abderahman dared not lift up their voices for men of the sword bore sway at length one day when the sons of yusuf with their choicest troops were out on a maraud the watchmen on the towers gave the alarm a troop of scattered horsemen were spurring wildly toward the gates the banners of the sons of yusuf were descried two of them spurred into the city followed by a handful of warriors covered with confusion and dismay they had been encountered and defeated by the wali temam and one of the brothers had been slain  the gates were secured in all haste and the walls were scarcely manned when temam appeared before them with his troops and summoned the city to surrender a great internal commotion ensued between the loyalists and the insurgents the latter however had weapons in their hands and prevailed and for several days trusting to the strength of their rockbuilt fortress they set the wali at defiance at length some of the loyal inhabitants of toledo who knew all its secret and subterraneous passages some of which if chroniclers may be believed have existed since the days of hercules if not of tubal cain introduced temam and a chosen band of his warriors into the very center of the city where they suddenly appeared as if by magic a panic seized upon the insurgents some sought safety in submission some in concealment some in flight casim one of the sons of yusuf escaped in disguise the youngest unarmed was taken and was sent captive to the king accompanied by the head of his brother who had been slain in battle  when abderahman beheld the youth laden with chains he remembered his own sufferings in his early days and had compassion on him but to prevent him from doing further mischief he imprisoned him in a tower of the wall of cordova  in the meantime casim who had escaped managed to raise another band of warriors spain in all ages a guerrilla country prone to partisan warfare and petty maraud was at that time infested by bands of licentious troops who had sprung up in the civil contests their only object pillage their only dependence the sword and ready to flock to any new and desperate standard that promised the greatest license with a ruffian force thus levied casim scoured the country took sidonia by storm and surprised seville while in a state of unsuspecting security  abderahman put himself at the head of his faithful zenetes and took the field in person by the rapidity of his movements the rebels were defeated sidonia and seville speedily retaken and casim was made prisoner the generosity of abderahman was again exhibited toward this unfortunate son of yusuf he spared his life and sent him to be confined in a tower at toledo  the veteran samael had taken no part in these insurrections but had attended faithfully to the affairs intrusted to him by abderahman the death of his old friend and colleague yusuf however and the subsequent disasters of his family filled him with despondency fearing the inconstancy of fortune and the dangers incident to public employ he entreated the king to be permitted to retire to his house in seguenza and indulge a privacy and repose suited to his advanced age his prayer was granted the veteran laid by his arms battered in a thousand conflicts hung his sword and lance against the wall and surrounded by a few friends gave himself up apparently to the sweets of quiet and unambitious leisure  who can count however upon the tranquil content of a heart nurtured amid the storms of war and ambition under the ashes of this outward humility were glowing the coals of faction in his seemingly philosophical retirement samael was concerting with his friends new treason against abderahman his plot was discovered his house was suddenly surrounded by troops and he was conveyed to a tower at toledo where in the course of a few months he died in captivity  the magnanimity of abderahman was again put to the proof by a new insurrection at toledo hixem ben adra a relation of yusuf seized upon the alcazar or citadel slew several of the royal adherents of the king liberated casim from his tower and summoning all the banditti of the country soon mustered a force of ten thousand men abderahman was quickly before the walls of toledo with the troops of cordova and his devoted zenetes the rebels were brought to terms and surrendered the city on promise of general pardon which was extended even to hixem and casim when the chieftains saw hixem and his principal confederates in the power of abderahman they advised him to put them all to death a promise given to traitors and rebels said they is not binding when it is to the interest of the state that it should be broken  no replied abderahman if the safety of my throne were at stake i would not break my word so saying he confirmed the amnesty and granted hixem ben adra a worthless life to be employed in further treason  scarcely had abderahman returned from this expedition when a powerful army sent by the caliph landed from africa on the coast of the algarves the commander aly ben mogueth emir of cairvan elevated a rich banner which he had received from the hands of the caliph wherever he went he ordered the caliph of the east to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet denouncing abderahman as a usurper the vagrant member of a family proscribed and execrated in all the mosques of the east  one of the first to join his standard was hixem ben adra so recently pardoned by abderahman he seized upon the citadel of toledo and repairing to the camp of aly offered to deliver the city into his hands  abderahman as bold in war as he was gentle in peace took the field with his wonted promptness overthrew his enemies with great slaughter drove some to the seacoast to regain their ships and others to the mountains the body of aly was found on the field of battle abderahman caused the head to be struck off and conveyed to cairvan where it was affixed at night to a column in the public square with this inscription thus abderahman the descendant of the omeyas punishes the rash and arrogant  hixem ben adra escaped from the field of battle and excited further troubles but was eventually captured by abdelmelee who ordered his head to be struck off on the spot lest he should again be spared through the wonted clemency of abderahman  notwithstanding these signal triumphs the reign of abderahman was disturbed by further insurrections and by another descent from africa but he was victorious over them all striking the roots of his power deeper and deeper into the land under his sway the government of spain became more regular and consolidated and acquired an independence of the empire of the east the caliph continued to be considered as first pontiff and chief of the religion but he ceased to have any temporal power over spain  having again an interval of peace abderahman devoted himself to the education of his children suleiman the eldest he appointed wali or governor of toledo abdallah the second was intrusted with the command of merida but the third son hixem was the delight of his heart the son of howara his favorite sultana whom he loved throughout life with the utmost tenderness with this youth who was full of promise he relaxed from the fatigues of government joining in his youthful sports amid the delightful gardens of cordova and teaching him the gentle art of falconry of which the king was so fond that he received the name of the falcon of coraixi  while abderahman was thus indulging in the gentle propensities of his nature mischief was secretly at work muhamad the youngest son of yusuf had been for many years a prisoner in the tower of cordova being passive and resigned his keepers relaxed their vigilance and brought him forth from his dungeon he went groping about however in broad daylight as if still in the darkness of his tower his guards watched him narrowly lest this should be a deception but were at length convinced that the long absence of light had rendered him blind they now permitted him to descend frequently to the lower chambers of the tower and to sleep there occasionally during the heats of summer they even allowed him to grope his way to the cistern in quest of water for his ablutions  a year passed in this way without anything to excite suspicion during all this time however the blindness of muhamad was entirely a deception and he was concerting a plan of escape through the aid of some friends of his father who found means to visit him occasionally one sultry evening in midsummer the guards had gone to bathe in the guadalquivir leaving muhamad alone in the lower chambers of the tower no sooner were they out of sight and hearing than he hastened to a window of the staircase leading down to the cistern lowered himself as far as his arms would reach and dropped without injury to the ground plunging into the guadalquivir he swam across to a thick grove on the opposite side where his friends were waiting to receive him here mounting a horse which they had provided for an event of the kind he fled across the country by solitary roads and made good his escape to the mountains of jaen  the guardians of the tower dreaded for some time to make known his flight to abderahman when at length it was told to him he exclaimed all is the work of eternal wisdom it is intended to teach us that we cannot benefit the wicked without injuring the good the flight of that blind man will cause much trouble and bloodshed  his predictions were verified muhamad reared the standard of rebellion on the mountains the seditious and discontented of all kinds hastened to join it together with soldiers of fortune or rather wandering banditti and he had soon six thousand men well armed hardy in habits and desperate in character his brother casim also reappeared about the same time in the mountains of ronda at the head of a daring band that laid all the neighboring valleys under contribution  abderahman summoned his alcaydes from their various military posts to assist in driving the rebels from their mountain fastnesses into the plains it was a dangerous and protracted toil for the mountains were frightfully wild and rugged he entered them with a powerful host driving the rebels from height to height and valley to valley and harassing them by a galling fire from thousands of crossbows at length a decisive battle took place near the river guadalemar the rebels were signally defeated four thousand fell in action many were drowned in the river and muhamad with a few horsemen escaped to the mountains of the algarves here he was hunted by the alcaydes from one desolate retreat to another his few followers grew tired of sharing the disastrous fortunes of a fated man one by one deserted him and he himself deserted the remainder fearing they might give him up to purchase their own pardon  lonely and disguised he plunged into the depths of the forests or lurked in dens and caverns like a famished wolf often casting back his thoughts with regret to the time of his captivity in the gloomy tower of cordova hunger at length drove him to alarcon at the risk of being discovered famine and misery however had so wasted and changed him that he was not recognized he remained nearly a year in alarcon unnoticed and unknown yet constantly tormenting himself with the dread of discovery and with groundless fears of the vengeance of abderahman death at length put an end to his wretchedness  a milder fate attended his brother casim being defeated in the mountains of murcia he was conducted in chains to cordova on coming into the presence of abderahman his once fierce and haughty spirit broken by distress gave way he threw himself on the earth kissed the dust beneath the feet of the king and implored his clemency the benignant heart of abderahman was filled with melancholy rather than exultation at beholding this wreck of the once haughty family of yusuf a suppliant at his feet and suing for mere existence he thought upon the mutability of fortune and felt how insecure are all her favors he raised the unhappy casim from the earth ordered his irons to be taken off and not content with mere forgiveness treated him with honor and gave him possessions in seville where he might live in state conformable to the ancient dignity of his family won by this great and persevering magnanimity casim ever after remained one of the most devoted of his subjects  all the enemies of abderahman were at length subdued he reigned undisputed sovereign of the moslems of spain and so benign was his government that every one blessed the revival of the illustrious line of omeya he was at all times accessible to the humblest of his subjects the poor man ever found in him a friend and the oppressed a protector he improved the administration of justice established schools for public instruction encouraged poets and men of letters and cultivated the sciences he built mosques in every city that he visited inculcated religion by example as well as by precept and celebrated all the festivals prescribed by the koran with the utmost magnificence  as a monument of gratitude to god for the prosperity with which he had been favored he undertook to erect a mosque in his favorite city of cordova that should rival in splendor the great mosque of damascus and excel the one recently erected in bagdad by the abbassides the supplanters of his family  it is said that he himself furnished the plan for this famous edifice and even worked on it with his own hands one hour in each day to testify his zeal and humility in the service of god and to animate his workmen he did not live to see it completed but it was finished according to his plans by his son hixem when finished it surpassed the most splendid mosques of the east it was six hundred feet in length and two hundred and fifty in breadth within were twentyeight aisles crossed by nineteen supported by a thousand and ninetythree columns of marble there were nineteen portals covered with plates of bronze of rare workmanship the principal portal was covered with plates of gold on the summit of the grand cupola were three gilt balls surmounted by a golden pomegranate at night the mosque was illuminated with four thousand seven hundred lamps and great sums were expended in amber and aloes which were burned as perfumes the mosque remains to this day shorn of its ancient splendor yet still one of the grandest moslem monuments in spain  finding himself advancing in years abderahman assembled in his capital of cordova the principal governors and commanders of his kingdom and in presence of them all with great solemnity nominated his son hixem as the successor to the throne all present made an oath of fealty to abderahman during his life and to hixem after his death the prince was younger than his brothers suleiman and abdallah but he was the son of howara the tenderly beloved sultana of abderahman and her influence it is said gained him this preference  within a few months afterward abderahman fell grievously sick at merida finding his end approaching he summoned hixem to his bedside my son said he the angel of death is hovering over me treasure up therefore in thy heart this dying counsel which i give through the great love i bear thee remember that all empire is from god who gives and takes it away according to his pleasure since god through his divine goodness has given us regal power and authority let us do his holy will which is nothing else than to do good to all men and especially to those committed to our protection render equal justice my son to the rich and the poor and never suffer injustice to be done within thy dominion for it is the road to perdition be merciful and benignant to those dependent upon thee confide the government of thy cities and provinces to men of worth and experience punish without compassion those ministers who oppress thy people with exorbitant exactions pay thy troops punctually teach them to feel a certainty in thy promises command them with gentleness but firmness and make them in truth the defenders of the state not its destroyers cultivate unceasingly the affections of thy people for in their goodwill consists the security of the state in their distrust its peril in their hatred its certain ruin protect the husbandmen who cultivate the earth and yield us necessary sustenance never permit their fields and groves and gardens to be disturbed in a word act in such wise that thy people may bless thee and may enjoy under the shadow of thy wing a secure and tranquil life in this consists good government if thou dost practice it thou wilt be happy among thy people and renowned throughout the world  having given this excellent counsel the good king abderahman blessed his son hixem and shortly after died being but in the sixtieth year of his age he was interred with great pomp but the highest honors that distinguished his funeral were the tears of real sorrow shed upon his grave he left behind him a name for valor justice and magnanimity and forever famous as being the founder of the glorious line of the ommiades in spain     the widows ordeal  or a judicial trial by combat   the world is daily growing older and wiser its institutions vary with its years and mark its growing wisdom and none more so than its modes of investigating truth and ascertaining guilt or innocence in its nonage when man was yet a fallible being and doubted the accuracy of his own intellect appeals were made to heaven in dark and doubtful cases of atrocious accusation  the accused was required to plunge his hand in boiling oil or to walk across redhot plowshares or to maintain his innocence in armed fight and listed field in person or by champion if he passed these ordeals unscathed he stood acquitted and the result was regarded as a verdict from on high  it is somewhat remarkable that in the gallant age of chivalry the gentler sex should have been most frequently the subjects of these rude trials and perilous ordeals and that too when assailed in their most delicate and vulnerable parttheir honor  in the present very old and enlightened age of the world when the human intellect is perfectly competent to the management of its own concerns and needs no special interposition of heaven in its affairs the trial by jury has superseded these superhuman ordeals and the unanimity of twelve discordant minds is necessary to constitute a verdict such a unanimity would at first sight appear also to require a miracle from heaven but it is produced by a simple device of human ingenuity the twelve jurors are locked up in their box there to fast until abstinence shall have so clarified their intellects that the whole jarring panel can discern the truth and concur in a unanimous decision one point is certain that truth is one and is immutableuntil the jurors all agree they cannot all be right  it is not our intention however to discuss this great judicial point or to question the avowed superiority of the mode of investigating truth adopted in this antiquated and very sagacious era it is our object merely to exhibit to the curious reader one of the most memorable cases of judicial combat we find in the annals of spain it occurred at the bright commencement of the reign and in the youthful and as yet glorious days of roderick the goth who subsequently tarnished his fame at home by his misdeeds and finally lost his kingdom and his life on the banks of the guadalete in that disastrous battle which gave up spain a conquest to the moors the following is the story  there was once upon a time a certain duke of lorraine who was acknowledged throughout his domains to be one of the wisest princes that ever lived in fact there was no one measure adopted by him that did not astonish his privy counselors and gentlemen in attendance and he said such witty things and made such sensible speeches that the jaws of his high chamberlain were wellnigh dislocated from laughing with delight at one and gaping with wonder at the other  this very witty and exceedingly wise potentate lived for half a century in single blessedness at length his courtiers began to think it a great pity so wise and wealthy a prince should not have a child after his own likeness to inherit his talents and domains so they urged him most respectfully to marry for the good of his estate and the welfare of his subjects  he turned their advice over in his mind some four or five years and then sent forth emissaries to summon to his court all the beautiful maidens in the land who were ambitious of sharing a ducal crown the court was soon crowded with beauties of all styles and complexions from among whom he chose one in the earliest budding of her charms and acknowledged by all the gentlemen to be unparalleled for grace and loveliness the courtiers extolled the duke to the skies for making such a choice and considered it another proof of his great wisdom the duke said they is waxing a little too old the damsel on the other hand is a little too young if one is lacking in years the other has a superabundance thus a want on one side is balanced by the excess on the other and the result is a wellassorted marriage  the duke as is often the case with wise men who marry rather late and take damsels rather youthful to their bosoms became dotingly fond of his wife and very properly indulged her in all things he was consequently cried up by his subjects in general and by the ladies in particular as a pattern for husbands and in the end from the wonderful docility with which he submitted to be reined and checked acquired the amiable and enviable appellation of duke philibert the wiferidden  there was only one thing that disturbed the conjugal felicity of this paragon of husbandsthough a considerable tine elapsed after his marriage there was still no prospect of an heir the good duke left no means untried to propitiate heaven he made vows and pilgrimages he fasted and he prayed but all to no purpose the courtiers were all astonished at the circumstance they could not account for it while the meanest peasant in the country had sturdy brats by dozens without putting up a prayer the duke wore himself to skin and bone with penances and fastings yet seemed further off from his object than ever  at length the worthy prince fell dangerously ill and felt his end approaching he looked sorrowfully and dubiously upon his young and tender spouse who hung over him with tears and sobbings alas said he tears are soon dried from youthful eyes and sorrow lies lightly on a youthful heart in a little while thou wilt forget in the arms of another husband him who has loved thee so tenderly  never never cried the duchess never will i cleave to another alas that my lord should think me capable of such inconstancy  the worthy and wiferidden duke was soothed by her assurances for he could not brook the thought of giving her up even after he should be dead still he wished to have some pledge of her enduring constancy  far be it from me my dearest wife said he to control thee through a long life a year and a day of strict fidelity will appease my troubled spirit promise to remain faithful to my memory for a year and a day and i will die in peace  the duchess made a solemn vow to that effect but the uxorious feelings of the duke were not yet satisfied safe bind safe find thought he so he made a will bequeathing to her all his domains on condition of her remaining true to him for a year and a day after his decease but should it appear that within that time she had in anywise lapsed from her fidelity the inheritance should go to his nephew the lord of a neighboring territory  having made his will the good duke died and was buried scarcely was he in his tomb when his nephew came to take possession thinking as his uncle had died without issue the domains would be devised to him of course he was in a furious passion when the will was produced and the young widow declared inheritor of the dukedom as he was a violent highhanded man and one of the sturdiest knights in the land fears were entertained that he might attempt to seize on the territories by force he had however two bachelor uncles for bosom counselors swaggering rakehelly old cavaliers who having led loose and riotous lives prided themselves upon knowing the world and being deeply experienced in human nature prithee man be of good cheer said they the duchess is a young and buxom widow she has just buried our brother who god rest his soul was somewhat too much given to praying and fasting and kept his pretty wife always tied to his girdle she is now like a bird from a cage think you she will keep her vow pooh poohimpossible take our words for itwe know mankind and above all womankind she cannot hold out for such a length of time it is not in womanhoodit is not in widowhoodwe know it and thats enough keep a sharp lookout upon the widow therefore and within the twelvemonth you will catch her trippingand then the dukedom is your own  the nephew was pleased with this counsel and immediately placed spies round the duchess and bribed several of her servants to keep watch upon her so that she could not take a single step even from one apartment of her palace to another without being observed never was young and beautiful widow exposed to so terrible an ordeal  the duchess was aware of the watch thus kept upon her though confident of her own rectitude she knew that it is not enough for a woman to be virtuousshe must be above the reach of slander for the whole term of her probation therefore she proclaimed a strict nonintercourse with the other sex she had females for cabinet ministers and chamberlains through whom she transacted all her public and private concerns and it is said that never were the affairs of the dukedom so adroitly administered  all males were rigorously excluded from the palace she never went out of its precincts and whenever she moved about its courts and gardens she surrounded herself with a bodyguard of young maids of honor commanded by dames renowned for discretion she slept in a bed without curtains placed in the center of a room illuminated by innumerable wax tapers four ancient spinsters virtuous as virginia perfect dragons of watchfulness who only slept during the daytime kept vigils throughout the night seated in the four corners of the room on stools without backs or arms and with seats cut in checkers of the hardest wood to keep them from dozing  thus wisely and warily did the young duchess conduct herself for twelve long months and slander almost bit her tongue off in despair at finding no room even for a surmise never was ordeal more burdensome or more enduringly sustained   the year passed away the last odd day arrived and a long long day it was it was the twentyfirst of june the longest day in the year it seemed as if it would never come to an end a thousand times did the duchess and her ladies watch the sun from the windows of the palace as he slowly climbed the vault of heaven and seemed still more slowly to roll down they could not help expressing their wonder now and then why the duke should have tagged this supernumerary day to the end of the year as if three hundred and sixtyfive days were not sufficient to try and task the fidelity of any woman it is the last grain that turns the scalethe last drop that overflows the gobletand the last moment of delay that exhausts the patience by the time the sun sank below the horizon the duchess was in a fidget that passed all bounds and though several hours were yet to pass before the day regularly expired she could not have remained those hours in durance to gain a royal crown much less a ducal coronet so she gave orders and her palfrey magnificently caparisoned was brought into the courtyard of the castle with palfreys for all her ladies in attendance in this way she sallied forth just as the sun had gone down it was a mission of pietya pilgrim cavalcade to a convent at the foot of a neighboring mountainto return thanks to the blessed virgin for having sustained her through this fearful ordeal  the orisons performed the duchess and her ladies returned ambling gently along the border of a forest it was about that mellow hour of twilight when night and day are mingled and all objects are indistinct suddenly some monstrous animal sprang from out a thicket with fearful howlings the female bodyguard was thrown into confusion and fled different ways it was some time before they recovered from their panic and gathered once more together but the duchess was not to be found the greatest anxiety was felt for her safety the hazy mist of twilight had prevented their distinguishing perfectly the animal which had affrighted them some thought it a wolf others a bear others a wild man of the woods for upward of an hour did they beleaguer the forest without daring to venture in and were on the point of giving up the duchess as torn to pieces and devoured when to their great joy they beheld her advancing in the gloom supported by a stately cavalier  he was a stranger knight whom nobody knew it was impossible to distinguish his countenance in the dark but all the ladies agreed that he was of noble presence and captivating address he had rescued the duchess from the very fangs of the monster which he assured the ladies was neither a wolf nor a bear nor yet a wild man of the woods but a veritable fiery dragon a species of monster peculiarly hostile to beautiful females in the days of chivalry and which all the efforts of knighterrantry had not been able to extirpate  the ladies crossed themselves when they heard of the danger from which they had escaped and could not enough admire the gallantry of the cavalier the duchess would fain have prevailed on her deliverer to accompany her to her court but he had no time to spare being a knighterrant who had many adventures on hand and many distressed damsels and afflicted widows to rescue and relieve in various parts of the country taking a respectful leave therefore he pursued his wayfaring and the duchess and her train returned to the palace throughout the whole way the ladies were unwearied in chanting the praises of the stranger knight nay many of them would willingly have incurred the danger of the dragon to have enjoyed the happy deliverance of the duchess as to the latter she rode pensively along but said nothing  no sooner was the adventure of the wood made public than a whirlwind was raised about the ears of the beautiful duchess the blustering nephew of the deceased duke went about armed to the teeth with a swaggering uncle at each shoulder ready to back him and swore the duchess had forfeited her domain it was in vain that she called all the saints and angels and her ladies in attendance into the bargain to witness that she had passed a year and a day of immaculate fidelity one fatal hour remained to be accounted for and into the space of one little hour sins enough may be conjured up by evil tongues to blast the fame of a whole life of virtue  the two graceless uncles who had seen the world were ever ready to bolster the matter through and as they were brawny broadshouldered warriors and veterans in brawl as well as debauch they had great sway with the multitude if any one pretended to assert the innocence of the duchess they interrupted him with a loud ha ha of derision a pretty story truly would they cry about a wolf and a dragon and a young widow rescued in the dark by a sturdy varlet who dares not show his face in the daylight you may tell that to those who do not know human nature for our parts we know the sex and thats enough  if however the other repeated his assertion they would suddenly knit their brows swell look big and put their hands upon their swords as few people like to fight in a cause that does not touch their own interests the nephew and the uncles were suffered to have their way and swagger uncontradicted  the matter was at length referred to a tribunal composed of all the dignitaries of the dukedom and many and repeated consultations were held the character of the duchess throughout the year was as bright and spotless as the moon in a cloudless night one fatal hour of darkness alone intervened to eclipse its brightness finding human sagacity incapable of dispelling the mystery it was determined to leave the question to heaven or in other words to decide it by the ordeal of the sworda sage tribunal in the age of chivalry the nephew and two bully uncles were to maintain their accusation in listed combat and six months were allowed to the duchess to provide herself with three champions to meet them in the field should she fail in this or should her champions be vanquished her honor would be considered as attainted her fidelity as forfeit and her dukedom would go to the nephew as a matter of right  with this determination the duchess was fain to comply proclamations were accordingly made and heralds sent to various parts but day after day week after week and month after month elapsed without any champion appearing to assert her loyalty throughout that darksome hour the fair widow was reduced to despair when tidings reached her of grand tournaments to be held at toledo in celebration of the nuptials of don roderick the last of the gothic kings with the morisco princess exilona as a last resort the duchess repaired to the spanish court to implore the gallantry of its assembled chivalry  the ancient city of toledo was a scene of gorgeous revelry on the event of the royal nuptials the youthful king brave ardent and magnificent and his lovely bride beaming with all the radiant beauty of the east were hailed with shouts and acclamations whenever they appeared their nobles vied with each other in the luxury of their attire their prancing steeds and splendid retinues and the haughty dames of the court appeared in a blaze of jewels  in the midst of all this pageantry the beautiful but afflicted duchess of lorraine made her approach to the throne she was dressed in black and closely veiled for duennas of the most staid and severe aspect and six beautiful demoiselles formed her female attendants she was guarded by several very ancient withered and grayheaded cavaliers and her train was borne by one of the most deformed and diminutive dwarfs in existence  advancing to the foot of the throne she knelt down and throwing up her veil revealed a countenance so beautiful that half the courtiers present were ready to renounce wives and mistresses and devote themselves to her service but when she made known that she came in quest of champions to defend her fame every cavalier pressed forward to offer his arm and sword without inquiring into the merits of the case for it seemed clear that so beauteous a lady could have done nothing but what was right and that at any rate she ought to be championed in following the bent of her humors whether right or wrong  encouraged by such gallant zeal the duchess suffered herself to be raised from the ground and related the whole story of her distress when she concluded the king remained for some time silent charmed by the music of her voice at length as i hope for salvation most beautiful duchess said he were i not a sovereign king and bound in duty to my kingdom i myself would put lance in rest to vindicate your cause as it is i here give full permission to my knights and promise lists and a fair field and that the contest shall take place before the walls of toledo in presence of my assembled court  as soon as the pleasure of the king was known there was a strife among the cavaliers present for the honor of the contest it was decided by lot and the successful candidates were objects of great envy for every one was ambitious of finding favor in the eyes of the beautiful widow  missives were sent summoning the nephew and his two uncles to toledo to maintain their accusation and a day was appointed for the combat when the day arrived all toledo was in commotion at an early hour the lists had been prepared in the usual place just without the walls at the foot of the rugged rocks on which the city is built and on that beautiful meadow along the tagus known by the name of the kings garden the populace had already assembled each one eager to secure a favorable place the balconies were filled with the ladies of the court clad in their richest attire and bands of youthful knights splendidly armed and decorated with their ladies devices were managing their superbly caparisoned steeds about the field the king at length came forth in state accompanied by the queen exilona they took their seats in a raised balcony under a canopy of rich damask and at sight of them the people rent the air with acclamations  the nephew and his uncles now rode into the field armed capapie and followed by a train of cavaliers of their own roistering cast great swearers and carousers arrant swashbucklers with clanking armor and jingling spurs when the people of toledo beheld the vaunting and discourteous appearance of these knights they were more anxious than ever for the success of the gentle duchess but at the same time the sturdy and stalwart frames of these warriors showed that whoever won the victory from them must do it at the cost of many a bitter blow  as the nephew and his riotous crew rode in at one side of the field the fair widow appeared at the other with her suite of grave grayheaded courtiers her ancient duennas and dainty demoiselles and the little dwarf toiling along under the weight of her train every one made way for her as she passed and blessed her beautiful face and prayed for success to her cause she took her seat in a lower balcony not far from the sovereigns and her pale face set off by her mourning weeds was as the moon shining forth from among the clouds of night  the trumpets sounded for the combat the warriors were just entering the lists when a stranger knight armed in panoply and followed by two pages and an esquire came galloping into the field and riding up to the royal balcony claimed the combat as a matter of right  in me cried he behold the cavalier who had the happiness to rescue the beautiful duchess from the peril of the forest and the misfortune to bring on her this grievous calumny it was but recently in the course of my errantry that tidings of her wrongs have reached my ears and i have urged hither at all speed to stand forth in her vindication  no sooner did the duchess hear the accents of the knight than she recognized his voice and joined her prayers with his that he might enter the lists the difficulty was to determine which of the three champions already appointed should yield his place each insisting on the honor of the combat the stranger knight would have settled the point by taking the whole contest upon himself but this the other knights would not permit it was at length determined as before by lot and the cavalier who lost the chance retired murmuring and disconsolate  the trumpets again soundedthe lists were opened the arrogant nephew and his two drawcansir uncles appeared so completely cased in steel that they and their steeds were like moving masses of iron when they understood the stranger knight to be the same that had rescued the duchess from her peril they greeted him with the most boisterous derision  oh ho sir knight of the dragon said they you who pretend to champion fair widows in the dark come on and vindicate your deeds of darkness in the open day  the only reply of the cavalier was to put lance in rest and brace himself for the encounter needless is it to relate the particulars of a battle which was like so many hundred combats that have been said and sung in prose and verse who is there but must have foreseen the event of a contest where heaven had to decide on the guilt or innocence of the most beautiful and immaculate of widows  the sagacious reader deeply read in this kind of judicial combats can imagine the encounter of the graceless nephew and the stranger knight he sees their concussion man to man and horse to horse in mid career and sir graceless hurled to the ground and slain he will not wonder that the assailants of the brawny uncles were less successful in their rude encounter but he will picture to himself the stout stranger spurring to their rescue in the very critical moment he will see him transfixing one with his lance and cleaving the other to the chine with a back stroke of his sword thus leaving the trio of accusers dead upon the field and establishing the immaculate fidelity of the duchess and her title to the dukedom beyond the shadow of a doubt  the air rang with acclamations nothing was heard but praises of the beauty and virtue of the duchess and of the prowess of the stranger knight but the public joy was still more increased when the champion raised his visor and revealed the countenance of one of the bravest cavaliers of spain renowned for his gallantry in the service of the sex and who had been round the world in quest of similar adventures  that worthy knight however was severely wounded and remained for a long time ill of his wounds the lovely duchess grateful for having twice owed her protection to his arm attended him daily during his illness and finally rewarded his gallantry with her hand  the king would fain have had the knight establish his title to such high advancement by further deeds of arms but his courtiers declared that he already merited the lady by thus vindicating her fame and fortune in a deadly combat √† outrance and the lady herself hinted that she was perfectly satisfied of his prowess in arms from the proofs she had received in his achievement in the forest  their nuptials were celebrated with great magnificence the present husband of the duchess did not pray and fast like his predecessor philibert the wiferidden yet he found greater favor in the eyes of heaven for their union was blessed with a numerous progenythe daughters chaste and beauteous as their mother the sons stout and valiant as their sire and renowned like him for relieving disconsolate damsels and desolated widows     the creole village  a sketch from a steamboat  first published in 1887   in traveling about our motley country i am often reminded of ariostos account of the moon in which the good paladin astolpho found everything garnered up that had been lost on earth so i am apt to imagine that many things lost in the old world are treasured up in the new having been handed down from generation to generation since the early days of the colonies a european antiquary therefore curious in his researches after the ancient and almost obliterated customs and usages of his country would do well to put himself upon the track of some early band of emigrants follow them across the atlantic and rummage among their descendants on our shores  in the phraseology of new england might be found many an old english provincial phrase long since obsolete in the parent country with some quaint relics of the roundheads while virginia cherishes peculiarities characteristic of the days of elizabeth and sir walter raleigh  in the same way the sturdy yeomanry of new jersey and pennsylvania keep up many usages fading away in ancient germany while many an honest broadbottomed custom nearly extinct in venerable holland may be found flourishing in pristine vigor and luxuriance in dutch villages on the banks of the mohawk and the hudson  in no part of our country however are the customs and peculiarities imported from the old world by the earlier settlers kept up with more fidelity than in the little povertystricken villages of spanish and french origin which border the rivers of ancient louisiana their population is generally made up of the descendants of those nations married and interwoven together and occasionally crossed with a slight dash of the indian the french character however floats on top as from its buoyant qualities it is sure to do whenever it forms a particle however small of an intermixture  in these serene and dilapidated villages art and nature stand still and the world forgets to turn round the revolutions that distract other parts of this mutable planet reach not here or pass over without leaving any trace the fortunate inhabitants have none of that public spirit which extends its cares beyond its horizon and imports trouble and perplexity from all quarters in newspapers in fact newspapers are almost unknown in these villages and as french is the current language the inhabitants have little community of opinion with their republican neighbors they retain therefore their old habits of passive obedience to the decrees of government as though they still lived under the absolute sway of colonial commandants instead of being part and parcel of the sovereign people and having a voice in public legislation  a few aged men who have grown gray on their hereditary acres and are of the good old colonial stock exert a patriarchal sway in all matters of public and private import their opinions are considered oracular and their word is law  the inhabitants moreover have none of that eagerness for gain and rage for improvement which keep our people continually on the move and our country towns incessantly in a state of transition there the magic phrases town lots water privileges railroads and other comprehensive and soulstirring words from the speculators vocabulary are never heard the residents dwell in the houses built by their forefathers without thinking of enlarging or modernizing them or pulling them down and turning them into granite stores the trees under which they have been born and have played in infancy flourish undisturbed though by cutting them down they might open new streets and put money in their pockets in a word the almighty dollar that great object of universal devotion throughout our land seems to have no genuine devotees in these peculiar villages and unless some of its missionaries penetrate there and erect banking houses and other pious shrines there is no knowing how long the inhabitants may remain in their present state of contented poverty  in descending one of our great western rivers in a steamboat i met with two worthies from one of these villages who had been on a distant excursion the longest they had ever made as they seldom ventured far from home one was the great man or grand seigneur of the village not that he enjoyed any legal privileges or power there everything of the kind having been done away when the province was ceded by france to the united states his sway over his neighbors was merely one of custom and convention out of deference to his family beside he was worth full fifty thousand dollars an amount almost equal in the imaginations of the villagers to the treasures of king solomon  this very substantial old gentleman though of the fourth or fifth generation in this country retained the true gallic feature and deportment and reminded me of one of those provincial potentates that are to be met with in the remote parts of france he was of a large frame a gingerbread complexion strong features eyes that stood out like glass knobs and a prominent nose which he frequently regaled from a gold snuffbox and occasionally blew with a colored handkerchief until it sounded like a trumpet  he was attended by an old negro as black as ebony with a huge mouth in a continual grin evidently a privileged and favorite servant who had grown up and grown old with him he was dressed in creole stylewith white jacket and trousers a stiff shirt collar that threatened to cut off his ears a bright madras handkerchief tied round his head and large gold earrings he was the politest negro i met with in a western tour and that is saying a great deal for excepting the indians the negroes are the most gentlemanlike personages to be met with in those parts it is true they differ from the indians in being a little extra polite and complimentary he was also one of the merriest and here too the negroes however we may deplore their unhappy condition have the advantage of their masters the whites are in general too free and prosperous to be merry the cares of maintaining their rights and liberties adding to their wealth and making presidents engross all their thoughts and dry up all the moisture of their souls if you hear a broad hearty devilmaycare laugh be assured it is a negros  besides this african domestic the seigneur of the village had another no less cherished and privileged attendant this was a huge dog of the mastiff breed with a deep hanging mouth and a look of surly gravity he walked about the cabin with the air of a dog perfectly at home and who had paid for his passage at dinner time he took his seat beside his master giving him a glance now and then out of a corner of his eye which bespoke perfect confidence that he would not be forgotten nor was heevery now and then a huge morsel would be thrown to him peradventure the halfpicked leg of a fowl which he would receive with a snap like the springing of a steeltrapone gulp and all was down and a glance of the eye told his master that he was ready for another consignment  the other village worthy traveling in company with the seigneur was of a totally different stamp small thin and weazen faced as frenchmen are apt to be represented in caricature with a bright squirrellike eye and a gold ring in his ear his dress was flimsy and sat loosely on his frame and he had altogether the look of one with but little coin in his pocket yet though one of the poorest i was assured he was one of the merriest and most popular personages in his native village  compere martin as he was commonly called was the factotum of the placesportsman schoolmaster and land surveyor he could sing dance and above all play on the fiddle an invaluable accomplishment in an old french creole village for the inhabitants have a hereditary love for balls and fetes if they work but little they dance a great deal and a fiddle is the joy of their heart  what had sent compere martin traveling with the grand seigneur i could not learn he evidently looked up to him with great deference and was assiduous in rendering him petty attentions from which i concluded that he lived at home upon the crumbs which fell from his table he was gayest when out of his sight and had his song and his joke when forward among the deck passengers but altogether compere martin was out of his element on board of a steamboat he was quite another being i am told when at home in his own village  like his opulent fellowtraveler he too had his canine follower and retainerand one suited to his different fortunesone of the civilest most unoffending little dogs in the world unlike the lordly mastiff he seemed to think he had no right on board of the steamboat if you did but look hard at him he would throw himself upon his back and lift up his legs as if imploring mercy  at table he took his seat a little distance from his master not with the bluff confident air of the mastiff but quietly and diffidently his head on one side with one ear dubiously slouched the other hopefully cocked up his under teeth projecting beyond his black nose and his eye wistfully following each morsel that went into his masters mouth  if compere martin now and then should venture to abstract a morsel from his plate to give to his humble companion it was edifying to see with what diffidence the exemplary little animal would take hold of it with the very tip of his teeth as if he would almost rather not or was fearful of taking too great a liberty and then with what decorum would he eat it how many efforts would he make in swallowing it as if it stuck in his throat with what daintiness would he lick his lips and then with what an air of thankfulness would he resume his seat with his teeth once more projecting beyond his nose and an eye of humble expectation fixed upon his master  it was late in the afternoon when the steamboat stopped at the village which was the residence of these worthies it stood on the high bank of the river and bore traces of having been a frontier trading post there were the remains of stockades that once protected it from the indians and the houses were in the ancient spanish and french colonial taste the place having been successively under the domination of both those nations prior to the cession of louisiana to the united states  the arrival of the seigneur of fifty thousand dollars and his humble companion compere martin had evidently been looked forward to as an event in the village numbers of men women and children white yellow and black were collected on the river bank most of them clad in oldfashioned french garments and their heads decorated with colored handkerchiefs or white nightcaps the moment the steamboat came within sight and hearing there was a waving of handkerchiefs and a screaming and bawling of salutations and felicitations that baffle all description  the old gentleman of fifty thousand dollars was received by a train of relatives and friends and children and grandchildren whom he kissed on each cheek and who formed a procession in his rear with a legion of domestics of all ages following him to a large oldfashioned french house that domineered over the village  his black valet de chambre in white jacket and trousers and gold earrings was met on the shore by a boon though rustic companion a tall negro fellow with a long goodhumored face and the profile of a horse which stood out from beneath a narrowrimmed straw hat stuck on the back of his head the explosions of laughter of these two varlets on meeting and exchanging compliments were enough to electrify the country round  the most hearty reception however was that given to compere martin everybody young and old hailed him before he got to land everybody had a joke for compere martin and compere martin had a joke for everybody even his little dog appeared to partake of his popularity and to be caressed by every hand indeed he was quite a different animal the moment he touched the land here he was at home here he was of consequence he barked he leaped he frisked about his old friends and then would skim round the place in a wide circle as if mad  i traced compere martin and his little dog to their home it was an old ruinous spanish house of large dimensions with verandas overshadowed by ancient elms the house had probably been the residence in old times of the spanish commandant in one wing of this crazy but aristocratical abode was nestled the family of my fellowtraveler for poor devils are apt to be magnificently clad and lodged in the castoff clothes and abandoned palaces of the great and wealthy  the arrival of compere martin was welcomed by a legion of women children and mongrel curs and as poverty and gayety generally go hand in hand among the french and their descendants the crazy mansion soon resounded with loud gossip and lighthearted laughter  as the steamboat paused a short time at the village i took occasion to stroll about the place most of the houses were in the french taste with casements and rickety verandas but most of them in flimsy and ruinous condition all the wagons plows and other utensils about the place were of ancient and inconvenient gallic construction such as had been brought from france in the primitive days of the colony the very looks of the people reminded me of the villages of france  from one of the houses came the hum of a spinning wheel accompanied by a scrap of an old french chanson which i have heard many a time among the peasantry of languedoc doubtless a traditional song brought over by the first french emigrants and handed down from generation to generation  half a dozen young lasses emerged from the adjacent dwellings reminding me by their light step and gay costume of scenes in ancient france where taste in dress comes natural to every class of females the trim bodice and covered petticoat and little apron with its pockets to receive the hands when in an attitude for conversation the colored kerchief wound tastefully round the head with a coquettish knot perking above one ear and the neat slipper and tight drawn stocking with its braid of narrow ribbon embracing the ankle where it peeps from its mysterious curtain it is from this ambush that cupid sends his most inciting arrows  while i was musing upon the recollections thus accidentally summoned up i heard the sound of a fiddle from the mansion of compere martin the signal no doubt for a joyous gathering i was disposed to turn my steps thither and witness the festivities of one of the very few villages i had met with in my wide tour that was yet poor enough to be merry but the bell of the steamboat summoned me to reembark  as we swept away from the shore i cast back a wistful eye upon the mossgrown roofs and ancient elms of the village and prayed that the inhabitants might long retain their happy ignorance their absence of all enterprise and improvement their respect for the fiddle and their contempt for the almighty dollar footnote this phrase used for the first time in this sketch has since passed into current circulation and by some has been questioned as savoring i fear however my prayer is of irreverence the author therefore owes it to his orthodoxy to declare that no irreverence was intended even to the dollar itself which he is aware is daily becoming more and more an object of worship i fear however my prayer is doomed to be of no avail in a little while the steamboat whirled me to an american town just springing into bustling and prosperous existence  the surrounding forest had been laid out in town lots frames of wooden buildings were rising from among stumps and burned trees the place already boasted a courthouse a jail and two banks all built of pine boards on the model of grecian temples there were rival hotels rival churches and rival newspapers together with the usual number of judges and generals and governors not to speak of doctors by the dozen and lawyers by the score  the place i was told was in an astonishing career of improvement with a canal and two railroads in embryo lots doubled in price every week everybody was speculating in land everybody was rich and everybody was growing richer the community however was torn to pieces by new doctrines in religion and in political economy there were camp meetings and agrarian meetings and an election was at hand which it was expected would throw the whole country into a paroxysm  alas with such an enterprising neighbor what is to become of the poor little creole village     a contented man   in the garden of the tuileries there is a sunny corner under the wall of a terrace which fronts the south along the wall is a range of benches commanding a view of the walks and avenues of the garden this genial nook is a place of great resort in the latter part of autumn and in fine days in winter as it seems to retain the flavor of departed summer on a calm bright morning it is quite alive with nurserymaids and their playful little charges hither also resort a number of ancient ladies and gentlemen who with the laudable thrift in small pleasures and small expenses for which the french are to be noted come here to enjoy sunshine and save firewood here may often be seen some cavalier of the old school when the sunbeams have warmed his blood into something like a glow fluttering about like a frostbitten moth thawed before the fire putting forth a feeble show of gallantry among the antiquated dames and now and then eying the buxom nurserymaids with what might almost be mistaken for an air of libertinism  among the habitual frequenters of this place i had often remarked an old gentleman whose dress was decidedly anterevolutional he wore the threecornered cocked hat of the ancien regime his hair was frizzed over each ear into ailes de pigeon a style strongly savoring of bourbonism and a queue stuck out behind the loyalty of which was not to be disputed his dress though ancient had an air of decayed gentility and i observed that he took his snuff out of an elegant though oldfashioned gold box he appeared to be the most popular man on the walk he had a compliment for every old lady he kissed every child and he patted every little dog on the head for children and little dogs are very important members of society in france i must observe however that he seldom kissed a child without at the same time pinching the nurserymaids cheek a frenchman of the old school never forgets his devoirs to the sex  i had taken a liking to this old gentleman there was an habitual expression of benevolence in his face which i have very frequently remarked in these relics of the politer days of france the constant interchange of those thousand little courtesies which imperceptibly sweeten life have a happy effect upon the features and spread a mellow evening charm over the wrinkles of old age  where there is a favorable predisposition one soon forms a kind of tacit intimacy by often meeting on the same walks once or twice i accommodated him with a bench after which we touched hats on passing each other at length we got so far as to take a pinch of snuff together out of his box which is equivalent to eating salt together in the east from that time our acquaintance was established  i now became his frequent companion in his morning promenades and derived much amusement from his goodhumored remarks on men and manners one morning as we were strolling through an alley of the tuileries with the autumnal breeze whirling the yellow leaves about our path my companion fell into a peculiarly communicative vein and gave me several particulars of his history he had once been wealthy and possessed of a fine estate in the country and a noble hotel in paris but the revolution which effected so many disastrous changes stripped him of everything he was secretly denounced by his own steward during a sanguinary period of the revolution and a number of the bloodhounds of the convention were sent to arrest him he received private intelligence of their approach in time to effect his escape he landed in england without money or friends but considered himself singularly fortunate in having his head upon his shoulders several of his neighbors having been guillotined as a punishment for being rich  when he reached london he had but a louis in his pocket and no prospect of getting another he ate a solitary dinner of beefsteak and was almost poisoned by port wine which from its color he had mistaken for claret the dingy look of the chophouse and of the little mahoganycolored box in which he ate his dinner contrasted sadly with the gay saloons of paris everything looked gloomy and disheartening poverty stared him in the face he turned over the few shillings he had of change did not know what was to become of him andwent to the theater  he took his seat in the pit listened attentively to a tragedy of which he did not understand a word and which seemed made up of fighting and stabbing and scene shifting and began to feel his spirits sinking within him when casting his eyes into the orchestra what was his surprise to recognize an old friend and neighbor in the very act of extorting music from a huge violoncello  as soon as the evenings performance was over he tapped his friend on the shoulder they kissed each other on each cheek and the musician took him home and shared his lodgings with him he had learned music as an accomplishment by his friends advice he now turned to it as a means of support he procured a violin offered himself for the orchestra was received and again considered himself one of the most fortunate men upon earth  here therefore he lived for many years during the ascendency of the terrible napoleon he found several emigrants living like himself by the exercise of their talents they associated together talked of france and of old times and endeavored to keep up a semblance of parisian life in the center of london  they dined at a miserable cheap french restaurant in the neighborhood of leicester square where they were served with a caricature of french cookery they took their promenade in st jamess park and endeavored to fancy it the tuileries in short they made shift to accommodate themselves to everything but an english sunday indeed the old gentleman seemed to have nothing to say against the english whom he affirmed to be braves gens and he mingled so much among them that at the end of twenty years he could speak their language almost well enough to be understood  the downfall of napoleon was another epoch in his life he had considered himself a fortunate man to make his escape penniless out of france and he considered himself fortunate to be able to return penniless into it it is true that he found his parisian hotel had passed through several hands during the vicissitudes of the times so as to be beyond the reach of recovery but then he had been noticed benignantly by government and had a pension of several hundred francs upon which with careful management he lived independently and as far as i could judge happily as his once splendid hotel was now occupied as a hotel garni he hired a small chamber in the attic it was but as he said changing his bedroom up two pair of stairshe was still in his own house his room was decorated with pictures of several beauties of former times with whom he professed to have been on favorable terms among them was a favorite operadancer who had been the admiration of paris at the breaking out of the revolution she had been a protegee of my friend and one of the few of his youthful favorites who had survived the lapse of time and its various vicissitudes they had renewed their acquaintance and she now and then visited him but the beautiful psyche once the fashion of the day and the idol of the parterre was now a shriveled little old woman warped in the back and with a hooked nose  the old gentleman was a devout attendant upon levees he was most zealous in his loyalty and could not speak of the royal family without a burst of enthusiasm for he still felt toward them as his companions in exile as to his poverty he made light of it and indeed had a goodhumored way of consoling himself for every cross and privation if he had lost his chateau in the country he had half a dozen royal palaces as it were at his command he had versailles and st cloud for his country resorts and the shady alleys of the tuileries and the luxembourg for his town recreation thus all his promenades and relaxations were magnificent yet cost nothing  when i walk through these fine gardens said he i have only to fancy myself the owner of them and they are mine all these gay crowds are my visitors and i defy the grand seignior himself to display a greater variety of beauty nay what is better i have not the trouble of entertaining them my estate is a perfect sans souci where every one does as he pleases and no one troubles the owner all paris is my theater and presents me with a continual spectacle i have a table spread for me in every street and thousands of waiters ready to fly at my bidding when my servants have waited upon me i pay them discharge them and theres an end i have no fears of their wronging or pilfering me when my back is turned upon the whole said the old gentleman with a smile of infinite good humor when i think upon the various risks i have run and the manner in which i have escaped them when i recollect all that i have suffered and consider all that i at present enjoy i cannot but look upon myself as a man of singular good fortune  such was the brief history of this practical philosopher and it is a picture of many a frenchman ruined by the revolution the french appear to have a greater facility than most men in accommodating themselves to the reverses of life and of extracting honey out of the bitter things of this world the first shock of calamity is apt to overwhelm them but when it is once past their natural buoyancy of feeling soon brings them to the surface this may be called the result of levity of character but it answers the end of reconciling us to misfortune and if it be not true philosophy it is something almost as efficacious ever since i have heard the story of my little frenchman i have treasured it up in my heart and i thank my stars i have at length found what i had long considered as not to be found on eartha contented man  p sthere is no calculating on human happiness since writing the foregoing the law of indemnity has been passed and my friend restored to a great part of his fortune i was absent from paris at the time but on my return hastened to congratulate him i found him magnificently lodged on the first floor of his hotel i was ushered by a servant in livery through splendid saloons to a cabinet richly furnished where i found my little frenchman reclining on a couch he received me with his usual cordiality but i saw the gayety and benevolence of his countenance had fled he had an eye full of care and anxiety  i congratulated him on his good fortune good fortune echoed he bah i have been plundered of a princely fortune and they give me a pittance as an indemnity  alas i found my late poor and contented friend one of the richest and most miserable men in paris instead of rejoicing hi the ample competency restored to him he is daily repining at the superfluity withheld he no longer wanders in happy idleness about paris but is a repining attendant in the antechambers of ministers his loyalty has evaporated with his gayety he screws his mouth when the bourbons are mentioned and even shrugs his shoulders when he hears the praises of the king in a word he is one of the many philosophers undone by the law of indemnity and his case is desperate for i doubt whether even another reverse of fortune which should restore him to poverty could make him again a happy man
