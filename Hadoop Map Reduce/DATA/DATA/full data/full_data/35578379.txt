to the reader of the following memoirs the memoirs themselves will disclose how i became acquainted with miss m they also refer here and there to the small part i was enabled to take in straightening matters out at what was a critical juncture in her affairs and in securing for her that independence which enabled her to live in the privacy she loved without any anxiety as to ways and means at the time it is clear that she considered me a dilatory intermediary i had not realized how extreme was her need but she came at last to take a far too generous view of these trifling little servicesservices as generously rewarded since they afforded me the opportunity of frequently seeing her and so of becoming as i hope one of her most devoted friends  one of the duties devolving on me as her sole executorcertain unusual legal proceedings having been brought to completionwas the examination of her letters and papers amongst these were her memoirswhich i found sealed up with her usual scrupulous neatness in numerous small square brownpaper packages and laid carefully away in a cupboard in her old nursery they were accompanied by a covering letter addressed to myself  miss ms handwriting was even more minute than one might naturally though not perhaps justifiably have anticipated her manuscript would therefore have been difficult enough for aging eyes to decipher even if it had not been almost inextricably interlined revised and corrected literary composition to this little womanofletters was certainly no primrose path the packages were therefore handed over to a trustworthy typist and at my direction one complete and accurate copy was made of their contents  after careful consideration and after disguising the names of certain persons and places to preclude every possibility of giving offenceeven mrs percy maudlen for instance if she ever scans these pages may blush unrecognizedi concluded that though i was under no absolute obligation to secure the publication of the memoirs this undoubtedly had been miss ms intention and wish at the same time and for similar reasons i decided that their publication should not take place until after my death instructions have therefore been left by me to this effect here then my editorial duties begin and end nothing has been altered nothing suppressed  even if such a task were within my province i should not venture to make any critical estimate of miss ms work i am not a writer and as a reader have an inveterate preference to be allowed to study and enjoy my authors with as little external intervention as possible the perusal of the memoirs has afforded me the deepest possible pleasure the seriousminded may none the less dismiss a midgets lucubrations as trifling and no doubtit could hardly be otherwisea more practised taste than mine will discover many faults crudities and inconsistencies in them though certain little prejudices on miss ms side may not be so easily detectable whatever their merits or imperfections may be i should be happy to think that the following pages may prove as interesting to other readershowever fewas they have been to myself  my own prejudices i confess are in miss ms favour indeed she herself assured me in the covering letter to which reference has been made that a chance word of mine had been her actual incentive to compositionthe remark in fact that the truth about even the least of thingse g your self miss mmay be a taper in whose beam one may peep at the truth about everything i cannot recall the occasion or this little apophthegm indeed only with extreme reluctance would i have helped to launch my small friend on her gigantic ordeal as a matteroffact she had a little way of carrying off scraps of the conversation of the commonsized as a bee carries off a drop of nectar and of transforming them into a honey all her own  as characteristic of her is the fact that during the whole time she was engaged on her writing and there is ample evidence in her manuscript that whether in fatigue disinclination or despair she sometimes left it untouched for weeks together she never made the faintest allusion to it authors i believeif i may take the elder disraeli for my authorityare seldom so secretive concerning their activities no less characteristically her letter to me was dated february 14th her memoirs were to be my valentine  little drops of water  my dear sir walter she wrote you know the rest nevertheless if only i had been given but one sharp spark of genius what infinite pains i should have been spared yet what is here concerns only my early days and chiefly one long year of them i might have written onalmost ad infinitum but i did not because i feared to weary us bothof myself the years that have followed my coming of age have been outwardly uneventful and other peoples thoughts i find are not so interesting as their experiences theres much to forgive in what i have writtenthe rawness the selfconsciousness the vanity the folly i am older now but am i wiseror merely not so young  just as it stands then i shall leave my story to and for you again and again as i have pored over the scenes of my memory i have asked myself what can life be about what does it mean what was my true course where my compass how many times too have i vainly speculated what inward difference being a human creature of my dimensions really makes what isdeep deep inat variance between man and midget you may discover this even if i never shall for after all lifes beads are all on one string however loosely threaded they may seem to be  i have tried to tell nothing but the truth about myself but i realize that it cannot be the whole truth for while so engaged just as when one peers into a lookingglass in the moonlight a something has at times looked out of some secret den or niche in me and then has vanished supposing then my dear sir w my story convinces you that all these years you have unawares been harbouring in your friendship not a woman scarcely a human being but an asp oh dear and oh dear well there are three andthirty ingredients ingrediments as i used to call them when i was a child in that sovran antidote venice treacle scatter a pennyweight of it upon my tombstone and so lay my infinitesimal apparition  maybe though there are not so very many vital differences between midgets and people of the common size no more perhaps than there are between them and the great even then it is possible that after reading my small endless story you may be very thankful that you are not a midget too  whether or not i have tried to be frank if not a warning keep or destroy what i have written as you will but please show it to nobody until nobody would mind and now goodbye  m   there was a tacit compact between miss m and myself that i should visit her at lyndsey about once a month business indisposition advancing age only too frequently made the journey impracticable but in general i would at such intervals find myself in her company at her old house stonecote drinking tea with her gossiping or reading to her while she sat in her chair beside my book embroidering her brilliant tiny flowers and beetles and butterflies with her tiny needle listening or daydreaming or musing out of the high window at the prospect of chizzel hill  at times she was an extremely quiet companion at others she would rain questions on me many of them exceedingly unconventional on a score of subjects at once scarcely pausing for answers which i was frequently at a loss to give in a mixed company she was perhaps exaggeratedly conscious of her minute stature  but in these quiet talksthat shrillsweet voice those impulsive little gesturesshe forgot it altogether not so her visitor who must confess to having been continually convicted in her presence of a kind of clumsiness and gaucherieand that i confess not merely physical to a stranger this experience however wholesome might be a little humiliating  when interested miss m would sit perfectly still her hands tightly clasped in her lap her eyes fixed with a piercing yet curiously remote scrutiny in complete repose her features lost this keenness and she became an indescribably beautiful little figure in her brightcoloured clothes in the large quiet room i can think of no comparison that would not seem fanciful her self is to some extent in her book and yet that unique volatile presence so frail yet so vigorous so very nearly nothing in her own whimsical phrase is only fitfully manifest  naturally enough she loved solitude but i am inclined to think she indulged in it to excess it was at any rate in solitude that she wrote her book and in solitude apparently that her unknown visitor found her in the following mysterious circumstances  the last of our reunionsand one no less happy than the restwas towards the end of the month of march on the morning of the following 25th of april i received a telegram summoning me to lyndsey i arrived there the same afternoon and was admitted by mrs bowater miss ms excellent but somewhat dickensian housekeeper then already a little deaf and elderly i found her in extreme distress it appeared that the evening before about seven oclock mrs bowater had heard voices in the housemiss ms and anothers friendly callers were infrequent unfamiliar ones extremely rare and mrs bowater confessed that she had felt some curiosity if not concern as to who this stranger might be and how he had gained admission she blamed herself beyond measurethough i endeavoured to reassure the good womanfor not instantly setting her misgivings at rest  hearing nothing more except the rain beating at the basement window at halfpast seven she went upstairs and knocked at miss ms door the large pleasant roomher old nurseryat the top of the house was in its usual scrupulous order but vacant nothing was disarranged nothing unusual except only that a slip of paper had been pinned to the carpet a little beyond the threshold with this message i have been called awaym  this communication far from soothing only increased mrs bowaters anxiety she searched the minute sheraton wardrobe and found that a garden hat and cape were missing she waited a whileunlike her usual selfat a loss what to be doing and peering out of the window but as darkness was coming on and miss m rarely went out in windy or showery weather or indeed descended the staircase without assistance she became so much alarmed that a little before eight she set out to explore the garden with a stable lantern and afterwards hurried off to the village for assistance  as the reader will himself discover this was not the first occasion on which miss m had given her friends anxiety the house the garden the surrounding district her old haunts at wanderslore were repeatedly submitted at my direction to the most rigorous and protracted search watch was kept on the only gipsy encampment in the neighbourhood near the heath advertisement failed to bring me any but false clues at length even hope had to be abandoned  miss m had been called away by whom i ask myself on what errand for what purpose so clear and unhurried was the writing of her last message as to preclude i think the afflicting thought that her visitor had been the cause of any apprehension or anxiety an even more tragic eventuality is out of the question after the events recorded in her last chapter not only had she made me a certain promise but her later life at lyndsey had been apparently perfectly serene and happy only a day or two before she had laughed up at her housekeeper why mrs bowater theres not room enough in me for all thats there nor is it to be assumed that some inward voiceher own frequent termhad summoned her away for mrs bowater immovably maintains that its tones reached her ear though she herself was at the moment engaged in the kitchen referred to in the first chapter of the memoirs  walter dadus pollacke  brunswick house beechwood     lyndsey     chapter one   some few years ago a brief account of me found its way into one or two country newspapers i have been told that it reappeared later in better proportion in the metropolitan press fortunately or unfortunately very little of this account was true it related among other things that i am accustomed to wear shoes with leaden soles to them to keep me from being blown away like thistledown in the wind that as a child i had narrowly escaped being scalded to death in a soup tureen that one of my ancestors came from poland that i am an expert painter of miniatures that i am a changeling and can speak the fairy tongue and so on and so forth  i think i can guess where my ingenuous biographer borrowed these fables he meant me no harm he was earning his living he made judicious use of his no doubts and it may be supposed and i hope he amused his readers but by far the greater part of his account was concerned with mere physical particulars he had looked at me in fancy through spectacles which may or may not have been rosy but which certainly minified i do not deserve his inches and ounces however flattering his intentions may have been it is true that my body is among the smaller works of god but i think he paid rather too much attention to this fact he spared any reference not only to my soul and i am not ungrateful for that but also to my mind and heart there may be too much of all three for some tastes in the following pages and especially perhaps of the last that cannot be helped finally my anonymous journalist stated that i was born in rutlandshirebecause i suppose it is the smallest county in england  that was truly unkind of him for as a matter of fact and to begin at the apparent beginning i was born in the village of lyndsey in kentthe prettiest country spot as i believe in all that countys million acres so it remains to this day in spite of the fact that since my childhood its little church with its decaying stones and unfading twelfthor is it thirteenthcentury glass has been restored and the lord of the manor has felled some of its finest trees including a grove of sweet chestnuts on bitchett heath whose forefathers came over with the romans but he has not yet succeeded in levelling the barrow on chizzel hill from my window i looked out indeed look out at this moment to the wavelike crest of this beloved hill across a long straggling orchard and pastures in the valley where cattle grazed and sheep wandered and unpolled willows stooped and silvered in the breeze i never wearied of the hill nor ever shall and when in my girlhood my grandfather aware of this idle gazing habit of mine sent me from geneva a diminutive telescope my daydreams multiplied his gift as an old kentish proverb goes spread butter on bacon with his spyglass to my eye i could bring a tapping green woodpecker as close as if it were actually laughing at me and could all but snuff up the faint rich scent of the cowslipspaggles as we called them in meadows a good mile away  my fathers house stonecote has a rather ungainly appearance if viewed from across the valley but it is roomy and open and fairly challenges the winds of the equinoxes its main windows are of a shallow bow shape one of them is among my first remembrances i am seated in a bright tartan frock on a pomatum pota coloured picture of mr shandy as i remember on its lidand around me are the brushes leather cases knickknacks etc of my fathers dressing table my father is shaving himself his chin and cheeks puffed out with soapsuds and now i look at him and now at his reflection in the great lookingglass and every time that happens he makes a pleasant grimace at me over his spectacles  this particular moment of my childhood probably fixed itself on my mind because just as with razor uplifted he was about to attack his upper lip a jackdaw attracted maybe by my gay clothes fluttered down on the sill outside and fussing and scrabbling with wing and claw pecked hard with its beak against the glass the sound and sight of this bird with its lively greyblue eyes so close and ardent startled me i leapt up ran across the table tripped over a hairbrush and fell sprawling beside my fathers watch i hear its ticking and also the little soothing whistle with which he was wont to comfort his daughter at any such mishap then perhaps i was five or six  that is a genuine memory but every family i suppose has its little pet traditions and one of ours relating to those early years is connected with our kitchen cat miaou she had come by a family of kittens and i had crept so it was said into her shallow basket with them having i suppose been too frequently meddled with this old mother cat lugged off her kittens one by one to a dark cupboard the last one thus secured she was discovered in rapt contemplation of myself as if in debate whether or not it was her maternal duty to carry me off too and there was i grinning up into her face such was our cooksmrs ballardsstory what i actually remember is different on the morning in question i was turning the corner of the brickfloored dusky passage that led to the kitchen when miaou came trotting along out of it with her blind bluntheaded bundle in her mouth we were equally surprised at this encounter and in brushing past she nearly knocked me over where i stood casting me at the same moment the queerest animal look out of her eyes so truth in this case was not so strange as mrs ballards fiction   my father was then a rather corpulent man with a highcoloured face and he wore large spectacles his time was his own for we were comfortably off on an income derived from a halfshare in the small fortune amassed by my grandfather and his partner in a paper mill he might have been a more successful though not perhaps a happier man if he had done more work and planned to do less but he only so far followed his hereditary occupation as to expend large quantities of its best handmade in the composition of a monograph the history of paper making this entailed a vast accumulation of books and much solitude i fancy too he believed in the policy of sleeping on ones first thoughts  since he was engaged at the same time on similar compilations with the hop and the cherry for theme he made indifferent progress in all three his papers alas were afterwards sold with his books so i have no notion of what became of them or of their value i can only hope that their purchaser has since won an easy distinction these pursuits if they achieved little else but the keeping of the man of the house quiet and contented proved my father at any rate to be a loyal and enthusiastic man of kent and i have seen to it that a fine morello cherrytree blossoms fruits and flourishes over his grave  my father was something of a musician too and could pizzicato so softly on his muted fiddle as not to jar even my too sensitive ear he taught me to play chess on a little board with pygmy men but he was apt to lose interest in the game when it went against him whereas it was then that our old friend dr grose played his hardest as my fathers hands were rather clumsy in make he took pains to be gentle and adroit with me but even after shaving his embrace was more of a discipline than a pleasurea fact that may partly account for my own undemonstrativeness in this direction  his voice if anything was small for his size except when he discussed politics with dr grose religion or the bringing up of children with my godmother miss fenne or money matters with my mother at such times his noisered face and gesticulationsaffected one of his listeners as eager as possible to pick up the crumbs far more than ever thunder did which is up in the clouds my only other discomfort in his company was his habit of taking snuff the stench of it almost suffocated me and at tap of his fingernail on the lid of his box i would scamper off for shelter like a hare  by birth he came of an old english family though no doubt with the usual admixtures my mothers mother was french she was a daundelyon the blood of that sweet enemy at times burned in her cheek like a flag and my father needed his heaviest guns when the stormy winds did blow and those colours were flying at such moments i preferred to hear the engagement from a distance not so much again because the mere discord grieved me as to escape the din but usuallyand especially after such little displaysthey were like two turtledoves and i did my small best to pipe a decoy  my father had been a man past forty when he married my mother she about fifteen years youngera slim nimble and lovely being who could slip round and encircle him in person or mind while he was pondering whether or not to say bo to a goose seven years afterwards came i friends as friends will professed to see a likeness between us and if my mother could have been dwindled down to be of my height and figure perhaps they would have been justified  but in hair and complexion possibly in ways too i harked back to an aunt of hers kitilda who had died of consumption in her early twenties i loved to hear stories of my greataunt kitilda she sang like a bird twice ran away from her convent school and was so fond of water that an old gentleman a friend of mr landors the poet who fell in love with her called her the naiad  my mother in her youth at tunbridge wells had been considered a beauty and had had many admirersat least so mrs ballard our cook told pollie yes and we know who might have turned out different if things hadnt been the same was a cryptic remark she once made which filled two little pitchers to overflowing among these admirers was a mr wagginhorne who now lived at maidstone he had pocketed his passion but not his admiration and being an artist in the same sense that my father was an author he had painted my mother and me and a pot of azaleas in oils how well i remember those interminable sittings with the old gentleman daubing along and cracking his beloved jokes and kentish cobbs at one and the same time whenever he came to see us this portrait was taken out of a cupboard and hung up in substitution for another picture in the diningroom what became of it when mr wagginhorne died i could never discover my mother would laugh when i inquired and archly eye my father it was clear at any rate that author was not jealous of artist  my mother was gentle with me and had need to be and i was happier in her company than one might think possible in a world of such fleetingness i would sit beside her workbox and she would softly talk to me and teach me my lessons and small rhymes to say while my own impulse and instinct taught me to sing and dance what gay hours we shared sewing was at first difficult for at that time no proportionate needles could be procured for me and i hated to cobble up only coarse work but she would give me little childish jobs to do such as arranging her silks or sorting her beads and would rock me to sleep with her finger to a drone so gentle that it might have been a distant bees  yet shadows there were before the darkness came child that i was i would watch gather over her face at times a kind of absentness as if she were dreaming of something to which she could give no name of some hope or wish that was now never to be fulfilled at this i would grow anxious and silent doubting perhaps that i had displeased her while to judge from her look i might not have been there at all  or again a mischievousness and mockery would steal into her mood then she would treat me as a mere trivial plaything talking small things to me as if our alphabet consisted of nothing but little oa letter for which i always felt a sort of pity but small affection this habit saddened my young days and sometimes enraged me more than i can say i was always of a serious cast of mindeven a little priggish perhaps and experience had already taught me that i could share my mothers thoughts and feelings more easily than she could share mine     chapter two   when precisely i began to speculate why i was despatched into this world so minute and different i cannot say pretty early i fancy though few opportunities for comparison were afforded me and for some time i supposed that all young children were of my stature there was adam waggett it is true the bumpkin son of a village friend of mrs ballards but he was some years older than i he would be invited to tea in the kitchen and was never at rest unless stuffing himself out with breadanddripping or doughcakevictuals naturally odious to me or pestering me with his coarse fooling and curiosity he was to prove useful in due season but in those days i had a distaste for him almost as deeprooted as that for hoppy the village idiotthough i saw poor hoppy only once  whatever the reason may be except in extremely desperate moments i do not remember much regretting that i was not of the common size still the realization was gradually borne in on me that i was a disappointment and mischance to my parents yet i never dared to let fall a question which was to be often in my young thoughts tell me mamma are you sorry that your little daughter is a midget but then does any one ask questions like that until they cannot be answered  still crossexamine her i did occasionally  where did i come from mamma  why my dear i am your mother  just i replied like pollies mother is her mother  she cast a glance at me from eyes that appeared to be very small unless for that instant it was mine that i saw reflected there  yes my dear she replied at length we come and we go she seemed tired with the heat of the day so i sate quietly holding her finger until she was recovered  only perhaps on account of my size was there any occasion for me to be thoroughly ashamed of myself otherwise i was if anything a rather precocious child i could walk a step or two at eleven months and began to talk before the christmas following the first anniversary of my birthday august 30th i learned my letters from the big black capitals in the book of genesis and to count and cipher from a beautiful little abacus strung with beads of silver and garnets the usual ailments came my way but were light come light go i was remarkably sinewy and muscular strong in the chest and never suffered from snuffling colds or from chilblains though shoes and gloves have always been a difficulty  i can perfectly recall my childish figure as i stood with endless satisfaction surveying my reflection in a lookingglass on the christmas morning after my ninth birthday my frock was of a fine puffed scarlet my slippers loose at heel to match my hair demurely parted in the middle hung straight on my narrow shoulders though i had already learned to plait it and so framed my face the eyebrows faintly arched eyebrows darker and crookeder now the nose in proportion the lips rather narrow and of a lively red  my features wore a penetrating expression in that reflection because my keen look was searching them pretty close but if it was a sharp look it was not i think a bold or defiant and then i smiled as if to say so this is to be my companion then  it was winter and frost was on the window that day i enjoyed the crisp air for i was packed warm in lambswool underneath there i stood my fathers round red face beaming on one side of the table my mothers smiling but enigmatic scrutinizing my reflection on the other and myself tippeting this way and thata veritable miniature of vanity  who should be ushered at this moment into the room where we were so happy but my godmother miss fenne come to bring my father and mother her christmas greetings and me a little catechism sewn up in a pink silk cover she was a bentup old lady and a rapid talker with a voice which though small jangled every nerve in my body like a pencil on a slate being my godmother she took great liberties in counselling my parents on the proper way of managing me the only time indeed i ever heard my father utter an oath was when miss fenne was just beyond hearing she peered across at me on this christmas morning like a bird at a scorpion caroline caroline she cried for shame the shrimp you will turn the childs head  shrimp i had seen the loathsome doubledup creatures in their boiled state on a kitchen plate my blood turned to vinegar and in rage and shame i fell all of a heap on the table hiding from her sight my face and my hands as best i could under my clothes and wishing that i might vanish away from the world altogether  my fathers voice boomed out in protest my mother took me into her arms to soothe and scold me but long after the ruffled old lady had taken her departure i brooded on this affront away away a voice seemed to cry within and i listened to it as if under a spell all that day i nursed my wounded vanity and the same evening after candle light i found myself for a moment alone in the kitchen pollie had gone to the woodshed to fetch kindling leaving the door into the garden ajar the night air touched my cheek half beside myself with desire of i know not what i sprang out from the doorstep into an inch or so of snow and picking myself up ran off into the darkness under the huge sky  it was bitterly cold frost had crusted the virgin surface of the snow my light footsteps can hardly have shattered its upper crystals i ran on and on into the ghostly world into this stiff marvelous gloating scene of frozen vegetation beneath that immense vacancy a kind of stupor must have spread over my young mind it seemed i was transported out of myself under the stars in the mute presence of the watchman of heaven i stood there lost in wonder in the grey luminous gloom  but my escapade was brief and humiliating the shock of the cold the excitement quickly exhausted me i threw myself down and covered my face with my hands trying in vain to stifle my sobs what was my longing where its satisfaction soft as wool a drowsiness stole over my senses that might swiftly have wafted me off on the last voyage of discovery but i had been missed a few minutes search and pollie discovered me lying there by the frozen cabbage stalks the woeful mænad was carried back into the kitchen againa hot bath a hot posset and a few anxious and thankful tears  the wonder is that being an only child and a sore problem when any question of discipline or punishment arose i was not utterly spoiled one person at least came very near to doing so my grandfather monsieur pierre de ronvel to be exact he was my stepgrandfather for my mothers charming mother with her ringlets and crinoline after my real grandfathers death had married a second time he crossed the english channel to visit my parents when i was in my tenth yeara tall stiff jerky man with a sallow face speckled furlike hair that stood in a little wall round his forehead and the liveliest black eyes his manners were a felicity to watch even at my age you would have supposed he had come courting my mother and he took a great fancy to me he was extremely fond of salad i remember and i very proud of my mustard and cresswhich i could gather for him myself with one of my own tableknives so copiously he talked with such a medley of joys and zests and surprises on his face that i vowed soon to be mistress of my stepmother tongue he could also conjure away reels and thimbles even spoons and forks with a skill that precluded my becoming a materialist for ever after i worshipped my grandfatherand yet without a vestige of fear  to him indeedthough i think he was himself of a secular turn of mindi owe the story of my birthday saint st rosa of lima in peru the only saint i believe of the new world with myself pinnacled on his angular knee and devouring like a sweetmeat every broken english word as it slipped from his tongue he told me how pious an infant my saint had been how when her mother to beautify her had twined flowers in her hair she had pinned them to her skull how she had rubbed quicklime on her fair cheeks to disenchant her lovers ses prétendants and how it was only veritable showers of roses from heaven that had at last persuaded pope clement to make her a saint  perhaps bon papa said i i shall dig and sow too when i am grown up like st rosa to support my mamma and papa when they are very old do you think i shall make enough money papa has a very good appetite he stared at me as if in consternation  dieu vous en garde ma ptite he cried and violently blew his nose  so closely i took st rosas story to heart that one day after bidding my beauty a wistful farewell in the glass i rubbed my cheek too but with the blue flowers of thebrooklime it stained them a little but soon washed off in my case a needless precaution my prétendants have been few  it was a mournful day when my grandfather returned to france never to be seen by me again yet he was to remember me always and at last when i myself had forgotten even my faith in his fidelity nearly all my personal furnishings and belongings were gifts of his from france and many of them of his own making there was my fourpost bed for instance with a flowered silk canopy a carved tester and half a dozen changes of linen and valance there were chairs to match a wardrobe silk mats from persia a cheval glass and clothes and finery in abundance china and cutlery topboots and sabots even a silverhooped bathtub and a crystal toilet set and scores of articles besides for use or ornament which it would be tedious to mention my grandfather had my measurements to a nicety and as the years went by he sagaciously allowed for growth  i learned to tell the time from an eightday clock which played a sacred tune at matins and vespers and later he sent me a watch the least bit too large for me to be quite comfortable but an exquisite piece of workmanship as my birthdays and his drew near i could scarcely sleep for thinking what fresh entrancing novelty the festive morning would bring the only one of his giftsby no means the least ingeniouswhich never after the first flush of excitement gave me much pleasure was a twochambered thatched summerhouse set up on a pole and reached by a wide shallow ladder the roof opened so that on very hot days a block of ice could be laid within the water from its slow melting running out by a gutter but i loved sunshine this was a plaything that ridiculously amused chance visitors it attracted flies i felt silly up in it and gladly resigned it to the tits starlings and sparrows to quarrel over as they pleased  my really useful furnitureof plain old sheraton designwas set out in my bedroom in one half of the room slept pollie a placid but before her marriage rather slowwitted creature about six years my senior the other half was mine and had been made proportionate to my needs by a cabinetmaker from london my father had had a low stone balcony built on beyond my window this was fenced with fine trellis work to screen it from the colder winds with its few extremely dwarf trees set along in green nankin tubs and the view it commanded i could enjoy this eyrie for hoursnever wearied of it in my youth nor shall if i live to be a hundred   i linger over these early recollections simply because they are such very happy things to possess and now for outofdoors  either because my mother was shy of me or because she thought vulgar attention would be bad for me she seldom took me far abroad now and then pollie carried me down to the village to tea with her mother and once or twice i was taken to church the last occasion however narrowly escaped being a catastrophe and the experiment was not repeated instead we usually held a short evening service on sundays in the house when my father read the lessons like a miner prophet as i wrote and told miss fenne he certainly dug away at the texts till the words glittered for me like lumps of coal on weekdays more people were likely to be about and in general i was secluded a mistake i think but fortunately our high plain house stood up in a delightful garden sloping this way and that towards orchard and wood with a fineturfed lawn few cultivated flowers and ample drifts of shade if kent is the garden of england then this was the garden of kent  i was forbidden to be alone in it but pollie would sometimes weary of her charge in which i encouraged her and when out of sight of the windows she would stray off to gossip with the gardener or with some friend from the village leaving me to myself to judge from the tales which i have read or have been told about children i must have been old for my age but perhaps the workings of the mind and heart of a girl in her teens are not of general interest let me be brief a stream of water ran on the southern side all the length of the garden under a high rocky bank its boundary which was densely overhung with ash and willow and hedges of brier and bramble looped with bindweed goosegrass and travellers joy on the nearer bank of this stream which had been left to its wild i would sit among the mossy rocks and stones and search the green tops of my ambush as if in quest of paradise  when the suns rays beat down too fiercely on my head i would make myself an umbrella of wild angelica or water parsnip  caring little for playthings and having my smallest books with me chiefly for silent company i would fall into a daydream in a world that in my solitude became my own in this fantastic and still world i forgot the misadventure of my birth which had now really begun to burden me forgot pride vanity and chagrin and was at peace there i had many proportionate friends few enemies an old carrion crow that sulked out a black existence in this beauty now and then alarmed me with his attentions but he was easily scared off the lesser and least of living things seemed to accept me as one of themselves nor perhaps because i never killed them had i any silly distaste for the caterpillars centipedes and satiny black slugs mistress snail would stoop out at me like a fostermother even the midges which to his frenzy would swarm round my fathers head like swifts round a steeple left me entirely unmolested either i was too dry a prey or they misliked the flavour of my blood  my eyes dazzled in colours the smallest of the marvels of flowers and flies and beetles and pebbles and the radiance that washed over them would fill me with a mute pentup rapture almost unendurable butterflies would settle quietly on the hot stones beside me as if to match their raiment against mine if i proffered my hand with quivering wings and horns they would uncoil their delicate tongues and quaff from it drops of dew or water a solemn grasshopper would occasionally straddle across my palm and with patience i made quite an old friend of a harvest mouse they weigh only two to the halfpenny this sharpnosed furry morsel would creep swiftly along to share my crumbs and snuggle itself to sleep in my lap byandby i suppose it took to itself a wife i saw it no more bees would rest there the panniers of their thighs laden with pollen and now and then a wasp his jaws full of wood or meat when sunbeetles or ants drew near they would seem to pause at my whisper as if hearkening as if in their remote silence pondering and sharing the world with me all childish fancy no doubt for i proved far less successful with the humans  but how it may be asked seeing that there must have been a shrill piping of birds and brawling of water among the stones how could mademoiselles delicate ear endure that racket perhaps it is because the birds being loose in the hollow of space it carried away into its vacancy their cries it is too the harsh rather than the shrill that frets me as for the noise of the water it was so full and limpid yet made up of such infinitely entangled chimings and drummings that it would lull me into a kind of trance until to a strange eye i must have appeared like a lifeless waxen mammet on my stone  what may wholly have been another childish fancy was that apart from the silvery darting flies and the rainbowcoloured motes in the sunbeams fine and airy invisible shapes seemed to haunt and hover around me when all was still most of my fellow creatures to my young nose had an odour a good deal denser than the fainter scented flowers and i can fancy such a fog if intensified would be distressing to beings so bodiless and rare whereas the air i disturbed and infected with my presence can have been of but shallow volume  fairies i never sawi had a kind of fear and distaste for them even in books nor for that matterperhaps because the stream here was too tumbling and opaquea kingfisher but whatever other company may have been mine i had the clouds and the water and the insects and the stoneswhile pimpernel mousetail tormentil the wild strawberry the feathery grasses seemed to have been made expressly for my delight egocentric midget that i was     chapter three   not that in an existence so passive riddles never came my way as one morning i brushed past a bush of lads love or maidens ruin as some call it its fragrance sweeping me from top to toe i stumbled on the carcass of a young mole curiosity vanquished the first gulp of horror holding my breath with a stick i slowly edged it up in the dust and surveyed the white heaving nest of maggots in its belly with a peculiar and absorbed recognition ah ha a voice cried within me so this is what is in wait this is how things are and i stooped with lips drawn back over my teeth to examine the stinking mystery more closely that was a lesson i have never unlearned  one of a rather different kind had another effect i was sitting in the garden one day watching in the distance a jay huffling and sidling and preening its feathers on a bit of decrepit fencing suddenly there fell a sharp crack of sound in a flash with a derisive chattering the jay was flown and then i saw adam waggett half doubled up stealing along towards the place i lay in wait for him with catapult dangling in one hand the other fist tight shut he came along like a thief and i cried hollowly out of my concealment adam what have you there  such a picture of foolish shame i have never seen he was compelled none the less to exhibit his spoil an eyeshut twinkletailed needlebilled jenny wren crumpled up in his great dirty paw fury burnt up in me like a fire what i said to him i cannot remember but it was nothing sweet and it was a cowed adam waggett that loafed off as truculently as he could towards the house his catapult and victim left behind him but that was his lesson rather than mine and one which he never forgot  when in my serener moods pollies voice would be heard slyly hallooing for me i would rouse up with a shock to realize again the little cell of my body into which i had been confined then she and i would eat our luncheon a few snippets of biscuit a cherry or two or slice of apple for me and for her a hunch of bread and bacon about half my size in length and thickness i would turn my back on her for i could not endure to see her gobble her meal having an abhorrence of cooked flesh and a dainty stomach still like most children i could be greedy and curious of unfamiliar foods to a few forbidden black currants which i reached up and plucked from their ranksmelling bush and devoured skin and all i owe lesson number 3 this one however had to be repeated  childhood quickly fleets away those happy unhappy faraway days seem like mere glimpses of a dragonfly shimmering and darting over my garden stream though at the actual time they more closely resembled perhaps a continuous dream broken into bits of vivid awakening  as i grew older my skirts grew longer my desire for independence sharper and my wits more inquiring on my seventeenth birthday i put up my hair and was confirmed by a bishop whom my godmother persuaded to officiate in the house it was a solemn occasion but my mother was a good deal concerned about the lunch and i with the ballooning lawn sleeves and the two square episcopal fingertips disposed upon my head the experience cast a peaceful light into my mind and shook my heart but it made me for a time a little selfconscious of both my virtue and my sins i began to brood not only on the deplorable state of my own soul but also on pollies and mrs ballards and became for a time a diminutive miss fenne i suppose innocence is a precarious bliss on the other hand if ones mind is like a dead moles belly it is wise i think to examine it closely but not too often and to repeat that confirmation for ones self every morning and evening  as a young child i had been of course as naturally religious as a savage or an angel but even then i think i never could quite believe that paradise was a mere fenneland  once i remember in the midst of my multiplication table i had broken out unannounced with then god made the world mamma  yes my dear  and all things in the forests and the birds in the sky andand moles and this i held down my limp coralcoloured arithmetic  yes said she  i wondered a while losing myself as if in wanderings like ariels between the clouds what mamma did he make them of my voice interrupted me  he made them said my mother steadily of his power and love  rapidly i slid back into her company and can we can i make things of my power and love  i suppose my dear replied my mother reflectively and perhaps thinking of my father in his study over his paper and hops it is only that in life that is really worth doing  then i said sagely i suspects thats how mullings does the garden mamma  long before miss fennes and the bishops visitation my mother had set about teaching me in earnest a governessa miss perrywas our first experiment alas apart from her tendency to quinsy it was i who was found wanting she complained of the strain on her nerves my mother feared that quinsy was catching and miss perry had no successor reading was always a difficulty my father bought me as tiny old books as could be found including a dwarf bible a midget pickering shakespeare and a grammar with a menagerie for frontispiece from which i learned that irony is a figure which intends the reverse of what it speaks and under the masque of praise conceals the most biting satyr and the following stanza        hail energeia hail my native tongue      concisely full and musically strong      thou with the pencil holdst a glorious strife      and paintst the passions equal to the life   my mother agreed that strung would be preferable to strong and explained that the passions did not signify merely illtemper while if i pecked overnicely at my food my father would cry hail energeia a challenge which rarely failed to persuade me to set to  my grandfather sent me other pygmy books from paris including a minute masterpiece of calligraphy une anthologie de chansons pour une minuscule aimante et bienaimée par p de r these i could easily carry about with me i soon learned to accustom my arms and shoulders to bulkier and more cumbrous volumes my usual method with a commonsized book was to prop it up towards the middle of the table and then to seat myself at the edge the page finished i would walk across and turn over a fresh leaf thus in my solitude i studied my lessons and read again and again my nursery favourites some of them i gather now undeservedly out of fashion  perhaps even better than fiction or folktales i liked books of knowledge  there were two of these in particular the observing eye or lessons to children on the three lowest divisions of animal lifethe radiated articulated and molluscous and the childhood of the world even at nine i remarked how nimbly the anonymous author of the former could skip from st paul to the lobster and i never wearied of brooding on mr clodds frontispiece this depicts a largeheaded and seemingly onelegged little girl in a flounced frock lying asleep under a wall on which ivy is sprawling for pillow for herself and her staring doll there lies on the ground a fullsized human skull and in the middle distance are seen the monoliths of stonehenge beyond these gigantic stones and behind the far mountains rises with spiky rays an enormous sun  i was that child and mine her sun that burned in heaven and he a more obedient luminary than any lamp of mans i would wonder what she would do when she awoke from sleep the skull in particular both terrified and entranced methe secret of all history seemed to lie hidden in the shadows beneath its dome indeed i needed no reminder from mr clodd that children and some grownup people too are apt to think that things are wonderful only when they are big which is not true  i knew already out of nowhere that the bees waxen cell is more curious than the chimpanzees rough hut though i should have dearly liked to see the latter and that an ant is more wonderful than the huge and dull rhinoceros such is childishness however i pitied the poor rhinoceros his dull over such small things as a nut a shell a drop of rainwater in a buttercup a frond of frost for there were cold winters at lyndsey in those days i would pore and pore imbibing the lesson that the eye alone if used in patience will tell its owner far more about an object than it can merely see  among my few framed pictures i cannot resist mentioning one by a painter of the name of bosch below the middle of it kneeled naked adam and eve with exquisite crimped hair on their shoulders and between them stood god all above and beneath them roamed the animals birds insects and infinitesimals of eden including a longtailed monkey on an elephant a jerboa a dancing crocodile andwho but our cat miaou carrying off a mouse an astonishing inexhaustible piece of thoughtfulness i loved mynheer bosch  shameful dunce miss m may remain but she did in her childhood supremely enjoy any simple book about the things of creation great or small but i preferred my own notions of some of them when my father of a dark clear night would perch me up at a window to see the starscharless wain and the chair and told me that they were huge boiling suns roaring their way through the vast pits of space i would shake my head to myself i was grateful for the science but preferred to keep them just stars and though i loved to lave my hands in a trickle of light that had been numberless years on its journey to this earth that of a candle also filled me with admiration and i was unfeignedly grieved that the bleak moon was naught but a sheer hulk sans even air or ice or rain or snow  how much pleasanter it would be to think that her shine was the reflection of our cherry orchards and that her shadows were just kentish hayricks barns and oasthouses it was too perhaps rather tactless of my father to beguile me with fullgrown authors accounts of the lives of the little accomplished writers they may be butwell never mind as for the lives of the great i could easily adjust monsieur bon papas spyglass and reduce them to scale   my father taught me also to swim in his round bath and on a visit to canterbury purchased for me the nimblest little dun shetland pony whom we called mopsa i learned to become a fearless rider but hardy though her race may be perhaps i was too light a burden to satisfy mopsas spirit in a passing fit of temper she broke a leg though i had stopped my ears for an hour before the vet came i heard the shot  my mothers lessons were never very burdensome she taught me little but she taught it welleven a morsel of latin i never wearied of the sweet oboelike nasal sound of her french poems and she instilled in me such a delight in words that to this day i firmly believe that things are at least twice the better and richer for being called by them apart from a kind of passionate impatience over what was alien to mearithmetic for instance and analysisand occasional fits of the sulks which she allowed to deposit their own sediment at leisure i was a willing and at times even a greedy scholar apparently from infancy i was of a firm resolve to match my wits with those of the commonsized and to be grownup some day  so much for my education a thing which it seems to me is likely to continueand specially in respect of human natureas long as i keep alive with so little childish company without rivalry i was inclined to swell myself out with conceit and complacency its easy holding down the latchet when nobody pulls the string but whatever size we may be in soul or body i have found that the world wields a sharp pin and is pitiless to bubbles  though inclined to be dreamy and idle when alone i was of course my own teacher too my senses were seven in number however few my wits in particular i loved to observe the clustering and gathering of plants like families each of a shape size and hue each in their kind and season though tall and lowly were intermingled now and then i would come on some small plant selfsown shining and flourishing free and clear and even the lovelier for being alone in its kind amid its greater neighbours i prized these discoveries and if any one of them was dwarfed a little by its surroundings i would cosset it up and help it against them how strange thought i if men so regarded each others intelligence if from pitying the dullwitted the sharpwitted slid to mere toleration and from toleration to despising and loathing what a contest would presently begin between the strongbodied stupid and the feeblebodied clever and how soon there would be no strongbodied stupid left in the world they would dwindle away and disappear into time like the mammoth and the woolly bear and then i began to be sorry for the woolly bear and to wish i could go and have a look at him perhaps this is putting my old head on those young shoulders but when i strive to reenter the thoughts of those remote days how like they seem to the noisy wasting stream beside which they flowed on and of whose source and destination i was unaware  all this egotism recalls a remark that mrs ballard once made apropos of some little smart repartee from miss m as she sat beside her pasteboard and slapped away at a lump of dough well i know a young lady whos been talking to the young man that rubbed his face with a brass candlestick     chapter four   in the midst of my eighteenth year fortune began to darken my mother had told me little of the world its chances and changes cares and troubles what i had learned of these came chiefly from books and my own speculations we had few visitors and from all but the most familiar i was quickly packed away my mother was sensitive of me for both our sakes but i think in this she was mistaken for when my time came life found me raw and it rubbed in the salt rather vigorously  my father had other views he argued for facing the facts though perhaps those relating to fruit and paper are not very intimidating but he seldom made his way against my mother except in matters that concerned his own comfort he loved me fondly but throughout my childhood seems to have regarded me as a kind of animated marionette when he came out from his mills and pockets it amused him to find me nibbling a raspberry beside his plate hed rub his round stubbly head and say well mamma and hows trot done this morning or he would stoop and draw ever so heedfully his left little finger down my nose to its uttermost tip and whisper and so to lands end my love now and then i would find his eyes fixed on me as if in stupefaction that i was actually his daughter  but now that i was getting to be a young woman and had put up my hair and the future frowned near this domestic problem began seriously to concern him my mother paled at the very mention of it i remember i had climbed up on to his writing desk one morning in search of a pair of high boots which i had taken off in his study the evening before we had been fishing for sticklebacks concealed from view while the wind whined at the window i heard a quarrel between my father and mother about me which i will never repeat to mortal ear it darkened my mind for days and if  but better not  at this time anxiety about money matters must have begun its gnawing in my poor fathers brains and i know what that means he had recommended to others and speculated himself in some experiment in the cultivation of the trees from which the chinese first made paper and had not only been grossly cheated but laughed at in the press the kentish courieri see his ears burning nowhad referred to him as the ingenious mr tapa and my mothers commiseration had hardly solaced him but my dear you couldnt have gone to canton by yourself we must just draw in our horns a little the ingenious mr tapa patted the hand on his shoulder but his ears burned on  besides my mother added with a long sighing breath as she seated herself again there are the books he plucked his spectacles off and gazed vaguely in her direction oh yes yes there are the books  nor was he long daunted by this attack he fell in love with some notion of so pickling hoppoles that they would last for ever but the press was no kinder to his poles than to his mulberries  and then befell the blackest misfortune of my life i had been ill and for a few days had been sleeping in one of the spare bedrooms in a cot beside my mother so that she should be near me if i needed her this particular evening however i had gone back to my own room we cannot change the past or foresee the future but if only pollie had not been a heavy sleeper if only i had escaped that trivial ailmenthow tangled is lifes skein it was the may after my eighteenth birthday and full moonlight  troubled in mind by my illness and other worries and mortifications my mother not fully aroused perhaps got up in the small hours and mounted the stone staircase in order to look in on me i was awake and heard the rustling of her nightdress and the faint touch of her slippered feet ascending from stone to stone i guessed her errand and in my folly thought i would pretend to be asleep and give her a surprise i drew my curtains and lay motionless on my back as if i were dead with eyes closed listening i smilingly waited  then suddenly i heard a muffled gasping cry and all was utterly icily still i flung aside the silk curtains and leapt out of bed   the moonlight was streaming in a lean ray across the floor of my room i ran down this luminous pathway into the dusk at the open door at the stairhead beyond still and silent i saw my poor dear on through the cold dark air i ran and stood in her loosened hair beside her head it lay unstirring her cheek colourless her hand stretched out palm upward on the stone i called into her ear first gently and pleadingly then loud and shrill i ran and chafed her fingers then back again and stooped listening with my cheek to her lips she exhaled a trembling sigh i called and called but my shrillness was utterly swallowed up in the vast nighthung house then softly in the silence her lids unsealed and her eyes as if wonderful with a remote dream looked up into my face my dear she whispered wakefulness gathering faintly into her gaze my dear is it you there was an accent in her voice that i had never heard before perhaps her tranceful eyes had magnified me then once more the lids closed down and i was alone i fell on my knees beside her and crouched praying into her heedless ear  it was my first acquaintance with calamity and physically powerless to aid her i could think of nothing for a moment but to persuade her to speak to me again then my senses returned to me to descend that flight of stairsdown which hitherto i had always been carriedwould waste more precious time than i could spare there seemed to be but one alternativeto waken pollie i ran back into my bedroom and tugged violently at the slack of her bedclothes a mouse might as well have striven to ring great paul she breathed on with open mouth flat on her back like a log then a thought came to me  there was a brassbound box under my bed a full fifteen inches long though shallow in which my grandfather had lately sent me some gowns and finery from paris with some little difficulty i lugged and pushed this all across the room and out on to the staircase my strength seemed to be superhuman one moment i flew to my mother but now she lay in a profound sleep indeed her cheek like marble with a last effort i edged my box on its side between the balusters and at some risk of falling after it shoved it over into the moonsilvered dusk below the house echoed with its resounding brazen clatter as it pitched from stair to stair then quiet clutching with either hand the baluster i leaned over listening then a voice cried sleepily hah then a call caroline and a moment afterwards i discerned my father ascending the staircase   for weeks i lay desperately ill the chill the anguish and horror of that night had come upon a frame already weakened life was nothing but an evil dream a world of terrifying shadows and phantoms but our old friend dr grose was familiar with my constitution and at last i began to mend pollie stricken with remorse nursed me night and day giving my small bed every hour she could spare in a house stricken and disordered i was never told in so many words that my mother was dead in my extreme weakness i learned it of the air around me of every secret sound and movement in the house  morning and evening appeared my fathers great face in the doorway his eyebrows lifted high above his spectacles to see his misery i almost wished that i might die to spare him more when dr grose gave him permission he sat down beside my bed and stooping low told me that my mother had remembered our last speech together on the staircase and he gave me her last message a thousand and one remembrances of her patience and impulsiveness of our long hours of solitude together of her fits of new life as if she were a tree blossoming in the spring of her voice her dignified silence with miss fenne her sallies with my grandfather her absent musingsthese all return to me  alas that it was never in my power except perhaps at that last moment to be to her a true comfort and companion anything much better in fact than a familiar and tragic playmate worse beyond words how little i had done for her that i might have done  but regret must not lead me into extremes that is not the whole truth there were occasions i think when she almost forgot my disabilities when we were just two quiet equal spirits in the world and conversed together gravely and simply not as children but as fellowwomen it is these i treasure dearest while thanking her for all why in the whirligig of time if my authorities are trustworthy and my life had fallen out differently the problem might now have been reversed i myself might have had naturalsized children and they a pygmy mother the strangeness of the world  out of the listlessness of convalescence my interests began to renew themselves across the gulf that separated us i could still commune with my mothers quiet spirit her peace and the peace of her forgiveness began to descend on me and her grave in my imagination has now no more sorrow than the anticipation of my own from my windowsill loggia i could command a full hundred of kent up there on the barrowed hilltop it was said that on fine days a keen eye could descry the sea to north and south though dr grose dismissed it as a piece of local presumption now that my mother was gone the clouds were stranger the birds more sweetly melancholy the flowers more fleeting something of youth had passed away to return no more  half my thoughts were wasted in futile resentment at my incapacities yet it was a helplessness that in part was forced on me from without still less now could my father take me seriously we shared our silent meals together he would sit moping pushing his hand over his whitening hair or staring over his spectacles out of the window to the low whistling of some endless monotonous tune that would haunt him for days together and fret me to distraction now and again he would favour me with a serious speech and then with a glance perhaps hurry away to his study before i could answer to his halfcompleted dissertations on hop cherry and paper i learned he had added another on the oyster many of his letters were now postmarked whitstable he even advertised in his old enemy the courier for information and would break out into furious abuse at the stupidity of his correspondents meanwhile his appetite increased he would nod in his chair his clothes grew shabby his appearance neglected poor dear he missed my mother  but i made a struggle to take her place every morning pollie would carry me off to the kitchen for a discussion with mrs ballard over the household affairs of the day with her fat floury hand she would hide her mouth and gravely nod her head at my instructions but i knew she was concealing her amusement oh these men she once exclaimed at some new caprice of the masters they are never happy unless they can be where they baint with my own hand i printed out for her a list of my fathers favourite dishes i left off my black and wore bright colours again so that he might not be constantly reminded of the past but when after long debate i took courage one day to propose myself as his housekeeperi shall never forget the facial expression which he quickly rubbed off with his hand  he fetched out of his trousers pocket a great bunch of keys and jangled them almost ferociously in the air at me for a full minute together with tears of amusement in his eyes then he tossed down the last gulp or two of his port and went off a moment after he must have realized how cruel a blow he had dealt my vanity and my love he returned seated himself heavily in his chair and looked at me then stretching out his hand he dropped his face on to his arm a horrible quietness spread over the room for the first time i looked with a kind of terror at the hairy fingers and whitening head and could not stir  how oddly chance repeats itself the door opened and once more unannounced miss fenne appeared in our midst my father hastily rose to greet her pretending that nothing was amiss but when she held out her clawlike hand to me to be kissed i merely stared at her she screwed up her countenance into a smile mumbled that i was looking pale and peaked again and with difficulty keeping her eyes from mine explained that she had come for a business talk with my father  a few days afterwards i was standing up at the window of my mothers little sewingroomalways a favourite refuge of mine for there the afternoon sun and the colours of evening used to beat into the corner and i saw a smallsized woman with a large black bonnet come waddling up the drive she was followed by a boy wheeling a square box on a twowheeled trolley it was mrs sheppey come to be housekeeper to the widower and his daughter  mrs sheppey proved to be a harassed and muddling woman and she came to a harassed home my fathers affairs had gone from bad to worse he was gloomy and morose a hunted look sometimes gleamed in his eyes and the spectacled nose seemed to grow the smaller the more solemn its surroundings were he spent most of the day in his dressinggown now had quarrelled with dr grose and dismissed mrs ballard the rooms were dirty and neglected pollie would maunder about with a broom or stand idly staring out of the window she was in love at least so i realize now at the time i thought she was merely lumpish and stupid  only once in my recollection did mrs sheppey pay my own quarters a visit i was kneeling on my balcony and out of sight and could watch her unseen she stood theretubshaped a knob of dingy hair sticking out from her head her skirts suspended round her bootspassively examining my bed my wardrobe and my other belongings her scrutiny over she threw up her hands and the whites of her eyes as if in expostulation to heaven turned about in her cloth boots and waddled out again pollie told me poor thing that her children had been thorns in her side i brooded over this had i not myself however involuntarily been a thorn in my mothers side i despised and yet pitied mrs sheppey  she was if anything frightened of me and of my tongue and would address me as little lady in a cringing pursedup fashion but i am thankful to say she never attempted to touch me or to lift me from the floor her memory is inextricably bound up with a brown round pudding with a slimy treacle sauce which she used to send to table every tuesday thursday and saturday my father would look at it with his nose rather than with his eyes and after perhaps its fiftieth appearance he summoned mrs sheppey with a violent tug at the bell she thrust her head in at the door take it away he said take it away eat it devour it hide it from gods sight good woman dont gibber take it away  his tone frightened me out of my wits and mrs sheppey out of the house then came the end at the beginning of august in my twentieth year my father who had daily become stranger in appearance and habits though steadfastly refusing to call in his old friend dr grose was found dead in his bed he was like a boy who never can quite succeed in pleasing himself or his masters he had gone to bed and shut his eyes never in this world to open them again     chapter five   am i sorry that almost beside myself with this new affliction and bewildered and frightened by the incessant coming and going of strangers in the house i refused to be carried down to bid that unanswering face goodbye no i have no regret on that score the older i grow the more closely i seem to understand him if phantoms of memory have any realityand it is wiser i think to remember the face of the living rather than the stony peace of the deadhe has not forgotten his only daughter  doubleminded creature i was and ever shall be now puffed up with arrogance at the differences between myself and gross commonsized humanity now stupidly sensitive to the pangs to which by reason of these differences i have to submit at times i have been tempted to blame my parents for my shortcomings what wicked follythey did not choose their only child after all too fellow creatures of any size seem much alike they rarely have nothing to blame providence forthe length of their noses or the size of their feet their bones or their corpulence the imbecilities of their minds or their bodies the accidents of birth breeding station or circumstance yet how secure and perhaps wholesome is mans selfsatisfaction to what ideal does he compare himself but to a selfperfected abstraction of his own image even his venus and apollo are mere flattering reflections of his own he or sheshapes and what of his anthropomorphic soul  as for myself dame nature may some day take a fancy to the dwarf what a pretty play it would bei have clean forgotten where i chanced on this amusing passagewhat a pretty play it would be if from the next generation onwards the only humans born into the world should be of mere pygmy stature fifty years hence there would remain but few of the normalsized in the land imagine these aged few miserably stalking through the dwarfed streets picking up a scanty livelihood in city or countryside where their very boots would be a public danger their very tread would set the bells in the steeples ringing and their appetites would be a national incubus house shop church high road furniture vehicles abandoned or sunken to the pygmy size wars and ceremonies ambitions and enterprises everything but prayers dwindled to the petty would greatgrandfather be venerated cherished admired a welcome guest a lamented emigrant would there be as many mourners as sextons at his funeral as many wreaths as congratulations at his grave and so on and so forthlike jonathan swift  but i must beware partly from fatigue and partly from dislike of the version of miss m that stared out of his picture at me i had begun i remember to be a little fretful when old mr wagginhorne was painting my portrait and i complained pertly that i thought there were far too many azaleas on the potted bush  ah little miss finical he said take care if you please once there was a diogenes whom the gods shut up in a tub and fed on his own spleen he died he died he repeated drawing his brush slowly along the canvas of dyspepsia  he popped round think of that  i can think of that to better purpose now and if there is one thing in the world whose company i shall deplore in my coffin that thing is a cynic that is why i am trying as fast as i can to put down my experiences in black and white before the black predominates  but i must get back to my story my poor father had left his affairs in the utmost disorder his chief mourners were his creditors apart from these one or two old country friends and distant relatives i believe attended his funeral but none even of them can have been profoundly interested in the hop the oyster or the cherry at least in the abstract dr grose owing to illhealth had given up his practice and was gone abroad but though possibly inquiry was made after the small creature that had been left behind i stubbornly shut myself away in my room under the roof listening in a fever of apprehension to every sinister movement in the house beneath  yet if a friend in need is a friend indeed then i must confess that my treatment of miss fenne was the height of ingratitude  in my grief and desolation the future seemed to be only a veil beyond the immediate present which i had neither the wish nor the power to withdraw miss fenne had no such illusions i begged pollie to make any excuse she could think of to prevent her from seeing me but at last she pushed her way up and doubtless the news and the advice she brought were the best tonic that could have been prescribed for me  as a child i had always associated my godmother with the crocodile though not with mr boschs charming conception of it in his picture of the creation yet there were no tears in her faded eyes when she explained that of my fathers modest fortune not a pittance remained in a few days the house with everything in it except my own small sticks of furniture was to be sold by auction i must keep my door locked against intruders all that would be left to me was a small income of about £110 per annum derived from money bequeathed to me by a relative of my mothers whom i had never seen  i fancy your father knew nothing about it she concluded at least so your dear mother seemed to imply but there its a sad business a sad business and that tapa scandal a lamentable affair having thus prepared the way my godmother proposed that i should take up my residence in her house and commit my future entirely to her charge  you cannot be an expensive guest she explained and i am sure you will try to be a grateful one no truly conscientious godparent my dear child ever relinquishes the soul committed to her care i sometimes wonder whether your poor dear mother realized this  but it was my soul if that is brother to the spirit and can be neighbour to pride that revolted against her proposition i had to shut my eyes at the very remembrance of miss fennes prim and musty drawingroom every intimation every jerk of her trembling head every pounce of her jewelled fingers only hardened my heart poor miss fenne her resentment at my refusal seemed to increase her shortness of sight looking in on her from my balcony i had the advantage of her as she faced me in the full light in her chair dressed up in her old ladys clothes like a kind of human alp among my pygmy belongings i tried to be polite but this only increased her vexation one smart tap of the ivory ball that topped her umbrella would have been my coup de grâce she eyed me but never administered it  at last she drew in her lips and fell silent then as may happen at such moments her illtemper and chagrin even the sense of her own dignity drooped away and for a while in the quietness we were simply two illassorted human beings helpless in the coils of circumstance she composed her mouth adjusted her bonnet strings peered a moment from dim old eyes out of the window then once more looked at me  it must be then as god wills she said in a trembling voice the spirit of your poor dear mother must be judge between us she has we may trust gone to a better world  for a moment my resolution seemed to flow away like water and i all but surrendered but a rook cawed close overhead and i bit my lip little more was said except that she would consider it her duty to find me a comfortable and godfearing home but she admonished me of the future warned me that the world was a network of temptations and assured me of her prayers so we parted i bowed her out of my domain it was the last time we met two days afterwards i received her promised letter        my dear godchildmr ambrose pellew an old clergyman friend of      mine in whose discretion and knowledge of the world i have every      confidence has spoken for you to an old married respectable      servant of his now living a few miles from londona mrs bowater      for the charge of thirty shillings a week she has consented to give      you board lodging and reasonable attendance in all the      circumstances this seems to me to be a moderate sum mr pellew      assures me that mrs b is clean honest and a practising      christian when this dreadful sale is over i have arranged that      pollie shall conduct you safely to what will in future be your      home i trust that you will be as happy there as providence      permits though i cannot doubt that your poor dear mother and your      poor father too for that matter would have wished      otherwisethat the roof of her old friend who was present at your      baptism and insisted on your confirmation should have been your      refuge and asylum now that you are absolutely alone in the world       however you have rejected this proposal and have chosen your      own path i am not your legal guardian and i am too deeply      pained to refer again to your obstinacy and ingratitude rest      assured that in spite of all i shall remember you in my prayers      and i trust d v that you will escape the temptations of this      wicked worlda world in which it has pleased god in spite of      selfsacrificing and anxious friends to place you at so      distressing a disadvantage but in his sight all men are equal let      that be your continual consolation see amos vii 2 prov xxxi      2428 eccles xii 1       i remain your affectionate godmother       emma e fenne       psi reopen this letter to explain that your financial affairs      are

dreadful storm that has broken over what we can only trust is a      tranquil resting place r i pe e f   so sprawling and straggling was my godmothers penmanship that i spelled her letter out at last with a minifying glass though rather for forlorn amusements sake than by necessity not that this diminishment of her handwriting in any sense lessened the effect upon me of the sentiments it conveyed they at once daunted me and gave me courage for a little i hesitated then at last i thought out in my heart that god might be kinder to me than miss fenne wished indeed i was so invigorated by the anticipation of the wicked world that i all but called her a crocodile to her phantasmal face couldnt ididnt imyself mean well too what pictures and prospects of the future of my journey of mrs bowater and the network pursued each other through my brain and what a darkness oppressed me when a voice kept repeating over in my mindharris and harris and harris as if it were a refrain to one of my grandfathers chansons messrs harris and harris and harrisi saw all three of them dark men with whiskers but trusted profoundly they would never come to see me  nor from that day to this through all my giddying ups and sobering downs have i ever for a moment regretted my decisionthough i might have conveyed it with a little better grace my body perhaps also my soul would have been safer in the seclusion of my godmothers house but my spirit i think it would have beaten itself to death there like a wasp on a windowpane whereaswell here i am     chapter six   those last few days of august dragged ondays of a burning windless heat yet as days i enjoyed them on some upper branch of my family tree must have flourished the salamander indeed i think i should have been a denizen of venus rather than of this colder darker planet i sat on my balcony basking in the hot sunshine my thoughts darting hither and thither like flies under a ceilingthose strange winged creatures that ever seem to be attempting to trace out in their flittings the starry square of pegasus in spite of my troubles and forebodings and fleeting panics my inward mind was calm i carefully packed away my few little valuables the very notion of food gave me nausea but that i determined to conquer since of course to become at either extreme a slave to ones stomach is a folly  the noise and tramplings of the men in the rooms beneath never ceased until night brought quiet the sale lasted for two days a stale and clouded air ascended even into my locked bedroom from the human beings with their dust and tobacco and perfumes and natural presences collected together in the heat of the great diningroom a hum a murmur the scuffling of feet toiling downstairs with some heavy and cumbrous burden the cries of the auctioneer the coarse voices and laughter the tinkle of glassthe stretching hours seemed endless and every minute of them knelled the fate of some beloved and familiar object i was glad my father couldnt hear the bidding and sorry that perhaps he did not know that the most valuable of his curioshow valuable i was to learn laterwas safely hidden away in an upper room so passed my birthdaythe twentiethnor tapped me on the shoulder with ah but my dear just you wait till i come again  none the less i thought a good deal about birthdays that afternoon and wondered how it was that we human beings can bear even to go on living between two such mysteries as the beginning and the end of life where was my mother now where was i but twoandtwenty years ago what was all this past this history of which i had heard so much and knew so little just a story better brains than mine have puzzled over these questions and perhaps if i had studied the philosophers i should know the answers in the evenings wrapped up in a shawl pollie carried me downstairs and we took a sober whispering walk in the hush and perfumes of the deserted garden loud rang the tongues of the water over the stones the moths were fluttering to their trysts and from some dark little coign the cricket strummed me a solo standing up there in the starry night the great house looked down on me like an elder brother mute but compassionate  by the second day after the conclusion of the sale the removers vans and carts should have gutted the rooms and be gone it had therefore been arranged that pollie should as usual share my bedroom the last night and that next day we should set off on our journey after luncheonthe flavour of its sliced nectarine or is it of one that came later is on my tongue at this momentall the rest of the house being now hollow and vacant pollie put on her hat thrust the large door key into her pocket and went off to visit her mother in the village and to fetch a clean nightdress she promised to return before dark her shoes clattered down the stone stairs the outer door boomed like a gun i spread out my hands in the air and as if my fourposter could bear witness cried softly i am alone marvel of marvels even as i sit here today gazing at my inkpot there in its original corner stands that same old fourposter pollie is living down in the village with her husband and her two babies and once more i am alone is there anything in life so fascinating so astonishing as these queer common little repetitions perhaps on the last daybut i anticipate  i read a little wrote on the flyleaf of my diminutive johnson september 1st lyndsey for the last timem arranged my morrows clothes on a chair then sat down in my balcony to do nothing to be nothing merely to dream but nature decreed otherwise soon after six by my grandfathers clockit struck the hour out of its case as if out of a sepulchrea storm which all the afternoon had been steadily piling its leaden vapours into space began to break chizzel hill with its prehistoric barrow was sunk to a green mound beneath those lowering cloudy heights pooling so placid and lovely a blue between them the very air seemed to thicken and every tree stood up as if carved out of metal of a sudden a great wind with heavy plashing drops of rain swept roaring round the house thick with dust and green leaves torn from the dishevelled summer trees there was a hush the darkness intensified and then a vast sheet of lightning seemed to picture all kent in my eyes and the air was full of water  one glance into the obscure vacancy of the room behind me persuaded me to remain where i was though the rain drove me further and further into the corner of my balcony cold and a little scared by the glare and din yet not unhappy i cowered close up against the glass and shading my eyes as best i could from the flames of the lightning i watched the storm how long i sat there i cannot say the clamour lulled and benumbed my brain into a kind of trance my only company was a blackbird which had flown or been blown into my refuge and with draggled feathers stared blackeyed out of the greenery at me it was gathering towards dark when the rain and lightning began to abate and the sullen thunder drew away into the distance echoing hollowly along the furthest horizons at last with teeth chattering and stiff to my bones i made my way into the room again and the benighted blackbird went squawking to his nest  slipping off my gown and shoes and huddling myself in the blankets and counterpane of my bed i sat there pondering what next was to be done it would soon be night and pollie seemed unlikely to appear until all this turmoil was over i was not only alone but forsaken and infinitely solitary a mere sentient living speck in the quiet sea of light that washed ever and again into the gloomiest recesses of the room and that familiar room itself seemed now almost as cold and inhospitable as a neglected church i could hear the dark vacant house beneath echoing and murmuring at every prolonged reverberation of thunder and sighing through all its crannies and keyholes my bedhangings softly shook in the air gone beyond recovery were my father and mother and i now realized how irrevocably i was no longer a child and the responsibilities of life were now wholly on my own shoulders  yet i was not utterly forlorn the great scene comforted me and now and then i prayed almost without thinking and without words just as a little tune will keep recurring in the mind and now darkness being spread over the garden in the east the moon was rising moreover a curious sight met my eyes for as the storm settled heavy rain in travelling showers was still occasionally skirting the house and when between the heapedup masses of cloud the distant lightning gleamed a faint vaporous lilac i saw motionless in the air and as if suspended in their falling between earth and sky the multitudinous glassclear pearshaped drops of water at sight of these jewels thus crystalling the dark air i was filled with such a rapture that i actually clapped my hands and presently the moon herself appeared as if to be my companion serene remote she glided at last from cover of an enormous bluff of cloud into the faintstarred vault of space seemed to pause for an instant in contemplation of the dark scene then went musing on her way beneath her silver all seemed at peace and it was then that i fell asleep  and while i slept i dreamed a dream my dreams often commit me to a quiet and radiant life as if of a reality less strange to me than that of waking others are a mere uneasiness and folly in the old days i would sometimes tell my dreams to mrs ballard and she would look them up in a frowsy book she kept in the dresser drawer a brown greasestained volume entitled napoleons book of fate then she would promise me a prince for a husband or that i would be a great traveller across the sea or that i must beware of a redhaired woman and nonsense of that kind but this particular dream remains more vividly in my memory than any  well i dreamed that i was walking in a strange gardenan orchard and as it seemed i was either of the common human size or this was a world wherein of human beings i was myself of the usual stature the night was still like the darkest picture yet there must have been light there since i could see as i walked the grasses were coarse and deep but they did not encumber my feet and presently i found myself standing beneath a tree whose branches in their towering sombre heaviness seemed to be made of iron dangling here and there amid the pendulous leaves hung enormous fruitspears stagnant and heavy as shaped lumps of lead or of stone why the sight of these fruits in the obscure luminosity of the air around them laid such a spell upon me i cannot say i stood there in the dewcold grass gazing up and up into those monstrous branches as if enchanted and then of a sudden the ground under my feet seemed faintly to tremble as if at a muffled blow one of the fruits in my dream now come to ripeness had fallen stonelike from above then againthud realization of the dreadful danger in which i stood swept over me i turned to escape and awoke shivering and in a suffocating heat to discover in the moonlight that now flooded my room where in actuality i was  yet still as it seemed the dying rumour of the sound persisted and surely i thought it must be poor careless pollie her key forgotten come back in the darkness after the storm and hammering with the great knocker on the door below hardly a minute had passed indeed before the whole house resounded again with her thumping one seldom finds courage keeping tryst on the outskirts of sleep and there was a vehemence in the knocking as if pollie was in an extremity of fear at finding herself under the vacant house alone in the night the thought of going to her rescue set my teeth chattering i threw back the bedclothes and gazed at the moon and the longer i sat there the more clearly i realized that i must somehow descend the stairs convey to her that i was safe and if possible let her in  three steep stone flights separated us stairs which i had very rarely ascended or descended except in her arms i thrust my foot out all was still i must go at once but what of light the moon was on this side of the house it might be pitch dark on the lower landings and in the hall on the stool by her bedside stood pollies copper candlestick with an inch or two of candle in it and a box of matches it was a thickset tallow candle and none too convenient for me to grasp with this alight in my hand the stick being too cumbersome i set out on my errand the air was cool the moon shone lustily just waked from sleep my mind was curiously exalted i sallied out into the empty corridor a pace or two beyond the threshold my heart seemed to swell up in my body for it seemed that at the head of the staircase lay stretched the still form of my mother as i had found her in the cold midnight hours long ago it was but a play of light a trick of fantasy i recovered my breath and went on  to leap from stair to stair was far too formidable a means of progression i should certainly have dashed out my brains so i must sit and jump sitting manipulating my candle as best i could in this sidling undignified fashion my eyes fixed only on the stair beneath me i mastered the first flight and paused to rest what a medley of furtive sounds ascended to my ear from the desolate rooms below the heavy plash of raindrop from the eaves scurry and squeak of mouse rustle of straw a stirringlight as the settling of dust crack of timber an infinitely faint whisper and from without the whistle of bat the stony murmur of the garden stream the hunting screech of some predatory nightfowl over the soaked and tranquil harvest fields and who whothat shape i turned sharply and the melted tallow of the guttering candle welled over and smartly burned the hand that held it the pain gave me confidence but better than that a voice from below suddenly broke out not pollies but adam waggetts hollaing in the porch adamthe wrenslaughtererprove me a coward no indeed all misgiving gone i girded my dressinggown tighter around me and continued the descent  it was a jolting and arduous business and as i paused on the next landing i now looked into the moonbathed vacancy of my fathers bedroom dismantled littered with paper and the fragments of wood and glass of a picture my mother had given him a great hole in the plaster a broken chair straddling in the midsta hideous spectacle it was an immense moth with greenly glowing eyes lured out of its roosting place came fluttering round my candle fanning my cheek with its plumy wings i shaded the flame and smiled up at the creature which not being of a kind that is bent on selfslaughter presently wafted away the lower i descended the filthier grew my journey my stub of candle was fast wasting and what use should i be to pollies messenger when indeed in the muck and refuse left by the sale i reached the door it was too late he was now beating with his fists at the rear of the house and i must needs climb down the last flight of the back wooden staircase used by the servants when at last the great stagnant kitchen came into view it was my whole inward self that cried out in me its stone flags were swarming with cockroaches  these shelled nocturnal soursmelling creatures are among the few insects that fill me with horror by comparison the devils coachman may be worsetempered but he is a gentleman the very thought of one of them rearing itself against my slippered foot filled me with disgust and the males were winged they went scurrying away into hiding infants seemingly to their mothers whisper whisperi felt sick at the sight there came a noise at the window peering from round my candle flame i perceived adams dusky face with its long nose staring in at me through the glass at sight of the plight i was in he burst into a prolonged guffaw of laughter this enraged me beyond measure i stamped my foot and at last he sobered down enough to yell through the glass that pollies mother had sent him to see that i was safe and had forgotten to give him the housekey pollie herself would be with me next morning  i waved my candle at him in token that i understood at this the melted grease once more trickled over and ran scalding up my arm the candle fell to the floor went out the pale moonshine spread through the air i could see adams conical head outlined against the soft light of the sky though he could no longer see me horror of the cockroaches returned on me instantly i turned tail leaving the lump of tallow for their spoil  how in that dark high house i managed to remount those stairs i cannot conceive youth and persistency i suppose i doubt if i could do it now utterly exhausted and bedraggled i regained my bedroom at last without further misadventure i sponged the smoke and grime from face and hands in my washbowl hung my dressinggown where the morning air might refresh it and was soon in a dead sleep from which i think even the angel gabriel would have failed to arouse me     chapter seven   when i awoke the morning sky was gay with sunshine there was a lisping and gurgling of starlings on the roof the roar of the little river in flood after the rains shook the air at my window and there sat pollie in her outdoor clothes the rest of the packing done and she awaiting breakfast unstirringly from my pillow i scrutinized the plump redcheeked face with its paleblue prominent eyes dreaming out of the window and sorrow welled up in me at the thought of the past and of how near drew our separation she heard me move and kneeling and stooping low over my bed with her workroughened finger she stroked the hand that lay on my coverlet a pretty sight i must have lookedafter my nights experiences we whispered a little together she was now a sedater young woman but still my pollie of the apples and novelettes and whether or not it is because early custom is second nature she is still the only person whom my skin does not a little creep against when necessity calls for a beast of burden  her desertion of me the night before had been caused by the untimely death of one of her fathers three alderney cowsa mild horned creature which i had myself often seen in the meadows cropping among the buttercups and whose richbreathed nose i had once had the courage to ask to stroke with my hand this illfated beast at first threat of the storm had taken shelter with her companions under an oak scarcely had the lightnings begun to play when she was struck down by a thunderbolt it was a tragedy after pollies heart she had she said fainted dead off at news of itand we bemoaned the event in concert in return i told her my dream of the garden nothing would then content her but she must fetch from under her mattress napoleons book of fate a legacy from mrs ballard  but pollie i demurred a dream is only a dream  honest miss she replied thumbing over the pages theres some of em means what happens and comes true and theyll tell secrets too if they be searched about moren a month before mrs ballard fell out with master she dreamed that one of the speckled hens had laid an egg in the kitchen dresser there it was clucking among the crockery and to dream of eggs the book says is to be certain sure of getting the place you are after and which she wrote off to a friend in london and is there now  what more was there to say so presently pollie succeeded in turning to pears in the greasegrimed book and spelled out slowly        pearsto dream of pears is indicative of great wealth which      means riches miss and that you will rise to a much higher spear      than the one you at present occupy to a woman they denote that she      will marry a person far above her in rank lords and suchlike      miss if you please and that she will live in great state to      persons in trade they denote success and future prosperity and      eleviation they also indi indicate constancy in love and      happiness in the marriage state   her red cheeks grew redder with this exertion of scholarship and i burst out laughing ah miss she cried in confusion laugh you may and thats what sarah said to the angel but mark my words if something of it dont hap out like what the book says  then pollie said i theres nothing for it but to open a butchers shop for live in great state i cant and wont not if the prince of wales himself was to ask me in marriage  lor miss retorted pollie in shocked accents and him a married man with grownup sons and all but she forgave me my mockery as for the dream book doubtless young bonaparte must often have dreamed of pears in corsica and no less indubitably have i lived in great statethough without much eleviation  but the day was hasting on my toilet must be made and the preparations for our journey completed now that the dawn of my new fortunes was risen expectancy filled my mind and the rainfreshened skies and leaves of the morning renewed my spirits our trainthe first in my experiencewas timed to leave our country railway station at 33 pm by one oclock all the personal luggage that i was to take with me had been sewn up in a square of canvas and corded the rest of my belongingsmy fourposter etcwere to be stowed in a large packingcase and sent after me first impressions endure no great store of sagacity was needed to tell me that so i had chosen my clothes carefully determined to show my landlady that i meant to have my own way and not be trifled with my dear mrs bowatershe would be amused to hear that  pollie bustled downstairs i stood in the midst of the sunlit dismantled room light and shadow at play upon ceiling and walls the sunpierced air a silvery haze of dust a host of memories and thoughts like a procession in a dream traversed my mind a strangeness tooas if even this novel experience of farewell was a vague recollection beyond defined recall pollie returned with the new hat in the paper bag in which she had brought it from home and i was her lookingglass when she had put it on then from top to basement she carried me through every room in the house and there on the kitchen floor mute witness of the past lay the beetlegnawn remnant of my candlestub we wandered through the garden glinting green in the cool flocking sunbeams after the rain and already vaunting its escape from man pollie was returning to lyndseyi not my heart was too full to let me linger by the water i gazed at the stones and the wild flowers in a sorrowful hunger of farewell trifles soon to be dying how lovely they were the thought of it swallowed me up what was the future but an emptiness would that i might vanish away and be but a portion of the sweetness of the morning even pollies imperturbable face wore the appearance of makebelieve for an instant i surprised the whole image of me reflected in her round blue eye  the waggetts wagonette was at the door but notand i was thankfulnot my adam but the old adam his father my luggage was pushed under the seat i was set up to be screened as far as possible from the wind beside pollie and behind mr waggettno stranger to me with his neat dark whiskers for in the old days at dinner parties he would wait at table i see him nowas gentlemanlike as a devils coachhorseentering the kitchen with his little black bag only once i swiftly turned my head over my shoulder toward the house then we were outside the iron gates and bumping along through the puddles between the bowery hedges towards the station  i thought of my father and mother lying side by side beyond the sullen drift of nettles under the churchyard wall miss fenne had taken me there many weeks before in her faded barouche with the gaunt white mare not a word had i breathed to her of my anguish at sight of the churchyard the whole afternoon was a nightmare she regaled the journey with sentiments on death and the grave throughout it i was in danger of slipping out of her sight for the buttons on the sagegreen leather seat were not only a discomfort but had failed to aid me to sit upright and nothing would have induced me to catch at the trimmings of her dolman to save myself from actually falling off into the pit of her carriage there sat her ancient coachman clutterclutter plodded the hoofs what a monstrous monstrous worldand she cackling on and onlike a hen over its egg  but now the novelty of this present experience the flowery cottages mr waggetts square sorrel nag the ballooning northwesterly clouds the aromatic rusty hedgerows the rooks in the cornfieldsall these sights and sounds called joy into my mind and far too soon the brightpainted railway station at the hillbottom hove into sight and our drive was over i was lifted down into pollies arms again then followed a foolish chaffering over the tickets which mr waggett had volunteered to purchase for us at the rounded window the looming face beyond had caught sight of me and the last words i heard bawled through for any to hear were lor mr waggett id make it a quarter for ee if it was within regulations but taint so the young ladys full natural size in the eye of the law and i couldnt give in to ee not even if twas a honeymooning you was after no doubt it was wholesome to learn as quickly as possible how easy a butt i was to be for the jests of the goodhumoured on that occasion it was a bitter pill i felt even pollie choke down a laugh into her bosom my cheek whitened but i said nothing  an enormous din at the moment shattered around me ten thousand times harsher to my nerves than any mere witticism could be my first steammonster was entering the station all but stunned by its clatter i barely had the presence of mind to thank mr waggett for the little straw basket of three greengages and the nosegay of cherrypie which he had thrust into my arms my canvaswrapped package was pushed in under the seat the door was slammed to the guard waved his green flag mr waggett touched his hat and our journey was begun  fortunately pollie and i found ourselves in an empty carriage the scream of the whistle the grinding jar of the wheels the oppressive odour of mr waggetts bouqueti leaned back on her to recover my wits but the cool air blowing in on my face and a faraway sniff from a little glass bottle with which her mother had fortified her for the journey quickly revived me and i was free to enjoy the novelties of steamtravel my eyes dizzied at the wide revolving scene that was now spread out beneath the feathery vapours how strange it was to see the green country worldmeadow and stream and wooded hillthus wheel softly by if pollie and i could have shared it alone it would have been among my pleasantest memories  but at the next stopping places other passengers climbed into the carriage and five complete strangers soon shared the grained wood box in which we were enclosed there was a lady in black with her hair smoothed up under her bonnet and a long pale nose and up against her sat her little boy a fine fair staring child of about five years of age a blackclothed fat little man with a rusty leather bag over the lock of which he kept clasped his finger and thumb quietly seated himself he cast but one dark glance about him and immediately shut his eyes in the corner was an older man with a beard under his chin gaiters and a hard widebrimmed hat besides these there was a fat countrywoman on the same side as pollie and i whom i could hear breathing and could not see and a driedup birdeyed woman opposite in a check shawl with heavy metal earrings dangling at her ears she sat staring blankly and bleakly at things close as if they were at a distance  my spirit drank in this company so rapt was i that i might have been a stock of wood gathered together in this small space they had the appearance of animals and if they had not been human what very alarming ones as long as i merely sat and watched their habits i remained unnoticed but the afternoon sun streamed hot on roof and windows and the confined air was soon so dense with a variety of odours that once more my brain dizzied and i must clutch at pollies arm for support at this movement the little boy who had more than once furtively glanced at me crouched wriggling back against his mother and edging his face aside piped up into her ear mamma is that alive  the train now stood motionless a fine array of hollyhocks and sunflowers flared beyond the window and his voice rang out shrill as a bird in the quiet of afternoon tiny points of heat broke out all over me as one by one my fellow passengers turned their astonished faces in my direction even the man with the leather bag heard the question the small beadbrown eyes wheeled from under their white lids and fixed me with their stare  hush my dear said the lady no less intent but less open in her survey hush look at the pretty cows  but she is mamma it moved i saw that move he asseverated looking along cornerwise at me out of his uptilted face  those blue eyes a mingling of delight horror incredulity even greed swam in their shallow deeps i stood leaning close to pollies bosom breathless and helpless a fascinating object no doubt never before had i been transfixed like this in one congregated stare i felt myself gasp like a fish it was the old farmer in the corner who at last came to my rescue alive i warrant eh maam he appealed to poor pollie and an uncommon neatfashioned young lady too off to whipham fair ill be bound  the bagman turned with a creeping grin on his tallowy features and muttered some inaudible jest out of the corner of his mouth to the gipsy she eyed him fiercely drawing her lips from her bright teeth in a grimace more of contempt than laughter once more the engine hooted and we glided on our way  i want that mamma whispered the child i want that dear little lady give that teeny tiny lady a biscuit  at this new sally universal merriment filled the carriage we were jogging along in fine style this then was miss fennes network a helpless misery and bitterness swept through me the heavy air swirled and thenwhence from whom i know notselfpossession returned to me why i had chosen my fate i must hold my own  my young admirer much against his mothers inclination had managed to fetch out a biscuit from her reticulea starshaped thing graced with a cone of rosetinted sugar still crouching back like a chick under her wing he stretched his bribe out at arms length towards me in a pink sweatsparked hand all this while pollie had sat like a lump beside me clutching her basket a vacant flushed smile on her round face i drew myself up and supporting myself by her wicker basket advanced with all the dignity at my command to the peak of her knees and stretching out my hand in return accepted the gift i even managed to make him an indulgent little bow feigned a nibble at the lump of food then planted it on the dusty ledge beneath the carriage window  a peculiar silence followed with a long sigh the child hid his face in his mothers sleeve she drew him closer and smiled carefully into nothingness there she murmured now mothers treasure must sit still and be a good boy i cant think why papa didnt takesecondclass tickets  but nor did that kind little ladys papa returned the child stoutly  the kindly old farmer continued to gloat on me gnarled hands on knees but i could not bear it i quietly surveyed him until he was compelled to rub his face with his fingers and so cover its retreat to his own window the gipsy woman kept her ferocious birdlike stare on me with an occasional stealthy glance at pollie the bagmans lids closed down for the rest of the journeythough passengers came and wenti kept well back and was left in peace it was my first real taste of the worlds curiosity mockery aversion and flattery one practical lesson it taught me from that day forward i never set out on any such journey unless thickly veiled for then though the inquisitive may see me they cannot tell whether or not i see them or what my feelings may be it is a real comfort though from what i have read it appears to be the condition rather of a ghost than of a normal young lady  but now the sun had begun to descend and the rays of evening to stain the fields we loitered on from station to station to my relief pollie had at last munched her way through the pasties and sweetmeats stowed in her basket my nosegay of cherrypie was fainting for want of water in heavy sleep the bagman and gipsy sat woodenly nodding and jerking side by side the lady had delicately composed her face and shut her eyes the little boy slumbered serenely with his small red mouth wide open languid and heavy i dared not relax my vigilance but in the desolation that gathered over me i almost forgot my human company and returned to the empty house which seemingly i had left for everthe shadows of yet another nightfall already lengthening over its flowers and sward  could i not hear the silken rustle of the evening primrose unfolding her petals soon the cool dews would be falling on the stones where i was wont to sit in reverie beside the flowing water it seemed indeed that my self had slipped from my body and hovered entranced amid the thousand jargonings of its tangled lullaby was there in truth a wraith in me that could so steal out and were the invisible inhabitants in their fortresses beside my stream conscious of its presence among them and as happy in my spectral company as i in theirs  i floated up out of these ruminations to find that my young pasha had softly awakened and was gazing at me in utter incredulity from sleepgilded eyes we exchanged a still protracted dwelling smile and for the only time in my life i actually saw a fellowcreature fall in love  oh but mamma mamma i do beseech you he called up at her from the platform where he was taking his last look at me through the dingy oblong window please please i want her for mine i want her for mine  i held up his biscuit in my hand laughing and nodding the whistle knelled our narrow box drew slowly out of the station as if heartbroken he took his last look at me petulantly flinging aside his mothers hand he had lost me for ever and pollie and i were alone again     beechwood     chapter eight   still the slow train bumped on loath to drag itself away from the happy harvest fields darkness was near when we ourselves alighted at our destination mounted into a fourwheeled cab and once more were in motion in the rainlaid dust on and on rolled pollie and i and our luggage together in such ease and concealment after the hard wooden seats and garish light that our journey began to seemas indeed i wished for the moment it might proveinterminable one after another the high street lamps approached flung their radiance into our musty velvet cabin and went gliding by ever and again the luminous square of a window beyond the outspread branches of a tree would float on then suddenly our narrow solitude was invaded by the bright continuous flare flung into it from a row of shops  never before had i been out after nightfall i gazed enthralled at the splendours of fruit and cakes silks and sweetmeats packed high behind the glass fronts wasnt i myself the heiress of £110 a year indeed i was drinking in romance and never traveller surveyed golden moscow or the steeps of tibet with keener relish than i the liquid amber ruby and emerald that summoned its customers to a wayside chemists shop twentywhat a child i was i smile now at these recollections with an indulgence not unmixed with envy it is moscow survives not the artless traveller  after climbing a long hillthe wayside houses steadily thinning out as we ascendedthe cab came to a standstill the immense shapeless old man who had so miraculously found our way for us and who on this mild august evening was muffled up to his eyes in a thick ulster climbed down backwards from his box and opened the door at the same moment as if by clockwork opened another doorthat of the last house on the hill i was peering out of the cab then at my home and framed in that lighted oblong stood mrs bowater all utterly different from what i had foreseen this much smaller house this much taller landlady anddear me how fondly i had trusted that she would not for the first time set eyes on her lodger being carried into her house i had in fancy pictured myself bowing a composed and impressive greeting to her from her own hearthrug but it was not to be  pollie lifted me out settled me on her arm and my feet did not touch terra firma again until she had ascended the five stone steps and we were within the passage  lor miss then here we are she sighed breathlessly then returned to the cabman to pay him his fare even dwarfed a little perhaps by my mourning there i stood breathed upon by the warm air of the house in the midst of a prickly doormat on the edge of the shiny patterned oilcloth that glossed away into the obscurity from under the gaslight in front of me and there stood my future landlady for the first time with head thrown back i scanned a countenance that was soon to become so familiar and so endeared mrs bowaters was a stiff and angular figure she too was in black with a long springside boot the bony hands hung down in their peculiar fashion from her elbows a large cameo brooch adorned the flat chest a scanty velvet patch of cap failed to conceal the thin hair sleekly parted in the middle over the high narrow temples the long dark face with its black set eyes was almost without expression except that of a placid severity she gazed down at me as i up at her steadily silently  so this is the young lady she mused at last as if addressing a hidden and distant listener i hope you are not overfatigued by your journey miss please to step in   to my ear mrs bowaters was what i should describe as a low roaring voice like falling water out of a black cloven rock in a hillside but what a balm was its sound in my ear and how solacing this dignified address to jaded nerves still smarting a little after my victory on the london chatham and dover railway making my way around a grandfathers clock that ticked hollowly beside the door i followed her into a room on the left of the passage from either wall of which a pair of enormous antlers threatened each other under the discoloured ceiling for a moment the glare within and the vista of furniture legs confused my eyes but mrs bowater came to my rescue  food was never mentioned she remarked reflectively being as i see nothing to be considered except as food socalled but you will find everything clean and comfortable and i am sure miss what with your sad bereavements and all as i have heard from mr pellew i hope it will be a home to you there being nothing else as i suppose that we may expect  my mind ran about in a hasty attempt to explore these sentiments they soothed away many misgivings though it was clear that mrs bowaters lodger was even less in dimensions than mrs bowater had supposed clean after so many months of mrs sheppeys habits it was this word that sang in my head wood glass metal flattered the light of gas and coal and for the first time i heard my own voice float up into my new apartment it looks very comfortable thank you mrs bowater and i am quite sure i shall be happy in my new abode there was nothing intentionally affected in this formal little speech  which being so replied mrs bowater there seems to be trouble with the cabman and the days drawing in perhaps you will take a seat by the fire  a stool nicely to my height stood by the steel fender the flames played in the chimney and for a moment i was left alone thank god said i and took off my hat and pushed back my hair alone only for a moment though its mistress gone as fine a black cat as ever i have seen appeared in the doorway and stood greeneyed regarding me to judge from its countenance this must have been a remarkable experience  i cried seductively puss  but with a blink of one eye and a shake of its forepaw as if inadvertently it had trodden in water it turned itself about again and disappeared in spite of all my cajoleries henry and i were never to be friends  whatever pollies trouble with the cabman may have been mrs bowater made short work of it pollie was shown to the room in which she was to sleep that night i took off my bodice and bathed face hands and arms to the elbow in the shallow bowl mrs bowater had provided for me and soon wonderfully refreshed and talkative pollie and i were seated over the last meal we were to share together for many a long day  there were snippets of bread and butter for me a little omelette two sizes too large a sugared cherry or two sprinkled with hundreds and thousands and a gay little bumper of milk gilded with the enwreathed letters a present from dover alackaday for that omelette i must have kept a whole family of bantams steadily engaged for weeks together but i was often at my wits end to dispose of their produce fortunately mrs bowater kept merry fires burning in the eveningladies of some sizes cant warm the air as much as most as she put it so at some little risk to myself among the steel fireirons the boiled became the roast at last i made a clean breast of my horror of eggs and since by that time my landlady and i were the best of friends no harm came of it she merely bestowed on me a grim smile of unadulterated amusement and the bantams patronized some less fastidious stomach  my landlady was a heavy thinker and not a copiousthough a leisurelytalker minutes would pass while with dish or duster in hand she pondered a speech then perhaps her long thin lips would only shut a little tighter or a slow convulsive rub of her lean forefinger along the side of her nose would indicate the upshot but i soon learned to interpret these mute signs she was a woman who disapproved of most things for excellent if nebulous reasons and her silences were due not to the fact that she had nothing to say but too much  pollie and i talked long and earnestly that first evening at beechwood she promised to write to me to send me all the gossip of the village and to come and see me when she could the next morning after a sorrowful breakfast we parted standing on the table in the parlour window with eyes a little wilder than usual i watched her pass out of sight a last wave of her handkerchief and the plumpcheeked fairskinned face was gone the strangeness and solitude of my situation flooded over me  for a few days strive as she might mrs bowaters lodger moped it was not merely that she had become more helpless but of far less importance this may in part be accounted for by the fact that having been accustomed at lyndsey to live at the top of a high house and to look down on the world when i found myself foot to foot with it so to speak on beechwood hill it alarmingly intensified the sense of my small stature use and habit however the relative merits of myself and of the passing scene gradually readjusted themselves with a proper respect for the former soon too as if from heaven the packingcase containing my furniture arrived mrs bowater shared a whole morning over its unpacking ever and again standing in engrossed consideration of some of my minute treasures and quite unaware of it heaving a great sigh but how to arrange them there in a room already overoccupied     chapter nine   a carpenter of the name of bates was called in so distant a relative of mrs bowaters apparently that she never by nod word or look acknowledged the bond mr bates held my landlady in almost speechless respect a woman in a thousand he repeatedly assured me when we were grown a little accustomed to one another a woman in ten thousand and if things hadnt been what they was you may understand they might have turned out different ah miss theres one looking down on us could tell a tale i looked up past his oblong head at the ceiling but only a few flies were angling round the chandelier  mrs bowaters compliments were less indirect that bates she would say surveying his days handiwork after he was gone is all thumbs  he was certainly rather snaillike in his movements and spent most of his time slowly rubbing his hands on the stiff apron that encased him but i minded his thumbs far less than his gluepot  many years have passed yet at the very whisper of his name that inexpressible odour clouds up into my nose it now occurs to me for the first time that he never sent in his bill either his memory failed him or he carpentered for love level with the wide table in the window recess strewn over with my small persian mats whereon i sat sewed read and took my meals mr bates constructed a broad shelf curtained off on three sides from the rest of the room on this wooden stage stood my fourposter wardrobe and other belongings it was my bedchamber from table to floor he made a staircase so that i could easily descend and roam the room at large the latter would have been more commodious if i could have persuaded mrs bowater to empty it a little if i had kept on looking at the things in it i am sure i should have gone mad even tact was unavailing if only there had been the merest tinge of a cromwell in my character the baubles that would have been removed  there were two simpering plaster figuresa shepherd and shepherdessnearly half my height on the chimneypiece whom i particularly detested also an enlarged photograph in a discoloured frame on the wallthat of a thicknecked formidable man with a bush of whisker on either cheek and a high quarrelsome stare he made me feel intensely selfconscious it was like a wolf looking all day into a sheepfold so when i had my meals i invariably turned my back on his portrait  i went early to bed but now that the autumnal dusks were shortening an hour or two of artificial light was necessary the flare of the gas dazzled and stupefied me and gave me a kind of hunted feeling so mrs bowater procured for me a couple of fine little glass candlesticks in bed i sometimes burned a waxlight in a saucer a companionable thing for nightthoughts in a strange place often enough i sat through the evening with no other illumination than that of the smouldering coals so that i could see out of the window it was an endless source of amusement to withdraw the muslin curtains gaze out over the darkened fields beyond the roadway and let my daydreams wander at will  at nine oclock mrs bowater would bring me my suppersome fragments of rusk or of bread and milk my food was her constant anxiety the difficulty as she explained was to supply me with little enough to eatat least of cooked food it dries up in the winking of an eye so her cat henry fared more sumptuously than ever though the jealous creature continued to reject all my advances and as far as possible ignored my existence simple victuals by all means miss mrs bowater would admit but if it dont enjoy the inside languishes and you are not yet of an age that can fall back on skin and bone  the question of food presently introduced that of money she insisted on reducing her charges to twenty shillings a week theres the lodging and theres the board the last being as you might say all but unmentionable and honesty the best policy though i have never tried the reverse so in spite of all my protestations it was agreed and i thus found myself mistress of a round fiftyeight pounds a year over and above what i paid to mrs bowater messrs harris harris and harris were punctual as quarterday and so was i i at once paid over to my landlady £13 and whatever other sum was needful the charity my godmother had recommended began and alas remained at home i stowed the rest under lock and key in one of my grandfathers boxes which i kept under my bed this was an imprudent habit perhaps mrs bowater advocated the penny bank but the thought of my money being so handy and palpable reassured me i would count it over in my mind as if it were a means to salvation and became in consequence near and parsimonious  occasionally when she had business to transact mrs bowater would be off to london there she would purchase for me any little trifle required for the replenishment of my wardrobe needing so little i could afford the finest materials my sovereign was worth at least sixty shillings rather than fine mrs bowater preferred things good and for this goodness i must confess she sometimes made rather alarming sacrifices of appearance still i was already possessed of a serviceable stock of clothes and by aid of one of my dear mothers last presents to me a shiny swiss miniature workbox with an inlaid picture of the lake of geneva on the lid i soon became a passable needlewoman  i love bright pure colours and my sweeping and dusting and bedmaking over and my external mourning for my father at an end a remarkably festive figure would confront me in my cheval glass of an afternoon the hours i spent in dressing my hair and matching this bit of colour with that i would talk to myself in the glass too for companys sake and make believe i was a dozen different characters i was young i pined for life and companionship and having only my ownfor mrs bowater was rather a faithful feature of the landscape than a fellow beingi made as much and as many of myself as possible  another question that deeply engaged my landlady was my health she mistrusted open windows but strongly recommended air what insidious maladies she spied around me indeed that september was unusually hot i sat on my table in the window like a cricket in an oven sorely missing my high open balcony the garden and the stream once and again mrs bowater would take me for a little walk after sunset discretion to her was much the better part of valour nor had i quite recovered from my experiences in the train but such walksthough solitary enough at that hour of the daywere straggly and irksome pollies arm had been a kind of second nature to me but mrs bowater i think had almost as fastidious a disinclination to carrying me as i have to being carried i languished for liberty being a light sleeper i would often awake at daybreak and the first call of the birds then the hillwhich led to tyddlesdon end and love or loose lanewas deserted thought of the beyond haunted me like a passion at a convenient moment i intimated to mrs bowater how secure was the street at this early hour how fresh the meadows and how thirsty for independent outings her lodger besides mrs bowater i am not a child and who could see me  after anxious and arduous discussion mr bates was once more consulted he wrapped himself in a veritable blanket of reflection and all but became unconscious before he proposed a most ingenious device with mrs bowaters consent she being her own landlady and amused at the idea he cut out of one of the lower panels of her parlour door a roundheaded opening just of an easy size to suit me in this aperture he hung a delicious little door that precisely fitted it so also with the door into the streetto which he added a brahmah lock by cementing a small square stone into the corner of each of the steps down from the porch he eased that little difficulty may heaven bless mr bates with his key round my neck stoop once stoop twice a scamper down his steps and i was freeas completely mistress of my goingsout and of my comingsin as every selfrespecting person should be  thats what my father would have called a good job mr bates said i cordially  he looked yearningly at me as if about to impart a profound secret but thought better of it well miss what i say is a jobs a job and if it is a job its a job that should be made a job of  as i dot the is and cross the ts of this manuscript i often thinka little ruefullyof mr bates  as soon as daybreak was piercing into my region of the sky and before mrs bowater or the rest of the world was stirring i would rise make my candlelit toilet and hasten out into the forsaken sweet of the morning if it broke wet or windy i could turn over and go to sleep again a few hundred yards up the hill the road turned off as i have said towards tyddlesdon end and loose lanevery stony and steep on the left and before the fork a wicket gate led into the woods and the park of empty wanderslore to the verge of these deserted woods made a comfortable walk for me  if as might happen any other wayfarer was early abroad i could conceal myself in the tussocks of grass and bushes that bordered the path in my thick veil with my stout green parasol and inconspicuous shawl i made a queer and surprising figure no doubt indeed from what i have heard the ill fame of wanderslore acquired a still more piquant flavour in the town by reports that elffolk had been descried on its outskirts but if i sometimes skipped and capered in these early outings it was for exercise as well as suppressed high spirits to be prepared too for the want of such facilities in the future i had the foresight to accustom myself to mrs bowaters steep steps as well as to my cementedin bateses as i called them my only difficulty was to decide whether to practice on them when i was fresh at the outset of my walk or fatigued at the end of it naturally people grow peculiar when much alone self plays with self and the mimicry fades  these little expeditions of course had their spice of danger and it made them the more agreeable a strange dog might give me a fright there was an old vixen which once or twice exchanged glances with me at a distance but with my parasol i was a match for most of the creatures which humanity has left unslaughtered my sudden appearance might startle or perplex them but if few were curious fewer far were unfriendly boys i feared most a hulking booby once stoned me through the grass but fortunately he was both a coward and a poor marksman until winter came i doubt if a single sunshine morning was wasted many a rainy one too found me splashing along though then i must be a careful walker to avoid a sousing  the birds renewed their autumn song the last flowers were blossoming concealed by scattered tufts of bracken where an enormous beech forked its roots and cast a golden light from its withering leaves i would spend many a solitary hour above the eastern treetops my kent stretched into the distance beneath the early skies far to my left and a little behind me rose the chimneys of gloomy wanderslore breathing in the gentle air the dreamer within would stray at will there i kept the anniversary of my mothers birthday twined a wreath for her of ivyflowers and winter green and hid it secretly in a forsaken blackbirds nest in the woods  still i longed for my old home again mrs bowaters was a stuffy and meagre little house and when meals were in preparation none too sweet to the nose especially low i felt when a scrawling letter was now and then delivered by the postman from pollie her spelling and grammar intensified my homesickness miss fenne too had not forgotten me i pored over her spidery epistles till my head ached why if i had been so rash and undutiful was she so uneasy even the texts she chose had a parched look the thought of her spectacling my minute handwriting and examining the proof that i was still a child of wrath gave my pride a silly qualm so mrs bowater came to my rescue and between us we concocted replies to her which i am afraid were not more intelligible for a tendency on my landladys part to express my sentiments in the third person  this little service set her thinking of sunday and church she was not she told me what you might call a religious woman having been compelled to keep her head up in the world and all not being gold that glitters she was none the less a regular attendant at st petersa church a mile or so away in the valley whose five bells of a sabbath evening never failed to recall my thoughts to lyndsey and to dip me into the waters of melancholy i loved their mellow clanging in the lap of the wind yet it was rather doleful to be left alone with my candles and only henry sullenly squatting in the passage awaiting his mistresss return  not that you need making any better miss mrs bowater assured me even a buttercupor a retriever dog for that matterbeing no fuller than it can hold of what it is in a manner of speaking but theres the next world to be accounted for and hopes of reunion on another shore where so i understand mere size body or station will not be noticeable in the sight of the lamb not that i hold with the notion that only the good socalled will be there  this speech i must confess made me exceedingly uncomfortable  wherever i go mrs bowater i replied hastily i shall not be happy unless you are there  d v said mrs bowater grimly i will  still i remained unconverted to st peters why i hardly know perhaps it was her reference to its pew rents or her description of the vicars daughters who were now nursing their father at tunbridge wells or maybe even it was a stare from her husband which i happened at that precise moment to intercept from the wall possibly if i myself had taken a sitting this aura of formality would have faded away mrs bowater was a little reassured however to hear that my father and mother in spite of miss fenne had seldom taken me to church they had concluded that my absence was best both for me and for the congregation and i told her of our little evening services in the drawingroom with mrs ballard the parlourmaid pollie and the boy on the sofa just as it happened to be their respective sundays in  this set her mind at rest turn and turn about on one sunday evening she went to st peters and brought back with her the text and crucial fragments of mr crimbles sermon and on the next we read the lessons together and sang a hymn once indeed i embarked upon a solo as pants the hart one of my mothers favourite airs but i got a little shaky at o for the wings and there was no rambling rumbling chorus from my father but sunday was not my favourite day on beechwood hill mrs bowater looked a little formal with stiff white frilling round her neck she reminded me of a leg of mutton to judge from the gloom and absentmindedness into which they sometimes plunged her quotations from mr crimble could be doubleedged my real joy was to hear her views on the fashions and manners of her fellowworshippers  well so the months went by winter came with its mists and rains and frosts and a fire in the polished grate was no longer an evening luxury but a daily need as often as possible i went out walking when the weather was too inclement i danced for an hour or so for joy and exercise and went swimming on a chair i would entertain myself also in watching through the muslin curtains the few passersby sorting out their gaits and noses and clothes and acquaintances and guessing their characters occupations and circumstances certain little looks and movements led me to suppose that even though i was perfectly concealed the more sensitive among them were vaguely uneasy under this secret scrutiny in such cases though very reluctantly i always drew my eyes away first because i did not like the thought of encroaching on their privacy and next because i was afraid their uneasiness might prevent them coming again but this microscopic examination of mankind must cease with dusk and the candlehours passed rather heavily at times the few books i had brought away from lyndsey were mine now nearly by heart so my eye would often wander up to a small bookcase that hung out of reach on the other side of the chimneypiece     chapter ten   one suppertime i ventured to ask mrs bowater if she would hand me down a tall thin darkgreen volume whose appearance had particularly taken my fancy a simple enough request but surprisingly received she stiffened all over and eyed the bookcase with a singular intensity the books there she said are what they call the dead past burying its dead  spoon in hand i paused looking now at mrs bowater and now at the coveted book mr bowater she added from deep down in herself followed the sea this was in fact mr bowaters début in our conversation and her remark uttered in so hollow yet poignant a tone produced a romantic expectancy in my mind  is i managed to whisper at last i hope mr bowater isnt dead  mrs bowaters eyes were like lead in her long darkskinned face she opened her mouth her gaze travelled slowly until as i realized it had fixed itself on the large yellowing photograph behind my back  dead no she echoed sepulchrally worse than  by which i understood that far from being dead mr bowater was still actively alive and yet apparently not much the happier for that instantaneously i caught sight of a rocky stormstrewn shore such as i had seen in my robinson crusoe and there mr bowater still following the sea  never never continued mrs bowater in her bible voice never to darken these doors again i stole an anxious glance over my shoulder there was such a brassy boldness in the responsive stare that i was compelled to shut my eyes  but mrs bowater had caught my expression he was as some would say she explained with gloomy pride a handsome man do handsome he did never but there miss things being as they must be and you in the green of your youththough hearing the worst may be a wholesome physic if taken with care as i have told fanny many a time she paused to breathe what i was saying is there can be no harm in your looking at the book if thats all theres to it with that she withdrew the drylooking volume from the shelf and laid it on the table beside my chair  i got down opened it in the middle as my father had taught me in order to spare the binding opened it on a page inky black as night all over but starred with a design as familiar to me as the lines on the palm of my hand  but oh mrs bowater i cried all in a breath running across dragging back the curtain and pointing out into the night look look its there its orion  there indeed in the heavens beyond my window straddling the dark star for star the same as those in the book stood the giant shaking his wondrous fires upon the air even mrs bowater was moved by my enthusiasm she came to the table compared at my direction chart with sky and was compelled rather grudgingly to admit that her husbands book was at least true to the facts stooping low i read out a brief passage she listened and it seemed a look of girlhood came into the shadowy face uplifted towards the window so the stars came into my life and faithful friends they have remained to this day  mrs bowaters little house being towards the crest of the hill with sunrise a little to the left across the meadows my window commanded about threefifths of the southern and eastern skies by day i would kneel down and study for hours the charts and thus be prepared for the dark night after night when the weather was fair or the windy clouds made mock of mans celestial patternings i would sit in the glow of the firelight and summon these magic shiners each by namebellatrix huge betelgeuse aldebaran and the rest i would look at one and while so doing watch another this not only isolated the smaller stars but gradually i became aware that they were one and all furtively signalling to me about a fortnight later my old lyndsey friend the dogstar topped the horizon fringe of woodland i heard myself shout at him across the world his sudden molten bursts of crimson betwixt his emeralds and sapphires filled me with an almost ridiculous delight  by the middle of december i had mastered all the greater stars in my region and with my spyglass a few even of the gammas and deltas but much of the zenith and all the north was closed to me andsuch is human greedi began to pine beyond measure for a sight of deneb vega and the chair this desire grew unendurable and led me into a piece of genuine foolhardiness i determined to await the first clear still night and then to sally out and make my way by hook or crook up to my beechroots from which i should be able to command a fair stretch of the northern heavens a quiet spell favoured me  i waited until mrs bowater had gone to her bedroom then muffled myself up in my thickest clothes and stole out into the porch at my first attempt one glance into the stooping dark was enough at the second a furtive sighing breath of wind as i breasted the hill suddenly flapped my mantle and called in my ear i turned tail and fled but never faint heart won fair constellation at the third i pressed on  the road was deserted no earthly light showed anywhere except from a lamppost this side of the curve of the hill i frisked along listening and peering and brimming over with painful delight the dark waned and my eyes grew accustomed to the thin starlight i gained the woods unharmed rich was my reward there and then i begged the glimmering polestar to be true to mr bowater fear indeed if in a friendly humour is enlivening company instead of my parasol i had brought out a curved foreign knife in a sheath at least five inches long which i had discovered on my parlour whatnot  the whisperings of space the calls of indetectable birds in the wastes of the sky the sudden appearance of menacing or sinister shapes which vanished or melted themselves into mere stocks or stones as i drew nearmy heart gave many an anguished jump but quiet and the magnificence of night vanquished all folly at last it seemed to me that a being whom one may call silence was brooding in solitude where living and human visitants are rare and that in his company a harmless spirit may be at peace oblivious of my ungainly knife yet keeping a firm arm on it self seemed to be the whole scene there and my body being so small i was perhaps less a disturber than were most intruders of that solemn repose  why i kept these nightwalks secret i cannot say it was not apprehension of mrs bowater she would have questioned my discretion but would not i think have attempted to dissuade me from them against my will no it may be that every true astronomer is a miser at heart and keeps some lambda or mu or lost nebula his eternal friend named with his name but unrecorded on any chart for my part i hoarded the complete north for a while  a fright i got one night however kept me indoors for the better part of a week in my going out the little house door had been carelessly left unlatched algol and the red planet mars had been my quarry among the floating woolpack clouds the wind was lightly blowing from the northwest after the calm i drew down my veil and set off briskly and lightheartedly for home  the sight of the darklooking hole in the door quickly sobered me down all was quiet however but on entering my room there was a strangeness in the air and that not due to my landladys forlorn trumpetings from above through the floating vaporous light i trod across to my staircase and was soon in bed hardly had my eyes closed when there broke out of the gloom around me a dismal appalling cry i soon realized that the creeping horror this caused in me was as nothing compared with that of the poor beast lured no doubt into the house by henry at finding itself beneath a strange roof  puss puss i pleaded shakenly and again broke out that heartsick cry  knife in hand i descended my staircase and edging as far as possible from the baleful globes greenly burning beneath a mahogany chair i threw open both doors and besought my unwelcome visitor to take his departure the night wind came fluttering there was the blur of a scuttering shapeless form and in the flash of an eye i was sprawling on the floor a good deal shaken with a nasty scratch on my thigh but otherwise unharmed i waved my hand after the fugitive and returned to bed  the blood soon ceased to flow not daring to send my bloodstained nightgown to the wash i concealed it behind my dresses in the wardrobe and the next fine morning carried it off with me and buried it as deeply as i could in a deserted rabbitburrow in the woods such is an evil conscience that first i had the fancy that during my digging a twig had inexplicably snapped in the undergrowth and next for burnt offering i made mrs bowater the present of an oval handglass set in garnets one of my grandfathers gifts this she took down to a local jewellers to be mounted with a pin and wore it on sundays in place of her usual cameo depicting the three graces disporting themselves under a palmtree beside a fountain  meanwhile i had heard a little more about the fanny whom mrs bowater had mentioned my landlady was indeed a slow confider fanny i gathered had a post as mistress at a school some forty miles away she taught the little boys english the fleeting miss perry returned to mind and with a faint dismay i heard that fanny would soon be returning home for the christmas holidays mrs bowaters allusions to her were the more formidable for being veiled i dreaded the invasion would she not come between us  then by chance i found hidden in my starbook the photograph of an infant in arms and of a pensive ringleted woman who in spite of this morsel in her lap seemed in her gaze out of nowhere to be vaguely afraid on the back was scrawled in pencil f six weeksand an extremely cross six weeks f looked for some inexplicable reason i pushed back this ladys photograph into the book and said nothing about it the suspicion had entered my mind that fanny was only a daughter by marriage i sank into a kind of twilight reflection at this it seemed in an odd fashion to make mrs bowater more admirable her husband more formidable and the unknown fanny more mysterious and enigmatical at the first opportunity i crept my way to the subject and asked my landlady if she could show me a portrait of her daughter  the photograph she produced from upstairs had in fading almost become a caricature it had both blackened and greyed it depicted herself many years younger but hardly less grim in appearance in full flounced skirts fanny as a child of about five or six standing at her knee and mr bowater leaning with singular amenity behind her richlycarved chair the fingers of his left hand resting disposedly on her right shoulder i looked anxiously at the child it was certainly crosspatch f and a far from prepossessing little creature with that fixed level gaze mr bowater on the other hand had not yet adopted the wild and rigid stare which dominated the small parlour  mrs bowater surveyed the group with a lackadaisical detachment fractiousyou can see the tears on her cheeks for all what the young man could do with his woolly lamb and grimaces it was the heyday  what was the heyday i wondered was mr bowaterattached to her seemed a less intrusive question  doted she replied polishing the glass with her apron but not to much purposewith an eye for every petticoat  this seemed a difficult conversation to maintain dont you think mrs bowater i returned zealously there is just the faintest tinge of mr bowater in the chin i dont i added candidly see the faintest glimpse of you  mrs bowater merely tightened her lips  and is she like that now i asked presently  mrs bowater rewrapped frame and photograph in their piece of newspaper its looks miss that are my constant anxiety and you may be thankful for being as you might say preserved from the world whats more the father will out i suppose from now till day of judgment  how strangely her sentiments at times resembled my godmothers and yet how different they were in effect my thoughts after this often drifted to mrs bowaters early married life and so peculiar are the workings of the mind that her husbands starchart his sleek appearance as a young father the mysterious reference to the petticoats awoke in me an almost romantic interest in him to such a degree that it gradually became my custom to cast his portrait a satirical little bow of greeting when i emerged from my bedroom in the morning and even to kiss my hand to his invisible stare when i retired for the night to all of which advances he made no reply   my next bout of stargazing presaged disaster i say stargazing for it is true that i stole out after honest folk are abed only when the heavens were swept and garnished but as a matter of fact my real tryst was with another self had my lot been different i might have sought that self in terra del fuego or malay or in a fine marriage mine was a smaller world bopeep i would play with shadow and dewbead and if ulysses as my father had read me stopped his ears against the sirens i contrariwise unsealed mine to the ethereal airs of that bare wintry solitude  the spectral rattle of the parched beechleaves on the saplings the faintest whisper in the skeleton bracken set me peeping peering tippeting and the invisibles if they heeded me merely smiled on me from their grave allseeing eyes as for the first crystal sparking of frost i remember in my folly i sat down bunched up fortunately in honest lambswool and remained minute by minute unstirring unwinking watching as if in my own mind the exquisite small fires kindle and flit from point to point of lichen and bark untilout of this engrossmentlittle but a burning icicle was left to trudge along home  it was december 23rd i remember that date and even now hardly understand the meaning or intention of what it brought me love for the frosty starroofed woods that was easy and yet what ifthough easyit is not enough i had lingered on talking in my childish fashiona habit never to leave meto every sudden lovely morsel in turn when to my dismay i heard st peters clock toll midnight was it my fancy that at the stroke and as peacefully as a mother when she is alone with her sleeping children the giant tree sighed and the whole night stilled as if at the opening of a door i dont know for i would sometimes pretend to be afraid merely to enjoy the pretending and even my small bowater astronomy had taught me that as the earth has her poles and equator so these are in relation to the ecliptic and the equinoctial so too then each one of useven a mammet like myselfmust live in a world of the imagination which is in everlasting relation to its heavens but i must keep my feet  i waved adieu to the woods and unseen wanderslore as if out of the duskiness a kind of reflex of me waved back and i was soon hastening along down the hill the only thing stirring in the cold white luminous dust instinctively in drawing near i raised my eyes to the upper windows of mrs bowaters crouching house to my utter confusion for one of them was wide open and seated there as if in wait for me was a muffled figureand that not my landladyslooking out all my fine boldness and excitement died in me i may have had no apprehension of telling mrs bowater of my pilgrimages but not having told her i had a lively distaste of being found out  stiff as a post i gazed up through the shadowed air at the vague motionless figureto all appearance completely unaware of my presence but there is a commerce between minds as well as between eyes i was perfectly certain that i was being thought about up there  for a while my mind faltered the old childish desire gathered in meto fly to be gone to pass myself away there was a door in the woods better sense and perhaps a creeping curiosity prevailed however with a bold front and as if my stay in the street had been of my own choosing i entered the gate ascended my bateses and so into the house then i listened faintly at last sounded a stealthy footfall overhead the window was furtively closed doubt vanished in preparation for the nights expedition i had lain down in the early evening for a nap evidently while i had been asleep fanny had come home the english mistress had caught her mothers lodger playing truant     chapter eleven   if it was the child of wrath in me that hungered at times after the night woods and solitude to such a degree that my very breast seemed empty within me it was now the child of grace that prevailed with girlish exaggeration i began torturing myself in my bed with remorse at the deceit i had been practising now conscience told me that i must make a full confession the first thing in the morning and now that it would be more decent to let fanny tell on me at length thought tangled with dream and a grisly night was mine  what was that it was day mrs bowater was herself softly calling me beyond my curtains and her eye peeped in always before i had been up and dressed when she brought in my breakfast through a violent headache i surveyed the stooping face something in my appearance convinced her that i was ill and she insisted on my staying in bed  but mrs bowater i expostulated  no no miss it was in a butt they drowned the sexton here you stay and its being christmas eve you must rest and keep quiet what with those old books and all you have been burning the candle at both ends  early in the afternoon on finding that her patient was little better my landlady went off to the chemists to get me some physic i could bear inactivity no longer and rose and dressed the fire was low the room sluggish when in the dusk as i sat dismally brooding in my chair the door opened and a stranger came in with my tea she was dressed in black and was carrying a light with that raised in one hand and my teatray held between finger and thumb of the other she looked at me with face a little sidelong her hair was dark above her clear pale skin and drawn without a fringe smoothly over her brows her eyes were almost unnaturally light in colour i looked at her in astonishment she was new in my world she put the tray on my table poked the fire into a blaze blew out her candle at a single puff from her pursed lips and seating herself on the hearthrug clasped her hands round her knees  mother told me you were in bed ill she said i hope you are better  i assured her in a voice scarcely above a whisper that i was quite well again  she nestled her chin down and broke into a little laugh my how you startled me  then it was you i managed to say  oh yes it was me it was me the words were uttered as if to herself she stooped her cheek over her knees again and smiled round at me im not telling she added softly  her tone her expression filled me with confusion but please do not suppose i began angrily that i am not my own mistress here i have my own key  oh yes your own mistress she interrupted suavely but you see thats just what im not and the key why its just envy thats gnawing at the roots ive never never in my life seen anything so queer she suddenly raised her strange eyes on me what were you doing out there  a lie perched on my lip but the wide light eyes searched me through i went said i to be in the woodsto see the stars then added in a rather pompous voice only the southern and eastern constellations are visible from this poky little window  there was no change in the expression of the two eyes that drank me in i see and you want them all thats odd now she went on reflectively stabbing again at the fire they have never attracted me very muchangels tintacks as they say in the sunday schools fanny bowater was looking for the moon  she turned once more opened her lips showing the firm row of teeth beneath them and sang in a low voice the first words i suppose of some old madrigal she enchants me and if i had my little key and my little secret door but never mind telltale tit her tongue shall be slit its safe with me im no sneak but you might like to know miss m that my mother thinks the very world of you and so do i for that matter though perhaps for different reasons  the calm insolent words infuriated me and yet her very accents with a curious sweet rasp in them like that in a skylarks song when he slides his last twenty feet from the clouds were an enchantment ever and always there seemed to be two fannies one visible her face the other audible her voice but the enchantment was merely fuel for the flames  will you please remember i broke out peremptorily that neither myself nor what i choose to do is any affair of yours mrs bowater is an excellent landlady you can tell her precisely what you please andand i seemed to be choking i am accustomed to take my meals alone  the sidelong face grew hard and solemn in the firelight then slowly turned and once more the eyes surveyed me under lifted browslike the eyes of an angel empty of mockery or astonishment or of any meaning but that of their beauty there you are she said one talks like one human being to another and i should have thought youd be grateful for that and this is the result facts are facts and im not sorry for them good or bad if you wish to see the last of me here it is i dont thrust myself on peopletheres no need but still im not telling  she rose and with one light foot on my fender surveyed herself for a moment with infinite composure in the large lookingglass that spanned the chimneypiece  and ii was exceedingly tired my head was burning like a coal my thoughts in confusion suddenly i lost control of myself and broke into an angry ridiculous sobbing i simply sat there my face hidden in my dry hot hands miserable and defeated and strange fanny bowater what did she do  heavens she muttered scornfully i gave up snivelling when i was a baby then voice manner even attitude suddenly changedand theres mother  when mrs bowater knocked at my door though still in my dayclothes i was in bed again and my tea lay untasted on a chair beside it  dear dear she said leaning anxiously over me your poor cheeks are red as a firebrand miss those chemists darent put a nose outside their soaps and tooth powders it must be dr phelps tomorrow if you are no better and as plump a little christmas pudding boiling for you in the pot as ever you could see tell me now theres no pain anywherethroat limbs or elsewhere  i shook my head she sprinkled a drop or two of eau de cologne on my sheet and pillow gently bathed my temples and hands kindled a nightlight and left me once more to my own reflections  they were none too comfortable one thing only was in my mindfanny bowater her face her voice every glance and intonation smile and gesture that few minutes talk seemed now as remote and incredible as a nightmare the stars the woods my solitary delights in learning and thinking were all suddenly become empty and meaningless she despised me and i hated her with a passion i cannot describe  yet in the midst of my hatred i longed for her company again distracting myself with the sharp and clever speeches i might have made to her and picturing her confounded by my contempt and indifference but should i ever see her alone again at every sound and movement in the house which before had so little concerned me i lay listening with held breath i might have been a mummy in a pyramid hearkening after the fluttering pinions of its spirit come back to bring it life but no tidings came of the stranger  when my door opened again it was only to admit mrs bowater with my suppera bowl of infants gruel not the customary old ladys rusk and milk i laughed angrily within to think that her daughter must have witnessed its preparation even at twenty then i had not grown used to being of so little consequence in other peoples eyes yet after all who ever quite succeeds in being that my real rage was not that fanny had taken me as a midget but as such a midget yet can i honestly say that i have ever taken her as mere fanny and not as such a fanny  the truth is she had wounded my vanity and vanity may be a more fractious nursling even than a wounded heart tired and fretful i had hardly realized the flattering candour of her advances even her promises not to tell of my nightwanderings implied that she trusted in my honour not to tell of her promise i thought and thought of her she remained an enigma cold and hardno one had ever spoken to me like that before yet her voiceit was as if it had run about in my blood and made my eyes shine a mere human sound to set me sobbing more dangerous yet i began to think of what miss bowater must be thinking of me until exhausted i fell asleep to dream that i was a child again and shut up in one of mrs ballards glass jars and that a hairy woman who was a kind of mixture of mrs bowater and miss fenne was tapping with a thimbled finger on its side to increase my terror  next morning thank heaven admitted me to my right mind again i got out of bed and peered through the window it was christmas day a thin scatter of snow was powdering down out of the grey sky the fields were calm and frozen i felt as i might say the hunger in my face looking out there was something astonishingly new in my life everything familiar had become a little strange  over night too some oneand with mingled feelings i guessed whomust have stolen into my room while i lay asleep laid out on a bedside chair was a crimson padded dressingjacket threaded with gold a delicate piece of needlework that would have gladdened my grandfather rolled up on the floor beside it was a thick woollen mat lozenged in green and scarlet and just of a size to spread beside my bed these gifts multiplied my selfreproaches and made me acutely homesick  what should i do beneath these thoughts was a quiet fizz of expectation and delight like water under a boat pride and common sense fought out their battle in my mind it was pride that lost the day when mrs bowater brought in my breakfast she found her invalid sitting up in fannys handsome jacket and the mat laid over the bedrail for my constant contemplation nor had i forgotten mrs bowater by a little ruse i had found out the name and address of a chemist in the town and on the tray beside my breakfast was the fine bottle of lavender water which i had myself ordered him to send by the christmas eve post  well there miss you did take me in that time she assured me and more like a valentine than a christmas present and its being the only scent socalled that ive any nose for  clearly this was no occasion for the confessional even if i had had a mind to it but i made at least half a vow never to go stargazing again without her knowledge my looks pleased her better too though not so much better as to persuade her to countermand dr phelps her yellowish long hand with its worn weddingring was smoothing my counterpane i clutched at it and shamestricken smiled up into her face  you have made me very happy i said at this small remark the heavy eyelids trembled but she made no reply  did i managed to inquire at last did she have any breakfast before she went for the doctor  a cup of tea said mrs bowater shortly a curious happiness took possession of me  she is very young to be teaching not much older than i am  the danger was to keep her back was the obscure reply we dont always see eye to eye  for an instant the dark cavernous face above me was mated by that other of birdlike lightness and beauty isnt it funny i observed i had made quite quite a different picture of her  looks are looks and brains are brains and between them you must tread very wary   about eleven oclock a solemnlooking young man of about thirty with a large pair of reddish leather gloves in his hand entered the room for a moment he did not see my bed then remarking circumspectly in a cheerful hollow voice so this is our patient he bade me goodmorning and took a seat beside my bed a deep blush mounted up into the fair smoothdowned cheeks as he returned my scrutiny and asked me to exhibit my tongue i put it out and he blushed even deeper  and the pulse please he murmured rising i drew back the crimson sleeve of fannys jacket and with extreme nicety he placed the tip of a square icy forefinger on my wrist once more his fairlashed eyelids began to blink he extracted a fine gold watch from his waistcoat pocket compared beat with beat frowned and turned to mrs bowater  you are not i assume aware of thethe young ladys normal pulse  there being no cause before to consider it i am not mrs bowater returned  any pain said dr phelps  headache replied mrs bowater on my behalf and shoots in the limbs  at that dr phelps took a metal case out of his waistcoat glanced at it glanced at me and put it back again he leaned over so close to catch the whisper of my breathing that there seemed a danger of my losing myself in the labyrinth of his downy ear  hm a little fever he said musingly have we any reason to suppose that we can have taken a chill  the head on the pillow stirred gently to and fro and i think its cheek was dyed with an even sprightlier red than had coloured his after one or two further questions and a low colloquy with mrs bowater in the passage dr phelps withdrew and his carriage rolled away  a painstaking young man mrs bowater summed him up in the doorway but not the kind i should choose to die under you are to keep quiet and warm miss have plenty of light nourishment and physic to follow which except for the lastmentioned and that mainly water one dont have to ride in a carriage to know for ones self  but peace and goodwill i liked dr phelps and felt so much better for his skill that before his wheels had rolled out of hearing i had leapt out of bed dragged out the trunk that lay beneath it and fetched out from it a treasured ivory box on removal of the lid this ingenious work disclosed an oriental temple with a spreading tree a pool a longlegged bird and a mountain and all these exquisitely tinted in their natural colours it had come from china and had belonged to my mothers brother andrew who was an officer in the navy and had died at sea this i wrapped up in a square of silk and tied with a green thread during the whole of his visit my head had been so hotly in chase of this one stratagem that it is a marvel dr phelps had not deciphered it in my pulse  when mrs bowater brought in my christmas dinnerlittle but bread sauce and a sprig of hollyi dipped in the spoon and as innocently as i knew how inquired if her daughter would like to see some really fine sewing  the black eyes stood fast then the ghost of a smile vanished over her features ill be bound she would miss ill give her your message alone again i turned over on my pillow and laughed until tears all but came into my eyes  all that afternoon i waited on the coals of fire that i had prepared for my enemys head the night before now ashes of penitence on my own a dense smell of cooking pervaded the house and it was not until the evening that fanny bowater appeared  she was dressed in a white muslin gown with a wreath of pale green leaves in her hair i am going to a party she said so i cant waste much time  mrs bowater thought you would like to see some really beautiful needlework i replied suavely  well she said where is it  wont you come a little closer  that figure as nearly like the silver slip of the new moon as ever i have seen seemed to float in my direction i held my breath and looked up into the light dwelling eyes it is this i whispered drawing my two hands down the bosom of her crimson dressingjacket it is only thank you i wanted to say  in a flash her lips broke into a low clear laughter why thats nothing really and truly i hate that kind of work but mother often wrote of you there was nothing better to do and the smallness of the thing amused me  i nodded humbly yes yes i muttered midget is as midget wears i know that andand here miss bowater is a little christmas present from me  voraciously i watched her smooth face as she untied the thread a little ivory box she exclaimed pushing back the lid and a buddhist temple how very pretty thank you  yes miss bowater and do you see in the corner there a moon she enchants you  so it is she laughed closing the box i was supposing she went on solemnly that i had been put in the corner in positively everlasting disgrace  please dont say that i entreated we may be friends maynt we i am better now  her eyes wandered over my bed my wardrobe and all my possessions but yes she said of course and laughed again  and you believe me  believe you  that it was the stars i thought mrs bowater might be anxious if she knew it was quite quite safe really and im going to tell her  oh dear she replied in a cold small voice so you are still worrying about that ii envied you with a glance over her shoulder she leaned closer next time you go she breathed out to me well go together  my heart gave a furious leap my lips closed tight i could tell you the names of some of the stars now i said in a last wrestle with conscience  no no said fanny bowater it isnt the stars im after the first fine night well go to the woods you shall wait for me till everything is quiet it will be good practise in practical astronomy she watched my face and began silently laughing as if she were reading my thoughts thats a bargain then what is life miss m but experience and what is experience but knowing thyself and whats knowing thyself but the very apex of wisdom anyhow its a good deal more interesting than the prince of denmark  yes i agreed and theres still all but a full moon  aha said she but what a world with only one jupiter has scores hasnt he just think of his love lanes she rose to her feet with a sigh of boredom and smoothed out her skirts with her long narrow hands i stared at her beauty in amazement  i hate these parties here she said they are not worth while  you look lovyou look all right  hm but whats that when theres no one to see  but you see yourself you live in it  the reflected face in the glass which craning forward i could just distinguish knitted its placid brows why if that were enough we should all be hermits i rather think you know that god made man almost solely in the hope of his twolegged appreciation but perhaps you disapprove of incense  why should i miss bowater my aunt kitilda was a catholic and so was my mothers family right back  thats right said miss bowater she kissed her hand to lookingglass and fourposter flung me a last fervid smile and was gone and the little box i had given her lay on the table beside my bed  i was aroused much later by the sound of voices drawing nearer instinctively i sat up my senses fastened on the sound like a vampire the voices seemed to be in argument then the footsteps ceased and clear on the night air came the words  but you made me promise not to write oh fanny and you have broken your own  then you must confess was the cautious reply that i am consistent as for the promises you are quite quite welcome to the pieces  you mean that was the muffled retort  that cried the other softly depends entirely on what you mean by mean please look happy youd soon grow old and uglier if there was only that scrap of moon to light your face  oh fanny will you never be seriousthe misery in the words seemed to creep about in my own mind for shelter they were answered by a sparkling gush of laughter followed by a crisp emphatic knock at the door fanny had returned from her party and the eavesdropper buried her face in her pillow so she enjoyed hurting people and yet     chapter twelve   the next afternoon mrs bowater was out when dr phelps made his call it was fanny who ushered him into the room he felt my pulse again held up the phial of medicine to the light left unconsulted my tongue and pronounced that we are doing very nicely as indeed i was while this professional inquiry was in progress fanny stood silently watching us then exclaimed that it was halfpast four and that i must have my tea she was standing behind dr phelps and for a few seconds i watched with extreme interest but slow understanding a series of mute little movements of brows and lips which she was directing at me while he was jotting down a note in a leather pocketbook at length i found myself repeatingas if at her dictationa polite little invitation to him to take tea with me the startled blue eyes lifted themselves above the pocketbook the square fair head was bowing a polite refusal when but of course dr phelps fanny broke in like one inspired how very thoughtless of me  thank you thank you miss bowater but cried dr phelps with a smooth uplifted hand and almost statuesque in his pose his refusal was too late miss bowater had hastened from the room  his panic passed he reseated himself and remarking that it was a very cold afternoon predicted that if the frost continued skating might be expected conversation of this kind is apt so soon to faint away like a breeze in hot weather that i kept wondering what to say next besides whenever dr phelps seemed impelled to look at me he far more quickly looked away and the sound of his voice suggested that he was uncertain if he was not all but talking to himself to put him more at his ease i inquired boldly if he had many other midgets among his patients  the long lashes swept his cheeks he pondered a while on my landladys window curtains as a matter of fact perhaps not he replied at last as if giving me the result of a mathematical calculation  i suppose dr phelps i then inquired there might be more at any time might there not our glances this time met he blinked  my father and mother i mean i explained in some confusion were just of the comof the ordinary size and what i was wondering is whether you yourself would be sorryin quite a general way of courseif you found your practice going down like that  going down  i mean the patients coming smaller i never had the opportunity of asking our own doctor dr grose at lyndsey you know besides i was a child then now first of all it is true isnt it that giants are usually rather dullwitted people so nobody would deliberately choose that kind of change if then quality does vary with quantity mightnt there be an improvement in the other direction you will think i am being extremely egoegotistical but one must take jacks side mustnt oneeven if ones jill  jack  the giant killer  he looked at me curiously and his finger and thumb once more strayed up towards the waistcoat pocket in which he kept his thermometer but instead of taking it out he coughed  there is a norm he began in a voice not quite his own  ah i cried interrupting him and throwing up my hands there is indeed but why i ask myself so vast a number of examples of it  it was as if a voice within were prompting me perhaps the excitement of fannys homecoming was partly to blame i sit at my window here and watch the passersby norms in mere size dr phelps every one of them if you allow for the few little defects in thethe moulding you know and just think what london must be like why nobody can be noticeable there  but surely dr phelps smiled indulgently though his eyelashes seemed to be in the way surely variety is possible withouterexcess indeed there must be variety in order to arrive at our norm mustnt there  youd be astonished i assured him how slight the differences really are a few inches or ounces red or black or fawn and age and sex of course thats all now isnt it true dr phelps that almost any twenty womenunselected you knowwould weigh about a ton and surely theres no particular reason why just human shells should weigh as much as that we are not lobsters and yet do you know i have watched and they really seem to enjoy being the same as one another one would think they tried to bemanners and habits knowledge and victuals hats and boots everything and if on the outside i suppose on the inside too what a mysterious thing it seems all of them thinking pretty much the same normthoughts you know just fivefootfivers after all one wouldnt so much mind the monotonous packages if the contents were different forty feeding like onewho said that now truly dr phelps dont you feel it would of course be very serious at first for their mothers and fathers if all the little human babies here came midgets but it would be amusing too wouldnt it and it isnt quite my own idea either  dr phelps cleared his throat and looked at his watch but surely he said with a peculiar emphasis which i have noticed men are apt to make when my sex asks intelligent or unintelligent questions surely you and i are understanding one another i try to make myself clear to you so extremes can meet at least i hope so he gave me a charming little awkward bow tell me then what is this peculiar difference you are so anxious about you wouldnt like a pygmy england a pygmy universe now would you miss m   it was a great pity a pygmy englandthe thought dazzled me in a few minutes dr phelps would perhaps have set all my doubts at rest but at that moment miss bowater came in with the tea and the talk took quite another turn she just made it fannys size even dr phelps looked a great deal handsomer in her company more sociable nor were we to remain threes none she had finished but one slice of toast over my fire and inflamed but one cheek when a more protracted but far less vigorous knock than dr phelpss on the door summoned her out of the room again and a minute or two afterwards our teaparty became one of four and its sexes in number at any rate equally matched  by a happy coincidence just as good king wenceslas had looked out on the feast of stephen so mr crimble the curateincharge at st peters had looked in by his ah phelps it was evident that our guests were well acquainted with one another and fanny and i were soon enjoying a tea enriched by the cream of local society mr crimble had mild dark eyes gold spectacles rather full red lips and a voice that reminded me of raspberries i think he had heard of me for he was very attentive and handled my small cup and saucer with remarkable if rather conspicuous ingenuity  candles were lit the talk soon became animated from the weather of this christmas we passed to the weather of last to dr phelpss prospects of skating and thence to the good old times to mr pickwick to our respective childish beliefs in santa claus stockings and to credulous parents fanny repeated some of the naïve remarks made by her pupils and mr crimble capped them with a collection of biblical bons mots culled in his sunday school i couldnt glance fast enough from one to the other dr phelps steadily munched and watched mr crimble he in turn told us of a patient of his a mrs hall who poor old creature was 101 and enjoyed nothing better than playing at old soldier with a small grandson  literally second childhood senile decay he said passing his cup  from mrs hall we naturally turned to parochial affairs and then mr crimble without more ado bolted his mouthful of toast in order to explain the inmost purpose of his visit  he was anxious to persuade miss bowater to sing at the annual parish concert which was to be given on new years eve try as he might he had been unable to persuade his vicar of the efficacy of watch night services so a concert was to be given instead now would miss bowater as ever be ever so kind and would i add my entreaties to his as he looked at fanny and i did toowith one of those odd turns of the mind i was conscious that the peculiar leaning angle of his head was exactly the same as my own whereupon i glanced at dr phelps but he sat fair and foursquare one feeding like forty fanny remaining hesitant appeal was made to him with almost more cordiality than mr crimble appeared to relish he agreed that the musical talent available was not so abundant as it might be and he promised to take as many of the expensive tickets as miss bowater would sing songs  i dont pretend to be musical not like you crimble but i dont mind a pleasant voicein moderation and i assure you miss bowater i am an excellent listenergiven a fair chance you know  but then said fanny so am i i believe now reallyand one can judge from ones speaking voice cant one mr crimblei believe you sing yourself  sing miss bowater interjected mr crimble tipping back his chair the wedding guest here beat his chest for he heard the loud bassoon now conjuring tricks eh phelps with a stethoscope and a clinical thermometer and ill hold the hat and make the omelette it would bring down the house  it was his breast he beat not his chest i broke in  the six eyes slid round as if at a voice out of the clouds there was a pause  why exactly cried mr crimble slapping his leg  but i wish dr phelps would sing said fanny in a small voice passing him the sugar  he must he shall said mr crimble in extreme jubilation so thats settled thank you miss bowater his eyes seemed to melt in his head at his success the programme is complete  he drew a slip of paper from his inside pocket and brandished a silver pencilcase mrs browning the better landbetter and better every year caller herrin to followthough what kind of herrings caller herrings are ive never been able to discover he beamed on me miss finchshe is sending me the names of her songs this evening miss willett and mr bangoro that we two and a queer pair theyd look and my luv is like hardy annuals mrs bullacerecitations abt vogler and no doubt a lord tennyson flute mr piper cello miss oran a niece of lady pollackes and for comic relief tom sturgess of course though i hope he will be a little moreereclectic this year and you and i again he turned his boyish brow on me will sit with mrs bowater in the front row of the gallerya claque phelps eh  he seemed to be in the topmost height of good spirits well thought i if social badinage and bonhomie were as pleasant and easy as this why hadnt my mother  but why in the gallery drawled fanny suddenly from the hearthrug with the little steel poker ready poised miss m dances  the clear voice rasped on the word a peculiar silence followed the lingering accents the two gentlemens faces smoothed themselves out and both i knew though i gave them no heed sat gazing not at their hostess but fanny herself was looking at me now her light eyes quite still in the flame of the candles which with their reflections in mrs bowaters pier glass were not two but four it was into those eyes i gazed yet not into only at  all day my thoughts had remained on her like bubbles in wine all day hope of the coming night and of our expedition to the woods had been as it were a palace in which my girlish fancy had wandered and now though only a few minutes ago i had been cheeping my small extemporary philosophy into the ear of dr phelps the fires of selfcontempt and hatred burned up in me hotter than ever  i forgot even the dainty dressingjacket on my back miss bowater is pleased to be satirical i said my hand clenched in my lap  now was i cried fanny appealing to dr phelps be just to me dr phelps opened his mouth swallowed and shut it again  i really think not you know said mr crimble persuasively coming to her rescue indeed it would be extremely kind anderentertaining though dancingerandunless perhaps so many strangers we can count in any case on your being present can we not miss m he leaned over seductively finger and thumb twitching at the plain gold cross suspended from his watchchain on his black waistcoat  oh yes i replied you can count on me for the claque  the room had sunk into a stillness constraint was in the air then thats settled on new years eve wewe all meet again unless miss bowater there is any hope of seeing you meanwhilejust to arrange the titles and so on of your songs on the programme  no smiled fanny i see no hope whatever you forget mr crimble there are dishes to wash and hadnt you better see miss finch first  mr crimble cast a strange look at her face he was close to her and it was almost as if he had whispered fanny but there was no time for further discussion dr phelps gloved and buttoned was already at the door  fanny returned into the room when our guests had taken their departure i heard their male voices in vivacious talk as they marched off in the cold dark air beneath my window  i thought they were never going said fanny lightly twisting up into her hair an escaped ringlet i think do you know we had better say nothing to mother about the teaat least not yet a while they are dull creatures its pottering about so dull and sleepy a place i suppose what could have inspired you to invite dr phelps to tea really really miss m you are rather astonishing arent you now  what right had she to speak to me like this as if we had met again after another life she paused in her swift collection of the remnants of our feast sulking she inquired sweetly  with an effort i kept my selfpossession you meant what you said then you really think i would sink to that  sink to what oh the dancing you mean how funny you should still be fretting about that still you look quite entertaining when you are cross diaphenia like the daffadowndilly you know good heavens surely we shouldnt hide any kind of lights under bushels should we im sure the reverend harold would agree to that isnt it being the least bit pedantic  i should think i retorted mr crimble would say anything pleasant to any young woman  i have no doubt he would she agreed the other cheek also you know but the real question is what the young woman would say in reply you are too sensitive miss m  perhaps i am oh that i could escape from this horrible net between us i know this anyhowthat i lay awake till midnight because you had made a kind of promise to come in then ii counted the pieces  her face whitened beneath the clear skin oh so we list she began turning on me then checked herself i tell you this she said her hand trembling im sick of it all thosethose fools ph i thought that you being as you aresnippeting along out of the nightmight understand theres such a thing as friendship on false pretences miss m  was she too addressing as she supposed a confidant hardly more external to herself than that inward being whom we engage in such endless talk and argument her violence shocked me still more her fools for the word was still nextdoor neighbour in my mind to the dreadful raca  understand i said i do if you would only let me you just hide in yourin your own outside you think because i am as i am that im only of that much account its you are thefoolish oh dont let us quarrel you just came i never knew every hour every minute inarticulate my tongue might be but my face told its tale she must have heard many similar confessions yet an almost childish incredulity lightened in hers  keep there she said keep there i wont be a moment  she hastened out of the room with the tea things poising an instant like a bird on a branch as she pushed open the door with her foot the slave left behind her listened to her footsteps dying away in a mingling of shame sorrow and of a happiness beyond words i know now that it is not when we are near people that we reach themselves not i mean in their looks and words but only by following their thoughts to where the spirit within plays and has its being perhaps if i had realized this earlier i shouldnt have fallen so easy a prey to fanny bowater i waitedbut that particular exchange of confidences was never to be completed a key sounded in the latch fanny had but time to show herself with stooping almost serpentlike head in the doorway tonight she whispered and not a word not a word     chapter thirteen   was there suspicion in the face of mrs bowater that evening our usual familiar talk dwindled to a few words this suppertime the old conflict was raging in my mindhatred of my deceit horror at betraying an accomplice and longing for the solemn quiet and solitude of the dark i crushed my doubtings down and cast a dismal hostile look at the long face so yellow of skin and sombre in expression when would she be gone and leave me in peace the packed little parlour hung stagnant in the candlelight it seemed impossible that mrs bowater could not hear the thoughts in my mind apparently not she tidied up my few belongings which contrary to my usual neat habits i had left scattered over the table she bade me goodnight but paused in the doorway to look back at me but what intimacy she had meant to share with me was put aside goodnight miss she repeated and im sure god bless you it was the dark quiet look that whelmed over me i gazed mutely without response and the silence was broken by a clear voice like that of a cautious mockingbird out of a wood  it called softly on two honeyed notes mother  the house draped itself in quiet until ten had struck and footsteps had ascended to the rooms overhead i kept close in my bedchamber then i hastily put on my outdoor clothes shivering not with cold but with expectation and sat down by the fire prepared for the least sound that would prove that fanny had not forgotten our assignation but i waited in vain the cold gathered the vaporous light of the waning moon brightened in the room the cinders fainted to a darker glow i heard the kitchen clock with its cracked cantankerous stroke beat out eleven its solemn mate outside who had seemingly lost his voice ticked on  hope died out in me leaving an almost physical nausea a profound hatred of myself and even of being alive well a cold voice said in my ear thats how we are treated that comes of those eyes we cannot forget cheated cheated again my friend  in those young days disappointment set my heart aching with a bitterness less easy to bear than it is now no doubt i was steeped in sentimentality and folly it was the vehemence of this new feeling that almost terrified me but my mind was my world it is my only excuse i could not get out of that by merely turning a tiny key in a brahma lock nor could i betake myself to bed how sleep in such an inward storm of reproaches humiliation and despised love  i drew down my veil wrapped my shawl closer round my shoulders descended my staircase and presently stood in the porch in confrontation of the night low on the horizon at evens with me across space and burning with a limpid fire hung my chosensirius the sudden sight of him pouring his brilliance into my eyes brought a revulsion of feeling he was cutting me dead i brazened him down i trod with exquisite caution down the steps daring but one fleeting glance as i turned at fannys window it was blinded empty toiling on heavily up the hill i sourly comforted myself with the vow that she should realize how little i cared that her room had been sweeter than her company never more would i put trust in any child of man  gradually however the quiet night received me into its peace just as poor soul did the moor desdemona and its influence stole into my darkened mind the smooth columnar boughs of the beeches lifted themselves archingly into the sky soon i was climbing over the mossbound roots of my customary observatory but this night the stars were left for a while unsignalled and unadmired the crisped frostlined leaves scattered between the snakelike roots sparkled faintly years seemed to have passed away dwindled in times hourglass since my previous visit that miss m had ghosted herself away for ever in my reverie the vision of fanny rearose into my imaginationthat secret still fountainof herself asleep now i could no more free myself from her sorcery than i could disclaim the two hands that lay in my lap she was indeed more closely mine than theyand nearer in actuality than i had imagined  a faint stir in the woods suddenly caught my attention the sound neared i pressed my hand to my breast torn now between two incentives two desiresto fly to stay and on the path by which i had come appeared some yards distant in the faint trickling light the dark figure of my dreams  she was dressed in a black cloak its peaked oldfashioned hood drawn over her head the moonbeams struck its folds as she moved her face was bowed down a little her hand from within clutching her cloak together and i realized instinctively and with joy that the silence and solitude of the woods alarmed her it was i who was calm and selfcontained she paused and looked around herstood listening with lips divided that yet could not persuade themselves to call me by name for my part i softly gathered myself closer together and continued to gloat and suddenly out of the faraway of the woods a nightbird loosed its cry ahoo ahoooooohooh   there is a hunter in us all i laughed inwardly as i watched a few months more and i was to watch a liontamer  but let me keep to one thing at a time i needled myself in and almost hooting the sound through my mouth as if in echo of the bird i heard myself call stealthily across the air fannyfanny bowater  the cloaked figure recoiled with lifted head like the picture of a fawn i have seen and gazed in my direction seeing nothing of me amidst the leaves and shadows she was about to flee when i called again  it is i fanny here here  instantly she woke to herself came near and looked down on me no movement welcomed her i was tired of waiting i yawned there is nothing to be frightened about  many of her fellow creatures i fancy have in their day wearied of waiting for fanny bowater but few have had the courage or sagacity to tell her so she had not recovered her equanimity fully enough to refrain from excuses  surely you did not expect me while mother was moving i am not accustomed miss m to midnight wanderings  i gave up expecting you and was glad to be alone  the barb fell short she looked stilly around her the solemn beeches were like mute giants overarching with their starry skyhung boughs the dark slim figure what consciousness had they i wonder of those odd humans at their roots  alone here she returned but no wonder its what you are all about  a peculiar elation sprang up in me at this none too intelligible remark  i wonder though she added you are not frozen likelike a pebble sitting there  but i am i said laughing softly it doesnt matter in me because im so easy to thaw you ought to know that oh miss bowater think if this were summer time and the dew and the first burning heat are you wrapped up and shall we sit here justjust for one dance of the sisters thou lost dove merope  for there on highand i had murmured the last words all but inaudibly to myselfthere played the spangling pleiads clear above her head in the twigswept sky  what sisters she inquired merely humouring me perhaps  the six fanny look you cannot see their seventhyet she is all that that is about south to north i swept my hand across the powdery firmament and i myself trudge along down watling street thats the milky way i dont think fanny i shall ever ever be weaned please may i call you that  she frowned up a moment into the emptiness hesitated thenjust like a white peacock i had once seen when a child from my godmothers ancient carriage as we rolled by an old low house with terraces smooth as velvet beneath its cedarsshe disposed her black draperies upon the ground at a little distance disclosing in so doing beneath their folds the moonblanched flounces of her party gown i gazed spellbound i looked at the white and black and thought of what there was within their folds and of the heart within that and of the spirit of man such was my foolish fashion following idly like a butterfly the scents of the air flitting on from thought to thought and so missing the full richness of the one blossom on which i might have hovered  tell me some more broke suddenly the curious voice into the midst of this reverie  well there i cried is fickle algol the demon and over there where the crab crawls is the little beehive between the roses  præsepe drawled fanny  yes said i unabashed the beehive and crane back your neck fannytheres little jackbythemiddlehorse and far down oh far down berenices hair which would have been fanny bowaters hair if you had been she  even as i looked a remote film of mist blotted out the infinitesimal cluster and see beyond the chair i went on laughing and yet exalted with my theme that dim in the girdle is the great nebulassh and on on that chirruping invisible that fanny is the midget perhaps you cannot even dream of her but she watches  never even heard of her said fanny goodhumouredly withdrawing the angle of her chin from the ecliptic  say not so horatia i mocked there are more things  oh yes i know all about that and these cold monotonous old things really please you personally id give the whole meaningless scramble of them for another moon  but your old glutton has gobbled up half of them already  then my old glutton can gobble up whats left who taught you about them and why she scanned me closely why did you pick out the faintest do you see them the best  i picked out the faintest because they were meant especially for me so that i could give them to you my father taught me a little about them and your father the rest  my father echoed fanny her face suddenly intent  his book do you miss him mine is dead  oh yes i miss him was the serene retort and so i fancy does mother  oh fanny i am sorry she told mesomething like that  you need not be i suppose god chooses ones parents quite deliberately praise him from whom all blessings flow she smoothed out her black cloak over her ankles raised her face again into the dwindling moonlight and gently smiled at me i am glad i came midgetina though its suicidally cold pardi on sent dieu bien à son aise ici we are going to be great friends arent we her eyes swept over me would you like that  friends indeed and as if she had offered me a lump of sugar  i gravely nodded but i must come to you you cant come to me no one has except perhaps my mothera little  oh yes she replied cautiously piercing her eyes at me that is a riddle you must tell me about your childhood not that i love children or my own childhood either i had enough of that to last me a lifetime i shant pass it on though i promise you midgetina if i ever do have a baby i will anoint its little backbone with the grease of moles bats and dormice and make it like you was your mother she began again after a pause of reflection are you sorry i mean you arentyou arent  her look supplied the missing words sorry that i am a midget fanny people think i must be but why it is all i am all i ever was i am myself inside like everybody else and yet you know not quite like everybody else i sometimes thinki laughed at the memoryi was asking dr phelps about that besides would you bealone  not when i was alone perhaps still it must be rather odd miss needleinahaystack as for being aloneonce again our owl if owl it was much nearer now screeched its screech in the wintry woodsi hate it  but surely expostulated the wiseacre in me thats what we cannot help being we even die alone fanny  oh but im going to help it im not dead yet do you ever think of the future  for an instant its great black hole yawned close but i shook my head  well that replied she is what fanny bowater is doing all the time theres nothing she added satirically so important so imperative for teachers as learning and you must learn your lesson my dear before you are heard itif you want to escape a slapping every little donkey knows that  i suppose the truth is said i as if seized with a bright idea there are two kinds of ambitions of wants i mean we are all like those chinese boxes and some of us want to live in the biggest the outsidest we can possibly manage and some in the inmost one of all the one i added a little drearily no one can share  quite quite true said fanny mimicking my sententiousness the teeniest tiniest ickiest one which no mortal ingenuity has ever been able to openand so discover the nothing inside i know your chinese boxes  poor fanny i cried rising up and kneeling beside the icecold hand that lay on the frosty leaves all that i have shall help you  infatuated thing i stooped low as i knelt and stroked softly with my own the outstretched fingers on which she was leaning  i might have been a pet animal for all the heed she paid to my caress fanny i whispered tragically will you please sing to meif you are not frozenly cold you rememberthe moon song i have never forgotten it and only three notes yet it sometimes wakes me at night its queer isnt it being you and me  she laughed tilting her chin and her voice began at once to sing as if at the scarcely opened door of her throat and a tune so plain it seemed but the words speaking        twas a cuckoo cried cuckoo      in the youth of the year      and the timid things nesting      crouched ruffled in fear      and the cuckoo cried cuckoo      for the honest to hear       onetwo notes a bell sound      in the blue and the green      cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo      and a silence between       ay mistress have a care lest      harsh love he hie by      and for kindness a monster      to nourish you try      in your bosom to lie      cuckoo and a cuckoo      and cuckoo   the sounds fell like beads into the quietas if a small child had come up out of her heart and gone down again and she callous and unmoved i cannot say why the clear muted notes saddened and thrilled me so was she the monster  i had drawn back and stayed eyeing her pale face the high cheek the delicate straight nose the darkened lips the slim black eyebrows the light clear unfathomable eyes reflecting the solitude and the thin brilliance of the wood yet the secret of herself remained her own she tried in vain not to be disturbed at my scrutiny  well she inquired at last with motionless glance fixed on the distance do you think you could honestly give me a testimonial miss midget  it is strange the sphinx had spoken yet without much enlightenment now look at me i commanded if i went away you couldnt follow when you go away you cannot escape from me i can go back andand be where i was my own meaning was halfconcealed from me but a startled something that had not been there before peeped out of those eyes so close to mine  if she said i could care like that too yet wanted nothing then i should be free too  what do you mean said i lifting my hand from the unanswering fingers  i mean she exclaimed leaping to her feet that im sick to death of the stars and am going home to bed hateful listening old woods  i turned sharp round as if in apprehension that some secret hearer might have caught her remark but fanny stretched out her arms and laughing a foolish tune in affected abandonment began softly to dance in the crisp leaves quite lost to me again so twirling she set off down the path by which she had come trespassing a physical exhaustion came over me i watched her no more but stumbled along with unheeding eyes in her wake what had i not given i thought bitterly and this my reward thus solitary i had gone only a little distance and had reached the outskirts of the woods when a far from indifferent fanny came hastening back to intercept me  and no wonder she had remembered to attire herself becomingly for her moonlight tryst but had forgotten the door key we stood looking at one another aghast as from eternity i suppose have all fellowconspirators in danger of discovery it was i who first awoke to action there was but one thing to be done and warning fanny that i had never before attempted to unlatch the big front door of her mothers house i set off resolutely down the hill  you walk so slowly she said suddenly turning back on me i will carry you  again we paused i looked up at her with an inextricable medley of emotions struggling together in my mind and shook my head  but why why she repeated impatiently we could get there in half the time  if you could fly fanny id walk i replied stubbornly  you mean and her cold anger distorted her face oh pride what childish nonsense and you said we were to be friends do you suppose i care whether but the question remained unfinished  i am your friend said i and that is why i will not i will not give way to you it was hardly friendship that gleamed out of the wide eyes then but mine the victorya victory in which only a tithe of the spoils unrecognized by the vanquished had fallen to the victor  without another word she turned on her heel and for the rest of our dejected journey she might have been mistaken for a cross nurse trailing on pace for pace beside a rebellious child my dignity was less ruffled than hers however and for a brief while i had earned my freedom  arrived at the house dumbly hostile in the luminous night fanny concealed herself as best she could behind the gatepost and kept watch on the windows far away in the stillness we heard a footfall echoing on the hill there is some one coming she whispered you must hurry she might i think have serpented her way in by my own little door where the head leads the heart may follow but she did not suggest it nor did i  i tugged and pushed as best i could but the umbrella with which from a chair i at last managed to draw the upper bolt of the door was extremely cumbersome the latch for a while resisted my efforts and the knowledge that fanny was fretting and fuming behind the gatepost hardly increased my skill the house was sunken in quiet mrs bowater apparently was sleeping without her usual accompaniment only henry shared my labours and he sat moodily at the foot of the stairs refusing to draw near until at the same moment fanny entered and he leapt out  once safely within and the door closed and bolted again fanny stood for a few moments listening then with a sigh and a curious gesture she bent herself and kissed the black veil that concealed my fair hair  i am sorry midgetina she whispered into its folds i was impatient mother wouldnt have liked the astronomy you know that was all and i am truly sorry forfor  my dear i replied in firm elderly tones whose echo is in my ear to this very day my dear it was my mind you hurt not my feelings with that piece of sententiousness i scrambled blindly through my batess doorway shut the door behind me and more disturbed at heart than i can tell soon sank into the thronging slumber of the guilty and the obsessed     chapter fourteen   when my eyes opened next morning a strange still glare lay over the ceiling and i looked out of my window on a world mantled and cold with snow for a while i forgot the fever of the last few days in watching the birds hopping and twittering among the crumbs that mrs bowater scattered out on the windowsill for my pleasure and yettheir every virtue every grace fanny bowater all were thine the very snow in my girlish fantasy was the fairness beneath which the unknown self in her must as i fondly believed lie slumbering a beauty that hid also from me for a while the restless selfcentred mind how believe that such beauty is any the less a gift to its possessor than its bespeckled breast and song to a thrush its sheen to a starling it is a riddle that still baffles me if we are all shut up in our bodies as the poets and the scriptures say we are then how is it that many of the loveliest seem to be all but uninhabited or to harbour such dingy tenants while quite plain faces may throng with animated ghosts  fanny did not come to share my delight in the snow that morning and as i looked out on it waiting on in vain hope flagged and a sadness stole over its beauty probably she had not given the fantastic lodger a thought she slid through life it seemed as easily as a seal through water but i was not the only friend who survived her caprices in spite of her warning about the dishwashing mr crimble came to see her that afternoon she was out with a little bundle of papers in his hand he paused at the gatepost to push his spectacles more firmly on to his nose and cast a kind of homeless look over the fields before turning his face towards st peters next day holy innocents he came again but this time with more determination for he asked to see me  to rid myself as far as possible of one piece of duplicity i at once took the bull by the horns and in the presence of mrs bowater boldly invited him to stay to tea with a flurried glance of the eye in her direction he accepted my invitation  a cold afternoon mrs bowater he intoned the cup that cheers the cup that cheers  my landlady left the conventions to take care of themselves and presently he and i found ourselves positively têteàtête over her seed cake and thin bread and butter  but though we both set to work to make conversation an absent intentness in his manner a listening turn of his head hinted that his thoughts were not wholly with me  are you long with us he inquired stirring his tea  i am quite quite happy here i replied with a sigh  ah he replied a little wistfully taking a sip how few of us have the courage to confess that perhaps it flatters us to suppose we are miserable it is this pessimismof a mechanical a scientific agewhich we have chiefly to contend against we dont often see you at st peters i think  you wouldnt see very much of me if i did come i replied a little tartly possibly it was his we that had fretted me it seemed needlessly egotistical on the other hand i added wouldnt there be a risk of the congregation seeing nothing else  mr crimble opened his mouth and laughed i wish he said with a gallant little bow there were more like you  more like me mr crimble  i mean he explained darting a glance at the furniture of my bedroom whose curtains to my annoyance hung withdrawn i mean thatthat youthat so many of us refuse to see the facts of life to look them in the face miss m there is nothing to fear  we were getting along famously and i begged him to take some of mrs bowaters black currant jam  but then i have plenty of time i said agreeably and the real difficulty is to get the facts to face me dear me if only now i had some of miss bowaters brains  a veil seemed suddenly to lift from his face and as suddenly to descend again so too he had for a moment stopped eating then as suddenly begun eating again  ah miss bowater she is indeed clever aa brilliant young lady the very life of a party i assure you and yet do you know in parochial gatherings try as i may i occasionally find it very difficult to get people to mix the little social formulas the prejudices yet surely miss m religion should be the great solvent at least that is my view  he munched away more vigorously and gazed through his spectacles out through my windowblinds  mixing people must be very wearisome i suggested examining his face  wearisome he repeated blandly i am sometimes at my wits end no a curates life is not a happy one yet he confessed it almost with joy  and the visiting i said and then alas my tongue began to run away with me he was falling back again into what i may call his company voice and i pined to talk to the real mr crimble little dreaming how soon that want was to be satiated  i sometimes wonder do you know if religion is made difficult enough  but i assure you he replied politely but firmly a true religion is exceedingly difficult the eye of a needlewe mustnt forget that  ah yes said i warmly that eye will be narrow enough even for a person with my little advantages i remember my mothers cook telling me when i was a child that in the old days really wicked people if they wanted to return to the church had to do so in a sheet with ashes on their heads you know and carrying a long lighted candle she said that if the door was shut against them they died in torment and went to hell but she was a roman catholic like my grandmother  mr crimble peered at me as if over a wall  i remember too i went on one summers day as a very little girl i was taken to the evening service and the singingbursting out like that you know with the panting and the yowling of the organ made me faint and sick and i jumped right out of the window  jumped out of the window cried my visitor in consternation  yes we were at the back pollie my nursemaid had put me up in the niche you see and i dragged her hand away but i didnt hurt myself the grass was thick in the churchyard i fell light and i had plenty of clothes on i rather enjoyed itthe air and the tombstones and though i had my gasps the eye seemed big enough when i was a child but afterwardswhen i was confirmedi thought of hell a good deal i cant see it so plainly now wide low and black with a few demons that cant be right  my dear young lady cried mr crimble as if shocked is it wise to attempt it it must be admitted of course that if we do not take advantage of the benefits bestowed upon us by providence in a christian community we cannot escape his displeasure the absence from his love  yes i said looking at him in sudden intimacy i believe that and i pondered a while following up my own thoughts have you ever read mr clodds childhood of the world mr crimble  by the momentary confusion of his face i gathered that he had not mr clodd ah yes the writer on primitive man  this was only a little book for the young you know but in it mr clodd says i remember that even the most shocking old forms of religion were not invented by devils they were mans struggles from darkness to twilight what he meant was that no man loves darkness at least i added with a sudden gush of remembrances not without the stars  that is exceedingly true replied mr crimble and talking of stars what a wonderful sight it was the night before last the whole heavens one spangle of diamonds i was returning from visiting a sick parishioner mr hubbins then it was his foot that fanny and i had heard reverberating on the hill i hastily hid my face in my cup but he appeared not to have noticed my confusion he took another slice of bread and butter folded it carefully in two then peered up out of the corner of his round eye at me and added solemnly sick i regret to say no longer  dead i cried from the bottom of my heart and again looked at him  then my eyes strayed to the silent scene beyond the window silent it seemed with the very presence of poor mr hubbins i should not like to go to hell in the snow i said ruminatingly out of the past welled into memory an old ballad my mother had taught me        this ae nighte this ae nighte        every nighte and alle      fire and sleet and candlelighte        and christe receive thy saule   beautiful beautiful murmured mr crimble yet not without a trace of alarm in his dark eyes but believe me i am not suggesting that mr hubbins his was i am told a wonderfully peaceful end  peaceful oh but surely not in his mind mr crimble surely one must be more alive in that last hour than everjust when ones going away at any rate and i couldnt refrain a sigh almost of envy i hope i shall be was mr hubbins a good man  he was a most regular churchgoer replied my visitor a little unsteadily a familyman one of our sidesmen in fact he will be greatly missed you may remember what mr ruskin wrote of his father here lies an entirely honest merchant mr ruskin senior was as a matter of fact in the wine trade mr hubbins i believe was in linen though of course it amounts to the same thing but havent we and he cleared his throat havent weerstrayed into a rather lugubrious subject  we have strayed into a rather lugubrious world said i  of course of course but believe me we mustnt always think too closely days and moments quickly flying true enough though hardly appropriate as a matter of fact at this particular season in the christian year but on the other hand we may make our lives sublime does not yet another poet tell us that although perhaps mr hub  yes i interposed eagerly the lover of books in me at once rising to the bait but what do you think longfellow absolutely meant by his sailor on the main of life being comforted you remember by somebody else having been shipwrecked and just leaving footprints in the sand i used to wonder and wonder does the poem imply mr crimble that merely to be born is to be shipwrecked i dont think that can be so because longfellow was quite a cheerful man wasnt heat least for a poet for my part i ran on now thoroughly at home with my visitor and on familiar ground i am sure i prefer poor friday do you remember how robinson crusoe described him soon after the rescue from the savages as without passions sullenness or designs even though he did poor thing have a hankering stomach after some of the flesh not that i mean to suggest i added hastily that mr hubbins was in any sense a cannibal  by no means said mr crimble helplessly but there and he brushed his knees with his handkerchief i fear you are too much of a reader for me andand critic for that very reason i do hope miss m you will sometimes contrive to pay a visit to st peters mother church has room for all you know in herabout her footstool he smiled at me very kindly and our organist mr temple has been treating us to some charmingly quaint old carolsat least the words seem a little quaint to a modern ear but i cannot boast of being a student of poetry parochial work leaves little time even for the classics        odi profanum vulgus et arceo      favete linguis   he almost chirped the delightful words in a high pleasant voice but except for the first three of them they were too many for my small latin and i afterwards forgot to test the aptness of his quotation i was just about to ask him with some little unwillingness to translate the whole ode for me when i heard fannys step at the door i desisted  at her entry the whole of our conversation as it hung about in mrs bowaters firelit little parlour seemed to have become threadbare and meaningless my visitor and i turned away from each other almost with relieflike longfellows shipwrecked sailors perhaps at sight of a ship  fannys pale cheeks beneath her round beaver hat and veil were bright with the coldfor frost had followed the snow she eyed us slowly with less even than a smile in her eyes facing my candles softly as if she had come out of a dream whatever class of the community mr crimble may have meant to include in his odi the celerity with which he rose to greet her made it perfectly clear that it was not miss bowaters she smiled at the black sleeve cuff and signet ring outstretched towards her but made no further advance she brought him too a sad disappointment simply that she would be unable to sing at his concert on the last night of the year at this blow mr crimble instinctively folded his hands he looked helpless and distressed  but miss bowater he pleaded the printer has been waiting nearly two days for the names of your songs the time is very short now  yes said fanny seating herself on a stool by the fire and slowly removing her gloves it is annoying i hadnt a vestige of a cold last night  but indeed indeed he began is it wise in this severe weather  oh it isnt the weather i mind was the serene retort its the croaking like a frog in public  a frog cried mr crimble beguilingly oh no  but all his protestations and cajoleries were unavailing even to a long silent glance so private in appearance that it seemed more courteous to turn away from it fanny made no discernible response his shoulders humped he caught up his soft hat made his adieua little formal and hastyand hurried off through the door to the printer  when his muffled footsteps had passed away i looked at fanny  oh yes she agreed shrugging her shoulders it was a lie i said it like a lie so that it shouldnt deceive him i detest all that wheedling to come here two days running after and why may i ask if it is beneath your dignity to dance to the parish is it not beneath mine to sing let the silly sheep amuse themselves with their bleating i have done with it all  she rose folded her gloves into a ball and her veil over her hat and once more faced her reflection in her mothers lookingglass i had not the courage to tell her that the expression she wore on other occasions suited her best  but surely i argued uneasily things are different if i were to dance stuck up there on a platform you know very well it would not be the dancing that would amuse them butjust me would you care for that if you werewell what i am  ah you dont know a low voice replied bitterly you dont know the snobs they are i have soaked in it for years like a pig in brine boxed up here in your pretty little dolls house you suppose that all that matters is what you think of other people but to be perfectly frank you are out of the running my dear i have to get my own living and all that matters is not what i think of other people but what other people think of me do you suppose i dont know what he in his heart thinks of meand all the rest of them well i say wait  and she left me to my dolls housea more helpless slave than ever   not only one star the fewer then dazzled st peters parish that new years eve but fanny and i never again shared an hours practical astronomy still she would often sit and talk to me and the chain of my devotion grew heavy perhaps she on her side merely basked in the flattery of my imagination it was for her a new variety of a familiar experience perhaps a curious and condescending fondness for me for a while sprang up in heras far as that was possible for apart from her instinctive heartlessness she never really accustomed herself to my physical shortcomings i believe they attracted yet repelled her to my lonely spirit she was a dream that remained a dream in spite of its intensifying resemblance to a nightmare  i realize now that she was desperately capricious of a catlike cruelty by nature and so evasive and elusive that frequently i could not distinguish her soft furry pads from her claws but whatever her mood or her treatment of me or her lapses into a kind of commonness to which i deliberately shut my eyes her beauty remained whomsoever we love becomes unique in that love and i suppose we are responsible for what we give as well as for what we accept the very memory of her beauty when i was alone haunted me as intensely as if she were present yet in her actual company it made her in a sense unreal so often it was only the ghost of her with whom i sat and talked how sharply it would have incensed her to know it when she came to me in my sleep she was both paradise and seraph and never fiddle entranced a paganini as did her liquid lapsing voice my small fastidious ear yet however much she loved to watch herself in lookingglass or in her mind and to observe her effects on others she was not vain  but the constant unbanishable thought of anything wearies the mind and weakens the body in my infatuation i too was scarcely more than a ghosta very childish ghost perhaps i think if i could call him for witness my small pasha in the train from lyndsey would bear me out in this as for what is called passion the only burning of it i ever felt was for an outcast with whom i never shared so much as glance or word alas fanny i suppose was merely a brazen image  long before the dark day of her departurea day which stood in my thoughts like a barrier at the worlds endi had very foolishly poured out most of my memories for her profit and amusement though so immobile was she when seated in a chair beside my table or standing foot on fender at the chimneypiece that it was difficult at times to decide whether she was listening to me or not what is more important she told me in return in her curious tortuous and contradictory fashion a good deal about herself and of her childhood whichbecause of the endless violent roarings of her nautical father and the taciturn discipline of poor mrs bowaterfilled me with compassion and heaped fuel on my love and not least of these bonds was the secret which in spite of endless temptation i managed to withhold from her in a last instinctive loyalty to mrs bowaterthe discovery that her own mother was long since dead and gone  she possessed more brains than she cared to exhibit to visitors like dr phelps and mr crimble even to this day i cannot believe that mr crimble even so much as guessed how clever she was it was just part of herself like the bloom on a plum hers was not one of those gesticulating minds her efforts only intensified her fannyishness oh dear how simple things are if only you leave them unexplained her very knowledge too which for the most part she kept to herself was to me like finding chain armour when one is in search of a beating heart she could shed it all and her cleverness too as easily as a swan waterdrops what could she not shed and yet remain fanny and with all her confidences she was extremely reticent a lift of the light shoulders or of the flat arched eyebrows a sarcasm a faraway smile at the same time illuminated and obscured her talk these are feminine gifts and yet past my mastery perhaps for this reason i admired them the more in fannyjust as in reading my childhoods beloved volume the observing eye i had admired the crabs cuirass and the scorpions horny ringsbecause being after all myself a woman i faintly understood their purpose  thus when fanny told me of the school she taught in and of the smoothhaired drawingmaster who attended it with his skill on mondays wednesdays and fridays and of the vivacious and saturnine monsieur crapaud who poked up in a room under the gables lived in the house or of that other parish curate who was a nephew of the headmistresss the implacable miss stebbings and who apparently preached sunday after sunday with peculiar pertinacity on such texts as god is lovewhen fanny recounted to me these afflictions graces and mockeries of her daily routine as literature mistress i could as easily bestow on her the vivifying particulars she left out as a painter can send his portraits to be framed  once and againjust as i have seen a blackbird drop plumb from the upper boughs of a tree on a worm disporting itself in the dewy mouldonce i did ask a question which produced in her one of those curious reactions which made her rather than immaterial an exceedingly vigilant image of her very self what will you do fanny when you cant mock at him  him she inquired in a breath  the him i said  what him she replied  well i said stumbling along down what was a rather black and unfamiliar alley to me my father was not i suppose particularly wise in anything but my mother loved him very much  and my father she retorted in words so carefully pronounced that i knew they must be dangerous my father was a first mate in the mercantile marine when he married your landlady  well i repeated what would you do ifif you fell in love  fanny sat quite still all the light at the window gently beating on her face with its halfclosed eyes her foot stirred and with an almost imperceptible movement of her shoulder she replied i shall go blind  i looked at her dumbfounded all the days of her company were shrivelled up in that small sentence oh fanny i whispered hopelessly then you know  know echoed the smooth lips  why i mean i expostulated rushing for shelter fully as rapidly as my old friend the lobster must have done when it was time to change his shell i mean thats what that absurd little frenchman ismonsieur crapaud  oh no said fanny calmly he is not blind he only has his eyes shut mine she added as if the whole light of the wintry sky she faced were the mirror of her prediction mine will be wide open  how did i know that for once the serene theatrical creature was being mortally serious     chapter fifteen   i grew a little weary of the beautiful snow in the days that followed my first talk with mr crimble and fretted at the close air of the house the last day of the year the wind was still in the north it perplexed me that the pride which from my seed had sprung up in fanny and had prevented her from taking part in the parish concert yet allowed her to attend it she set off thickly veiled not even mr crimbles spectacles were likely to pierce her disguise i had written a little letter the afternoon before and had myself handed it to mrs bowater with a large fork of mistletoe from my christmas bunch it was an invitation to herself and fanny to sit with me and see in the new year she smiled at me over itstill her tranquil though neglected selfand i was halfsatisfied  her best black dress was donned for the occasion she had purchased a bottle of ginger wine which she brought in with some glasses and placed in the middle of the red and black tablecloth its whitelettered darkgreen label haunts me still the hours drew on fanny returned from the concertentering the room like a cloud of beauty she beguiled the dwindling minutes of the year with mocking echoes of it  in a rich falsetto she repeated mr crimbles few words of sympathetic apology for her absence i must ask your indulgence ladies and gentlemen for a lamentable hiatus in our programme she gave us miss willetts and mr bangors spirited rendering of oh that we two and of the recitation which rather easily it appeared mrs bullace had been prevailed upon to give as an encore after her abt vogler the ladys yes by elizabeth barrett browning and what a glance of light and fire she cast me when she came to stanza six of the poem        lead her from the festive boards      point her to the starry skies   and she imitated lady pollackes niecesmiss oranscello obligato to the lost chord with a plangency that stirred even the soul of henry as he lay curled up in my landladys lap the black head split like a pomegranate as he yawned his disgust  at this mrs bowater turned her bony face on me her hands on her knees and with a lift of her eyes disclosed the fact that she was amused and that she hoped her amusement would remain a confidence between us she got up and put the cat out and on her return had regained her solemnity  i suppose she said stiffly staring into the sparkling fire that was our only illumination i suppose poor creatures they did their best and it isnt so many years ago fanny since you were as putabout to be allowed to sing at one of the church concerts as a bird is to hop out of its cage  yes said fanny but in this world birds merely hop out of one cage into another though i suppose the larger are the more comfortable this retort set mrs bowaters countenance in an impassive maskso impassive that every fitfullylit photograph in the room seemed to have imitated her stare and mother added fanny seductively who taught me to sing  the lord knows cried mrs bowater with conviction i never did  yes muttered fanny in a low voice for my information but does he care i hastily asked mrs bowater if she was glad of tomorrows new year as if in reply the kitchen clock always ten minutes fast began to chime twelve halfchoking at every stroke and once more the soul of poor mr hubbins sorrowfully took shape in a gaze at me out of vacancy  to them going downhill miss my landlady was replying to my question it is not the milestones are the pleasantest companynor that the journeys then of much account until it is over by which i dont mean to suggest there need be gloom but to you and fanny herewell i expect the little thats the present for you is mostly wasted on the future with that she rose and poured out the syrupy brown wine from the green bottle reserving a remarkably little glass which she had rummaged out of her years hoardings for me  fanny herself with musing headher mockings overwas sitting drawnup on a stool by the fire i doubt if she was thinking whether or not to my enchanted eyes some phantom within her seemed content merely to be her beauty and in rest there was a grace in her bodythe smooth shoulder the poised head that because perhaps it was so transitory seemed to resemble the neverchangingthat mimicry of the unknown which may be seen in a flower in a green hill even in an animal it is as though i do think what we love most in this life must of necessity share two worlds  faintly out of the frosty air was wafted the knelling of midnight i rose stepped back from the firelight drew the curtain and stole a look into space away on the right flashed sirius and to east of him came gliding flatheaded hydra with alphard the red bird in his coil so for a moment in our history i and the terrestrial globe were alone together it seemed indeed that an intenser silence drew over reality as the earth faced yet one more fleeting revolution round her invisible lord and master but no moon was risen yet  i turned towards the shape by the fire and without her perceiving it wafted kiss and prayer in her direction cold careless fannyfurther than uranus we were alone for at first stroke of st peters mrs bowater had left the room and had opened the front door she was smiling but was she smiling or was that vague bewitchingness in her face merely an unmeaning guile of which she was unaware it might have been a mermaid sitting there in the firelight  the bells broke in on our stillness and fortunately since there was no dark man in the house to bring us luck henry already disgusted with the snow and blacker in hue than any whiskered human i have ever seen seized his opportunity and was the first living creature to cross our threshold from one year into another  this auspicious event renewed our spirits which in waiting had begun to flag from far away came a jangling murmur of shouting and instruments and bells which showed that the rest of the parish was sharing our solemn vigil and then with me on my table between them a hand of each clasping mine mrs bowater fanny and i after sipping each others health raised the strains of auld lang syne there must have been scottish blood in mrs bowater she certainly made up for some little variation from the tune by a heartfelt pronunciation of the words hardly had we completed this rite than the grandfathers clock in the narrow passage staidly protested its own rendering of eternity and we alleven mrs bowaterburst out laughing  goodnight midgetina an immense happy new year to you whispered a voice to me about half an hour afterwards i jumped out of bed and peeped through my curtains on some little errand fanny had come down from her bedroom and with a paisley shawl over her shoulders stood with head and candle thrust in at the door i gazed at her fairness oh fanny i cried oh fanny   new years day brought a change of weather a slight mist rose over the fields it began to thaw a kind of listlessness now came over fanny which i tried in vain to dispel yet she seemed to seek my company often to remain silent and occasionally to ask me curious questions as if testing one answer against another and one discovery i made in my efforts to keep her near me that she liked being read to most of the volumes in mrs bowaters small library were of a nautical character and though one of them on the winds and tides and seas and coasts of the world was to console me later in fannys absence the majority defied even my obstinacy fanny hated stories of the sea seemed to detest crusoe and smiled her slow mysterious smile while she examined my own small literary treasures by a flighty stroke of fortune tacked up by an unskilled hand in the stained brown binding of a volume on disorders of the nerves we discovered among her fathers books a copy of wuthering heights by emily brontë  the very first sentence of this strange dwelling book was a spell 1801i have just returned from a visit to my landlordthe solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with and when a few lines farther on i read he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their browsthe apparition of who but mr crumble blinked at me out of the print and the enchantment was complete it was not only gaunt enormous yorkshire with its fells and wastes of snow that seized on my imagination not only that vast kitchen with its flagstones green chairs and firearms but the mere music and aroma of the words i beheld his black eyes a range of gaunt thorns a wilderness of crumbling griffins a huge livercoloured bitch pointerthey rang in my mind echoed on in my dreams  and though in the wet and windy afternoons and evenings which fanny and i thus shared she much more than poor mr crimble resembled heathcliff in being rather morose and in frequently expressing an aversion to showing displays of feeling she was more attracted by my discovery than she condescended to confess jane eyre she said was a better story though jane herself was a fool what cared i to me this book was like the kindling of a light in a strange house and that house my mind i gazed watched marvelled and recognized as i kneeled before its pages but though my heart was torn and my feelings were a little deranged by the scenes of violence and my fancy was haunted by that stalking wolfish spectre i took no part i surveyed all with just that sense of aloofness and absorption with which as children cathy and heathcliff barefoot in the darkness of the garden had looked in that sunday evening on the lintons crimson taperlit drawingroom  if in february you put a newly gathered sprig of budding thorn into the fire instantaneously in the influence of the heat it will break into brightgreen tiny leaf that is what emily brontë did for me not so for fanny in her vapid listlessness she often pretended to yawn over wuthering heights and would shock me with mocking criticism or cry ah at the poignant passages but i believe it was pure concealment she was really playing a part in the story i have at any rate never seen her face so transfigured as when once she suddenly looked up in the firelight and caught my eye fixed on her over the book  it was at the passage where cathyin her grand plaid silk frock white trousers and burnished shoesreturns to the dreadful grange and dismally beclouded heathcliff stares out at her from his hidingplace he might i read on well skulk behind the settle at beholding such a bright graceful damsel enter the house is heathcliff not here she demanded pulling off her gloves and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors  it was at this point that our eyes as i say fannys and mine met but she bright graceful damsel was not thinking of me  do you like that kind of character fanny i inquired  my candles flames gleamed lean and tiny in her eyes whose she asked  why heathcliffs  she turned slowly away you take things so seriously midgetina its merely a story he only wanted taming youll see byandby but at that moment my ear caught the sound of footsteps and when mrs bowater opened the door to contemplate idle fanny the book was under my bed   as the day drew near for fannys return to her duties her mood brightened she displayed before me in all their stages the new clothes which mrs bowater lavished on herto a degree that amateur though i was in domestic economy filled me with astonishment i had to feign delight in these fineriesah whispered i to each when she wears you she will be far far away i envied the very buttons and indeed pestered her with entreaties i implored her to think of me at certain hours to say goodnight to herself for me to write day by day in the first of the evening to share the moon if we both look at her at the same moment i argued it will be next to looking at one another you cannot be utterly gone and if you see even a flower or hear the wind oh i hope and hope you will be happy  she promised everything with smiling ease and would have sealed the compact in blood if i had thought to cut my thumb for it thursday in holy weekthen she would be home again i stared at the blessed day across the centuries as a condemned man stares in fancy at the scaffold awaiting him but on mine hung all my hopes long evenings i never saw her at all and voices in the kitchen when she came in late suggested that my landlady had also missed her but fanny never lost her selfcontrol even when she lost her temper and i dared not tax her with neglecting me her cold looks almost suffocated me i besought her to spend one last hour of the eve of her departure alone with me and with the stars in the woods she promised at eleven she came home and went straight up into her bedroom i heard her footsteps she was packing then silence  i waited on until sick at heart i flung myself on my knees beside my bed and prayed that god would comfort her heathcliff had acquired a feeble pupil the next afternoon she was gone     chapter sixteen   for many days my mind was an empty husk yet in a constant torment of longing daydream despair and selfreproaches everything i looked at had but one meaningthat she was not there i did not dare to admit into my heart a hope of the future since it would be treason to the absent there was an ecstatic mournfulness even in the sight of the january sun the greening fields the first scarcely perceptible signals of a new year and when one morning i awoke early and heard still half in dream a thrush in all but darkness singing of spring it seemed it was a voice pealing in the empty courts of paradise what ridiculous care i took to conceal my misery from mrs bowater hardly a morning passed but that i carried out in a bag the food i couldnt eat the day before to hide it away or bury it but such journeys were brief  i have read somewhere that love is a disease or is it that life piles up the fuel a chance stranger darts a spark and the whole world goes up in smoke was i happier in that fever than i am in this literary calm why did love for things without jealousy or envy fill me with delight pour happiness into me and love for fanny parch me up suck every other interest from my mind and all but blind my eyes is that true i cannot be sure for to remember her ravages is as difficult as to reassemble the dismal phantoms that flock into a delirious brain and still to be honesttheres another chance was she to blame would my mind have been at peace even in its solitary woe if she had dealt truly with me would any one believe itit never occurred to me to remind myself that it might be a question merely of size simply because i loved i deemed myself lovable yet in my heart of hearts that afternoon i had been twitting mr crimble for saying his prayers  but even the heart is phoenixlike the outer world began to break into my desolation not least successfully when after a week or two of absence there came a post card from fanny to her mother with a mere love to m scrawled in its top righthand corner it was as if a wineglass of cold water had been poured down my back it was followed by yet another little shock one evening when she had carefully set down my bowl of rusk and milk mrs bowater took up her stand opposite to me black as an image in wood you havent been after your stars miss of late its moping you are i suffered myself from the same greensick fantasticalities when i was a girl not that a good results any the better for a poor cause but it was courting danger with your frail frame it was indeed  i smile in remembrance of the picture presented by that consciencestricken face of mine upturned to that stark monitora monitor no less stark at this very moment though we are both many years older  yes yes she continued and even the dun fading photograph over her head might have paled at her accents im soliciting no divulgements she wouldnt have gone alone and if she did would have heard of it from me but you must please remember miss i am her mother and you will remember miss also she added with upper lip drawn even tighter that your care is my care and always will be while you are under my roofand after please god  she soundlessly closed the door behind her as if in so doing she were shutting up the whole matter in her mind for ever as indeed she was for she never referred to it again thunderbolts fall quietly at times i sat stupefied but as i examine that distant conscience i am aware first of a faint flitting of the problem through my mind as to why a freedom which mrs bowater would have denied to fanny should have held no dangers for me and next i realize that of all the emotions in conflict within me humiliation stood head and shoulders above the rest indeed i flushed all over at the thought that never for one momentthen or sincehad i paused to consider how on that fateful midnight fanny could have left the housedoor bolted behind her my utter stupidity and fannys all these weeks my landlady had known and said nothing the green gooseberries of my childhood were a far less effective tonic but i lost no love for mrs bowater in this prodigious increase of respect  a far pleasanter interruption of my sick longings for the absent one occurred the next morning at a loss what to be reading for fanny had abstracted my wuthering heights and taken it away with her once more shudderingly pushing aside my breakfast i turned over the dusty faded pile of bowater books and in one of them i discovered a chapter on knots our minds are cleverer than we think them and not only cats have an instinct for physicking themselves i took out a piece of silk twine from my drawer andwith fannys phantom sulking a while in neglectset myself to the mastery of the ship boys science i had learned for ever to distinguish between the granny and the reef such is fate this knot was also called the true lovers and was setting about the fishermans bend when there came a knock on the doorand then a head  it was pollie until i saw her round red country cheek and stiff sunday hat thus unexpectedly appear i had almost forgotten how much i loved and had missed her no doubt my landlady had been the dea ex machinâ that had produced her on this fine sunshine morning anyhow she was from heaven besides butter a posy of winter jasmine a crochet bedspread and a varnished arbour chair made especially for me during the winter evenings by her father mr muggeridge she brought startling news there suddenly fell a pause in our excited talk she drew out her handkerchief and a slow crimson mounted up over neck cheek ears and brow i couldnt look quite away from this delicious sight so my eyes wandered up in admiration of the artificial cornflowers and daisies in her hat  whereupon she softly blew her nose and with a gliding glance at the shut door she breathed out her secret she was engaged to be married a trying romantic vapour seemed instantly to gather about us in whose hush i was curiously aware not only of pollie thus suffused sitting with her hands loosely folded in her lap but of myself also perched opposite to her with eyes in which curiosity incredulity and even a remote consternation played upon her homely features time melted away and there once more sat the old polliea gawk of a girl in a pinafore munching up green apples and replaiting her dull brown hair  then of course i was bashfully challenged to name the happy man i guessed and guessed to pollies everincreasing gusto and at last i dared my first unuttered choice well then it must be adam waggett  adam waggett oh miss him a nose like a winebottle  it was undeniable i apologized and pollie surrendered her future into my hands its bob halibut miss she whispered hoarsely  and instantaneously bob halibuts red head loomed louringly out at me but i know little about husbands and premonitions only impress us when they come true time was to prove that pollie and her mother had made a prudent choice am i not now mr halibuts godsister so to speak  the wedding said pollie was to be in the summer and oh misswould i come  the scheming that followed the sensitive draping of difficulties on either side the old homesick longing on mineto flee away now at once from this scene of my afflicted adoration i almost hated fanny for giving me so much pain mrs bowater was summoned to our council my promise was given and it was she who suggested that its being a nice bright afternoon pollie should take me for a walk  but whither it seemed a sheer waste of pollie to take her to the woods thoughts of st peters the nocturnal splendour in the cab a hunger for novelty the itch to spend money and maybe a tinge of daredevilrywithout a moments hesitation i chose the shops and the town once more in my black with two thicknesses of veil canopying my head as if i were a joint of meat in the dog days i settled myself on pollies arm andin the full publicity of three oclock in the afternoonoff we went  we chattered we laughed we sniggled together like schoolgirls in amusement at the passersby in the strange busy high street i devoured the entrancing wares in the shop windowsmilliner hairdresser and perfumer confectioner even the pyramids of jam jars and sugarcones in the grocers and the soaps syrups and sponges of mr simpkinsbeechwoods pharmaceutical chemist out of the sovereign which i had brought with me from my treasurechest pollie made purchases on my behalf for mrs bowater a muslin tie for the neck for herselfafter heated controversya pair of kid gloves and a bottle of frangipani and for me a novel  this last necessitated a visit to mrs stockss circulating library my hopes had been set on jane eyre mrs stocks regretted that the demand for this novel had always exceeded her supply what may be called the sensational style of fiction or was it friction never lays much on our hands she produced instead and very tactfully a comparatively diminutive copy of miss austens sense and sensibility it was a little shopsoiled but books keep miss and she let me have it at a reduced price her great shears severed the string pollie and i once more set clanging the sonorous bell at the door and emerged into the sunlight oh pollie i whispered if only you could stay with me for ever  this taste of life had so elated me that after fevered and silent debate i at last laughed out and explained to pollie that i wished to be put down her breathless arguments against this foolhardy experiment only increased my obstinacy she was compelled to obey bidding her keep some little distance behind me i settled my veil clasped tight my miss austen in my arms and set my face in the direction from which we had come one after another the wide pavingstones stretched out in front of me it was an extraordinary experience i was openly alone now not with the skulking deceitful shades and appearances of night or the quiet flowers and trees in the enormous vacancy of nature but in the midst of a town of men in their heightand walking along there by myself it was as if i had suddenly realized what astonishingly active and domineering and multitudinous creatures we humans are i cant explain the high street to use a good old phrase got up into my head my mind was in such a whirl of excitement that full consciousness of what followed eludes me   the sun poured wintry bright into the housewalled gulf of a street that in my isolation seemed immeasurably vast and empty i think my senses distorted the scene there was the terrific glitter of glass the clatter of traffic a puff of wind whirled dust and grit and particles of straw into the air the shapes of advancing pedestrians towered close above me then stiff with sudden attention passed me by my legs grew a little numb and my brain confused the strident whistling of a butchers boy with an empty bloodstained tray over his shoulder suddenly ceased saucereyed he stood stock still gulped and gaped i kept on my course a yelp of astonishment rent the air whereupon as it seemed from divers angles similar boys seemed to leap out of the ground and came whooping and revolving across the street in my direction and now the blood so hummed in my head that it was rather my nerves than my ears which informed me of a steadily increasing murmur and trampling behind me  with extraordinary vividness i recall the vision of a gigantic barouche gliding along towards me in the shine and the dust and seated up in it a high pompous lady who at one moment with rigid urbanity inclined her head apparently in my direction and at the next her face displeased as if at an offensive odour had sunk back into her cushions oblivious not only of beechwood but of the whole habitable globe simultaneously i was aware even as i hastened on first that the acquaintance whose salute she had acknowledged was mr crimble and next that with incredible rapidity he had wheeled himself about and had instantaneously transfixed his entire attention on some object in the window of a hatters  until this moment as i say a confused but blackening elation had filled my mind but at sight of mr crimbles rooklike stooping shoulders i began to be afraid my shoe stumbled against a jutting pavingstone i almost fell whereupon the mute concourse at my heelsspreading tail of me the cometburst into a prolonged squealing roar of delight the next moment pollie was at my side stooping to my rescue it was too late one glance over my shoulderand terror and hatred of the whole human race engulfed me like a sea i struck savagely at pollies cottongloved hand shivering with clenched sticky teeth i began to run  why this panic who would have harmed me and yet on the thronging faces which i had flyingly caught sight of through my veil there lay an expression that was not solely curiositya kind of hunger a doglike gleam i remember one thinlegged ferrety redhaired lad in particular well no matter the comedy was brief and it was mrs stocks who lowered the curtain attracted by all this racket and hubbub in the street she was protruding her round head out of her precincts like fox to its hole i scrambled over her wooden doorstep whisked round her person and fled for sanctuary into her shop she hustled poor pollie in after me wheeled round on my pursuers slammed the door in their faces slipped its bolt and drew down its dark blue blind  in the sudden quiet and torpor of this musty gloom i turned my hunted eyes and stared at the dark strip of holland that hid me from my pursuers so too did mrs stocks the round creature stood like a stone out of reach of the surf then she snorted  them said she with a flick of her duster a parcel of idle herrand boys i know them and no more decency than if you was royalty my dear or a pickpocket or a corpse run over in the street you rest a bit pore young thing and compose yourself theyll soon grow tired of themselves  she retired into the back part of her shop beyond the muslined door and returned with a tumbler of water i shook my head my sight pulsed with my heartbeats as if congealed into a drop of poison i stared and stared at the blind  open the door i said id like to go out again  oh miss oh miss cried pollie  but mrs stocks was of a more practical turn after surveying my enemies from an upper window she had sent a neighbours little girl for a cab by the time this vehicle arrived with a halfhearted boo of disappointment the concourse in the street had all but melted away and mrs stockss check duster scattered the rest the cabdoor slammed the wheels ground on the kerbstone my début was over i had been but a nine minutes wonder     chapter seventeen   we jogged on sluggishly up the hill and at last in our velvety quiet as if at a preconcerted signal pollie and i turned and looked at one another and broke into a long mirthless peal of laughtera laughter that on her side presently threatened to end in tears i left her to recover herself fixing my festering attention on her engagement ringtwo hearts in silver encircled by six skyblue turquoises and in the silly helpless fashion of one against the world i plotted revenge  the cab stopped there stood the little brick house wholly unaffected by the tragic hours which had passed since we had so gaily set out from it i eyed it with malice and disgust as i reascended my bateses and preceded pollie into the passage once safely within i shrugged my shoulders and explained to mrs bowater the phenomenon of the cab with such success that i verily believe she was for the moment convinced that her lodger was one of those persons who prosper in the attentions of the mobroyalty that is rather than pickpockets or corpses run over in the street  with my new muslin tie adorning her neck mrs bowater took tea with us that afternoon but even pollies imaginative version of our adventures made no reference to the lady in the carriage nor did she share my intense conjecture on what mr crimble can have found of such engrossing interest in the hatters was it that the lady had feigned not to have seen me entirely for my sake and that mr crimble had feigned not to have seen me entirely for his i was still poring over this problem in bed that night when there came a tap at my door it was pollie she had made her way downstairs to assure herself that i was safe and comfortable and oh miss she whispered as she bade me a final goodnight you never see such a lovely little bedroom as mrs bowater have put me intofit for a princess and yet just quite plain bobs been thinking about furniture too  so i was left alone again with forgotten fanny and that night i dreamed of her nothing to be seen but black boiling waves flinging their yeasty curdling crests into the clouds and every crest the face of my ferrety herrandboy and afloat in the midst of the welter beneath a beloved shape whiter than the foam with shut eyes under the gigantic stoop of the water who hangs these tragic veils in the sleeping mind who was this i that looked out on them i awoke shuddering breathed a blessingdisjointed nameless turned over and soon was once more asleep  my days experiences in the high street had added at least twentyfour hours to my life so much a woman of the world was i becoming that when after pollies departure a knock announced mr crimble i greeted him with a countenance guileless and selfpossessed with spectacles fixed on me he stood nervously twitching a small bunch of snowdrops which he assured me were the first of the new year i thanked him remarked that our lyndsey snowdrops were shorter in the stalk than these and had he noticed the pale green hieroglyphs on the petals  in the white dead nettle you have to look underneath for them tiny black oblongs you cant think how secret it looks  but mr crimble had not come to botanize after answering my inquiry after the health of mrs hubbins he suddenly sat down and announced that the object of his visit was to cast himself on my generosity the proposal made me uncomfortable but my timid attempt to return to mrs hubbins was unavailing  i speak he said of yesterdays atrocity there is no other word for it and inasmuch as it occurred within two hundred yards of my own church indeed of my mothers house i cannot disclaim all responsibility for it  nor could i but i wished very heartily that he had not come to talk about his share oh said i as airily as i could you mean mr crimble my little experience in the high street that was nothing my attention was so much taken up with other things that i did not get even so much as a glimpse of st peters so you see  you are kindness itself he interrupted with a rapid insertion of his forefinger between his neck and his clerical collar but the fact is and he cast a glance at me as if with the whites of his eyes the fact is i was myself a scandalized witness of the occurrence believe me it cannot have hurt your sensitive feelings more thanthan it hurt mine  but honestly mr crimble i replied glancing rather helplessly round the room it didnt hurt my feelings at all you dont feel much you know when you are angry it was just as i should have foreseen it is important to know where we are isnt it and where other people are and boys will be boys as mrs bowater says and particularly i suppose errand boys what else could i expect it has just taught me a very useful lessoneven though i didnt much enjoy learning it if i am ever to get used to the world and that is a kind of duty mr crimble isnt it the world must get used to me perhaps if we all knew each others insidesour thoughts and feelings i meaneverybody would be as peculiar thereinside you knowas i am outside im afraid this is not making myself very clear  and only a few weeks ago i had been bombarding dr phelps with precisely the opposite argument that i suppose is what is meant by being deceitful on the weights  mr crimble opened his mouth but i continued rapidly you see i must be candid about such things to myself and try not toto be silly and you were merely going to be very kind werent you i am a midget and its no good denying it the people that hooted me were not thats all and if there hadnt been so many of them perhaps i might have been just as much amused if not even shocked at them as they at me we think our own size thats all and im perfectly certain i nodded at him emphatically im perfectly certain if poor mr hubbins were here now hedhed bear me out  bear me outthe words lingered on in my mind so distinctly and conveyed so peculiar a picture of mr hubbinss spirit and myself that i missed the beginning of my visitors reply  but i assure you he was saying it is not merely that the glint of perspiration was on his forehead in the almightys sight all men are equal appearances are nothing and some of us perhaps are far more precious by very reason ofof passing afflictions and  my godmother i interposed said exactly that in a letter to me a few months ago not that i accept the word mr crimble the afflictions i mean and as for appearances why they are everything arent they i gave him as cordial an imitation of a smile as i could  no no no yes yes yes said mr crimble rapidly but it was not of that not of that in a sense that i was speaking what i came to say this afternoon is this i grant it i freely confess it i played the coward morally rather than physically perhaps but still the coward thethe hideous barbarity of the proceeding he had forgotten me his eyes were fixed on the scene in his memory he was once more at the hatters window there fell a painful pause  i rose and sat down again but quite quite honestly i interposed faintly they did me no harm they were only inquisitive what could you have done why really and truly i laughed feebly they might have had to pay you know it was gettinggetting me cheap  his head was thrown back so that he looked under his spectacles at me as he cried hollowly they might have stoned you  not with those pavements  but i was there i turned aside you saw me  what persuaded me to be guilty of such a ridiculous quibble i cannot think anything perhaps to ease his agitation but honestly honestly mr crimble i murmured out at him i didnt see you see me  oh ah a womans way he adjured me desperately turning his head from one side to the other but you must have known that i knew you knew i had seen you you must confess that and well  as i say i can only appeal to your generosity  but what can i do im not hurt if it had been the other way roundyou scuttling along i mean i really do believe i might have looked into the hatters besides when we were safe in the cab i mean im glad it was experience oh and past i loved it and the streets and the shops and all those grinning gnashing faces and even you it was wildly exciting mr crimble cant you see and nowi ended triumphantlyand now i have another novel  at this suddenly overcome i jumped up from my chair and ran off into my bedroom as if in search of the book the curtains composed themselves behind me in this inner quietness this momentary release i stood there erect beside the bedwithout a thought in my head and i began slowly silentlyto laugh handkerchief to my lips i laughed and laughednot exactly like pollie in the cab but because apparently some infinitely minute being within me had risen up at remembrance of the strange human creature beyond the curtains who had suddenly before my very eyes seemed to have expanded and swollen out to double his size oh what extraordinary things life was doing to me how can i express myself for that pip of a moment i was just an exquisite icicle of solitudeas if i had never been born yet there under my very nose was my bed my glass my hairbrushes and bottleshere we all are miss mand on the other side of the curtains and how contemptuous i had been of pollies little lapse into the hysterical i brushed my handkerchief over my eyes tranquillized my features and sallied out once more into the world  ah here it is i exclaimed ingenuously and lifting my sense and sensibility from where it lay on the floor beside my table i placed it almost ceremoniously in mr crimbles hands a visible mist of disconcertion gathered over his face he looked at the book he opened it his eye strayed down the titlepage  yes yes he murmured jane austena pocket edition macaulay i remember he closedto the covers again drew finger and thumb slowly down the margin and then leaned forward but you were asking me a question what could i have done frankly i dont quite know but i might have protected you driven the rabble off taken you the good shepherd but there in short and the sun of relief peered through the glooms of conscience i did nothing that was my failure and absurd though it may seem i could not rest until as a matter of fact i had unbosomed myself confessed knowing you would understand his tongue came to a standstill and when he continued in a small constrained voice and with a searching almost appealing glance when miss bowater returns you will i hope allow me to make amends to prove she would neverforforgive  the fog that had been his became mine in an extravagance of attention to every syllable of his speech as it died away uncompleted in the little listening room i mutely surveyed him then i began to understand to realize where my poor little generosity was to come in  ah i replied at last forlornly our eyes in close communion she wont be back for months and months and anyhow she wouldnt i am sure much mind mr crimble  easter he whispered well you will write i suppose and his eye wandered off as if in search of the inkpot and no doubt you will share ouryour secret there was no vestige of interrogation in his voice and yet it was clear that what he was suggesting i should do was only and exactly what he had come that afternoon to ask me not to do why surely i thought examining him none too complimentarily i am afraid he was merely playing for a kind of stalemate what funny blind alleys love leads us into  no i said solemnly i shall say nothing but that i suppose is because i am not so brave as you are really and truly i think she would only be amused everything amuses her  it seemed that we had suddenly reassumed our natural dimensions for at that he looked at me tinily again and with the suggestion to which i was long accustomed that he would rather not be observed while so looking  on the whole ours had been a gloomy talk nevertheless there not on my generosity but i hope on my understanding he reposed himself and so reposes to this day when the door had closed behind him i felt far more friendly towards mr crimble than i had felt before even apart from the almighty he had made us as nearly as he couldequals i tossed a pleasant little bow to his snowdrops and catching sight of mr bowaters fixed stare on me hastily included him within its range  mr crimble mrs bowater informed me the following sunday evening lived with an aged mother and in spite of his sociability and his fun was a lonely young man he hadnt my landlady thought yet seen enough of the world to be of much service to those who had they and i think she meant clergymen in general as well as mr crimble in particular live a shutin complimentary life and people treat them according though of course theres those who have seen a bit of trouble and cheeseparing themselves and the church is the church when alls said and done  and all in a moment i caught my first real glimpse of the churchno more just a number of st peterses than i was so many organs or beechwood was so many errand boys or for that matter england so many counties it was an idea my attention wandered  but he was very anxious about the concert i ventured to protest  ive no doubt said mrs bowater shortly  but then i remarked with a sigh fanny seems to make friends wherever she goes  it isnt the making replied her mother but the keeping  the heavy weeks dragged slowly by and a onesided correspondence is like posting letters into a dream my progress with miss austen was slow because she made me think and argue with her apart from her i devoured every fragment of print i could lay hands on for when fiction palled i turned to facts mastered the sheepshank the running bowline and the figureofeight and wrestled on with my seacraft it was a hard task and i thought it fair progress if in that i covered half a knot a day  besides which mrs bowater sometimes played with me at solitaire draughts or cards in these she was a martinet and would appropriate a fat pack at beggarmyneighbour with infinite gusto how silent stood the little room with just the click of the cards the simmering of the kettle on the hob and mrs bowaters occasional gruff four to pay we might have been on a desert island i must confess this particular game soon grew a little wearisome but i played on thinking to please my partner and that she had chosen it for her own sake until one evening with a stifled sigh she murmured the word cribbage i was shuffling my own small pack at the moment and paused my eyes on their backs in a rather wry amusement but fate has pretty frequently so turned the tables on me and after that one for his nob sepulchrally broke the nightsilence of beechwood far more often than four to pay  not all my letters to fanny went into the post my landlady looked a little askance at them and many of the unposted ones were scrawled if possible in moonlight after she had gone to bed to judge from my recollection of other letters written in my young days i may be thankful that fanny was one of those practical people who do not hoard the valueless i can still recall the poignancy of my postscripts on the one hand i beseech you to write to me fanny i live to hear last night was full moon again i saw youyou only in her glass on the other henry has been fighting there is a chip out of his ear nine centuries nearer now and how is monsieur crapaud     wanderslore     chapter eighteen   at last there came a post which brought me not a sermon from miss fenne nor gossip from pollie but a message from the islands of the blest all that evening and night it lay unopened under my pillow i was saving it up and never have i passed hours so studious yet so barren of result it was the end of february a sudden burst of light and sunshine had fallen on the world there were green shining grass and newfallen lambs in the meadows and the almond tree beyond my window was in full leafless bloom as for the larks they were singing of fanny the next morning early about seven oclock her letter folded up in its small envelope in the bosom of my cloak i was out of the house and making my way to the woods it was the clear air of daybreak and only the large stars shook faint and silvery in the brightening sky  frost powdered the ground and edged the grasses but now tufts of primroses were in blow among the withered mist of leaves i came to my observatory just as the first beams of sunrise smote on its upper boughs yet even now i deferred the longedfor moment and hastened on between the trees beech and brooding yew by what seemed a faint foottrack and at last came out on a kind of rising on the edge of the woods from this green eminence for the first time i looked straight across its desolate garden to wanderslore  it was a long dark manywindowed house it gloomed sullenly back at me beneath the last of night from the alarm calls of the blackbirds it seemed that even so harmless a trespasser as i was a rare spectacle a tangle of brier and bramble bushed frostily over its grey stone terraces nearer at hand in the hollow stood an angled house also of stoneand as small compared with wanderslore as a little child compared with its mother it had been shattered at one corner by a falling tree whose bole still lay among the undergrowth the faint track i was following led on and apparently past it breathless and triumphant i presently found myself seated on a low mossy stone beside it monarch of all i surveyed with a profound sigh i opened my letter        burn this letter and show the other to m       dear midgetinadont suppose because i have not written that      fanny is a monster though in fact she is i have often thought      of youwith your stars and knickknacks and of course your      letters have come my thanks i cant really answer them now      because i am trying at the same time to scribble this note and to      correct composition papers under the very eyes of miss      stebbingsthe abhorred daughter of argus and the eldest gorgon      dear me i almost envy you midgetina it must be fun to be like      a tiny roundheaded pin in a pincushion and just mock at the      workbox but all things in moderation       when the full moon came last i remembered our vow she was so      dazzling poor old wreck and i wondered as i blinked up at her      if you would not some day vanish away altogetherunless you make a      fortune by being looked at i wish i could only would they pay      enough that is the question       what i am writing about now is not the moon butdont be      amuseda man not monsieur crapaud who is more absurd than ever      but some one you know mr crimble he has sent me the most alarming      letter and wants me to marry him it is not for the first time of      asking but still a solemn occasion mother once said that he was      like a coquetteall attention and no intention sad to say it is      the other way round m you see always judges by what she fears      i by what this heart tells me       now i darent write back to him direct a because i wish just      now to say neither yes nor no b because a little delay will      benefit his family pride c because it is safer not tohes      very careless and i might soon want to change my mind d      because thats how my fancy takes me and e because i love you      exceedingly and know you will help me       when no answer comes to his letter he will probably dare another      pilgrimage to beechwood hill if only to make sure that i am not in      my grave so i want you to tell him secretly that i have      received his letter and that i am giving it my earnest      attentionlet alone my prayers tell me exactly how he takes this      answer then i will write to you again i am sure midgetina in      some previous life you must have lived in the tiny rooms in the      palace at mantuayou are a born intrigante        in my bedroom 11 pma scheme is in my mind but it is not      yet in bloom and you may infer from all this that i dont care      often i wish this were so i sat in front of my eight inches of      grained lookingglass last night till it seemed some goddess      must intervene but no my head was dark and empty i could hear      mr oliphant cajoling with his violin in the distanceas if music      had charms oh dear they give you life and leave you to ask      why you seem to be perfectly contented in your queer little prim      way with merely asking but fanny bowater wants an answer or she      will make one up meanwhile search for a scrap of magic mushroom      little sister and come nearer some day i will tell you even more      about myself meanwhile believe me petitissimost m your      affecf       psburn this       ppswhat i mean is that he must be made to realize that i      will not and cannot give him an answer before i come homeunless      he hears meanwhile       burn this the other letter is for show purposes   fannys other was more brief        dear midgetinait is delightful to have your letters and i am      ashamed of myself for not answering them before but i will do so      the very moment there is a free hour would you please ask mother      with my love to send me some handkerchiefs some stockings and      some soap my first are worn with weeping my second with sitting      still and my third is mottledand similarly affects the      complexion but easter draws near and i am sure i must long to be      home did you tell mother by any chance of your midnight astronomy      lesson it has been most useful when all other baits and threats      have failed to teach the young idea how to shoot truly a poets      way of putting it is mr crimble still visiting his charming      parishioner       i remain       yours affecly       fanny bowater   slowly selfconscious word by word lingering here and there i read these letters throughthen through again then i lifted my eyes and stared for a while over my left shoulder at empty wanderslore a medley of emotions strove for mastery and as if to reassure herself the tiny roundheaded pin kissed the signature whispering languishingly to herself in the great garden i love you exceedingly oh fanny i love you exceedingly and hid her eyes in her hands the notepaper was very faintly scented my imagination wandered off i know not where and returned elated and dejected which the more i know not then i folded up the secret letter into as small a compass as i could dragged back a loose flat stone hid it away in the dry crevice beneath and replaced the stone the other i put into my silk bag  i emerged from these labours to see in my mind mrs bowater steadfastly regarding me and behind her the shadowy shape of mr crimble with i know not what of entreaty in his magnified dark eyes i smiled a little ruefully to myself to think that my life was become like a pool of deep water in which i was slowly sinking down and down as if in sober fact there were stones in my pocket or leaden soles to my shoes it was more like reading a story about myself than being myself and what was to be the end of it all i thought of fanny married to mr crimble as my mother was married to my father how dark and uncomfortable a creature he looked beside fannys grace and fairness and would mrs crimble sit in an armchair and watch fanny as fanny had watched me and should i be asked to tea i was surprised into a shudder yet i dont think there would have been any wild jealousy in my hearteven if fanny should say yes i could love her better perhaps if she would give me a little time and what was really keeping her back why did every word she said or wrote only hide what she truly meant  so far from mocking at the workbox i was only helplessly examining its tangled skeins nor was i criticizing fanny to help herthat was my one burning desire to give all i had take nothing in a vague and possibly priggish fashion i knew too that i wanted to help her against herself her letter and perhaps the long waiting for it had smoothed out my old excitements in the midst of these musings memory suddenly alighted on the question in the letter which was to be shown to mrs bowater about the stargazing there was no need for that now but the point was had not fanny extorted a promise from me not to tell her mother of our midnight adventure it seemed as though without a shred of warning the fair face had drawn close in my consciousness and was looking at me low and fixedly like a snake in a picture why it was like cheating at cards fascinated and repelled i sank again into reverie  no no its cowardly fanny cried aloud a voice in the midst of this inward argument as startling as if a stranger had addressed me the morning was intensely still sunbeams out of the sky now silvered the clustered chimney shafts of wanderslore where shadow lay the frost gloomed wondrously blue on the dishevelled terraces where sun a thin smoke of vapour was ascending into the air the plants and bushes around me were knobbed all over with waxgreen buds the enormous trees were faintly coloured in their twigs a sunbeetle staggered out among the pebbles at my feet i glanced at my hands they were coral pink with the cold i love you exceedinglyexceedingly i repeated though this time i knew not to whom   so saying and even as i said it realizing that the exceedingly was not my own and that i must be intelligent even if i was sentimental i rose from my stone and turned to go back i thus faced the worn small stone house again instantly i was all attention a curious feeling came over me familiar yet eluding remembrance it meant that i must be vigilant cautiously i edged round to the other side of the angled wall where lay the fallen tree hard dark buds showed on its yet living fringes rather than clamber over its sodden bole i skirted it until i could walk beneath a lank upthrust bough at every few steps i shrank in and glanced around me then fixed my eyesas i had learned to do by my streamside or when stargazingon a single object in order to mark what was passing on the outskirts of my field of vision nothing i was alone in the garden a robin with a light flutter of wing perched to eye me a string of rooks cawed across the sky wanderslore emptily stared if indeed i was being watched then my watcher was no less circumspect than i soon i was skirting the woods again and had climbed the green knoll by which i had descended into the garden i wheeled sharply searching the whole course of my retreat nothing  when i opened my door mrs bowater and henry seemed to be awaiting me was it my fancy that both of them looked censorious absently she stood aside to let me pass to my room then followed me in  such a lovely morning mrs bowater i called pleasantly down from my bedroom as i stood taking off my cloak in front of the glass and not a soul to be seenthough and my voice was better under command with a hairpin between my teeth i wouldnt have minded if there had been not now  ah came the reply but you must be cautious miss boys will be boys and the sound tailed away men men i heard the door open and close and paused with hands still lifted to my hair prickling cold all over at this strange behaviour what could i have been found out in now  then a voice sounded seemingly out of nowhere what i was going to say miss isa letters come  with that i drew aside the curtain the explanation was simple having let henry out of my room in which he was never at ease mrs bowater was still standing like a figure in waxwork in front of her chiffonier her eyes fixed on the window they then wheeled on me mr bowater she said  i was conscious of an inexpressible relief and of the profoundest interest i glanced at the great portrait mr bowater i repeated  yes she replied buenos ayres hes broken a leg and sos fixed there for the time being  oh mrs bowater i said i am sorry and how terribly sudden  believe me my young friend she replied musingly its never in my experience whats unprepared for that finds us least expecting it not that it was actually his leg was in my mind  what was chiefly in my selfish mind was the happy conviction that i had better not give her fannys letter just then  i do hope hes not in great pain was all i found to say  she continued to muse at me in her queer sightless fashion almost as if she were looking for help  oh dear me miss the poor thing cried brokenly how should your young mind feel what an old woman feels just grovelling in the past  she was gone and feeling very uncomfortable in my humiliation i sat down and staredat the workbox why why indeed i thought angrily why should i be responsible well i suppose its only when the poor fishsturgeon or sticklebackstruggles that he really knows hes in the net     chapter nineteen   one of the many perplexing problems that now hemmed me in was brushed away by fortune that afternoon between gloomy bursts of reflection on fannys mr crimbles mrs bowaters and my own account i had been reading miss austen and at about four oclock was sharing chapter xxiii with poor elinor        the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind her to      everything but her beauty and good nature but the four succeeding      yearsyears which if rationally spent give such improvements to      the understandingmust have opened her eyes to her defects of      education which the same period of time spent on her side in      inferior society and more frivolous pursuits   i say i was reading this passage and had come to the wordsand more frivolous pursuits when an unusually imperative rattattat fell upon the outer door and i emerged from my book to discover that an impressive whitehorsed barouche was drawn up in the street beyond my window the horse tossed its head and chawed its frothy bit and the coachman sat up beside his whip in the sparkling frosty afternoon air my heart gave a thump and i was still seeking vaguely to connect this event with myself or with mr bowater in buenos ayres when the door opened and a lady entered whose plumed and purple bonnet was as much too small for her head as she herself was too large for the room yet in sheer dimensions this was not a very large lady it was her presence that augmented her  she seemed too to be perfectly accustomed to these special proportions and with a rather haughty thank you to mrs bowater winningly announced that she was lady pollacke a friend a mutual friend as i understand of dear mr crimbles  though a mauvish pink in complexion lady pollacke was so like her own white horse that whinnyingly rather than winningly would perhaps have been the apter word i have read somewhere that this human resemblance to horses sometimes accompanies unusual intelligence the poet william wordsworth was like a horse i have seen his portrait and i should like to see dean swifts whether or not the unexpected arrival of this visitor betrayed me into some little gaucherie and for a moment i still sat on as she had discovered me literally floored by my novel then i scrambled with what dignity i could to my feet and chased after my manners  and not merely that continued my visitor seating herself on a horsehair easychair but among my still older friends is mr pellew so you seeyou see she repeated apparently a little dazzled by the light of my window that we need no introduction and that i know allall the circumstances she lowered a plump whitekidded hand to her lap as if providentially there all the circumstances lay  unlike mr crimble lady pollacke had not come to make excuses but to bring me an invitationnothing less than to take tea with her on the following thursday afternoon but first she hopedshe was sure in fact and she satisfied herself with a candid gaze round my apartmentthat i was comfortable with mrs bowater a thoroughly trustworthy and sagacious woman though perhaps a little eccentric in address  i assured her that i was so comfortable that some of my happiest hours were spent gossiping with my landlady over my supper  ah yes she said that class of person tells us such very interesting things occasionally do they not yet i am convinced that the crying need in these days is for discrimination uplift by all means but we mustnt confuse what does the old proverb say festina lente theres still truth in that now had i known your fatherbut there we must not rake in old ashes we are clean i see and quiet and secluded  her equine glance made a rapid circuit of the photographs and ornaments that diversified the walls and i simply couldnt help thinking what a queer little cage they adorned for so large and handsome a bird the kind of bird as one might say that is less weight than magnitude  i was still casting my eye up and down her silk and laces when she abruptly turned upon me with a direct question you seldom i suppose go out  possibly if lady pollacke had not at this so composedly turned her full face on mewith its exceedingly handsome noseher bonnet might have remained only vaguely familiar now as i looked at her it was as if the full moon had risen she was without the least doubt in the world the lady who had bowed to mr crimble from her carriage that fateful afternoon a little countenance is not perhaps so telltale as a large one i remember at any rate the horrid shock i once experienced when my father set me up on his hand one day to show me my own face many times magnified in his dressingroom shavingglass but my eyes must have narrowed a little for lady pollackes at once seemed to set a little harder and she was still awaiting an answer to her question  go out i repeated meditatively not very much lady pollacke at least not in crowded places the boys you know  ah yes the boys it was mr crimbles little dilemma all over again lady pollacke was evidently wondering whether i knew she knew i knew  but still i continued cheerfully it is the lookeron that sees most of the game isnt it  her eyelids descended though her face was still lifted up well so the proverb says she agreed with the utmost cordiality it was at this momentas i have saidthat she invited me to tea  she would come for me herself she promised now wouldnt that be very nice for us bothquite a little adventure  i was not perfectly certain of the niceness but might not mr crimble be a fellowguest and hadnt i an urgent and anxious mission with him i smiled and murmured and as if her life had been a series of such little social triumphs my visitor immediately rose and i must confess in so doing seemed rather a waste of space  then thats settled thursday afternoon we must wrap up she called gaily through her descending veil this treacherous month it has come in like a lamb butand she tugged at her gloves still scrutinizing me fixedly beneath her eyelids but it will probably go out like a lion as if to illustrate this prediction she swept away to the door leaving mrs bowaters little parlour and myself to gather our scattered wits together as best we could while her carriage rolled away  alas though i love talking and watching and exploring how could i be even at that age a really social creature though lady pollacke had been politeness itself the remembrance of her bonnet in less favourable surroundings was still in my minds eye if anything then her invitation slightly depressed me besides thursday never was a favourite day of mine it is said to have only one lucky hourthe last before dawn but this is not teatime worse still the coming thursday seemed to have sucked all the virtue out of the wednesday in between i prefer to see the future stretching out boundless and empty in front of melike the savannas of robinson crusoes island visitors and i am quite sure he would have agreed with me are hardly at times to be distinguished from visitations  all this merely means that i was a rather green and backward young woman and far worse unashamed of being so here was one of the greatest ladies of beechwood lavishing attentions upon me and all i was thinking was how splendid an appearance she would have made a few days before if she had borrowed his whip from her coachman and dispersed my little mob with it as had mrs stocks with her duster but noblesse oblige mr crimble had been compelled to consider my feelings and no doubt lady pollacke had been compelled to consider his  the next day was fine but i overslept myself and was robbed of my morning walk for many hours i was alone mrs bowater had departed on one of her shopping bouts so whoever knocked knocked in vain and i listened to such efforts in secret and unmannerly amusement i wonder if ever ghosts come knocking like that on the doors of the mind and it isnt that one wont hear but cant my afternoon was spent in an anxious examination of my wardrobe four oclock punctually arrived and almost as punctually lady pollacke soon under mrs bowaters contemplative gaze i was mounted up on a pile of cushions and we were bowling along in most inspiriting fashion through the fresh march air strangely enough when during our progress eyes were now bent in my direction lady pollacke seemed copiously to enjoy their interest this was especially the case when she was acquainted with their owners and bowed her bow in return  quite a little reception for you she beamed at me after a particularly respectable carriage had cast its occupants scarcely modulated glances in my direction how strange is human character to an intelligent onlooker my other little reception must have been infinitely more inspiring and yet she had almost wantonly refused to take any part in it now supposing i had been royalty or a corpse run over in the street but we were come to our journeys end  brunswick house was a fine square stoneedged edifice dominating its own grounds regiments of crocuses stood with mouths wide open in its rich loam its gateposts were surmounted by white balls of stone and the gravel was of so lively a colour that it must have been new laid wherever i looked my eyes were impressed by the best things in the best order this was as true of lady pollackes clothes as of her features of her gateposts and her drawingroom and the next most important thing in the last was its light  light simply poured in upon its gilt and brass and pale maroon from two high wide windows staring each other down from between their rich silk damask curtains it was like entering an enormous bath and it made me timid in the midst of a large animals skin beneath a fine white marble chimneypiece and under an ormolu clock the parlourmaid was directed to place a cherrycoloured stool for me here i seated myself with a fine encouraging smile my hostess left me for a few minutes to myself maybe because an embroidered firescreen that stood near reminded me of miss fenne i pulled myself together dont be a ninny i heard myself murmur my one hope and desire in this luxurious solitude was for the opportunity to deliver my message to mr crimble this was not only a visit it was an adventure i looked about the flashing room and it rather stared back at me  the first visitor to appear was none but miss bullace whose recitation of the ladys yes had so peculiarly inspirited fanny she sat square and dark with her broad lap in front of her and scrutinized me as if no emergency ever daunted her and lady pollacke recounted the complexity of ties that had brought us together miss bullace alas knew neither mr ambrose pellew nor my godmother nor even my godmothers sister augusta fenne indeed i seemed to have no claim at all on her recognition until she inquired whether it was not augusta fennes cousin dr julius fenne who had died suddenly while on a visit to the bermudas apparently it was we all at once fell into better spirits which were still more refreshed when lady pollacke remarked that augusta had also gone off like that and that fennes were a doomed family  but merely to smile and smile is not to partake so i ventured to suggest that to judge from my last letter from my godmother she at any rate was in her usual health and i added rather more cheerfully perhaps than the fact warranted that my family seemed to be doomed too since so far as i was aware i myself was the last of it left alive  at this a sudden gush of shame welled up in me at the thought that through all my troubles i had never once remembered the kindnesses of my stepgrandfather that he too might be dead i was so rapt away by the thought that i caught only the last three words of miss bullaces murmured aside to lady pollacke viz not blush unseen  lady pollacke raised her eyebrows and nodded vigorously and then to my joy mr crimble and a venerable old lady with silver curls clustering out of her bonnet were shown into the room he looked pale and absent as he bent himself down to take my hand it was almost as if in secret collusion we had breathed the word fanny together mrs crimble was supplied with a teacup and her front teeth were soon unusually busy with a slice of thin bread and butter eating or drinking her intense old eyes dwelt distantly but assiduously on my small shape and she at last entered into a long story of how as a girl she had been taken to a circusa circus and there had seen but what she had seen mr crimble refused to let her divulge he jerked forward so hastily that his fragment of toasted scone rolled off his plate into the wild beasts skin and while with some little difficulty he was retrieving it he assured us that his mothers memory was little short of miraculous and particularly in relation to the past  i have noticed he remarked in what i thought a rather hollow voice that the more advanced in years weerhappily become the more closely we return to childhood  senile i began timidly remembering dr phelpss phrase  but mr crimble hastened on why mother he appealed to her with an indulgent laugh i suppose to you i am still nothing but a small boy about that height he stretched out a ringless left hand about twentyfour inches above the rosepatterned carpet  the old lady was not to be so easily smoothed over you interrupted me harold she retorted with some little show of indignation in what i was telling lady pollacke even a child of that size would have been a perfect monstrosity  a lightning grimace swept over miss bullaces square features  ah ah ah laughed mr crimble i am rebuked i am in the corner another scone lady pollacke mrs crimble was a beautiful old lady but it was with a rather unfriendly and feline eye that she continued to regard me and i wondered earnestly if fanny had ever noticed this characteristic  the fact of the matter is said lady pollacke with conviction our memories rust for want of exercise where physically speaking would you be mr crimble if you hadnt the parish to tramp over precisely the same with the mind every day i make a personal effort to commit some salient fact to memorysuch a fact for a trivial example as the date of the norman conquest the consequence is my husband tells me i am a veritable encyclopædia my father took after me alexander the great i have read somewhere could address by namethough one may assume not christian nameevery soldier in his army thomas babington macaulay a great genius poor man knew by heart every book he had ever read a veritable mine of memory on the other hand i once had a parlourmaid sarah jakes who couldnt remember even the simplest of her duties and if it hadnt been for my constant supervision would have given us port with the soup  perfectly perfectly true assented miss bullace now mine is a verbal memory my mind is a positive magnet for words method of course is everything i weld let us say that a line of a poem terminates with the word bower and the next line commences with she i commit these to memory as one wordbowersheeand so master the sequence my old friend lady bovill porterwe were schoolfellowsrecommended this method it was edmund keans i fancy or some other wellknown actors how else indeed could a great actor realize what he was doing wordperfect you see he is free  exactly exactly sagely nodded mr crimble but with a countenance so colourless and sad that it called back to my remembrance the picture of a martyrof st sebastian i thinkthat used to hang up in my mothers room  and youi discovered lady pollacke was rather shrilly inquiring of me is yours a verbal memory like miss bullaces or are you in my camp  ah there cried mr crimble tilting back his chair in sudden enthusiasm miss m positively puts me to shame and poetry miss bullace even your wonderful repertory  you mean miss m recites inquired miss bullace leaning forward over her lap but how entrancing it is we then who are birds of a feather and how i should adore to hear a fellowenthusiast now wont you lady pollacke join your entreaties to mine just a stanza or two  a chill crept through my bones i had accepted lady pollackes invitation thinking my mere presence would be entertainment enough and because i knew it was important to see life and immensely important to see mr crimble in actual fact it seemed i had hopped for a moment not out of my cage but merely as fanny had said into another compartment of it  but mr crimble and i were only talking i managed to utter  oh now but do delicious pleaded a trio of voices  their faces had suddenly become a little strained and unnatural the threat of further persuasion lifted me almost automatically to my feet with hunted eyes fixed at last on a small marble bust with stooping head and winged brow that stood on a narrow table under the window i recited the first thing that sprang to remembrancean old poem my mother had taught me tom o bedlam        the moons my constant mistress        and the lovely owl my marrow          the flaming drake          and the nightcrow make        me music to my sorrow       i know more than apollo        for oft when he lies sleeping          i behold the stars          at mortal wars        and the rounded welkin weeping       the moon embraces her shepherd        and the queen of love her warrior          while the first does horn          the stars of the morn        and the next the heavenly farrier   throughout these first three stanzas all went well so rapt was my audience that i seemed to be breaking the silence of the seas beyond their furthest hebrides but at the first line of the fourthat with a heartmy glance unfortunately wandered off from the unheeding face of the image and swam through the air to be caught as it were like fly by spider by miss bullaces dark fixed gaze that lay on me from under her flat hat  with a heart i began and failed some ghost within had risen in rebellion sealed my tongue it seemed to my irrational heart that i hadhow shall i say itbetrayed my stars betrayed fanny that she and they and i could never be of the same far quiet company again so the furious fancies were never shared the blood ran out of my cheek i stuck fast and shook my head  at which quite a little tempest of applause spent itself against the walls of lady pollackes drawingroom an applause reinforced by that of a little round old gentleman who unnoticed had entered the room by a farther door and was now advancing to greet his guest he was promptly presented to me on the beastskin and with the gentlest courtesy begged me to continue  with a heart now with a heart  he prompted me a most important organ though less in use nowadays than when i was a boy  but it was in vain even if he had asked me only to whisper the rest of the poem into his long pink ear for his sake alone i could not have done so moreover mr crimble was still nodding his head at his mother in confirmation of his applause and miss bullace was assuring me that mine was a poem entirely unknown to her that with a few little excisions it should be instantly enshrined in her repertorythough perhaps a little bizarre and that if i made trial of lady bovill porters bowershee method my memory would never again play me false  the enunciationam i not right sir walteras distinct from the elocutionwas flawless and really quite remarkable vocal power  amidst these smiles and delights and what with the brassy heat of the fire and the scent of the skin i thought i should presently faint and caught as if at a straw at the bust in the window  how lovely i cried with pointing finger  at that silence fell but only for a moment lady pollacke managed to follow the unexpected allusion and led me off for a closer inspection in the hushed course of our progress thither i caught out of the distance two quavering words uttered as if in expostulation apparent intelligence it was mrs crimble addressing sir walter pollacke  classical you know lady pollacke was sonorously informing me as we stood together before the marble head charming pose dont you think though as we see only a fragmentone of sir walters little hobbies  i looked up at the serene winged sightless face and a whisper sounded on and on in my mind in its mute presence i know more than apollo i know more than apollo how strange that this mere deafanddumbness should seem more real more human even than anything or any one else in lady pollackes elegant drawingroom but selfpossession was creeping back who i asked is he and who sculped him  scalped him cried lady pollacke poring down on me in dismay  cut him out  ah my dear young lady said a quiet voice that i cannot tell you it is the head of hypnos sleep you know the son of night and brother of death one wing as you see has been broken away in preparation for this more active age and yet  only a replica of course the voice trembled into richness but an exceedingly pleasant example it gives me rare pleasure rare pleasure he stood softly rocking hands under coattails eyes drinking me in toto have your companionship  what pleasure his words gave me i could notcan neverexpress then and there i was his slave for ever  walter murmured lady pollacke as if fondly smiling down on the rotund old gentleman you are a positive peacock over your little toys is he not mr crimble did you ever hear of a woman wasting her affections on the inanimate even a doll i am told is an infant in disguise  but mr crimble had approached us not to discuss infants or woman but to tell lady pollacke that her carriage was awaiting me  then pity tis tis true cried she as if in miss bullaces words but please miss m it must be the briefest of adieus there are so many of my friends who would enjoy your companyand those delightful recitations walter will you see that everythings quiteerconvenient  i am sure lady pollackes was a flawless savoir faire yet when i held out my hand in farewell her cheek crimsoned it seemed from some other cause than stooping the crucial moment had arrived if one private word was to be mine with mr crimble it must be now or never to my relief both gentlemen accompanied me out of the room addressing their steps to mine urgency gave me initiative i came to a standstill on the tesselated marble of the hall and this time proffered my hand to sir walter he stooped himself double over it and i tried in vain to dismiss from remembrance a favourite reference of pollies to the guineapig held up by its tail  i wonder now what sir w would have said of me in his autobiography and there stood a flaxen spelican in the midst of the hearthrug blushing poor tiny thing over her little piece like some little breadandbutter miss fresh from school something to that effect i wonder still more who taught him so lovable a skill in handling that spelican  there goodbye said he and the blessing my dear young lady of a fellow fanatic  he turned about and ascended the staircase except for the parlourmaid who was awaiting me in the porch mr crimble and i were alone     chapter twenty   mr crimble i whispered i have a message  a tense excitement seized him his face turned a dusky yellow how curious it is to see others as they must sometimes see ourselves should i have gasped like that if mr crimble had been fannys mercury  a letter from miss bowater i whispered and i am to say the cadaverous face was close above me its sombre melting eyes almost bulging behind their glasses i am to say that she is giving yours her earnest attention let alone her prayers  i remember once when adam waggett as a noisy little boy was playing in the garden at home the string of his toy bow suddenly snapped mr crimble drew back as straight and as swiftly as that his eyes rained unanswerable questions but the parlourmaid had turned to meet me and the next moment she and i were side by side in lady pollackes springy carriage en route for my lodgings i had given my message but never for an instant had i anticipated it would have so overwhelming an effect  there must have been something inebriating in lady pollackes tea my mind was still simmering with excitement and yet during the whole of that journey i spent not a moment on mr crimbles or fannys affairs or even on brunswick house but on the dreadful problem whether or not i ought to tip the parlourmaid and if so with how much where had i picked this enigma up possibly from some chance reference of my fathers it made me absent and harassed i saw not a face or a flower and even when the parlourmaid was actually waiting at my request in mrs bowaters passage i stood over my moneychest still incapable of coming to a decision  instinct prevailed just as i could not bring myself to complete tom o bedlam with miss bullace looking out of her eyes at me so i could not bring myself to offer money to lady pollackes nice prim parlourmaid instead i hastily scrabbled up in tissue paper a large flat broocha bloodstone set in pinchbecka thing of no intrinsic value alas but precious to me because it had been the gift of an old servant of my mothers i hastened out and lifting it over my head pushed it into her hand  dear me how ashamed of this impulsive action i felt when i had regained my solitude should i not now be the jest of the pollacke kitchen and drawingroom alikefor even in my anxiety to attain mr crimbles private ear i had halfconsciously noticed what a cascade of talk had gushed forth when mr crimble had closed the door of the latter behind him  that evening i shared with mrs bowater my experiences at brunswick house so absorbed was i in my own affairs that i deliberately evaded any reference to hers yet her pallid face seemingly an inch longer and many shades more austere these last two days touched my heart  you wont think i pleaded at last that i dont infinitely prefer being here with you isnt it mrs bowater that you and i havent quite so many things to pretend about it is easy thinking of others when there are only one or two of them but whole drawingroomsful while here well there is only just you and me  why miss she replied as for pretending the worlds full of shadows though substantial enough when it comes to close quarters if we were all to look at things just bare in a manner of speaking it would have to be the garden of eden over again it cant be done and its just that that whats called the gentry know so well we must make the best use of the mess we can  i was tired the thin sweet air of spring wafted in at my window after the precocious heat of the day breathed a faint reviving fragrance a curious excitement was in me yet her words or perhaps the tone of her voice coloured my fancy with vague forebodings i pushed aside my supper slipped off my fine visiting clothes and put on my dressinggown with lights extinguished i drew the blind and strove for a while to puzzle out lifes riddle for myself not for the first or the last time did wandering wits cheat me of the goal for presently in the quiet out of my thoughts stole into my imagination the vision of that dreaming head my eyes had sheltered on  hypnos i sighed the word andanother face fannys seemed to melt into and mingle with the visionary features why why was my desperate thought why needed she allow the world to come to such close quarters why with so many plausible reasons given in her letter for keeping poor mr crimble waiting had she withheld the one that counted for most and what was it i knew in my heart that that could not be making the best use of the mess surely if one just told only the truth there wasnt anything else to tell it had taken me some time to learn this lesson  a low rumbling voice shook up from the kitchen mrs bowater was talking to herself dejection drew over me again at the thought of the deceit i was in and i looked at my love for fanny as i suppose abraham at the altar of stones looked at his son isaac then suddenly a thought far more matteroffact chilled through my mind i saw again mr crimble huddling down towards me in that echoing hall heard my voice delivering fannys message and realized that half of what i had said had been written in mockery it had been intended for my eye onlylet alone my prayers in the solitude of the darkness the words had a sound far more sinister than even fanny can have intended  mr crimble however had accepted them apparently in good faithto judge at least from the letter which reached me the following morning        dear miss mthank you i write with a mind so overburdened that      words fail me but i realize that miss bowater has no truer friend      than yourself and shall be frank after that terrible morning      you might well have refused to help me i cannot believe that you      willfor her sake this long concealment believe me is not of my      own seeking it cannot it must not continue a moment beyond the      necessity for weeks nay months i have been tortured with doubts      and misgivings her pride her impenetrable heedlessness oh      indeed i realize the difficulties of her situation i dare not      speak till she gives consent yet silence puts me in a false      position and tongues as perhaps even you may be aware begin to      wag nor is this my first attempt andto be more frank than i      feel is discreetthere is my mother quite apart from hers now      alas aged and more dependent on my affection and care than ever      to make a change nowthe talk the absence of christian charity      my own temperament and calling i pray for counsel to guide my      stumbling bark on this sea of darkest tempest       can f decide that her affections are such as could justify her      in committing her future to me am i justified in asking her you      too must have many anxietiesanxieties perhaps unguessed at by      those of coarser fibre and though i cannot venture to ask your      confidences i do ask for your feminine intuitioneven though this      may seem an intrusion after my sad discomfiture the other day      and yet i assure you it was not corporeal fearare not we      priests the police of the city beautiful might i not have      succeeded merely in making us both ridiculous but that is past      and the dead past must bury its dead there is no gentler sexton       need i say that this letter is not the fruit of any mere      impulse the thought the very image of her never leaves my      consciousness night or day and i get no rest i am almost afraid      at the power she has of imprinting herself on the mind i implore      you to be discreet without needless deception i will wait      patiently my last desire is to hasten an answerunless dear      miss m one in the affirmative and would it be possibleindeed      the chief purpose of this letter was to make this small      requestwould it be possible to give me one hourno teathis      afternoon there was a phrase in your whispered messageprobably      because of the peculiar acoustic properties of brunswick      housethat was but halfcaught we must not risk the faintest      shadow of misunderstanding       believe me yours most gratefully though perplexed in the      extreme       harold crimble       psi feel at times that it is incumbent on one to burn ones      boats even though out of sight the further shore       and the letter would it be even possible to share a glance at      that   my old habit of hunting in the crannies of what i read had ample opportunity here two things stood out in my mind a kind of astonishment at mr crimbles stumbling bark which he was asking me to help to steer and inexpressible relief that fannys letter was buried beyond hope of recovery before he could call that afternoon the more i pitied and understood his state of mind the more helpless and anxious i felt then in my foolish fashion i began again picturing in fancy the ceremony that would bring mr crimble and my landlady into so close a relationship why did he fear the wagging of tongues so much i didnt would miss bullace be a bridesmaid would i i searched in my drawer and read over the form of solemnization of matrimony i came to the dreadful day of judgment and to serve and obey and shivered i was not sure that i cared for the way human beings had managed these things but at least bridesmaids said nothing and if i  while i was thus engaged mrs bowater entered the room i smuggled my prayerbook aside and gave her fannys letter she was always a woman of few words she folded it reflectively took off her spectacles replaced them in their leather case and that in her pocket  soap handkerchiefs stockings she mused though why in the world she didnt say silk is merely fannys way and i am sure miss she added she must have had one peculiar moment when the thought occurred to her of the bolt  but mrs bowater i cried in snakelike accents you said you were soliciting no divulgements  mrs bowaters mouth opened in silent laughter between you she began and broke off gracious goodness but heres that young man mr crimble calling again   mr crimble drank tea with me though he ate nothing and now his darkest tempest being long since stilled i completely absolve myself for amending the message which lady pollackes tesselated hall had mercifully left obscure he sat there almost like a goldfishthough black in effect beyond descriptiongaping for the crumb that never comes she bade me i muttered my falsehood she bade me say secretly that she has had your letter that she is giving it her earnest attention her earnest attention alone and in her prayers  the dark liquid pupils appeared for one sheer instant to rotate then he turned away and as if quite helplessly stifled an unsheltered yawn  alone he cried desperately i see myself i see myself in her young imagination  i think he guessed that my words were false that his ear had not been as treacherous as all that whether or not no human utterance have i ever heard so humble tragic final it knelled in my ear like the surrender of all hope and yet it brought me personally some enlightenment it was with mr crimbles eyes that i now scanned not only his phantom presence in fannys imagination but my own standing beside hima knickknack figure of fun pygmied beneath the flappets of his clerical coat like a sunbeetle by a rook the spectacle strengthened me without much affecting fanny she was no longer the absolute sultana of my being i could think now as well as adore  how strange it is that when our minds are needled to a sharp focus mere things swarm so close there was not a single ornament or book or fading photograph in mrs bowaters parlour that in this queer privacy did not mutely seem to cry yes here am i this is how things go  i leant forward and looked at him we mustnt care what she sees what she thinks if only we can go on loving her  can can echoed mr crimble i have prayed on my knees not to  this was a sharp ray on my thoughts of love but why i said even when i was a child i knew by my mothers face that i must go on and should go on loving her mr crimble whether she loved me or not one cant make a bad mistake in giving can one and yetwell you must remember that i cannot but have been aa disappointment that as long as i live i cant expect any great affection any disproportionate one i mean  but but he stumbled on a daughters affectionits different i mustnt brood on my trouble it unhinges me why the clock stops but nevertheless may god bless you for that  but surely i persisted smiling as cheerfully as i could nil desperandum mr crimble and you know what they say about fish in the sea  his eye rolled round on me as if a serpent had spoken i am sorry i am sorry he repeated rapidly in the same low unemphatic undertone as if to himself i must just wait you have never seen a sheepa bullock shall we call himbeing driven to the slaughterhouse on onfrom despair to despair thats my position his face was emptied of expression his eyes fixed  these words his air his look this awful private thingi cant sayit shocked and frightened me beyond words but i answered him steadily none the less listen mr crimble i said look at me here what i am i have had my desperate moments toomore alone in the world than you can ever be and i swear before god that i will never never be not myself i wonder what the listener thought of this little challenge not perhaps what mr crimble did  well he replied with sudden calm thats the courage of the martyrs and not all of them perhaps have been christians if history is to be credited yes and in sober truth i assure you you that i would go to the stake forfor miss bowater  he rose and in that instant of dignity i foresaw what was never to belawn sleeves encasing those loose black arms he had somehow wafted me back to my confirmation  and the letter i have no wish to intrude but her actual words i maynt see that  you will please forgive me i entreated helplessly it is buried because you see fannyyou see mrs bowater  ah he said it is this deception which dismays scandalizes me most but you will keep me informed  he seized his soft round hat and it was on this cold word we parted i stood by the window with hand stretched out to summon him back but no word of comfort or hope came to my aid and i watched him out of sight     chapter twentyone   that night i wrote to fanny copying out my letter from the scrawling draft from which i am copying it now        dear fannyi have given mr crimble your message first exactly      in your own words though he did not quite hear them and then      leaving out a little you may be angry at what i am going to      saybut i am quite sure you ought to answer him at once fanny      hes dreadfully fond of you i never even dreamed people were      like thatin such torture for what cant be unless you mean you      do care but are too proud to tell him so if he knows you have      no heart for him he may soon be better this sounds hateful but i      am not such a pin in a pincushion as not to know that even the      greatest sorrows and disappointments wear out why isnt that      beechtree we sat under a kind of cannibal of its own dead leaves       your private letter is quite safe though i prefer not to burn      itindeed cannot burn it you know how i have longed for it      but please if possible dont send me two in future it doesnt      seem fair and your mother knew already about our stargazing you      see how else could the door have been bolted but its best to      have been found outnext i mean to telling oneself       what day are you coming home i look at it as if it were a      lighthouseeven though it is out of sight shall we go on with      wuthering heights when you do come i saw the dazzling      moonbut there fanny what i want most to beg of you is to write      to mr crimbleall that you feel even if not all that you think      no perhaps i mean the reverse he must have been wondering about      you long before i began to and there it was all sunken in no one      could have guessed his longing by looking at him i am afraid it      must affect his health       and now goodbye i have made a vow to myself not to think into      things too much your affectionate friend as much of her as there      is       midgetina       psplease tell me the day you are coming and that shall be my      birthday   fanny was prompt in reply        dear midgetinaits a strange fact but while to judge from      your letter you seem to be growing smaller i in spite of miss      stebbingss water porridge am growing fatter now which is the      tragedy i may come home on the 30th if so kill the fatted      calf i will supply the birthdaycake how foolish of you to keep      letters i never do lest i should remember the answers anyhow i      shall not write again but if by any chance mr crimble should      make another call will you explain that my chief motive in not      singing at the concert was because i should have been a second      mezzosoprano one of two in one concert must be superfluous      perhaps i did not explain this clearly nor did i say how charming      i thought my double was       i am tiredof overwork i have finished wuthering heights it      is a mad untrue book the world is not like emily brontës      conception of it it is neither dream nor nightmare midgetina but      wide wide awake and i am convinced that the poets are only      cherubs with sugarsticks to their little rosebud mouths i      abominate whitewash as for putting people out of their misery      and cannibal beechtrees no fretful midge if you could see me      sitting here looking down on rows and rows of vacant and hostile      facesthough one or two are infatuated enoughyou would realize      that such a practice would lead me into miscellaneous infanticide       personally i never did think into things too painfully though as      regards telling the reverse is certainly the wiser course so      you will forgive so short and perhaps none too sweet a letter      from your affecf   enclosed with this was a narrow slip of paper        i shall not write to you know who think if you like but dont      feel like a microscope he is only in love and however      punctilious your own practice may be pray miss m do not      preachat any rate to your affecte but unregenerate friendf   i believe i drafted and destroyed three answers to this letter it broke down my defences far more easily than had the errand boys it shamed me for a prig a false friend a sentimentalist and the fretful midge rankled like salt in a wounded heart yet fanny was faithless even to her postscript a sheaf of narcissuses hooded in blue tissue paper was left at the house a day or two afterwards it was accompanied by mr crimbles card in a little envelope tied in with the stalks        i am given a ray of hope   mrs bowater had laid this offering on my table with a peculiar grimace whether scornful or humorous it was impossible to detect from mr crimble miss why one might think he had two irons in the fire  i sat gazing at this thankoffering long after she had gonethe waxy wings the crimsonrimmed corona the palegreen cluster of pistil and stamen the heavy perfume stole over my senses bringing only weariness and selfdistaste to my mind fly that i was caught in a webonce more i began a letter to fanny imploring her to write to her mother to tell her everything but that letter too was torn up into tiny pieces and burnt in the fire  next morning heavily laden with my parasol a biscuit or two in my bag my sense and sensibility and a rug in my arms i set off very early for wanderslore having arranged with mrs bowater over night that she should meet me under my beech at a quarter to one  under the flat budpointed branches i pressed on between clusters of primrose celandine and wild wood anemone breathing in the earthy freshness of grass and moss and presently i came out between the stones and jutting roots in sight of the vacant windows i stood for a moment confronting their black regard then descended the knoll and was soon making myself comfortable beside the garden house but first i managed to clamber up on a fragment of the fallen masonry and peep in at its low windows a few dead lastyears flies lay dry on their backs dusty derelict spiderwebs a litter of straw and a few potsherdsthe place was empty but it was mine and the very remembrance of which it whispered to methe picture of my poor fathers bedroom that night of the stormonly increased my sense of possession  what was wrong with me just then what i had sallied out in hope to be delivered from was the unhappy conviction that my life was worthless and i of no use in the world i had taught myself to make knots in strings but actual experience seemed to have proved that most human fumblings resulted only in grannies and not in the true lovers variety they secured nothing only tangled and jammed i was young then and yet as heavily burdened with other peoples responsibilities as was poor christian with the bundle of his sins but my bundle too in that lovely desolate loneliness at last fell off my shoulders  could i not still be loyal in heart and mind to fanny even though now i knew how little she cared whether i was loyal or not i even climbed up behind mr crimbles thick spectacles and looked down again at myself from that point of vantage whether or not i was his affair i could try to make him mineperhaps even persuade fanny to love him  oh dear was not every singing bird in that wilderness every unfolding flower and sunlit march leaf welcoming the spirit within me to their quiet habitation as if in response to this naïve thought welled up in my memory the two last stanzas of my tom o bedlam which either for pride or shame had stuck in my throat on the skin mat in lady pollackes skylit drawingroom        with a heart of furious fancies        whereof i am commander          with a burning spear          and a horse of air        to the wilderness i wander       with a knight of ghosts and shadows        i summoned am to tourney          ten leagues beyond          the wide worlds end        methinks it is no journey   parasol for spear the youngest miss shankss pony for horse of air there was i even though commonsized boots might reckon it a mere mile or so ten leagues at least beyondmrs bowaters nor like her husband had i broken my leg nor had fanny broken my heart all would come right again why what a waste of fanny it would be to make her mrs crimble my bishop according to miss fenne had had quite a homely helpmate little short of a frump caroline as i remember her thirty years ago perhaps if i left off my fine colours and bought a nice brown stuff dress and a bonnet might not mr crimble change his mind i have noticed that as soon as i begin to laugh at myself the whole world seems to smile in return  absurd contrary volatile creature that i wasa kind of thankfulness spread over my mind i turned on to my knees where i sat and repeated the prayers which in my haste to be off i had neglected before coming out and thus kneeling i opened my eyes on the garden again bathed delicately in the eastern sunshine there was my old friend mr clodds nature pranking herself under the nimble fingers of spring and in her sight as well as in the sight of my godmothers god and mr crimbles almighty and possibly of dr phelpss norm were not in deed and in truth all men equal how mysterious and how entrancing if sight then eyes but whose where i gazed round me dazzledly and if wings had been mine would have darted through the thin bluegreen veil and been out into the morning  poor sheknight romantical miss midge she had no desire to hunt big game or turn steeplejack her fancies were not dangerously furious but as she knelt there environed about by that untended garden and not so ridiculously pygmy either even in the ladder of the worlds proportionsawedged blade of grass goldcupped moss starry stonecrop green musky moschatel closepacked pebble waxwinged flywell i know not how to complete the sentence except by remarking that i am exceedingly glad i began to write my life  i realized too that it is less flattering to compare oneself with the very little things of the world than with the great given time i might scale an alp i could only kill an ant besides i am beginning to think that one of the pleasantest ways of living is in ones memory how much less afflicting at times would my present have been if i had had the foresight to remind myself how beguiling it would appear as the past even my old sharpest sorrows have now hushed themselves to sleep and those for whom i have sorrowed are as quiet  having come to a pause in my reflections i opened my sense and sensibility at chapter xxxv yet attend to miss austen i could not she is one of those compact and cautious writers that will not feed a wandering mind and at last after three times rereading the same paragraph an uneasy conviction began to steal over me there was no doubt now in my mind i was being watched softly stealthily i raised my eyes from my book and with not the least motion of head or body glanced around me whereupon as if it had been playing sentinel out of the thicket near at hand a blackbird suddenly jangled its challenge and with warning cries fled away on its wings towards the house     chapter twentytwo   then instantly i discovered the cause of the birds alarm at first i fancied that this strange figure was at some little distance then i realized that his stature had misled me and that he could not be more than twenty or thirty yards away standing there with fixed white face and black hair under a flowering blackthorn he remained as motionless and as intent as i he was not more than a few inches apparently superior in height to myself  so i seemed to whisper as gaze met gaze there hardly certain the while if he was real or an illusion indeed if even then before my eyes he had faded out into the tangle of thorn twig and thinspun blossom above and around him it would not have greatly astonished though it would have deeply disappointed me with a peculiar trembling curiosity i held him with my gaze if he would not disclose himself then must i  slowly and deliberately my cold hand crept out and grasped my parasol without for a moment removing my eyes from this interlopers face i pushed its ribbed silk tent taut into the air click went the tiny spring and at that he stirred  who are you watching me i cried in a low steady voice across the space that divided us his head stooped a little i fanciedand fearedthat he was about to withdraw but after a pause he drew himself up and came nearer casting as he approached his crooked shadow away from the sun on the closecropped turf beside him  to this day i sometimes strive in vain to see quite clearly in my mind that face as it appeared at that first meeting a different memory of it obtrudes itself yet how many many times have i searched his features for news of himself and looked passinglyand once with final intensityinto those living eyes but i recollect that his clothes looked slightly out of keeping and grotesque amid the green things of early spring it seemed he had wasted in them so too the cheek had wasted over its bone and seemed parched the thin lips the ears slightly pointed and then broke out his low hollow voice scarcely rising or falling the mere sound of it seemed to be as full of meaning as the words  he looked at me and at all i possessed as if piece by pieceas if he had been a long time searching for them all yet he now seemed to avoid my eyes though they were serenely awaiting his indeed from this moment almost to the last i was never at a loss or distressed in his company he never called me out of myself beyond an easy and happy return though he was to creep into my imagination as easily as a single bee creeps into the thousandcelled darkness of its hive  whenever i parted from him his remembrance was like that of one of those strange figures which thrust themselves as if out of the sleepworld into the minds wakefulness vividly darkly impress themselves upon consciousness and then are gone so i sometimes wonder if i ever really knew him if he was ever perfectly real to me like fanny for instance yet he made no pretence to be mysterious and we were soon talking together almost as naturally as if we were playmates of childhood who had met again after a long separation  he confessed that quite unknown to me he had watched me come and go in the cold mornings of winter when frost had soon driven me home again out of the bare frozen woods he had even been present i think when fanny and i had sharedor dividedthe stars between us a faint distaste at any rate showed itself on his face when he admitted that he had seen me not alone i was unaccustomed to that kind of interest and hardly knew whether to be pleased or angry  but you know i come here to be alone i said as courteously as possible  yes he answered with face turned away thats how i saw you  without my being aware of it too he played a kind of chess with me seizing each answer in turn for hook on which to hang another question what had i to conceal of my short history though not of myself i told him freely yet asked him few questions in return nor at that time did i even consider how strange a chance had brought two such human beings as he and i to this place of meeting yet after all whales are but little creatures by comparison with the ocean in which they roam and glowworm will keep tryst with glowworm in forests black as night  through all he said was woven a thread of secrecy so low and monotonous was his voice not lifting itself much but only increasing in resonance when any thought angered or darkened his mind so few were his gestures that he might have been talking in his sleep not once that long morning did he laugh not even when i mischievously proffered him my parasol as he sat a few paces away to screen him from the march sun solemnly he shared mrs bowaters biscuits with me scattering the crumbs to a robin that hopped up between us as if he had been invited to our breakfast  his head hung so low between his heavy shoulders that it reminded me of a flower stooping for want of water not that there was anything limp or fragile or gentle in his looks he was far rather clumsy and ugly in appearance yet with a grace in his look like that of an old haggled thorntree when the wind moves its branches and anyhow he was come to be my friendout of the unknown and when i looked around at the serene wild loveliness of the garden it seemed to be no less happy a place because it was no longer quite a solitude  you read he said glancing reflectively but none too complimentarily at my book  it isnt wise to think too much i replied solemnly shutting miss austen up besides as i havent the opportunity of seeing many people in the flesh you know the next best thing is to meet them in booksspecially in this kind of book if only i were jane austen my gracious i would enjoy myself her people are just the same as people are nowinside i doubt if leopards really want to change their spots but of coursei added since he did not seem inclined to express any opinioni read other kinds of books as well thats the best of being a duncetheres so much to learn just lately i have been learning to tie knots  i laughed and discovered that i was blushing  he raised his eyes slowly to my face then looked so long and earnestly at my hands that i was forced to hide them away under my bag long before i had noticed that his own hands were rather large and powerful for his size fannys face i had loved to watch for its fairness and beautyit would have been as lovely if she had not been within to watch mrs bowaters was like spelling out bits of a peculiar language i often found out what she was feeling or thinking by imitating her expression and then translating it after she was gone this young mans kept me engrossed because of the self that brooded in itits dark melancholy too and because even then perhaps i may have remotely and vaguely realized that flesh and spirit could not be long of one company he himself was as it were a foreigner to me and i felt i must make the best and most of him before he went off again  perhaps memory reads into this experience more than in those green salad days i actually found there but of this at least i am certainthat the morning sped on unheeded in his company and i was even unconscious of how cold i was until he suddenly glanced anxiously into my face and told me so so now we wandered off together towards the great housewhich hitherto i had left unapproached we climbed the greenstained scaling steps from terrace to terrace tufted with wallflower and snapdragon amongst the weeds cushioned with bright moss fretted with lichen standing there side by side with him looking upour two figures alone on the wide flowerless weedgrown terracehale sour weeds some of them shoulderhighi scrutinized the dark shut windows  what was the secret that had kept it so long vacant i inquired mrs bowater had never given me any coherent answer to this question my words dropped into the silence like a pebble into a vast black pool of water  there was a tale about he replied indifferently and yet as i fancied not so indifferently as he intended that many years ago a womanhe pronounced the word almost as if it had reference to a different species from ourselvesthat a woman had hanged herself in one of its upper rooms  hanged herself it was the kind of fable mrs ballard used to share with adam waggetts mother over their tea and shrimps frowning in horror and curiosity i scanned his face was this the water i could dip for in his well alas how familiar i was to become with the bucket  he made a movement with his hands at which i saw the poor creature up there in the darkness suspended lifeless poor poor human with head awry  why i asked him pondering childishly over this picture  it was mere gossip he replied and true or not such as they make up to explain their own silly superstitions just thinking long enough and hard enough would soon invite an evil spirit into any old empty house human beings are no better than sheep though they dont always see the dogs and shepherds that drive them  and does it i faltered glancing covertly up the walls and conscious of a novel vein of interest in this strangely inexhaustible world does the evil spirit ever look out of the windows  he turned his face to me smiling and inquired if i had ever heard the phrase the eyelids of the dawn theres night too he said  but whose spirit whose i persisted when i am here alone in the garden why it is just peace how could that be if an evil spirit haunted here  yes he said but a selfish solitary peace dead birds dont sing dont come when you cant get back or the clouds are down  you are trying to frighten me i said in a louder voice and i have been too much alone for that of course things must look after themselves dont we and you said an evil spirit what is the good of dreaming when you are wide awake  then said he almost coldly do you deny that man is an evil spirit he distorts and destroys  but with that the words of my mother came back to me out of a faraway morning he made us of his power and love yet i could not answer him could only wait as if expectant that by mere silence i should be able to share the thoughts he was thinking and all the while my eyes were brooding in some dark chamber of my mind on fanny and not as they well might have on the dark bark of mr crimble tossing in jeopardy beneath its fleeting ray of hope  truly this stranger was making life very interesting even if he was only prodding over its dead moles and truly i was an incorrigibly romantic young lady for when with a glance at my grandfathers watch i discovered that it was long past noon and told him i must be gone without a single moments hesitation i promised to come again to meet him on the very first fine morning that showed so strong within me was the desire to do so that a profound dismay chilled my mind when on turning about at the end of the terracefor he had shown no inclination to accompany mei found that he was already out of sight i formally waved my hand towards where he had vanished in case he should be watching sighed and went on  it was colder under the high sunless trees i gathered my cloak closer around me and at that discovered not only that miss austen had been left behind but that fannys letter still lay in undisturbed concealment beneath its stone it was too late to return for them now and a vague misgiving that had sprung up in me amid the treetrunks was quieted by the assurance that for theserather than for any other reasoni must return to wanderslore as soon as i could so in remarkably gay spirits i hastened lightheeled on my way in the direction of civilized society of nefarious man and of my nevertobeblessedtoomuch mrs bowater     chapter twentythree   my landlady was already awaiting me at the place appointed and we walked off together towards the house it had been a prudent arrangement for we met and passed at least half a dozen strangers before we arrived there and one and all by the unfeigned astonishment with which they turned to watch our two figures out of sight for i stooped once or twice as if to tie my shoelace in order to see clearly proved themselves to belong to that type of humanity to which my new acquaintance had referred frigidly as they vanity of vanities when one old loitering gentleman did not so much as lift an eyelid at mehe was so absorbed in own thoughtsi felt a pang of annoyance  as soon as i was safely installed in my own room again i confided in mrs bowater a full account of my mornings adventure not so much because i wished to keep free of any further deceit as because i simply couldnt contain myself and must talk of my stranger she heard me to the end without question but with an unusual rigidity of features she compressed her lips even tighter before beginning her catechism  what was the young mans name she inquired and where did he live  my hope had been that she herself would be able to supply these little particulars with a blank face i shook my head we just talked of things in general  i see she said and glanced at me as if over her spectacles her next question was even less manageable was the young fellow a gentleman  alas she had fastened on a flaw in my education this was a problem absolutely new to me i thought of my father of mr waggett dr grose dr phelps the old farmer in the railway train of sir walter pollacke my bishop heathcliff mr bowater mr clodd even henryor rather all these male phantoms went whisking across the back of my mind calling up every other twolegged creature of the same gender within sight or hearing meanwhile mrs bowater stood like patience on her brussels carpet or rather like thomas de torquemada watching these intellectual contortions  well really do you know mrs bowater i was forced to acknowledge at last with a sigh and a smile i simply cant say i didnt think of it that seems rather on his side doesnt it but to be quite quite candid perhaps not a gentleman not exactly i mean  which is no more than i supposed was her comment and if notand any kind of not misswhat was he then and if not why you can never go there again  indeed but i must i said as if to myself  with your small knowledge of the world she retorted unmovedly you must if you please be guided by those with more who isnt a gentleman couldnt be desirable company if chanced on like a stranger in a young ladys lonely rambles and how tall did you say and whats more she continued not pausing for an answer and gathering momentum on her way if he is a gentleman id better come along with you miss and see for myself  a rebellious and horrified glance followed her retreating figure out of the room so this was the reward for being open and aboveboard what a ridiculous figure i should cut tippeting along behind my landlady what would my stranger think of me what would she think of him was he a gentleman to decide whether or not the spirit of man is an evil spirit had been an easy problem by comparison gentle manwhy of course self muttered in shame to self convicted of yet another mean little snobbery he had been almost absurdly gentlehad treated me as if i were an angel rather than a young woman  but the nettlerash produced by mrs bowaters bigotry was not to be so easily allayed as all that it had invited yet another kind of them in an old green rotting board hung over the wicket gate that led up the stony path into wandersloretrespassers will be prosecuted why couldnt one put boards up in the wanderslore of ones mind my landlady had never inquired if lady pollacke was a gentlewoman how mechanical things were in their unexpectedness that morning i had gone out to free myself from the crimble tangle merely to return with a few more knots in the skein  a dead calm descended on me i was adrift in the sargasso seain the doldrums and had dropped my sextant overboard even a long stare at the mastermariner on the wall gave me no help yet i must confess that these foolish reflections made me happy i would share them with fannyperhaps with the gentleman himself some day i leaned over the side of my small vessel more deeply interested in the voyage than i had been since pollie had carried me out of my girlhood into the waggetts wagonette and as i sat there simmering over these novelties a voice clear as a cockcrow exclaimed in my mind if father hadnt died id have had nothing of all this my hands clenched damp in my lap at this monstrosity but i kept my wits and managed to face it if father hadnt died i answered myself you dont know what would have happened and if you think that because i am happy now anything could make me not wish him back its a lie but i remained a little less comfortable in mind   the evening post brought me a letter and a registered parcel i turned them over and over examining the unfamiliar handwriting the bright red seals but all in vain in spite of my hardwon knotlore i was still kneeling over the package and wrestling with string and wax when mrs bowater folding her letter away in its envelope announced baldly shes not coming home it seems at all these holidays having been invited by some school friend into the countrymerriden or some such place not that you might expect fanny to write plain when she doesnt mean plain  oh mrs bowater not at all  cold fogs of disappointment swept in blotting out my fools paradise that inward light without which life is dark indeed died in eclipse the one thought and desire which i now realized i had been feeding on from hour to hour had been snatched away to think that they had been nothing but waste oh fanny i whispered bitterly to myself oh fanny but the face i lifted to her mother showed only defiance  well i muttered who cares lets hope she will enjoy herself better than mooning about in this dingy old place  mrs bowater merely continued to look quietly over the envelope at me  oh but you know mrs bowater i quaked miserably its not dingy to me surely a promise is a promise whoever you make it to  with that i stooped my face over the stuffysmelling brown paper and attacked the last knot with my teeth with eyes still a little asquint with resentment i smoothed away the wrappings from the shape within then every thought evaporated in a sigh for there of a delicate veined fairness against the white paper lay a minute copy in ivory of none but lovely hypnos halfblindly i stared at itlost in a serenity beyond all hope of my poor foolish lifethen lifted it with both hands away from my face a presentto me look i cried look  mrs bowater settled her face over the image as if it had been some tropical and noxious insect i was offering for her inspection but i thrust it into her hand and opened my letter        my dear young ladyi am no poet and therefore cannot hope to      share with you the music of the flaming drake but we did share      my hypnos only a replica as i told you but none the less one of      the most beautiful things i possess will you then give me the      pleasure of accepting the contents of the little package i am      having posted with thisas a small token of the delight your      enthusiasm gave yours most sincerely       walter pollacke       pslady pollacke tells me that we may perhaps again look forward      to your company to tea in a few days please do not think then of      acknowledging this little message by post   but i did acknowledge it not with that guardedness of the feelings which miss austen seemed to recommend but from the very depths of my heart next morning came lady pollackes invitation        dear miss mi hasten to renew my invitation of last thursday      will you give us the pleasure of your company at tea on friday      afternoon mrs monneriethe younger daughter as you will      remember of lord bhas expressed an exceedingly warm wish to      make your acquaintance and mr pellew who is giving us a course      of sermons at st peters during holy week will also be with us      may we perhaps share yet another of those delightful      recitations       believe me       yours sincerely       lydia preston pollacke   i searched my memory for memorial of lord b alas in vain this lapse made the thought of meeting his younger daughter a little alarming yet i must confess to having been pleasantly flattered by these attentions even the black draught administered by fanny who had not even thought it worth her while to send me a word of excuse or explanation lost much of its bitterness i asked mrs bowater if she supposed i might make sir walter a little present in return for his would it be a proper thing to do would it be ladylike  whats meant kindly she assured me after a moments reflection even if taken amiss which to judge from his letter it wont be is nothing to be thought of but only felt  this advice decided me and early on my friday morning i trimmed and freshened up as well as i could one of my grandfathers dwarf cedartrees which in the old days had stood on my window balcony its branches were now a little dishevelled but it was still a fresh and pretty thing in its greygreen pot     chapter twentyfour   with this dwarf tree in my arms when came the auspicious afternoon i followed lady pollackes parlourmaidher neat little bonnet tied with a bow under her eardown my bateses and was lifted by mrs bowater into the carriage how demure a greeting we exchanged when the maid and i having seated ourselves together under its hood my glance fell upon the bloodstone brooch pinned conspicuously for the occasion near the topmost button of her trim outdoor jacket it gave me so much confidence that even the sudden clatter of conversation that gushed out over me in the doorway of lady pollackes drawingroom failed to be disconcerting the long flowery room was thronged with company and everybody was talking to everybody else on my entry as if a seraph had spoken the busy tongues sank instantly to a hush i stood stilettoed by a score of eyes but sir walter had been keeping good watch for me and i at once delivered my great pot into his pink outstretched hands  my dear dear young lady he cried stooping plumply over me the pleasure you give me a little masterpiece and real old nankin alas my poor hypnos  but it is me me i cried if i could only tell you  a murmur of admiration rippled across the room in which i distinctly heard a quavering nasal voice exclaim touching touching  the wordsas if a pleasant sheep had bleatedcame i fancied from a rather less fashionable lady with a lorgnette who was sitting almost alone on the outskirts of the room and who i afterwards discovered was only a widowed sister of lady pollackes but i could spare her but one startled glance for at the same moment i was being presented to the younger daughter of lord b mrs monnerie sat amply reclining in an immense gilded chaira lady with a large and surprising countenance lady pollackes younger had misled my fancy far from being the slim fair sylphlike thing of my expectations mrs monnerie cannot have been many years the junior of my godmother miss fenne  her skin had fallen into the queerest folds and puckers her black swimming eye under a thick eyebrow gazed down her fine drooping nose at me with a dwelling expression at once indulgent engrossed and amused with a gracious sweep of her hand she drew aside her voluminous silk skirts so that i could at once install myself by her side in a small caneseated chair that had once i should fancy accommodated a baby pollacke and had been brought down from the nursery for this occasion  thus then i found myselfthe exquisitely selfconscious centre of attentionstriving to nibble a biscuit nurse my childsize handleless teacup and respond to her advances at one and the same time  lady pollacke hung like a cloud at sunset over us both her cheek flushed with the effort to be amused at every sentence which mrs monnerie uttered and to share it as far as possible with the rest of her guests  a little pale eh mused mrs monnerie brooding at me with her great eye she wants seaair seaairjust to tinge that roseleaf porcelain i must arrange it  i assured her that i was in the best of health  not at all she replied all young people boast of their health when i was your age every thought of illness was as black as a visitation of the devil thats the door where we must lay all such evils isnt it mr pellew  a lean tall birdlike figure the hair on his head still showing traces of auburn disengaged itself from a knot of charmed spectators  ah he said but i doubt now he continued with a little deprecating wave of his teacup at me if miss m can remember me when we first met we were precisely one week old precisely one week old  why like dr phelps mr pellew referred to me as we i had not time to consider for he was already confiding to mrs monnerie that he had never baptized an infant who more strenuously objected to holy water than had i i looked at his long fair eyelashes and the smileline on his cheek as he bent with a sort of jocular urbanity over her chair but could not recall his younger face though during my christening i must of course have gazed at him even more absorbedly  remember youill be bound she did cried mrs monnerie with enthusiasm or was it the bachelor thumb the mercy is you didnt drop her into the font can you swim my dear  i couldnt at a week i replied as archly as possible but i can swim my father taught me  but how wonderful broke our listeners into chorus  there we are then asserted mrs monnerie seabathing and are we a swimmer mr pellew  mr pellew seemed not to have caught her question he was assuring me that miss fenne had kept him well informedwell informed of all my doings he trusted i was comfortable with the excellent mrs bowater and hoped that some day i should be able to pay a visit to his rectory in devonshire mrs pellew he knew what he knew about mrs pellew however was never divulged for mrs monnerie swallowed him up  devonshire my dear mr pellew no indeed penthouse lanes redhot fields staring cows imagine it she would be dried up like a leaf what she wants is a mild but bracing seaair it shall be arranged and who is this mrs bowater  at this precise moment among the strange faces far above me i descried that of mr crimble modestly peering out of the background he coughed and in a voice i should scarcely have recognized as his informed mrs monnerie that my landlady was a most resan admirable woman he paused coughed again swept my soul with his glancei assure you mrs monnerie in view ofof all the circumstances one couldnt be in better hands indeed the house is on the crest of the hill well out of the town yet not a quarter of an hours walk from my mothers  hah remarked mrs monnerie with an inflection that i am sure need not have brought a warmth to my cheek or a duskier pallor to mr crimbles  you have perhaps heard the tragic story of wanderslore persisted mr crimble miss mserlodgings are immediately adjacent to the park  hah repeated mrs monnerie even more emphatically mrs bowater eh well i must see for myself and im told miss m she swept down at me that you have a beautiful gift for recitation she looked round patted her lap imperiously and cried come now whos to break the ice  in fact no doubt mrs monnerie was not so arbitrary a mistress of lady pollackes little ceremony as this account of it may suggest but that is how she impressed me at the time she the sun and i the leastbut i hope not the least gratefulof her obsequious planets lady pollacke at any rate set immediately to breaking the ice she prevailed upon a miss templemaine to sing and we all sat mute  i liked miss templemaines appearancebrown hair straight nose dark eyelashes pretty fringe beneath her peakbrimmed hat but i was a little distressed by her song which so far as i could gather was about two persons with more or less broken hearts who were compelled to part and said ah for a long time only physically distressed however for though i seemed to be shaken in its strains like a linnet in the wind its adieux were protracted enough to enable me to examine the rest of the company at my leisure their eyes i found were far more politely engaged the while in gazing composedly down at the carpet or up at the ceiling and when i did happen to intercept a gliding glance in my direction it was almost as if with a tiny explosion that it collided with mine and broke away  mrs monneries eyelids on the other hand with a faintly fluttering motion remained closed from the first bar to the lasta method of appreciation i experimented with for a moment but quickly abandoned while at the first clash of the keys sir walter had dexterously contrived to slide himself out of the room by the door at which he had unexpectedly entered it on my first visit such was the social situation when after murmurs of gratitude and applause miss templemaine took up her gloves and rose from the piano and mrs monnerie reopened herself to the outer world with the ejaculation thats right now my dear  the summons was to me my moment had come but i was prepared for it in my last ordeal i had broken down because i had chosen a poem that was a kind of secret thing in my mind so after receiving lady pollackes letter i had hunted about for a recitation as short but less personal one i mean whose sentiments i didnt mind and since mrs bullace had chosen two of mrs brownings pieces for her triumph on new years eve i argued that she knew the parish taste and that i could do no better of course too composure over what i was going to do was far more important than the composition  prepared for it i said just now but i meant it only in the sense that one prepares for a cold bath there was still the plunge i clasped my hands stood up ceiling and floor gently rocked a little there seemed to be facesfaces everywhere and every eye in them was fixed on me thus completely encompassed i could find no refuge from them for unfortunately my hypnos was completely obliterated from view by the lady with the lorgnette so i fixed my attention instead on the window where showed a blank break of clear fair blue sky between the rainclouds of afternoon a nervous cough from lady pollacke plunged me over and i announced my title the weakest thing by elizabeth barrett browning        which is the weakest thing of all        mine heart can ponder      the sun a little cloud can pall        with darkness yonder      the cloud a little wind can move        whereer it listeth      the wind a little leaf above        though sere resisteth       what time that yellow leaf was green        my days were gladder      now on its branch each summersheen        may find me sadder      ah me a leaf with sighs can wring        my lips asunder      then is my heart the weakest thing        itself can ponder       yet heart when sun and cloud are pined        and drop together      and at a blast which is not wind        the forests wither      thou from the darkening deathly curse        to glory breakest      the strongest of the universe        guarding the weakest   the applause in which miss templemaine generously joined was this time quite unconcealed and lady pollackes sisters last touching had hardly died away when mrs monnerie added her approbation  charming perfectly charming she murmured eyeing me like a turtledove but tell me my dear why that particular poem it seemed to have even less sense than usual  noo yees breathed lady pollacke and many heads nodded in discreet accord  doesnterperhaps mrs browning dwell rather assiduously on the tragic side of life mr crimble ventured to inquire  lady pollacke jerked her head either in the affirmative or in the negative and looked inquiringly at mrs monnerie who merely drooped her eyes a little closer towards me and smiled almost as if she and i were in a little plot together  what do you say miss m  well mrs monnerie i replied a little nervously for all eyes were turned on me i dont think i know myself what exactly the poem meansthe whos and whatsand what the blast was which was not wind but i thought it was a poem which every one would understand as much as possible of  to judge from the way she quivered in her chair though quite inaudibly mrs monnerie was extremely amused at this criticism  and that is why you chose it  well yes said i you see when one is listening to poetry not reading it to oneself i mean one hasnt time to pry about for all its bits of meaning but only just to get the generalgeneral  aroma suggested mrs monnerie  yesaroma  and the moral  the silence that hung over this little exchange was growing more and more dense luckless miss m she only plunged herself deeper into it by her reply that oh theres nothing very much in the moral mrs monnerie thats quite ordinary at least i read about that in prose why before i was seven  touch began that further voice but was silenced by a testy lift of mrs monneries eyelid indeed she said and couldnt you wouldnt you now give me the prose version thats more my mark  it was in a little nursery lessonbook of mine called the observing eye letters about snails and coral insects and spiders and things i paused a book rather you know for sundays but mymy family and i  oh but do cried lady pollacke in a voice i should hardly have recognized i adore snails  once more i was cornered so i steeled myself anew and stumbled through the brief passage in the squat blue book it tells how        the history of each one of the animals we have now considered      teaches us that our kind god watches over the wants and the      pleasures of the meanest of his creatures we see that he gives to      them not only the sagacity and the instruments which they need for      catching their food but that he also provides them with some means      of defending themselves we learn by their history that the      gracious eye watches under the mighty waters as well as over the      earth and that no creature can stop doing his will without his eye      seeing it     chapter twentyfive   once more i sat down but this time in the midst of what seemed to me a rather unpleasant silence as if the room had grown colder a silence which was broken only by the distant whistlings of a thrush at one and the same moment both mr pellew and mr crimble returned to teacups which i should have supposed must have by this time been empty and lady pollackes widowed sister folded up her lorgnette  my dear miss m said mrs monnerie dryly with an almost wicked ray of amusement in her deepset eyes wherever the top of beechwood hill may be and whatever supplies of food may be caught on its crest there is no doubt that you have been provided with the means of defending yourself but tell me now what do you think perhaps mr pellews little instruments are or better stillmine am i a mollusc with a hard shell or a scorpion with a sting  lady pollacke rose to her feet and stood looking down on me like a hen though not exactly a motherly one but this was a serious question over which i must not be flustered so i took my time i folded my hands and fixed a long long look on mrs monnerie even after all these years i confess it moves me to recall it  of course really and truly i said at last as deferentially as i could i havent known you long enough to say but i should think mrs monnerie you always knew the truth  i was glad i had not been too impetuous my reply evidently pleased her she chuckled all over  ah she said reposefully the truth and that is why i suppose like sleeping beauty i am so thickly hedged in with the thorns and briers of affection well well theres one little truth well share alone you and i she raised herself in her chair and stooped her great face close to my ear we must know more of one another my dear she whispered i have taken a great fancy to you we must meet again she hoisted herself up sir walter pollacke had hastened in and stood smiling with arm hooked and genial beaming countenance in front of her mr crimble had already vanished mr pellew was talking earnestly with lady pollacke conversation broke out like a stormshower on every side for a while i was extraordinarily alone  into this derelict moment a faircheeked breathless lady descended and surreptitiously thrusting a crimson padded birthday book and a miniature pencil into my lap entreated my autographjust your signature you knowfor my small daughter how she would have loved to be here  this lady cannot have been many years older than i and one of those instantaneous fleeting affections sprang up in me as i looked up at her for the first and only time and seemed to see that small daughter smiling at me out of her face  alas such is vanity i turned over the leaves to august 30th and found printed there for motto a passage from shakespeare        he that has had a little tiny wit      with hey ho the wind and the rain      must make content with his fortunes fit      for the rain it raineth every day   the 29th was little less depressing from samuel taylor coleridge        he prayeth best who loveth best      all creatures great and small   this would never do i bent double over the volume turned back hastily three or four leaves and scrawled in my name under august 25th on a leaf that bore the quotation        fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden      that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature      possess it merely that it should come to this   and beneath the quotation the signature of josephine mildred spratte  thank you thank you she will be overjoyed blushed the fairhaired lady a sudden hunger for solitude seized upon me i rose hastily conscious for the first time of a headache caused no doubt by the expensive and fumey perfumes in the air threading my way between the trains and flounces and trouserlegs around me at last my adieux were over i was in the porchin the carriage the breezes of heaven were on my cheek my blessed parlourmaid was once more installed beside me yet even now the pollacke faces were still flocking in my mind the outside world was very sluggishly welling in looking up so long had stiffened my neck i fixed my eyes on the crested back buttons of lady pollackes stifflooking coachman and committed myself to my thoughts  it was to a miss m with one of her own handkerchiefs laid over her brows and sprinkled with vinegar and lavender water that mrs bowater brought in supper that evening we had one of our broken talks together none the less but she persisted in desultory accounts of fannys ailments in her infancy and i had to drag in brunswick house by myself at which she poked the fire and was mum it was unamiable of her i longed to share my little difficulties and triumphs surely she was showing rather too much of that discrimination which lady pollacke had recommended  she snorted at mr pellew she snorted at my friendly parlourmaid and even at mrs monnerie even when i repeated for her ear alone my nursery passage from the observing eye her only comment was that to judge from some fine folk she knew of there was no doubt at all that god watched closely over the pleasures of the meanest of his creatures but as for their doing his will she hadnt much noticed it  to my sigh of regret that fanny had not been at home to accompany me she retorted with yet another onslaught on the fire and the apophthegm that the world would be a far better place if people kept themselves to themselves  but mrs bowater i argued fretfully if i did that i should justdistil as you might say quite away besides fanny would have been far far thethe gracefullest person there mrs monnerie would have taken a fancy to her now if you like  mrs bowater drew in her lips and rubbed her nose god forbid she said  but it was her indifference to the impression that i myself had made on mrs monnerie that nettled me the most why then who is lord b i inquired impatiently at last pushing back the bandage that had fallen over my eyes  from what ive heard of lord b said mrs bowater shortly he was a gentleman of whom the less heard ofs the better  but surely i protested that isnt mrs monneries fault any more than fannys being so lovelyi mean than i being a midget was my fathers fault anyhow i hurried on mrs monnerie says i look pale and must go to the sea  mrs bowater was still kneeling by the fire just as fanny used to kneel and like fanny when one most expected an answer she remained silent though unlike fanny it seemed to be not because she was dreaming of something else how shall i express itthere fell a kind of loneliness between us the severe face made no sign  would youwould you miss me some silly self within piped out pathetically  why for the matter of that was her sardonic reply theres not very much of you to miss  i rose from my bed flung down the bandage and ran down my little staircase oh mrs bowater i said burying my face in her camphory skirts be kind to me be kind to me ive nobody but you  the magnanimous creature stroked my vinegarsodden hair with the tips of her horny fingers why there miss i meant no harm isnt all the gentry and nobility just gaping to snatch you up you wont want your old mrs bowater very long whats more you mustnt get carried away by yourself you never know where that journey ends if sea it is sea it must be though lord preserve us the words no favourite of mine  but suppose suppose mrs bowater i cried starting up and smiling enrapturedly into her face suppose we could go together  that said she with a look of astonishing benignity would be just what i was being led to suppose was the heighth of the impossible  at which of course we at once began discussing ways and means but delicious though this prospect seemed i determined that nothing should persuade me to go unless all hope of fannys coming home proved vain naturally from fanny memory darted to wanderslore i laughed up at my landlady holding her finger and suggested demurely that we should go off together on the morrow to see if my stranger were true to his word  we have kept him a very long time and if as you seem to think mrs monnerie isnt such a wonderful lady you may decide that after all he is a gentleman  she enjoyed my little joke was pleased that i had been won over but refused to accept my reasoning though the topic itself was after her heart  the point is miss not whether your last conquest is a wonderful lady or a grand lady or even a perfect lady for the matter of that but well a lady its thats the kind in my experience that comes nearest to being as uncommon a sort as any sort of a good woman  this was a wholly unexpected vista for me and i peered down its smooth green aristocratic sward with some little awe  as for the young fellow who made himself so free in his manners she went on placidly so that i had to scamper back to pick her up again i have no doubt seeing will be believing  but what is the story of wanderslore i pressed her none too honestly  the storyand this time mrs bowater poured it out quite freelywas precisely what i had been told already but with the addition that the young woman who had hanged herself in one of its attics had done so for jealousy  jealousy but of whom i inquired  her husbands not her own driven wild by his  you really mean i persisted that she couldnt endure to live any longer because her husband loved her so much that he couldnt bear anybody else to love her too  in some such measure replied mrs bowater though i dont say he didnt help the other way round but she was a wild scattering creature it was just her way the less she cared the more they flocked she couldnt collect herself and say here i am who are you so to speak ah miss its a sickly and dangerous thing to be too much admired  but you said scattering was she mad a little  no peculiar perhaps with her sidelong startled look a lovelier ive never seen  youve seen her  thirty years ago perhaps alive and dead  oh mrs bowater poor thing poor thing  that you may well say for lovely in the latter finding she was not  my eyes were fixed on the fire but the picture conjured up was dark even amidst the redhot coals and he did he die too at least his jealousy was broken away  and im not so sure of that said mrs bowater its like the men to go on wanting even when it comes to scrabbling at a grave and theres a trashy sort of creature though wellsetup enough from the outside that a spark will put in a blaze ive no doubt he was that kind  i thought of my own sparks but questioned on then theres nothing else butbut her ghost there now  lor ghosts miss its an hour i see when beds the proper place for you and me i look to be scared by that kind of gentry when they come true  you dont believe then in destroyers mrs bowater  miss its those queer books you are reading was the evasive reply destroyers why wasnt it cruel enough to drive that poor featherbrained creature into a noose  candle and i and drowsing cinders kept company until st peters bell had told only the sleepless that midnight was over the world it seemed to my young mind that there was not a day scarcely an hour i lived but that life was unfolding itself in ever new and ravishing disguises i had not begun to be in the least tired or afraid of it smallest of bubbles i might be tossing on the great waters but i reflected the universe what need of courage when no danger was apparent surely one need not mind being different if that difference added to ones share in the wonderful banquet even wanderslores story was only of what happened when the tangle was so harshly knotted that no mortal fingers could unravel it and though my own private existence now had mrs monnerieand all that she might do and mean and beto cope with as well as my stranger who was yet another queer story and as yet mine alone these complications were enticing one must just keep control of them that was all at which i thought a little unsteadily of fannys pin and remembered that that pin was helping to keep her and mr crimble from being torn apart  he had seemed so peering a guest at brunswick house mrs monnerie hadnt so much as glanced at him when he had commented on mrs brownings poems there seemed to be a shadow over whatever he did it was as though there could be a sadness in the very coursing of ones blood how thankful i felt that mine hadnt been a really flattering reply to mrs monneries question she was extremely arrogant even for a younger daughter of a lord on the other hand though of course the sheer novelty of me had had something to do with it she had certainly singled me out afterwards to know what i thought and in thoughts there is no particular size only effusivenessno piercingness i smiled to myself at the word pitied my godmother for living so sequestered a life and wondered how and why it was that my father and mother had so obstinately shut me away from the world if only fanny was coming homewhat a difference she would find in her fretful midge and with that i discovered that my feet were cold and that my headache had ached itself away     chapter twentysix   there had been no need to reserve the small hours for these ruminations the next few days were wet and windy every glance at the streaming panes cast my mind into a sort of vacancy the wind trumpeted smoke into the room i could fix my mind on nothing then the weather faired there came a red sky at night and spica flashing secrets to me across the darkness and that suppertime i referred as casually as possible to mr anon  i suppose one must keep ones promises mrs bowater even to a stranger would halfpast six be too early to keep mine do you think would it look tooforward of course he may have forgotten all about me by this time  mrs bowater eyed me like an owl as i bent my cheeks over my bowl of bread and milk and proceeded to preach me yet another little sermon on the ways of the world nevertheless the next morning saw us setting out together in the crisp sparkling air to my tryst with the tacit understanding that she accompanied me rather in the cause of propriety than romance  owing i fancy to a bunion she was so leisurely a walker that it was i who must set my pace to hers but the day promised to be warm and we could take our ease as we wandered on among the early flowers and bright green grass and under the beeches a mildness lightened into her face over her long features lay a vacant yet happy smile of which she seemed to be unaware this set me off thinking in the old old fashion comparing my lot with that of ordinary human beings how fortunate i was if only she could have seen the lowlier plants as i couldscarcely looking down on any and of the same stature as some among the taller of them so that the air around me was dyed and illumined with their clear colours and burthened with their breath  the least and humblest of themnot merely crispedged lichen speckleseed whitlowgrass and hyssop in the wallare so close to earth the wonder indeed is that commonsized people ever see them at all they must at any rate i thought commit themselves to their stomachs or go down on their knees to see them properly so on we went mrs bowater and i she pursuing her private musings and i mine  i smiled to myself at remembrance of dr phelps and his blushes after all if humanity should dwindle into a delicate littleness it would make a good deal more difference than he had supposed what a destruction would ensue among all the lesser creatures of the earth the squirrels moles voles hedgehogs and the birds not to mention the bees and hornets they would be the enemies thenthe traps and poisons and the nets no more billowy cornfields a good yard high no more fine ninefoot hedges flinging their blossoms into the air and all the longlegged doubled bloated garden flowers gone clean out of favour it would be a little world would it be a happier the dwarfed mrs bowaters dr phelpses miss bullaces lady pollackes  but there was little chance of such an eventualityat least in my lifetime it was far likelier that the miss ms of the world would continue to be a byplay yet as i glanced up at my companion and called to mind other such lapland giants of mine i can truthfully avouch that i did not much envy their extra inches so much more thinskinned surface to be kept warm and unscratched the cumbersome bones the curious distance from foot and fingertip to brain too and those quarts and quarts of blood i shuddered it was little short of a miracle that they escaped continual injury and what an extended body in which to die  on the other hand what real loss was minewith so much to my advantage these great spreading beechtrees were no less shady and companionable to me than to them nor thought i could moon or sun or star or ocean or mountain be any the less silvery hot lustrous and remote forlorn in beauty or vast in strangeness one way or the other than they are to ordinary people could there be any doubt at all too that men had always coveted to make much finer and more delicate things than their clumsiness allowed  what fantastic creatures they werewith their vast mansions pyramids palaces scores of sizes too large either for carcass or mind their satan a monster on whose wrist the vulture of the andes could perch like an aphis on my thumb yet their death but skeletonhigh and their saviour of such a stature that wellnigh without stooping he could have laid his fingers on my head  times sands had been trickling fast while i thought these small thoughts that bright spring daybreak so though we had loitered on our way it seemed we had reached our destination on the wings of the morning alas mrs bowaters smile can have been only skindeep for when lifting my eyes from the ground i stopped all of a sudden spread out my hands and cried in triumph there mrs bowater she hardly shared my rapture  she disapproved of the vast blank barn of a place with its blackshot windows and cold chimneys the waste and ruination of the garden displeased her so much that i grew a little ashamed of my barbarism  its all going to wrack and ruin she exclaimed snorting at my stone summerhouse no less emphatically than she had snorted at mrs monnerie not a walkable walk nor the trace of a border and was there ever such a migglemaggle of weeds a fine house in its prime miss but now money melting away like butter in the sun  but said i standing before her in the lovely light amid the dwelling dewdrops really and truly mrs bowater it is only going back to its own again what you call a migglemaggle is what these things were made to be they are growing up now by themselves and if you could look as close as i can youd see they breathe only what each can spare they are just racing along to live as wildly as they possibly can its the tameness i expostulated flinging back my hood that would be shocking to me  mrs bowater looked down at me listening to this highpiped recitative with an unusual inquisitiveness  well thats as it may be she retorted but what im asking is wheres the young fellow he dont seem to be as punctual as they were when i was a girl  my own eyes had long been busy but as yet in vain  i did not come particularly to see him was my airy reply besides we said no timeany fine day shall we sit down  with a secretive smile mrs bowater spread a square of waterproof sheeting over a flat stone that had fallen out of the coping of the house unfolded a newspaper over the grass and we began our breakfast neither of us betrayed much appetite for it she i fancy having already fortified herself out of her brown teapot before leaving the house and i because of the odour of indiarubber and newspaperan odour presently intensified by the moisture and the sun paying no heed to my fastidious nibblings she munched on reflectively while i grew more and more ill at ease first because the young fellow was almost visibly sinking in my old friends esteem and next because her clothbooted foot lay within a few inches of the stone beneath which was hidden fannys letter  itll do you good the sea she remarked presently after sweeping yet one more comprehensive glance around her and we can only hope mrs monnerie will be as good as her word a spot like thistrespassing or notis good for neither man nor beast and when you are young the more human company you get with proper supervising the better  were you happy as a girl mrs bowater i inquired after a pause  our voices went up and up into the still mild air happy enoughfor my own good she said neatly screwing up her remaining biscuits in their paper bag in my days children were brought up taught to make themselves useful i would as soon have lifted a hand against my mother as answer her back  you mean sheshe whipped you  if need be my landlady replied complacently folding her threadgloved hands on her lap and contemplating the shiny toecaps of her boots she had large hands my mother and plenty of temper kept well under control whats more if life isnt a continual punishment for the stoopidities and wickedness of others not to mention ourselves then it must be even a darker story than was ever told me  and was mrs bowater mr bowater youryour first i looked steadily at a flower at my foot in case she might be affected at so intimate a question and not wish me to see her face  if mr bowater was not the first was her easy response he may well live to boast of being the last which is neither here nor there for we may be sure hes enjoying attentive nursing broken bones are soon mended its when things are disjointed from the root that the wrench comes  the stormfelled bole lay there beside us as if for picture to her parable i began to think rather more earnestly than i had intended to that morning in my present state of conscience it was never an easy matter to decide whether mrs bowaters comments on life referred openly to things in general or covertly to me in particular how fortunate that the scent of fannys notepaper was not potent enough to escape from its tomb and whether or not speech seemed less dangerous than silence  it seems to me mrs bowater i began rather hastily at least to judge from my own father and mother that a man depends very much on a woman men dont seem to grow up in the same way though i suppose they are practical enough as men  if it were one female was the reply thered be less to be found fault with that poor young creature over there took her life for no better reason even though the reason was turned inside out as you may say  i met the frightful louring stare of the house what was her name i whisperedbut into nothing for bolt upright as she was mrs bowater had shut her eyes as if in preparation for a nap   a threadlike tangle of song netted the air we were indeed trespassers i darted my glance this way and that in and out of the pale green whispering shadows in this wild haunt then realizing by some faint stir in my mind that the stiff still shutaway figure beside me was only feigning to be asleep i opened the rainwarped covers of my sense and sensibility and began plotting how to be rid of her for a while so that my solitude might summon my stranger and i might recover fannys letter  then once more i knew raising my eyes i looked straight across at him scowling there beneath his stunted thorn in a drift of flowers like fools parsley he was making signs too with his hands i watched him pensively in secret amusement then swifter than daphne into her laurel instantaneously he vanished and i became aware that its black eyes were staring out from the long face of the motionless figure beside me as might an owls into an aviary  did you hear a bird mrs bowater i inquired innocently  when i was a girl said the mouth sparrowhawks were a common sight but i never heard one sing  but isnt a sparrowhawk quite a large bird  we must judge said mrs bowater not by the size but the kind elseways miss your old friend might have been found sleeping as they say at her box she pretended to yawn gathered her legs under her and rose up and up ill be taking a little walk round and you shall tell your young acquaintance that i mean him no harm but that i mean you the reverse and if show himself he wont well here i sit till the day of judgment  an angry speech curled the tip of my tongue but the simplefaced flowers were slowly making obeisance to mrs bowaters black dragging skirts and when she was nearly out of sight i sallied out to confront my stranger  his face was black with rage and contempt that contaminating scarecrow whos she was his greeting the days i have waited  the resentment that had simmered up in me on his behalf now boiled over against him i looked at him in silence  that contaminating scarecrow as you are pleased to call her is the best friend i have in the world i need no other  and i he said harshly have no friend in this world and need you  then said i you have lost your opportunity do you suppose i am a childto be insulted and domineered over only because i am alone possibly and my lips so trembled that i could hardly frame the words it is your face i shall see when i think of those windows  i was speaking wiselier than i knew he turned sharply and by a play of light it seemed that at one of them there stood looking down on us out of the distance a shape that so had watched for ever leering darkly out of the void and there awoke in me the sense of this strangers extremity of solitude of his unhappy disguise of his animallike patience  why i said mrs bowater you might far rather be thanking her forfor  curses on her he choked turning away there was everything to tell you  what everything  call her back now he muttered furiously  that i said smoothly is easily done but forgive me i dont know your name  his eyes wandered over the turf beneath me mounted slowly up my foot to my head and looked into mine in their intense regard i seemed to be but a bubble floating away into the air i shivered and turned my back on him without waiting for an answer he followed me as quietly as a sheep  mrs bowater had already come sauntering back to our breakfast table and with gaze impassively fixed on the horizon pretended not to be aware of our approach  i smiled back at my companion as we drew near this mrs bowater said i is mr anon would you please present him to miss thomasina of bedlam  for a moment or two they stood facing one another just as i have seen two insects standmotionless regardful exchanging each others presences then after one lightning snap at him from her eye she rose to my bait like a fish a pleasant morning sir she remarked affably though in her bible voice my young lady and i were enjoying the spring air  back to memory comes the darkness of a theatre and mrs monnerie breathing and sighing beside me and there on the limelit green of the stage lolls assheaded bottom the weaver cracking jokes with the fairies  my oberon addressed mrs bowater as urbanely as st george must have addressed the dragonor any other customary monster  he seemed to pass muster none the less for she rose patted her sheet pushed forward her bonnet on to her rounded temples and bade him a composed goodmorning she would be awaiting me she announced in an hours time under my beech tree  i think perhaps two mrs bowater i said firmly  she gave me a lookall our long slow evening firelit talks together seemed to be swimming in its smile and withdrew  the air eddied into quiet again the stretchedout blue of the sky was as bland and solitary as if a seraph sat dreaming on its eastern outskirts mr anon and i seated ourselves three or four feet apart and i watched the sidelong face so delicately carved against the green yet sunken in so sullen a stare  standing up on his feet against the background of mrs bowaters inkblack flounces with his rather humped shoulders and straight hair he had looked an eccentric and even to my view a stunted figure now the whole scene around us seemed to be sorting itself into a different proportion before my eyes he it was who was become the unit of space the yardstick of the universe the flowers their roots glintily netted with spiderwebs nodded serenely over his long hands a peacock butterfly with folded colours sipped of the sunshine on a tuft nearly at evens with his cheek the very birds sang to his size and every rift between the woodlands awaited the cuckoo only his clothes were grotesque but less so than in my parlour mr crimbles skirts or even lady pollackes treacherous bonnet  i folded my white silk gloves into a ball a wren began tweeting in a bush near by i am going away soon i said to the sea  the wren glided away out of sight amongst its thorns i knew by his sudden stillness that this had been unwelcome news that will be very pleasant for me wont it i said  the sea he returned coldly with averted head well i am bound still further  the reply fretted me i wanted bare facts just then why are you so angry what is your name and where do you live it was my turn to ask questions and i popped them out as if from a little by little  and then with his queer croaking yet captivating voice he broke into a long low monologue he gave me his nameand mr anon describes him no worse he waved his hand vaguely in the direction of the house he lived in but instead of apologizing for his illtemper he accused me of deceiving and humiliating him of being so i gathered a toy of my landladys of betraying and soiling myself  why all this wild stuff only seemed to flatter me i cannot say i listened and laughed pressing flat with both hands the sorry covers of my book and laughed also low in my heart  oh contempt he cried i am used to that  the words curdled on his tongue as he expressed his loathing of poor mrs bowater and her kindmere humanitythat ate and drank in musty houses stuck up out of the happy earth like warts on the skin that battened on meat stalked its puddled streets and vile stifling towns spread its rank odours on the air increased and multiplied monstrous in shape automatic blinded by habit abandoned by instinct monkeylike degraded  what an unjust tirade he barked it all out at me as if the blame were mine as if i had nibbled the apple i turned my face away smiling but listening did i realize he asked me what a divine fortune it was to be so little and in this to be all on and on he raved i breathed air a dewdrop could chill i was as near lovely naught made visible as the passing of a flower the mere mattering of a dream and when i died my body would be but a perishing flake of manna and my bones  yes a wrens picking i rudely interrupted and what of my soul please why you talk likelike a poet besides you tell me nothing new i was thinking all that and more on my way here with my landlady what has size to do with it why when i thought of my mother after she was dead and peered down in the place of my imagination into her grave i saw her spirityoung younger than i and bodiless and infinitely more beautiful even than she had been in my dreams floating up out of it free sweet and happy like a flamethough shadowy besides i dont see how you can help pitying men and women they seem to fly to one another for company and half their comfort is in their numbers  never in all my life had i put my thoughts into words like this and hea stranger  there fell a silence between us the natural quietude of the garden was softly settling down and down like infinitesimal grains of sand in a pool of water it had forgotten that humans were harbouring in its solitude and still he maintained that his words were not untrue that he knew mankind better than i that to fall into their ways and follow their opinions and strivings was to deafen my ears and seal up my eyes and lose my very self the self everywhere he said  and he told me whether in time or space i know not of a country whose people were of my stature and slenderness this was a land he said walled in by enormous icecapped mountains couching the furnace of the rising sun and yet set at the oceans edge its sanddunes ring like dulcimers in the heat its valleys of swift rivers were of a green so pale and vivid and so flowerencrusted that an englisheven a kentishspring is but a coarse and rustic prettiness by comparison vine and orange and trees of outlandish names gave their fruits there yet there also willows swept the winds and palms spiked the blue with their fans and the cactus flourished with the tamarisk geese of dark green and snow were on its inland waters and a bird clocked the hours of the night and the conformation of its stars would be strange to my eyes and such was the lowliness and simplicity of this peoples habitations that the most powerful seaglass turned upon and searching their secret haunts from a ship becalmed on the ocean would spy out nothingnothing there only world wilderness of snowdazzling mountaintop and green valley ravine and condor and what might just be natures small ingenuitiesmounds and traceries yet within all was quiet loveliness feet light as goldfinches silks fine as gossamer voices as of a watery beading of silence and their life being all happiness they have no name for their god and it seemsaccording to mr anons account of itthat such was the ancient history of the world that man was so once but had swollen to his present shape of which he had lost the true spring and mastery and had sunk deeper and deeper into a kind of oblivion of the mind suffocating his past and now all but insane with pride in his own monstrosities  all this my new friend and yet not so very new it seemedall this he poured out to me in the garden though i can only faintly recall his actual words as if like moses i had smitten the rock and i listened weariedly with little hope of understanding him and with the suspicion that it was nothing but a tom o bedlams dream he was recounting yet as if in disproof of my own incredulity there sat i and over the trees yonder stood mrs bowaters ugly little brick house and beyond that the stony tapering spire of st peters the high street and i looked at him without any affection in my thoughts and wished fretfully to be gone what use to be lulled with fantastic pictures of paradise when i might have died of fear and hatred on mrs stockss doorstep when everything i said was touching touching  well i mockingly interposed at last the farthing dips guttering and what if its all true and there is such a place what then how am i going to get there pray would you like to mummy me and shut me up in a box and carry me there as they used to in basman years and years ago my father told me of the pygmy men and horsesthe same size as yours i supposewho lived in caves on the banks of the nile but i doubt if i believed in them much even then i am not so ignorant as all that  the life died out of his face just as because of a cloud carried up into the sky the sunlight at that moment fled from wanderslore he coughed leaning on his hands and looked in a scared empty hunted fashion to right and left only that you might stay he scarcely whispered   i love you  instinctively i drew away lips dry and heart numbly heavily beating an influence more secret than the shadow of a cloud had suddenly chilled and darkened the garden and robbed it of its beauty i shrank into myself cold and awkward and did not dare even to glance at my companion  a fine thing was all i found to reply for a toy as you call me i dont know what you mean  miserable enough that memory is when i think of what came after for now my only dread was that he might really be out of his wits and might make my beloved solitary garden for ever hateful to me i drew close my cape and lifted my book  there is a private letter of mine hidden under that stone i said coldly will you please be so good as to fetch it out for me and you are never never to say that again  the poor thing looked so desperately ill and forsaken with his humped shouldersand that fine fantastic story still ringing in my earsthat a kind of sadness came over me and i hid my face in my hands  the letter is not there said his voice  i drew my fingers from my face and glared at him from between them then scrambled to my feet out swam the sun again drenching all around us with its light and heat  next time i come i shrilled at him the letter will be there the thief will have put it back again oh how unhappy you have made me     chapter twentyseven   i stumbled off feeling smaller and smaller as i went more and more ridiculous and insignificant as indeed i must have appeared for distance can hardly lend enchantment to any view of me not one single look did i cast behind but now that my feelings began to quiet down i began also to think and a pretty muddle of mind it was what had enraged and embittered me so if only i had remained calm was it that my pride my vanity had in some vague fashion been a punishment of him for fannys unkindness to me  but he stole he stole my letter i said aloud stamping my foot on a budding violet andthere was mrs bowater evidently she had been watching my approach and now smiled benignly  why you are quite out of breath miss and your cheeks i hope you havent been having words a betterspoken young fellow than i had fancied and im sure i ask his pardon for the gentleman  ach i swept up at my beechtree now cautiously unsheathing its first green buds in the lower branches i think he must be light in his head  and that often comes replied mrs bowater with undisguised bonhomie from being heavy at the heart why miss he may be a young nobleman in disguise theres unlikelier things even than that to judge from that trash of fannys while as for fish in the seaits sometimes wise to be contented with what we can catch  who had been talking to me about fish in the seaquite lately i thought contemptuously of pollie and the dream book i am sorry i replied nose in air but i cannot follow the allusion  the charge of vulgarity was the very last i think which mrs bowater would have lifted a finger to refute my cheeks flamed hotter to know that she was quietly smiling up there we walked on in silence  that night i could not sleep i was afraid life was blackening my mind like the mould of a graveyard i could think of nothing but one face one voicethat scorn and longing thought and fantasy what if he did love me a little i might at least have been kind to him had i so many friends that i could afford to be harsh and ungrateful how dreadfully ill he had looked when i scoffed at him and now what might not have happened to him i seemed lost to myself no wonder fanny my body grew cold at a thought the palms of my hands began to ache  halfstifled i leapt out of bed and without the least notion of what i was doing hastily dressed myself and fled out into the night i must find him talk to him plead with him before it was too late and in the trickling starlight pressed against my own gatepostthere he was  oh i whispered at him in a fever of relief and shame and apprehensiveness what are you doing here you must go away at once at once i forgive you yes yes i forgive you butat once keep the letter for me till i come again his hand was wet with the dew oh and never say it again please please if you care for me the least bit in the world never never say what you did again i poured out the heedless words in the sweetscented quiet of midnight nownow go i entreated and indeed indeed i am your friend  the dark eyes shone quietly close to mine he sighed he lifted my fingers and put them to my breast again he whispered unintelligible words between us and was gone no more stars for me that night i slept sound until long after dawn   softly as thistledown the days floated into eternity yet they were days of expectation and action april was her fickle self not so mrs monnerie her letter to mrs bowater must have been a marvel of tact apartments had been engaged for us at a little wateringplace in dorsetshire called lyme regis mrs bowater and i were to spend at least a fortnight there alone together and after our return mrs monnerie herself was to pay me a visit and see with her own eyes if her prescription had been successful after that perhaps if i were so inclined and my landlady agreed with mr pellew that it would be good for me i might spend a week or two with her in london what a twist of the kaleidoscope i had sown never a pinch of seed yet here was everything laughing and blossoming around me like the wilderness in isaiah  indeed my own lookingglass told me how wan and languishing a miss m was pining for change of scene and air she rejoiced that fanny was enjoying herself rejoiced that she was going to enjoy herself too i searched mrs bowaters library for views of the sea but without much reward so i read over mr bowaters captain mauryon the winds and monsoons and tiderips and hurricanes freshened up my robinson crusoe and dreamed of the angels with the vials in the midst of my packing and i spread it out for sheer amusements sake mr crimble called again he looked nervous gloomy and holloweyed  i was fast becoming a mistress in affairs of the sensibilities yet when kneeling over my open trunk i heard him in the porch i mimicked fannys dash and wished to goodness he had postponed his visit until only echo could have answered his knock it fretted me to be bothered with him and now what would i not give to be able to say i had done my best and utmost to help him when he wanted it here is a riddle i can find no answer to however long i live how is it that our eyes cannot foresee our very hearts cannot forefeel the future and how should we act if that future were plain before us yet even then what could i have said to him to comfort him really and truly i had no candle with which to see into that dark mind  in actual fact my task was difficult and delicate enough in spite of her vow not to write again yet another letter had meanwhile come from fanny if mr crimbles had afforded a ray of hope this had shut it clean away it was full of temporizings wheedlings evasionsand brimming over with fanny  it suggested too that mrs bowater must have misread the name of her holiday place the halflegible printing of the postmark on the envelopefortunately i had intercepted the postmandid not even begin with an m and no address was given within i was to tell mr crimble that fanny was overtired and depressed by the terms work that she simply couldnt set her weary mind to anything and as for decisions        he seems to think only of himself you couldnt believe      midgetina what nonsense the man talks he cant see that all      poor fannys future is at stake body and soul tell him if he      wants her to smile he must sit in patience on a pedestal and      smile too one simply cant trust the poor creature with cold      sober facts his mother nowwhy i could read it in your own      polite little description of her at your grand receptionshe      smiles and smiles so did the cheshire cat       but oh dear fanny time and your own true self god helping      would win her over so writes h c thats candid enough if you      look into it but it isnt sense once hostile old ladies are      not won over they dont care much for mind in the young anyhow      one look at me was enough for herand it was followed by a sharp      little peer at poor harold she guessed so you see my dear even      for youthful things like you and me time gathers roses a jolly      sight faster than we can and it would have to be the fait      accompli before a word is breathed to her that is if i could      take a deep breath and say yes       but i cant i ask you can you see fanny bowater a right      reverendissima no nor can i and not even gaiters or an apron      here and now would settle the question offhand why i confide all      this in you why for that matter it has all been confided in      me i know not you want nothing and if you did you wouldnt      want it long now would you perhaps that is the secret but fanny      wants a good deal she cannot even guess how much so while miss      stebbings and beechwood hill for ever and ever would be hell before      purgatory h c and st peters would be merely the same thing      with the fires out and i am quite sure that given a chance      heaven is our home       oh midgetina i listen to all this mumbling my heart like a dog      a bone what the devil has it got to do with me i ask myself      who set the infernal trap if only i could stop thinking and      mocking and find some onenot to love me between ourselves      there are far too many of them already but capable of making me      love him they say a woman cant be driven i disagree she can      be drivenmad and apart from that though twenty men only succeed      in giving me hydrophobia one could persuade me to drink if only      his name was mr right as mother succinctly puts it       but first and last i am having a real if not a particularly      sagacious holiday and can take care of myself and next and last      play i beseech you the tiny good samaritan between me and      poor plodding blinded h ceven if he does eventually have to      go on to jericho       and i shall ever remain your most affecf   how all this baffled me i tried but dismally failed to pour a trickle of wine and oil into mr crimbles wounded heart for his sake and for mine not for fannys for i knew in myself that his jericho was already within view  i dont understand her i dont understand her he kept repeating crushing his soft hat in his small square hands i cannot reach her i am not in touch with her  out of the fount of my womanly wisdom i reminded him how young she was how clever and how much flattered  you know then there areothers he gulped darkly meeting me  that surely is what makes her so precious i falsely insinuated  he gazed at me his eyes like an immense empty shopwindow that thought puts i cant and he twisted his head on his shoulders as if shadows were around him i cant bear to think of her andwithothers it unbalances me but how can you understand a sealed book last night i sat at my window it was raining i know not the hour and spring he clutched at his knees stooping forward i repudiated myself thrust myself out oh believe me we are not alone and there and then i resolved to lay the whole matter beforehis glance groped towards the doorbefore in fact her mother she is a woman of sagacity of proper feeling in her station though how she came to be the mother of but thats neither here nor there we mustnt probe probably she thinksbut what use to consider it one word to herand fanny would be lost to me for ever for a moment it seemed his eyes closed on me how can i bring myself to speak of it a remote voice murmured from beneath them  i looked at the figure seated there in its long black coat and far away in my mind whistled an ecstatic birdthe sea the sea you are going awayout out of all this  so too was mr crimble if only i had known it it was my weak and cowardly acquiescence in fannys deceits that was speeding him on his dreadful journey none the less a wretched heartless impatience fretted me at being thus helplessly hemmed in by my fellow creatures how clumsily they groped on why couldnt they be happy in just living free from the clouds and trammels of each other and of themselves the selfish helplessness of it all it was indeed as though the strange fires which fanny had burnt me inwhich any sudden thought of her could still fan into a flickering blazehad utterly died down whether or not i was hardened a poor little earthenware pot fresh from the furnace and with what elixir was it brimmed  i rose from my chair walked away from my visitor and peered through my muslin curtains at the green and shine and blue a nursemaid was lagging along with a sleeping infantits mild face to the skyin a perambulator a faint drift of dandelions showed in the stretching meadow kents blue hems lay calm my thoughts drew far away  mr crimble i cried in a low voice is she worth all our care for her  ourour he expostulated  mine then when i gave her just to be friends becausebecause i loved her a little ivory box nothing of any value of course but which i have loved and treasured since childhood she left it without a thought its in my wardrobe drawershall i show it to you i say it was nothing in itself but what i mean is that she just makes use of me and with far less generosity thanthan other people do her eyes her voice when she moves her hand turns her head looks backoh i know but and i turned on him in the light does it mean anything let us just help her all we can andkeep away  it was a treachery past all forgiveness i see that now if only i had said love on love on ask nothing but i did not say it a contempt of all this slow folly was in my brain that afternoon why couldnt the black cowering creature take himself off what concern of mine was his sick sheepish look what particle of a fig did he care for me had he lifted a little finger when i myself bitterly needed it i seemed to be struggling in a net of hatred  he raised himself in his chair his spectacles still fixed on me as if some foul insect had erected its blunt head at him  then you are against her too he uttered under his breath i might have known it i might have known it i am a lost man  it was pitiful lost fiddlesticks i snapped back at him with bared teeth i wouldntive never harmed a fly who i should like to know came to my help when but i choked down the words silence fell between us the idiot clock chimed five he turned his face away to conceal the aversion that had suddenly overwhelmed him at sight of me  i see he said in a hollow low voice with his old wooden artificial dignity theres nothing more to say i can only thank you and be gone i had not realized you misjudge her you havent the how could it be expected but there thinkings impossible  how often had i seen my poor father in his last heavy days draw his hand across his eyes like that already my fickle mind was struggling to find words with which to retract to explain away that venomous outbreak but i let him go the stooping hatted figure hastened past my window and i was never to see him again     chapter twentyeight   yet in spite of misgivings no very dark foreboding companioned me that evening with infinite labour i concocted two letters        dear mr crimblei regret my words this afternoon bitterly      indeed i do but still truth is important isnt it one we know      hasnt been too kind to either of us i still say that and if it      seems inconsiderate please remember shakespeares lines about the      beetle which i came across in a birthday book the other daya      creature i detest besides we can return good for evili cant      help this sounding like hypocrisyeven though it is an extremely      tiring exchange i feel small enough just now but would do      anything in the world that would help in the way we both want i      hope that you will believe this and that you will forgive my      miserable tongue believe me ever yours sincerelym m   my second letter was addressed to fannys school co miss stebbings        dear fannyhe came again today and looks like a corpse i can      do no more you must know how utterly miserable you are making him      that i cant and wont go on being so doublefaced i dont call      that being the good samaritan throw the stone one way or the      other however many birds it may kill thats the bravest thing to      do a horrid boy i knew as a child once aimed at a jay and      killeda wren well theres only one wren that i know ofyour m       psi hope this doesnt sound an angry letter i thought only the      other day how difficult it must be being as fascinating as you are      and of course we are what we are arent we and cannot i      suppose help acting like that you cant think how he looked and      talked besides i am sure you will enjoy your holiday much more      when you have made up your mind oh fanny i cant say whats in      mine every day theres something else to dread and all that i do      seems only to make things worse do write and though of      course it isnt my affair do have a sagacious holiday too   mrs bowater almost squinted at my two small envelopes when she licked the stamps for me we can only hope was her one remark that when the secrets of all hearts are opened theyll excuse some of the letters we reach ourselves to write but i did not ask her to explain  lyme regis was but a few days distant when not for the first time since our meeting at mrs bowaters gatepost i set off to meet mr anonthis time to share with him my wonderful news when showers drifted across the sunshafted sky we took refuge under the shelter of the gardenhouse as soon as the hot beams set the raindrops smouldering so that every bush was hung with coloured lights we returned to my smoking stone and we watched a rainbow arch and fade in the windy blue  he was gloomy at first grudged me i think every moment that was to be mine at lyme regis so i tempted him into talking about the books he had read and about his childhoodfar from as happy as mine it hurt me to hear him speak of his mother then i asked him small questions about that wonderful country he had told me of which whether it had any real existence or not filled me with delight as he painted it in his imagination he was doing his best to keep his word to me and i to keep our talk from becoming personal  if i would trust myself to him friend to friendhe suddenly broke out in a thick low voice when i least expected itthe whole world was open to us and he knew the way  what way said i and how about poor mrs bowater how strange you are where do you live may i know  there was an old farmhouse he told me on the other side of the park and near it a few cottagesat the far end of loose lane he lodged in one of these against my wiser inclinations he persuaded me to set off thither at once and see the farm for myself  on the further side of wanderslore sprouting their pallid green frondlets like beads at the very tips of their black were more yews than beeches we loitered on along the neglected bridlepath cuckoos were now in the woods and we talked and talked as if their voices alone were not seductive enough to enchant us onwards sometimes i spelled out incantations in the water and sometimes i looked out happily across the wet wayside flowers and sometimes a robin flittered out to observe the intruders how was it that human company so often made me uneasy and selfconscious and natures always brought peace  now you said i began again that they have a god and that they are so simple he hasnt a name what did you mean by that there cant be one god for the commonsized and one forfor me now can there my mother never taught me that and i have thought for myself indeed i had  god he cried why what is all this  all this at that moment was a clearing in the woods softly shimmering with a misty transparent green in whose sunbeams a thousand flies darted and zigzagged like motes of light and the years first butterflies fluttered and languished  but if i speak i said listen now my voice is just swallowed up out of just a something it faints into a nothingdies no no i suppose i was arguing only to draw him out all this cares no more for me thanthan a lookingglass yet it is mine can you see jesus christ in these woods do you believe we are sinners and that he came to save us i do but i can see him only as a little boy you know smiling crystal intangible and yet i do not like children much  he paused and stared at me fixedly my size he coughed  oh size i exclaimed how you harp on thatas if i never had did you not say yourself that the smaller the body is the happier the ghost in it bodies indeed  he plunged on hands in pockets frowning clumsy and up there in the northwest a huge cloud poured its reflected lights on his strange face inwardlywith all my wits in a pleasant scatteri laughed and outwardly all but danced solemnly taking me at my word and as if he were reading out of one of his dry old books he began to tell me his views about religion and about what we are qualities consciousness ideas and that kind of thing as if you could be anything at any moment but just that moments whole self at least so it seemed then i was happy but since in his earnestness his voice became almost as false to itself as was mr crimbles when he had conversed with me about hell my eyes stole my ears from him and only a few scattered sentences reached my mind  nevertheless i enjoyed hearing him talk and encouraged him with bits of questions and exclamations did he believe perhaps in the pagan godsmars and all that was there even at this very moment cramped up among the moss and the roots a crazy brutal pan in the woods and those delicious nymphs and naiads what would he do if one beckoned to himor pans pipes began wheedling  nymphs he grunted arent you  oh i cried coming to a pause beside a hollytree so marvellously sparkling with waterdrops on every curved spine of it that it took my breath away lets talk no more thoughts they are only mice gnawing i can hear them at night  you cannot sleep he inquired with so grave a concern that i laughed outright  sleep with that mr crimble on my nerves i gave a little nod in my mind to my holly and we went on  crimble he repeated his eyes greenish at that moment shot an angry glance at me from under their lids who is he  a friend a friend i replied and poor man as they say in love calm yourself mr jealousy not with me i am three sizes too small with miss bowater but there i went on in dismay that mere vanity should have let this cat out of its bag thats not my secret we mustnt talk of that either what i really want to tell you is that we havent much time i am going away lets talk of me oh mr anon shall i ever be born again and belong to my own world  it seemed a kind of mournful serenity came over his face you say you are going away he whispered pointing with his finger and yet you expect me to talk about that  we were come to the brink of a clear rainpuddle perhaps three or four feet wide in the mossgreened stony path and that was the image of myself which lay on its surface against the far blue of the skythe underscarlet of my cape my face fair hair eyes i trembled a little his own reflection troubled me more than he did himself  come i said laying a hand on his sleeve the times so short and indeed i must see your house you know you have seen mine ah but you should see lyndsey and chizzel hill and the stream in my fathers garden i often hear that at night mr anon i would like to have died a child however long i must live  but now the cloud had completely swallowed up the sun a cold gust of wind swept hooting down on us and i clung to his arm we pushed on emerged at last from the rusty gates its eagles green and scaling and came to the farm but not in time a cloud of hail had swirled down beating on our heads and shoulders it all but swept me up into the air catching hands we breasted and edged on up the rough miry lane towards a thatched barn open on one side and roofing a red and blue wagon under this we scrambled and tingling all over with the buffetings of the wind and the pelting of hailstones i sat laughing and secure watching over my sodden skirts and shoes the sweeping pattering drifts paling the green  around us in the short straw and dust stalked the farmers fowls cackling with redeyed glances askew at our intrusion ducks were quacking doves flew in with whir of wing i thought i should boil over with delight and presently a sheepdog ears down and tail between its legs slid round the beam of the barn door half in half out it stood bristling eyes fixed head thrust out my companion drew himself up and with a large stone in his hand edged stooping and stealthilyand very much i must confess like the picture of a fuegian i have seen in a bookbetween the gaudy wheels of the wagon and faced the lowgrowling beast i watched him enthralled for a moment or two he and the sheepdog confronted each other without stirring then with one sharp bark the animal flung back its head and with whitened eye turned and disappeared  oh bravissimo said i mocking up at mr anon from under my hood he was cowed poor thing i would have made friends with him  we sate on in the sweet dusty scent of the stormy air the hail turned to rain the wind rose higher i began to be uneasy so heavily streamed the water out of the clouds that walking back by the way we had come would be utterly impossible for me whats to be done nowi thought to myself yet the liquid song of the rain the gurgling sighs and trumpetings of the wind entranced me and i turned softly to glance at my stranger he sat chin on largeboned hands his lank hair plastered on his hollow temples by the rain his eyes glassy in profile  i am glad of this he muttered dreamily as if in response to my scrutiny we are here  a scatter of green leafsheaths from a hawthorn over against the barn was borne in by the wind  i am glad too i answered because when you are at peace so i can be for that marvellous land you tell me of is very far away why who but he broke in so earnestly that i was compelled to listen confiding in me some queer wisdom he had dug up out of his booksof how i might approach nearer and nearer to the brink between life and reality and see all things as they are in truth in their very selves all things visible are only a veil he said a veil that withdraws itself when the mind is empty of all thoughts and desires and the heart at one with itself that is divine happiness he said and he told me too out of his farfetched learning a secret about myself  it was cold in the barn now the fowls huddled close rain and wind ever and again drowned the low alluring faraway voice wandering on as if out of a trance dreams maybe yet i have learned since that one half of his tale is true that at need even an afflicted spirit winged for an instant with serenity may leave the body and perhaps if lost in the enchantments beyond never turn back but i swore to keep his words secret between us i had no will to say otherwise and assured him of my trust in him  my very dear he said softly touching my hand but i could make no answer  he scrambled to his feet and peered down on me it is not my peace all the days you are away he gulped forlornly and turned away his head but that is what i mean just nothing all thishe made a gesture with his hands as if giving himself up a captive to authoritynothing but a sop to a dog  then stooping he drew my cape around me banked the loose hay at my feet and shoulders smiled into my face and bidding me wait in patience a while but not sleep was gone  the warmth and odour stole over my senses i was neither hungry nor thirsty but drugged with fatigue with a fixed smile on my face a smile betokening as i believe now little but feminine vanity and satisfaction after feeding on that strange heart my thoughts went wandering the sounds of skies and earth drowsed my senses and i nodded off into a nap the grinding of wheels awoke me from a welter of dreams i gazed out through the opening of the barn at a little battered cart and a shaggy pony and behold on the chopped straw and hay beside me lay stretched out nose on paw our enemy the sheepdog he thumped a friendly tail at me while he growled at my deliverer  thoughtful mr anon he had not only fetched the ponycart but had brought me a bottle of hot milk and a few raisins they warmed and revived me a little lightwitted after my sleep in the hay i clambered up with his help into the cart and tucked myself in as snugly as i could with my draggled petticoats and muddy shoes so with myself screened well out of sight of prying eyes we drove off  all this long while i had not given a thought to mrs bowater we stood before her at last in her oilcloth passage like adam and eve in the garden her oldest bonnet on her head she was just about to set off to the police station and instead of showing her gratitude that her anxieties on my account were over mrs bowater cast us the blackest of looks leaving mr anon to make our peace with her i ran off to change my clothes as i emerged from my bedroom he entered at the door in an old trailing pilot coat many sizes too large for him and i found to my astonishment that he and my landlady had become the best of friends i marvelled this little achievement of mr anons made me like himall of a burstten times as much i believe as he would have been contented that i should love him  indeed the high tea mrs bowater presided over that afternoon sitting above her cups and saucers just like a clergyman is one of the gayest memories of my life and yetshe had left the room for a moment to fetch something from the kitchen and as in a selfconscious hush mr anon and i sat alone together i caught a glimpse of her on her return pausing in the doorway her capped head almost touching the linteland looking in on us with a quizzical benign foolish expression on her face like that of a grownup peeping into a childs dolls house so swirling a gust of hatred and disillusionment swept over me at sight of her that for some little while i dared not raise my eyes and look at mr anon all affection and gratitude fled away miss m was once more an ishmael     lyme regis     chapter twentynine   out of a cab from a livery stable mrs bowater and i alighted at our london terminus next morning to find positively awaiting us beside the wooden platform a firstclass railway carriagea palatial apartment swept and garnished padded and varnisheda miracle of wealth at this very moment i seem to be looking up in awe at the orangerimmed i think it was orange label stuck on the glass whose inscription i afterwards spelled out backwards from within mrs bywater and party as soon as we and our luggage were safely settled an extremely polite and fatherly guard locked the door on us at this mrs bowater was a little troubled by the thought of how we should fare in the event of an accident but he reassured her  never fear maam accidents are strictly forbidden on this line besides which he added with a solemn turtlelike stare if i turn the key on the young lady none of them young aogling don jooans can force their way in strict orders maam  to make assurance doubly sure mrs bowater pulled down the blinds at every stoppingplace we admired the scenery we read the warning against pickpockets and i translated it out of the french after examining the enormous hotels depicted in the advertisements we agreed there was nothing like home comforts mrs bowater continued to lose and find in turn our tickets her purse her spectaclecase her cambric pockethandkerchief not to mention a mysterious little screw of paper containing lozenges i think she scrutinized our luxury with grim determination and we giggled like two schoolgirls as we peeped together through the crevices of the blinded windows at the rich furry passengers who ever and again hurried along casting angry glances at our shrouded windows  it being so early in the yearbut how mild and sweet a daythere were few occupants of the coach at axminster as i had once made a frequently broken vow to do at once what scared me i asked to be perched up on the box beside the lean brickfaced driver thus giddily exalted above his three cantering roan horses we bowled merrily along with his whip he pointed out to me every object of interest as it went floating bychurch and inn farm and mansion  thems peewits he would bawl and thats the selfsame cottage where lived the little old ooman what lived in a shoe he stooped over me reins in fist with his seamed red face and fiery little eye as if i were a small child home for the holidays evening sunlight on the hilltops and shadowy in the valleys and presently the three stepping horsesvapour jetting from their nostrils their sides panting like bellowsdragged the coach up a hill steeper than ever and that there said the driver as we surmounted the crestand as if for emphasis he gave a prodigious tug at an iron bar beside him that theres the sea  the sea flat bowshaped hazed remote and of a blue stilling my eyes as with a dreami verily believe the saltest tears i ever shed in my life smarted on my lids as the spirit in me fled away to be alone with that far loveliness a desire almost beyond endurance devoured me yes cried hidden self to self i can never never love him but he shall take me awayawayaway oh how i have wasted my days sick for home  but small opportunity was given me for these sentimental reflections nearly at the foot of even another hill and one so precipitous that during its rattling descent i had to cling like a spider to the drivers strap we came to a standstill and in face of a gaping knot of strangers i was lifted downwith a there miss nantuckety from the driverfrom my perch to the pavement  the lodgings mrs monnerie had taken for us proved to be the sea rooms in a small white bowwindowed house on the front commanding the fishingboats the harbour and the stone cobb i tasted my lips snuffed softly with my nose stole a look over the bay and glanced at mrs bowater was she too halfdemented with this peculiar and ravishing experience i began to shiver but not with cold with delight face creased up in a smile the wind had stiffened the skin cheeks tingling and ravenously hungry i watched the ceremonious civilities that were passing between landlady and landlady mrs bowater angular and spare mrs petrie round dumpy smooth and a little bald my friend mrs monnerie was evidently a lady whose lightest word was sesame every delicacy and luxury that lyme out of its natural resources can have squandered on king george iii was ours without the asking  mrs bowater it is true at our seafish breakfast next morning referred in the first place to the smell of drains next to fleas and last to greasy cooking but who should have the privilege of calling the kettle black unless the pot moreover we were firstclass visitors and had to complain of something i say we but since in the first place all the human houses that i have ever entered have been less sweet to the nose than mere country outofdoors since next as i discovered when i was a child there must be some ichor or acid in my body unpleasing to mans parasites and since last i cannot bear cooked animals these little inconveniences even if they had not existed solely in mrs bowaters fancy would not have troubled me  the days melted away we would sally out early while yet many of lymes kitchen chimneys were smokeless and would return with the shadows of evening how mrs bowater managed to sustain so large a frame for so many hours together on a few hard biscuits and a bottle of cold tea i cannot discover her mood like our weather that april was almost always set fair and her temper never above a comfortable sixty degrees we hired a goatchaise and with my flaxen hair down my back under a sunbonnet i drove reuben up and down the esplanadeboth of us passable tenyearolds to a careless observer my cheeks and hands were scorched by the sun mrs bowater added more and more lilac and white to her outdoor attire and mrs petrie lent her a striped and once handsome parasol with a storks head for handle which had been left behind by a visitorotherwise unendeared  on warm mornings we would choose some secluded spot on the beach or on the fragrant greenturfed cliffs or in the uplyme meadows though i could never persuade mrs bowater to join me i sometimes dabbled in the sun in some icecold shallow seaweedy pool between the rocks then while she read the newspaper or crocheted i also over book or needle indulged in endless reverie for hours together with eyes fixed on the glassgreen tumbling water i would listen to its enormous far phantom bells and voices happier than words can tell and i would lie at full length basking in the heat for it was a hot may almost wishing that the huge furnace of the sun would melt me away into a little bit of glass and what colour would that have been i wonder if a small heart can fall in love with the whole world that heart was mine but the very intensity of this greed and delightand the tiniest shell or pebble on the beach seemed to be all but exploding with itwas a severe test of my strength  one late twilight i remember as we idled homeward the planet venus floating like a luminous waterdrop in the primrose of the western sky we passed by a low whitewalled house beneath trees and from an open window came into the quiet the music of a fiddle what secret decoy was in that air i cannot say i stopped dead looking about me as if for refuge and drinking in the while the gliding lamenting sounds  curiously perturbed i caught at mrs bowaters skirt sky and darkening headland seemed to be spinning around memelting out into a dream oh mrs bowater i whispered as if i were drowning it is strange for us to be here  she dropped herself on the grass beside me brushing with her dress the scent of wild thyme into the dewy air and caught my hands in hers her long face close to mine she gently shook me now now now now she called come back my pretty one see its me me mrs bowater the love shes been to me  i smiled groped with my hand opened my eyes in the dimness to answer her but a black cloud came over them and the next thing i recall is waking to find myself being carried along in her arms cold and half lifeless and she actually breaking ever and again into a shambling run as she searched my face in what seemed even to my scarcely conscious brain an extravagant anxiety   four days afterwardsand i completely restoredwe found on the breakfast table of our quiet searoom an unusually bountiful post a broad impressivelooking letter and a newspaper for mrs bowater and a parcel from fanny for me time and distance had divided me from the past more than i had supposed the very sight of her handwriting gave me a qualm fanny oh my heavens cried a voice in me whats wrong now  but removing the brown paper i found only a book and it being near to my size as books go i opened it with profound relief my joy was premature the book fanny had sent me was by bishop jeremy taylor holy living and dying with prayers containing the whole duty of a christian i read over and over this title with a creeping misgiving and dismay and almost in the same instant detected lightly fastened between its flyleaves and above its inscriptionto midgetina in memoriaman inch or two of paper pencilled over in fannys minutest characters  a slow furtive glance discovered mrs bowater far too deeply absorbed to have noticed my small movements she was sitting bolt upright her forehead drawn crooked in an unusual frown an open letter lay beside her plate she was staring into rather than at her newspaper with infinite stealth i slipped fannys scrap of paper under the tablecloth folded it small and pushed it into my skirt pocket a present from fanny i cried in a clear voice at last  but mrs bowater with drooping pallid face and gaze now fixed deep on a glasscase containing three stuffed aquatic birds had not heard me i waited watching her she folded the newspaper and removed her spectacles on our return she began inconsequently the honourable mrs monnerie has invited you to stay in her london housenot for a week or two for good thats all as it should be i suppose seeing that pays pay and mine is no other call on you  the automatic voice ceased with a gasp her thoughts appeared to be astray she pushed her knotted fingers up her cheeks almost to her eyes  its said she added with long straight mouth that that unfortunate young man mr crimbleis ill she gave a glance at me without appearing to see me and left the room  what was amiss oh this world i sat trembling in empty dread listening to her heavy muffled footfall in the room above the newspaper with a scrawling cross on its margin lay beside mrs monneries large roughedged envelope i could bear the suspense no longer on hands and knees i craned soundlessly forward over the white tablecloth across the rank dish of coagulating bacon fat and stole one or two of the last few lines of greyblack print at the foot of the column the reverend gentleman leaves a widowed mother he was an only son and was in his twentyninth year  leaves wasthe dingy letters blurred my sight footsteps were approaching i huddled back to my carpet stool on the chair mrs petrie had come to clear away the breakfast things stonily i listened while she cheerfully informed me that the glass was still rising that she didnt recollect such weather not for the month for ten years or more you must be what ive heard called an alcyon miss she nodded her congratulations at me and squinnied at the untasted bacon  i am going for a breath of air mrs petrie came mrs bowaters voice through the crack of the door will you kindly be ready for your walk miss in half an hour  left once more to myself i heard the alarm clock on the mantelpiece ticking as if every beat were being forced out of its works and might be its last an early fly or twomy strange familiar friendsdarted soundlessly beneath the ceiling the sea was shimmering like an immense lookingglass more pungent than i had ever remembered it the refreshing smell of seaweed eddied in at the open window  with dry mouth and a heart that jerked my body with its beatings i unfolded fannys scrap of paper        wise mi have thrown the stone and now i am fey for my own      poor head could youandwill you absolutely secretly send me any      money you can spare £15 if possible im in a holefull fathom      fivebut mean to get out of it i ask you rather than mother      because i remember you said once you were putting money by out of      that young ladys independence of yours notes would be best if      not a post office order to this address somehow i must trust      to luck and to your wonderful enterprise if you would be truly a      dear its only until my next salary if you cantor wonthelp      me damnation is over my head but i bequeathe you a kiss all honey      and roses none the less and am pro tem your desperate f       psbe sure not to give m this address and in a week or two we      shall all be laughing and weeping together over the prodigal      daughter   fanny then had not heard our morning news i read her scribble again and again for the least inkling of it my thoughts in disorder that sprawling cross on the newspaper this gibbering and dancing as of a skeleton before my eyes and the stone the stone what did it mean the word echoed on in my head as if it had been shouted in a vault i was deadly frightened and sick stood up as if to escape and found only my own distorted face in mrs petries flowerandbutterflypainted chimney glass  you you my eyes cried out on me and a furious stormremorse grief horrorbroke within i knew the whole awful truth like a shade in the bright light mr crimble stood there beyond the table not looking at me its face turned away unspeakable misery bowed my shoulders chilled my skin  but you said ill i whispered angrily up at last at mrs bowaters bonneted figure in the doorway i have looked where the cross is he is dead  she closed the door with both hands and seated herself on a chair beside it  ive trapsed that front missstriving to pick up the ends it doesnt bear thinking of that poor misguided young man its hid away  what did he die of mrs bowater i demanded  she caught at the newspaper folded it close nodded shook her head four nights ago she said and still some one last shred of devotionnot of fidelity not of fear for i longed to pour out my heart to hersealed my lips holy living and dying holy living and dying i read over and over the faded gilt letters on the cover of fannys gift and she in her mockery desperate too damnationthe word echoed on in my brain  but poor mrs bowater was awaiting no confession from me she had outtrapsed her strength when next i looked round at her the bonneted head lay back against the rosegarlanded wallpaper the mouth ajar the eyelids fluttering it was my turn nowto implore her to come back and failing to do so i managed at last to clamber up and tug at the bellpull     chapter thirty   i surveyed with horror the recumbent angular figure stretched out on the long narrow horsehair sofa the shut eyesit was selfish to leave me like this  there miss dont take on mrs petrie was saying the poor things coming round now slipping dead off out of thingsmanys the time ive wished i couldeven though you have come down for a bit of pleasuring  but it was lyme regiss solemn roundshouldered doctor who reassured me at first sight of him i knew mrs bowater was not going to die he looked down on her politely protesting that she must not attempt to get up this unseasonable heat perhaps the heart of course not so strong as it might be he ordered her complete rest in bed for a few dayslight nourishment no worry and he would look in again me he had not detected under the serge windowcurtain though he cast an uneasy glance around him i fancied on leaving the room  after remaining alone under the still sunshiny window until i could endure it no longer i climbed up the steep narrow stairs to mrs bowaters bedroom and sat a while clasping the hand that hung down from the bed the blind gently ballooned in the breeze raying lights circled across the ceiling as carriage and cart glided by on the esplanade fearful lest even my fingertips should betray me to the flat shape beneath the counterpane i tried hard to think my mind was in a whirl of fears and forebodings but there was but one thing supremely urgent facing me now i must forget my own miseries and somehow contrive to send fanny the money she needed  somehow but how the poor little hoard which i had saved from my quarterly allowances lay locked up on beechwood hill in my box beneath my bed by what conceivable means could i regain possession of it unknown to mrs bowater  conscience muttered harsh words in my ear as i sat there holding that cold limp hand with mine while these inward schemings shuttled softly to and fro  when my patient had fallen asleep i got downstairs againa more resolute if not a better woman removing latch and box keys from their ribbon round my neck i enclosed them in an envelope with a letter        dear mr anoni want you please to help me the large one of      these two keys unlocks my little house door the smaller one a box      under my bed would you please let yourself in at mrs bowaters      tomorrow evening when its darkthere will be nobody theretake      out twenty pounds which you will find in the box and send them to      miss fanny bowater the crown and anchor hotel b i will      thank you when i come       believe me yours very sincerely       m m   it is curious many a false pandering word had sprung to my tongue when i was concocting this letter in my mind beside mrs bowaters bed and even with mrs petries stubby inkcorroded pen in my hand yet some last shred of honesty compelled me to be brief and frigid i was simply determined to be utterly open with him even though i seemed to myself like the dark picture of a man in a bog struggling to grope his way out i dipped my fingers into a vase of wallflowers wetted the gum sealed down the envelope and wrote on it this address mr  lodging at a cottage near the farm northwest of wanderslore beechwood kent and i prayed heaven for its safe delivery  for fanny no words would comenothing but a mere bare promise that i would help her as soon as i couldan idiots message the next three days were an almost insupportable solitude from mr anon no answer could be expected since in my haste i had forgotten to give him mrs petries address i brooded in horror of what the failure of my letter to reach him might entail i shared fannys damnation wherever i went a silent mr crimble dogged my footsteps meanwhile mrs bowaters newspaper i discovered lay concealed beneath her pillow  at length i could bear myself no longer and standing beside her bed asked if i might read it until that moment we had neither of us even referred to the subject propped up on her pillows her long face looking a strange colour against their whiteness she considered my request  well miss she said at last you know too much to know no more  i spread out the creased sheets on the worn carpet and read slowly the smudged matteroffact account from beginning to end there were passages in it that imprinted themselves on my memory like a photograph mr crimble had taken the evening service that last day looking ill and worn though never in what may be described as robust health owing to his indefatigable devotion to his ecclesiastical and parochial duties the service over and the scanty congregation dispersed he had sate alone in the vestry for so unusual a time that the verger of st peters a mr soames anxious to get home to his supper had at length looked in on him at the door to ask if his services were required any further mr crimble had raised his head as if startled and had smiled in the negative and then closing the eastern door behind him had hastened out of the church no other human eye had encountered him until he was found at 1127 pm in an outhouse at the foot of his mothers garden the head of the unfortunate gentleman was wellnigh severed from the body he was an only son and was in his twentyninth year universal sympathy will be extended by all to the aged lady who is prostrated by this tragic occurrence  propped on my hands and knees fearful that mrs bowater might interrupt me before i was prepared i stared fixedly at the newspaper i understood all that it said yet it was as strange to me as if it had been written in hebrew i had seen i had known mr crimble who then was this my throat drew together as i turned my head a little and managed to inquire what is an inquest mrs bowater  fretting out the whys and wherefores came the response muffled by a handkerchief pressed close to her mouth  andthis why i whispered stooping low  thats between him and his maker said the voice the poor young man had set his heart on we know where as we make our bed so we must lie on it miss its for nobody to judge though it may be a lesson  oh mrs bowater then you knew i knew  no no not your lesson miss i didnt mean that its not for you to fret yourself though i must say i have always made it a habit though without prying please god to be aware of more than interference could set right fanny and i have talked the affair over till we couldnt look in each others faces for fear of what we might say but shes mr bowaters child through and through and my firm hand was not firm enough maybe you did what you could its not in human conscience to ask more than the natural frame can bear  did what i could i cowered staring at my knuckles and it seemed that a little concourse of strangers heads close together were talking in my mind my eyes were dry i think the spectre of a smile had dragged up my lips mrs bowater raised herself in her bed and peered over at me  its the letters she whispered at me if he hasnt destroyed them theyll be read to the whole parish  i crouched lower youll be thankful to be rid of me i shall be thankful to be rid of myself mrs bowater  she thrust a long skinny arm clean out of the bed come away there come away she cried  oh i said take me away take me away i cant bear it mrs bowater i dont want to be alive  there miss rest now and think no more she smoothed my hair clucked a little low whistling tune as if for lullaby why there now she muttered sardonically you might almost suppose i had been a mother myself  there was silence between us for a while then quietly raising herself she looked down at me on the pillow and finding me to be still awake a long smile spread over her face why we dont seem neither of us to be much good at daytime sleeping     chapter thirtyone   a morning or two afterwards we set out on our homeward journeythe sea curdling softly into foam on its stones a solitary ship in the distance on its dim blue horizon we were a dejected pair of travellers keeping each a solemn face turned aside at the window thinking our thoughts and avoiding as far as we could any interchange of looks that might betray them one to the other for the first time in our friendship mrs bowater was a little short and impatient with me over difficulties and inconveniences which i could not avoid owing to my size  her key in the lock of the door she looked down on me in the porch a thin smile between nose and cheek no place like home there maynt be miss she began but the dark passage was certainly uninviting the clock had stopped i think ill be calling round for henry she added abruptly  i entered the stagnant room ran up my stairs my heart with meand paused not merely my own ghost was there to meet me but a past that seemed to mutter never again never again from every object on shelf and wall yet a faint sweet unfamiliar odour lay on the chilly air i drew aside the curtain and looked in fading on the coverlet of my bed lay a few limp violets ivory white and faintly rosy  i was alone in the house concealed now even from mr bowaters frigid stare yet at sight of these flowers a slight vertigo came over me and i had to sit on my bed for a moment to recover myself  then i knelt down my heart knocking against my side and dragged from out its hidingplace the box in which i kept my money gritty with the undisturbed dust of our absence it was locked i drew back my hand on my mouth what could be the meaning of this my stranger had come and gone had he been so stupidly punctilious that having taken out the twenty pounds he had relocked an almost empty box  or had he at the last moment this riddle distressed me so much that instantly i was seized with a violent headache but nothing could be done for the present i laid by the violets in a drawer pushed back the box and making as good a pretence at eating my supper as i could prepared for the night  one by one the clocks in hall and kitchen struck out the hours and the wind being in the east borne on it came the chimes of st peters automatically i counted the strokes turning this way and that as if my life depended on this foolish arithmetic yet ready like job to curse the day i was born what had my existence been but a blind futility my thought for others but a mask of egotism and selfishness yet in all this turmoil of mind i must have slept for suddenly i found myself stiff drawnup and wideawakelistening to a cautious reiterated tapping against my windowpane a tallow nightlight burned beside me in a saucer of water for the first time in my lifeat least since childhoodi had been afraid to face the dark why i know not but i at once leapt out of bed and blew out that light the night was moonless but high and starry i peered through the curtains and a shrouded figure became visible in the gardenfannys  curtain withdrawn we looked each at each through the cold dividing glass in the gloomher eyes in the nightspread pallor of her skin as if congealed the dark lips with an exaggerated attempt at articulation murmured words but i could catch no meaning the face looked almost idiotic in these contortions i shuddered shook my head violently she drew back  terrified that she would be gonein my dressinggown and slippers i groped my way across the room and was soon with my door open in the night air she had heard me and with a beckon of her finger turned as if to lead me on  no no i signalled i have no key with a gesture she drew close stooped and we talked there together muttering in the porch  midgetina she whispered smiling bleakly its this wretched money i must explain im at my wits endin awful troublewithout it  huddled close i wasted no time in asking questions she must come in but this she flatly refused to do yet money money was her one cry and that she must have before she saw her mother again not daring to tell her that i was in doubt whether or not my savings were still in my possession i pushed her hand away as she knelt before me on the uppermost step i must fetch it i said  by good fortune my moneybox was not the weightiest of my grandfathers french trunksnot the brassbound friendinneed of my younger days and it contained little but paper i hoisted it on to my bed and as i had lately seen the porters do at the railway station contrived to push under it and raise it on to my shoulder its edge drove in on my collarbone till i thought it must snap thus laden i staggered cautiously down the staircase pushed slowly across the room and so out into the passage and towards the rounded and dusky oblong of the open door  on the threshold fanny met me gasping under this burden and at sight of me some blessed spirit within her seemed to give her pause no no she muttered and drew back as if suddenly ashamed of her errand on i came however and prudence prevailed with a sound that might have been sigh or sob she snatched the load from me and gathered it in as best she could under her cloak  oh midgetina she whispered meaninglessly now we must talk and having wedged back the catch of my door we moved quickly and cautiously in the direction of wanderslore   we climbed on up the quiet hill the cool fragrant night seemed to be luring us on and on to swallow us up yet there shone the customary stars there indeed to my amazement as if the heavenly clock of the universe had set back its hands on my behalf straddled the constellation of orion  come to our beechtree now a vast indistinguishable tent of whispering silky leaves fanny seated herself upon a jutting root and i stood panting before her  well she said with a light desolate laugh  oh fanny well i cried  cant you trust me  trust you  oh oh mockingbirdwith all these riches  i cast a glance up into the leafy branches and seated myself opposite to her  fanny fanny have you heard  heard she says it was her turn to play the parrot what am i here for but to hear more but never mind thats all over has mother  all over fanny i interrupted her all over but the letters  what letters she stared at me and added looking away oh mine she gave out the word with a long inexhaustible sigh that was all right he did not hide he burned neither to nor from not even to his mother every paper destroyed i envy her feelings he just gave up went out exit i envy that too  not even to you fanny not a word even to you  the figure before me crouched a little closer together they said was her evasive reply that there is melancholia in the family  i think the word frightened me even more than its meaning melancholia i repeated the melodious syllables oh fanny  listen midgetina her voice broke out coldly i can guess easily enough whats saving up for me when i come homewhich wont be yet a while i can assure you i can guess too what your friends lady pollacke and co are saying about me let them rave that cant be helped i shall bear it and try to grin maybe there would be worse still if worse were known but your worse i wont have not even from you i was not his keeper i did not play him false i deny it could i prevent himcaring for me was he man enough to come openly did he say to his mother take her or leave her i mean to have heras i would have done no he blew hot and cold he temporized hehe was a coward oh this everlasting dogfight between body and mind ages before you ever crept upon the scene he pestered and pestered meuntil i have almost retched at the sound of church bells what was it i ask you but sheer dread of what the man might go and do that kept me shillyshallying and whats more miss wren who told me to throw the stone pff it sickens me this paltering world i cant and wont see things but with my reason my reason i tell you what else is a schoolmaam for did he want me for my sake who begged and begged that his beautiful love should be kept secret there was once a philosopher called plato my dear he poisoned mans soul  flesh and spirit fanny must have been very tired her voice fluttered on like a ragged flag  but listen listen i entreated her i havent blamed you for that fanny i swear it i mean you cant help not loving i know that but perhaps if only we had its a dreadful thing to think of him sitting there alonethe vestryand then looking up with a smile oh fanny with a smile i dare hardly go into his mindand the verger looking in i think of him all day  and i all night came the reply barked out in the gloom wasnt the man a christian then  fanny i covered my eyes dont say that we shall both of us just suffocate in the bog if you wont even let yourself listen to what you are saying  well she said doggedly be sure you shall suffocate last miss midge theres ample perchroom for you on fannys shoulder i felt rather than saw the glance almost of hatred that she cast at me from under her brows  mock as you like at me was my miserable answer i have kept my word to youall but and it was i who helpedoh yes i know that  ah all but her agile tongue caught up the words and what else may i ask  i took a deep breath with almost sightless eyes fixed on the beautiful mysterious glades stretching beneath us he came again why it was not very many days ago and we talked and talked and i grew tired yes and angry at last i told him you were only making use of me you were i said that all we could do was just to go on loving youand keep away i know fanny i cannot be of any account i dont understand very much but that is true   she leaned nearer as if incredulous her face as tranquil in its absorption as the planet that hung in the russetblack sky in a rift of the leaves  candid and candid she scoffed brokenly and all in a gasp  the voice trailed off her mouth relaxed and suddenly my old love for her seemed to gush back into my heart a burning inarticulate pity rose up in me  listen midgetina she went on that was honest and i can be honest too i dont care what you said if you had called me the vilest word they can set their tongue to id still have forgiven you but would you have me give in go under have you ever seen mother grundy i tell you he haunts methe blackness the deadness that outhouse do you suppose i cant see inside that he sits by my bed i eat his shadow with my food at every corner in the street his black felt hat bobs and disappears if even he hadnt been so solemn so insignificant her low torturing laugh shook under the beechen hollow  and i say thisshe went on slowly as if i sat at a distance if hes not very careful i shall go the same way i cant bear thatthat kind of spying on me dont you suppose you can sin after death if only he had given me awaybetrayed me we should at least have been square but that she jerked back her head thats only one thing i had not meant to humble myself like this you seem not to care what humiliations i have to endure you sit there oh how absurd for me watching and watching me null and void and meaningless yet you are human you feel you said you loved meoh yes but touch me come hereshe laid her hand almost fondly on her breastand be humanly generous no thats no more your nature thanthan a changelings contamination perhaps  her eyes fretted round her as if she had lost her sense of direction  and now theres this tongueless staring ghost she shuddered hiding her face in her hands the misery of it all  fanny fanny i besought her you know i love you but the words sounded cold and distant and some deadly disinclination held me where i was though i longed to comfort her and at times i confess it i have hated you too you havent always been very kind to me i was trying to cure myself you were curing me but still i go ona little  its useless useless she replied dropping her hands into her lap and gazing vacantly on the ground i cant care i cant even cry and all you say is only pity i dont want that would you still pity me i wonder if you knew that even though i had come to take this wretched money from you i meant to taunt you to accuse you of lying to me  taunt lying my cheek grew hot i drew back my head with a jerk and stared at her i dont understand you  there what did i say she doesnt understand me she cried with a sob as if calling on the angels to bear witness to her amazement well then let fanny tell you miss m whoever and whatever you may be that she yes even she can understand that unearthliness too oh these last days i have had my fill of them take all give nothing theres no other means of grace in a world like this  but you said taunt me i insisted with eyes fixed on the box that lay between the bluntheaded fronds of the springing bracken what did you mean by that i did my best your mother was ill she fainted fanny when the newspaper came i couldnt come back a single hour earlier so i wrote toto a friend sending him my keys and asking him to find the money for you i know my letter reached him perhaps i hesitated in dread of what might be hanging over our heads perhaps the box is empty  but i need not have wasted myself the puzzle was not quite inexplicable for the moment fannys miseries seemed to have vanished animation came into her face and voice and movements as she told me how the night before thinking that her mother and i might have returned from lyme regis she had come tapping and suddenly as she stood in the garden her face close to the glass an utterly strange one had thrust itself into view and the figure of a ghastly gloating little dwarfish creature had appeared in the porch  at first she had supposedbut only for an instantthat it was myself of course mother had mentioned him in her letters butand fanny opened her eyes at mei never guessed he was well like that  then in her folly and without giving him the least opportunity to explain his presence there she had begun railing at him and had accused him of forcing his way in to rob the house and he stood there hunched up looking at meout of my own house the very picture of fanny helplessly standing there at her own door and of these two facing each other like that in the porchthis ridiculous end to my fine stratagem filled me with a miserable amusement i leaned back my head where i sat shrilly and dismally laughing and laughing until tears sprang pricklingly into my eyes if any listener had been abroad in the woods that night he would i think have hastened his departure  but fanny seemed to be shocked at my levity she peered anxiously into the clear nightglooms around us  and what i said still striving to regain command over myself what happened then oh fanny not a policeman  but her memory of what had followed was confused or perhaps she had no wish to be too exact all that i could win from her for certain was that after an angry and bitter talk between herself and mr anon he had simply slammed my door behind him and dared her to do her worst  that was pretty brave of him i remarked  oh said fanny amiably i am not blaming your friend midgetina he seemed to be perfectly competent  yet even now i remained unsatisfied if fanny had come secretly to beechwood as she had suggested and had spent the night with a friend solely to hear the last tidings of mr crimble what was this other trouble so desperate that she had lost both her wits and her temper at finding mr anon there supposing the house had been empty my curiosity overcame me and the none too ingenuous question slipped from my tongue did you want some of the money for mourning then fanny  her dark pale face above the black enveloping cloak met my look with astonishment  mourning she cried why that would be the very no not mourning midgetina i owe a little to a friendand not money only she added with peculiar intensity of course if you have any doubts about lending it  give not lend said i  yes but how are we to get at it i cant lug that thing about and you say he has the key shall we smash it open  the question came so hurriedly that i had no time to consider what besides moneyand of course friendshipcould be owed to a friend and especially to a friend that made her clench her teeth on the word  yes smash it open i nodded its only a box  but such a pretty little box  with knees drawn up and shivering now after my outburst of merriment i watched her labours my beloved chest might keep out moth and rust it was no match for fanny she wound up a large stone in her silk scarf a few heavy and muffled blows the lock surrendered and the starlight dripped in like milk from heaven upon my hoard  why midgetina whispered fanny delicately counting the notes over between her long white fingers you are richer than i supposeda female croesus wasnt it a great risk i mean she continued receiving no answer no wonder he was so cautious and how much may i take  it seemed as if an empty space not of yards but of miles had suddenly separated us all you want said i  but i didnti didnt taunt you now did i she smiled at me with head inclined to her slim shoulder as if in mimicry of my ivory hypnos  there was nothing to taunt me about maynt i have a friend  why she retorted lightly mechanically recounting the bits of paper friend indeed what about all those pollackes and monneries mothers so full of you will soon be flitting to quite another sphere its the old friends that then will be left mourning you wont sit moongazing then my dear  no fanny i said stubbornly ive had enough of that just for the present  sst she whispered swiftly raising her head and clasping the notes to her breast beneath her cloak what was that  we listened i heard nothingnothing but sigh of newborn leaf or falling of dead twig cast off from the parent tree it was early yet for the nightingale  only the wind said she  only the wind i echoed scornfully or perhaps a weasel  she hurriedly divided my savings and thrust my share into my lap i pushed it in under my arm  good heavens midgetina she cried aghast you are almost naked how on earth was i to know  i clutched close my dressinggown and stumbled to my feet trying in vain to restrain my silly teeth from chattering never mind about me fanny i muttered they dont waste inquests on changelings  my god was her vindictive comment how she harps on the word as if i had nothing else to worry about with a contemptuous foot she pushed my empty box under cover of a lowgrowing yew seemingly wanderslore was fated to entomb one by one all my discarded possessions  turning she stifled a yawn with a sound very like a groan then its au revoir midgetina give me five minutes start you know i am grateful  yes fanny i said obediently smiling up into her face  wont you kiss me she said tout comprendre you know cest tout pardonner  why fanny i replied no thank you i prefer plain english  but scarcely a minute had separated us when i sprang up and pursued her a few paces into the shadows into which she had disappeared to forgive allhow piteously easy now that she was gone she had tried to conceal it brazen it out but unutterable wretchedness had lurked in every fold of her cloak in the accents of her voice in every fatigued gesture her very eyes had shone the more lustrously in the starlight for the dark shadows around them but understand heri could not even guess what horrible secret trouble she had been concealing from me and beyond that tooa hideous selfish dreadmy guilty mind was haunted by the fear of what she might do in her extremity  fanny fanny i called falsely into the silence oh come back i love you indeed i love you  how little blessed it is at times even to give no answer came i threw myself on the ground and i strove with myself in the darkness crushing out every thought as it floated into my mind and sinking on and on into the depths of unconsciousness  oh my dear my dear came the whisper of a tender guttural voice in my ear you are deathly cold why do you grieve so she is gone listen listen they have neither love nor pity and ii cannot live without you  i sat up black with rage my strangers face glimmered obscurely in the gloom  oh if you spy on me again i rasped at him live without me what do i careyou can go and  but thank god the die without me was never uttered i havent that to haunt me some hidden strength that had been mine these few days melted away like water not now not now i entreated him i hastened away     london     chapter thirtytwo   and thenwell life plays strange tricks in a week or two london had swallowed me up how many times i wonder had i tried in fancy to picture mrs monneries town house how romantic an edifice fancy had made of it impressive in its own fashion it fell far short of these ignorant dreams it was no 2 of about forty set side by side their pillared porticoes fronting a prodigious square its only garden chiefly the resort of cats children nursemaids an old whiskered gentleman in a bath chair and sparrows was visible to every passerby through a spearheaded palisade of railings broad pavingstones skirted its areas and over each descent of steps hung a bellpull  on cloudless days the sun filled this square like a tank with a dry glare and heat in which even my salamanderish body sometimes gasped like a fish out of water when rain fell out of the low grey skies and the scaling planetrees hissed and the sparrows chirped my spirits seemed to sink into my shoes and fair or foul london soot and dust were enemies alike to my eyes my fingers and my nose  even my beloved cloudburdened northwest wind was never quite free of smuts and grit and when blew the east but it must be remembered how ignorant and local i was in my long carriage journey to mrs monneries through those miles and miles of grimed huddling houses those shops and hoardings and steeples i had realized for the first time that its capital is not a part of england only a sprawling human growth in it and though i soon learned to respect it as that i could never see without a sigh some skimpy weed struggling for life in its brickedup crevices it was nearly all dead except for human beings and that could not be said of lyndsey or even of beechwood hill  maybe my imagination had already been prejudiced by a coloured drawing which mr wagginhorne had sent me once for a valentine when i was a child it hangs up now in that childs nursery for a memento that i have been nearly dead in the midst of it on a hill in gold and faded carmine encircled with great fivepointed blue stars and with green grooved valleys radiating from its castellated towers is a cityhierusalem a city surmounted by a narrow wreathing pennon on which inscribed in silver are the words who heareth the voice of my spirit and how shall they who deceive themselves resort unto me  scattered far and near about this central piece and connected with it by thin lines like wandering paths radiating from its gates across mountain valley and forest lie like round weblike smudges if seen at a distance the other chief cities of the world rome venice constantinople paris and the rest london sprawls low in the lefthand corner the strongest glass cannot exhaust the skill and ingenuity of the maker of this drawing an artist who mr wagginhorne told me was mad poor thinga man in a frenzy distemperhis very words for when you peer close into this london it takes the shape of a tusked black hairy boar sprawling with hoofs outspread fast asleep and between them and even actually diapering the carcass of the creature is a perfect labyrinth of lifea high crowned king and queen honeyhiving bees an old man with a beard as if in a swoon robbers with swords travellers with beasts and torches inns a cluster of sharpcoloured butterflies of the same proportion fluttering over what looks like a clot of dung a winding river ships trees tombs wasted unburied bodies a child issuing from an egg a phoenix taking flight and so on there is no end to this poor mans devices the longer you look the more strange things you discover yet at distance of a pace or two his pig appears to fade into nothing but a cloudycoloured cobwebone of the many around his brightdyed hierusalem  now i cannot help wondering if this peculiar picture may not already have tinged a young mind with a curious horror of london even though my aversion may have needed no artificial aid  still i must not be ungrateful these were vague impressions and as an actual fact mrs monnerie had transported me into the very midst of the world of rank and fashion her no 2 was now my home the spaciousness the unnatural solitude the servants who never so much as glanced at me until after my back was turned the hushed opulency the formality it was impossible to be just my everyday miss m my feet never found themselves twirling me round before their mistress was aware of it i all but gave up gossiping with myself as i went about my little selfservices  parochial creature that i wasi missed mrs bowaters homeliness to have things out of proportion to my body was an old story to that needless to say i was perfectly accustomed but here things were at first out of all proportion to my taste and habits a very different thing it is in fact extremely difficult in retrospect to get side by side again with those new experienceswith a self that was at one moment intoxicated and engrossed and the next humiliated and desperately ill at ease at the novelty of her surroundings  i had a maid too fleming with a pointed face and greenish eyes who unlike mrs bowater did not snort but sniffed at things whether i retired for the night or rose in the morning it was always to the accompaniment of a halfaudible sniff and i was never perfectly certain whether that sniff was one of the mind or of the body or of both i found it hard to learn to do little enough for myself fleming despised meat least so i felteven for emptying my washbasin or folding my nightgown worse i was never sure of being alone she stole about so softly on her duties and then the company  not that the last black days at beechwood were not even blacker for the change at first i tried to think them quietly over to ravel out my mistakes and to get straight with my past but i couldnt in all that splendour i had to spend much more time in bewaring of faux pas and in growing accustomed to being a kind of tame petted animaltame even to itself i mean so mrs bowaters went floating off into the past like a dingy little house on the edge of a muddy river amid that old horror and anxiety even my dear pollies wedding day had slipped by unheeded how often my thoughts went back to her now if only she could have been my fleming  i tried to make amends for my forgetfulnesseven to the extent of pocketing my pride and commissioning fleming to purchase for me out of the little stock of money left me by fanny a cradle as a wedding present for pollie and a chest of tools for her husband oddly enough she did not sniff at this request her green eyes almost sparkled at the very word wedding she seemed to revive into a new woman and pollie completely forgave me        dear miss mwe was mother and all very sorry and grieved you      couldnt come though it passed off very satisfactory as for      forgetting please dont mention the word lyndsey have never been      the same since the old house was empty it all passed off very      satisfactory though with such torrents of rain there was a great      pool in the churchyard which made everybody in high spirits and      william and i cant thank you enough for those beautiful gifts you      have sent us will have been a carpenter since he was a boy but      theres things there miss he says he never heard on in his born      days but will be extreamly useful when he comes to know what for      and mother says it was just like your good kind heart to think of      what you sent me you cant think how handsome it looks in the      newpapered room and im sure i hope if i may say so it may be      quite as useful as wills tools and its being pretty late to marry      it isnt as if i was a slip of a girl and of course i have mother      though if any does come you may be sure it will be a sunday treat      being too fine for ordinary       please god miss i hope you are keeping well and happy in your new      suroundings and that dream will come true it was a dreadful moment      that day by the shops but im thankful all came well if you ever      writes to mrs b i trust you will mention me to her kindly not      being much of a letter writer if you could have heard the things      she said of you your ears would burn miss you were such a treasure      and to judge from her appearance she must have seen her troubles      and being a married woman helps to see into things though thank god      im well and happy and william hopes to keep me so       well i must close now trusting that you are in the best of health      your old pollie       miss fenne have been very poorly of late so ive heard though not      yet took to her bedmore peculiar than ever about church and such      like adam waggett being ws oldest friend though not my choice was      to have been best man but hes in service in london and couldnt      come   but if i pined for pollies company how can i express what the absence of mrs bowater meant to me even when i had grown used to my new quarters i would sometimes wake myself calling her name in a dream she had been almost unendurably kind to me that last may morning in wanderslore when she had come to fetch me from yet another long adieuto mr anon after he had gone she and i had sat on for a while in that fresh spring beauty a sober and miserable pair miserable on my side for miserable reasons then if ever had been the moment wherein to clear my breast and be in spirit as well as heart at one with her yet part for honesty and part for shame i had remained silent i could only comfort myself with remembering that we should soon meet again and that the future might be kinder well sometimes the future is kinder but it is never the same thing as the past  they may perhaps talk about that unfortunate  about that poor young mr crimble miss was one of my landladys last remarks as she sat staring rigidly at the great empty house we all take good care to spread about each others horrors and what else is a newspaper for if so well i shouldnt ask it i suppose but ive been thinking maybe my fanny wasnt everything to blame weve had it out together she and i though only by letter she was frightened of me as much as anything though goodness knows i tried to bring her up a godfearing child she had no one as she thought to go toand him a weak creature for all his obstinacy and as you might say penned in by his mother and his cloth they say the cartholics dont marry and theres nothing much to be wondered at in that poor young fellow he wont bear much thinking on even when hes gone out of mind im fearing now that whats come about may make her wilder and harder help her all you can if only in your thoughts miss she sets more store by you than you might guess  indeed indeed i will i said  you see miss mrs bowater monotoned on im nothing much better than an aunt for fanny with no children of my own for guidance and him there helpless with his broken leg in buenos ayres the long bonneted face moved round towards me do you feel any smouldering affections for the young gentleman thats just gone  this was an unexpected twist to our talk but in some little confusion i met it as candidly as i could  i am fonder of fannyand of course of you mrs bowater oh far far buti dont quite know how to express iti am as you might say in my own mind with him i think he knows a little what i am in myself i mean and besides oh well it isnt a miserable thing to feel that just ones company makes anybody happy  mrs bowater considered this reply for some little time  he didnt look any too happy just now to judge from his back view she remarked oracularly and when i was but there miss im thinking only of your comfort and im not quite as comfortable as might be over that there mrs monnerie generous she may be though not noticing it much perhaps from a purse with no bottom to it judging from what ive seen god bless you one way or the other and perhaps youll sometimes remember the bits of sundays weve shared up thereyou and the old dragon  a smile and a tear battled for the dark eye that looked down on me indeed seldom after came a sunday evening with its clanking bells and empty london hush but it brought back to me with a pang my hymns and talks with the old dragon not that any one i ever saw at mrs monneries appeared to work so hard as to need a day of rest there was merely a peculiar empty sensation on sundays of there being nothing to do   a flight of stone steps and a pillared porch led up to her great ornamental door beyond was a hall compared with which the marbles of brunswick house were mere mosaic an alabaster fountain its jet springing lightly from a gilded torch held by a crouching faun cooled and discreetly murmured a ceaseless hush in the air on either hand a wide shallow staircase ascended to an enormous gilded drawingroom with its chairs and pictures and to the library the diningroom stood opposite the portico when mrs monnerie and i were alone we usually shared a smaller room with her parrot chakka her little chinese dog cherrywhose whimper had a most uncomfortable resemblance to the wild and homesick cry of my seagulls at lyme regisand her collections of the worlds smaller rarities it is only i suppose one more proof of how volatile a creature i used to be that i took an intense interest in the contents of these cabinets for a few days and then found them nothing but a vexation no doubt this was because of an uneasy suspicion that mrs monnerie had also collected me  she could be extremely tactful in her private designs yet she showed me off in a fashion that might have turned a far less giddy head than her protégées and perhaps cannot have been in the best of taste  so sure had she been of me that when i arrived a room on the first floor of no 2 had already been prepared for my reception a wonderful piece of fantasticalnesslike a miniature fairy palace but without a vestige of any real makebelieve in it it was panelled and screened with carvings in wood inlaid with silver and motherofpearldwarfs and apes and misshapen gods and goddesses leering and gaping out at one from amidst leafy branches flowers and fruits and birds and butterflies the faintest sniff of that indian woodwhatever it wasrecalls to this day that nightmare scenery its hangings were of a silk so rich that they might have stood on edge on the floor these screens and tapestries guarded a privacy that rarely alas contained a miss m worth being in private with  the one piece of chagrin exhibited by mrs monnerie in those early days of our acquaintance was at my insistence on bringing at least a few of my familiar sticks of furniture and chattels with me from mrs bowaters their plain sheraton design she thought was barbarously out of keeping with the rest it was but i had my way  not the least precious of these old possessions though dismal for its memories was the broken money chest which fanny had pushed in under the yew in the garden at wanderslore tacked up in canvas its hinges and lock repaired it had been sent on to me a week or two after my farewells to beechwood by mr anon inside it i found the nightgown i had buried in the rabbits hole fannys letter from under its stone my sense and sensibility and last pinned on to a scrap of kingfisher coloured silk a pair of earrings made out of two old gold coins apart from a few withered flowers they are the only thing i possess that came from wanderslore long afterwards i showed these earrings to sir w p he told me they were quarter rose nobles of edward iiis reign and only a quarter of a quarter of an ounce in weight they weigh pretty heavy for me now however  my arrangement with mrs monnerie had been that however long i might stay with her i should still be in the nature of a visitor that no 2 in fact should be my town house and mrs bowaters my country but i was soon to realize that she intended mrs bowater to have a very small share in me she pretended to be jealous of me to love me for my own sweet sake and even while i knew it was mere pretence it left its flattery on my mind and for the first time in my life i feigned to be even smaller than i was would mince my speeches affect to be clever even ogle the old lady until it might be supposed we were a pair of queerlyassorted characters in a charade  nevertheless i had had the obstinacy to insist that i should be at liberty to stay with mrs bowater whenever i wished to do so and i was free to invite any friend to visit me i chose and especially my dear any one an eighth as exquisite mrs monnerie had kindly put it it may seem a little strange that all these obligations should have been on her side but mrs monneries whims were far more vigorous than most peoples principles the dews of her loving kindness descended on me in a shower and it was some little time before i began to feel a chill  not the least remarkable feature of no 2 was its back view the window of my room came down almost to the floor it commanded an immense zinc cisterngeorge by namea virginia creeper groping along a brick wall similar cisterns smalling into the distance other brick walls and scores of back windows once after contemplating this odd landscape for some little time it occurred to me to speculate what the back view from the house of life was like but i failed to conceive the smallest notion of it i rarely drew my curtains and oddly enough when i did so was usually in a vacant or dismal mood my lights were electric one simply twisted a tiny ivory button at first their clear and coloured globes set like tiny tulips in a candelabra charmed my fancy but such is custom i soon wearied of them and pined for the slim living flame of candleseven for my coarse old nightlight swimming in its grease in a chipped blue and white saucer     chapter thirtythree   mrs monnerie had rifled her collections for my usepygmy venetian glass a silvergilt breakfast and tea service pygmy porcelain there were absurd little mechanical knickknackspiping birds a maddening little operatic clock of which i at last managed to break the mainspring a musical chair and so on my bath was of jade my table a long one of ebony inlaid with ivory with puffing cherub faces at each corner representing the four winds my own few possessions i must confess looked not only worn but provincial by comparison but i never surprised myself actually talking to any of mrs monneries exquisite novelties as to my other dumb old wooden friends she delighted in them far more than i  i suppose really to enjoy such pomp and luxury one should be positively born in the purple and then i suppose one must be careful that the dye does not go to the bone whether or not i have long since come to the conclusion that i am vulgar by naturelike my mother tongue and at times in spite of my relief at being free of the blackness that had craped in my last days at beechwood i often found myself hungering for my bowater parloureven for its smell another thing i learned gradually at no 2 was that i had been desperately oldfashioned and that is to some extent to belong to the dead  mrs monneries chief desire no doubt was to give her new knickknack a suitable setting but it may also have reminded her childlessnessfor she too like mrs bowater was nothing much better than an auntof her childhood of course i affected as much pleasure in it as i could and was really grateful but she greatly disliked being thanked for anything and would blandly shut her eyes at the least manifestation of gratitude humour me humour me humour me she once petulantly nodded at me there are at least a hundred prayers in the prayer book my pet to one thanksgiving and thats human nature all over it was what my frame must have cost that scandalized me when one day after rhapsodizing not without a shudder over a cape and hat which she had given me composed solely of the shimmering emerald feathers of the hummingbird i rather tactlessly reminded her of my £110 a year and of my determination to live within it her eyelids pinched me a glance as if i had explained in public that i had been bitten by a flea  yet as time went on a peculiar affection sprang up in me for this crowded and lonely old woman it has survived sore trials she was by turns generous and mean honeyed and cantankerous impulsive and scheming like mrs bowater she disapproved of the world in general and yet with how different a result a restless darting mind lay hidden behind the great mask of her countenance with its heavylidded eyes and tower of hair she loved to sit indolently peering musing and gossiping twiddling the while perhaps some little antique toy in her capacious lap i can boast at any rate that i was a spellbound listener and devoured her peculiar wandering satirical talk as if it had been manna from heaven  it was the old old story talking to me was the next most private thing to talking to herself and i think she enjoyed for a while the company of so queer a confessor once i remember she confided to me the whole story of a girlish love affair at least forty years old i could hardly believe my eyes as i watched her she looked so freshened and demure and spirited it was as if she were her own twenties just dressed up but she had a dry and acrid tongue and spared nothing and nobody to her and to mrs bowater i owe nearly all my stock of worldly wisdom and now i shall never have time i suppose to sort it out  mr monnerie as fleming confided in me one dayand the aristocracy was this extremely reticent and contemptuous creatures favourite topic of conversationmr monnerie had been a banker and had made a late and dazzling marriage for mrs monneries blood was as blue as caddis bay on a cloudless morning i asked fleming if she had ever seen lord b and what kind of man he was she never had but remarked obscurely that he must have lived mainly on porridge he had sown so many wild oats  this information reminded me of an old rhyme i had once learned as a child and used to shout about the house        come all you young men with your wicked ways      sow your wild wild oats in your youthful days      that we may live happy when we grow old      happy and happy when we grow old      the day is far spent the nights coming on      so give us your arm and well joggle alongjoggle           and joggle and joggle along   fleming herself i learned had come from ash and was therefore i suppose of an anglosaxon family though she was far from stupid and rather elegant in shape because i suppose i did not like her i was rather aggrieved she had been born in kent mr and mrs monnerie she told me had had no children the fair young man percy maudlen with the tired smile and beautiful shoes who came to tea or luncheon at no 2 at least once a week was mrs monneries only nephew by blood and the still fairer susan monnerie who used to float into my room ever and anon like a zephyr was the only one mrs monnerie cared to see of her three nieces by marriage and yet the other two when they were invited to luncheon were far more docile and considerate in the opinions and sentiments they expressed that seemed so curious to me there was no doubt that mrs monnerie belonged to the aristocracy and yet there always appeared to be quarrels going on in the familyapart of course from births deaths and marriages which seemed of little consequence she enjoyed relatives in every county in england and scotland while i had not one now so far as i knew not even in kent  marvell the butlerhe had formerly been mr monneries valetwas another familiar object of my speculations his rather solemn cleanshaven countenance and steady grey eyes suggested a severe critic of mankind yet he seemed bent only on giving pleasure and smoothing things over and stooped my dish of sliced cherries or apricots over my shoulder with a gesture that was in itself the cream of flattery it astonished me to hear that he had a grownup son in india and though i never met mrs marvell i felt a prodigious respect for her  i would look up and see him standing so smooth and benevolent behind mrs monneries chair that he reminded me of my bishop and i doubt if ever she crisply uttered his delightful name but it recalled the pleasant chime of a poem which my mother had taught me the nymph complaining of the death of her fawn i should have liked to have a long talk with mr marvellany time of the day when he wasnt a butler i meanbut the opportunity never came  one day when he had left us to ourselves i ventured to quote a stanza of this poem to mrs monnerie        with sweetest milk and sugar first      i it at my own fingers nursed      and as it grew so every day      it waxed more white and sweet than they      it had so sweet a breath and oft      i blushed to see its foot more soft      and whiteshall i saythan my hand      nay any ladys in the land   charming charming poppet she cooed much amused pushing in a nut for chakka many shades whiter than your wrinkled old claw you old wretch another sagacious old bird my dear though past blushing i fear at any ladys hand  nothing would content her but that i must recite my bon mot again when her nephew percy dandled in to tea that afternoon he sneered down on me with his pale eyes and with finger and thumb exposed yet another inch of his silk sock but made no comment  manners my dear percy maketh man said his aunt congratulate miss m  if percy maudlen had had no manners at all i think i should at that moment have seen the pink tip of his tongue for if ever any human being detested my small person it was he for very good reasons probably though i never troubled to inquire into them i disliked him too beyond expression he was of course a superior young man with a great many similar ancestors looking out of his face yet he resembled a weasel but susan monneriethe very moment i saw her i loved her just as one loves a field of buttercups or a bush of may for some little time she seemed to regard me as i suppose a linnet regards a young cuckoo that has been hatched out in her nest though of course a squab cuckoo is of much the same size as its fostermother but she gradually grew accustomed to me and even realized at last that i was something a little moreand also perhaps lesshuman than either chakka or cherry or a dresden china shepherdess  i would look at her just for pleasures sake her hair was of the colour of undyed silk with darker strands in it her skin pale and she had an odd little stutter in her light young voice when she was excited i would often compare her with fanny what curious differences there were between them she was graceful but as if she had been taught to be unlike fanny she was not so fascinatingly just a beautiful bodywith that sometimes awful someone looking out of its windows there was a lovely delicacy in her as if absurd though it may sound every bit of her had been selected actually picked out from the finest materials perhaps it was her food and drink that had helped to make her so for i dont think miss stebbingss diet was more than wholesome or that following the sea in early life makes a man rich enough to afford many dainties for his children anyhow there was nothing manmade in fanny and if there are womenshaped mermaids i know what looks will be seen in their faces  however that may be a keen roving spirit dwelt in susans clear blue eyes i never discovered in her any malice or vanity and this i think frequently irritated mrs monnerie susan too used to ask me perfectly sane and ordinary questions and i cannot describe what a flattery it was i had always supposed that men and women were intended to talk openly to one another in this world but it was an uncommonly rare luxury for me at mrs monneries i could talk freely enough to susan and told her a good deal about my early days though i kept my life at beechwood hill more or less to myself  and that reminds me that mrs bowater proved to have been a good prophet it was one day at luncheon mrs monnerie happened to cast a glance at the morning post newspaper which lay open on a chair near by showing in tall type at the top of the column sudden death of sir jasper goodge sir jasper goodge whose family history it seemed was an open book to her reminded her whimsically of another tragedy she put back her head and surveying me blandly as i sat up beside her inquired if i had known at all intimately that unfortunate young man mr crimble  i remember him bobbing and sidling at me that delightful afternoon whenwhat do you think of it susanpoppet and i discovered in each other an unfashionable taste for the truth a bazaar in aid of the pollacke blanket fund or something of the kind  the recollection seemed to have amused her so much that for the moment i held my breath and ignored her question  but why was mr crimble unfortunate inquired susan attempting to make cherry beg for a breadcrumb i glanced in consternation at marvell who at the moment was bringing the coffee things into the room but he appeared to be uninterested in mr crimble  mr crimble was unfortunate my dear said mrs monnerie complacently because he cut his throat  ach how horrible how can you say such things get down you little silly please aunt alice there must be something pleasanter to talk about than that everybody knows about the hideous old sir jasper goodge so it doesnt much matter what one says of him but in spite of her command the little dog still gloated on her fingers  there may be things pleasanter my dear susan returned mrs monnerie complacently but there are few so illuminating in greek tragedy i used to be told all such horrors have the effect of what is called a purgation did mr crimble seem that kind of young man my dear and why was he so impetuous  i think mrs monnerie said i he was in trouble  hm said she he had a very sallow look i remember so he discussed his troubles but not with you my fairy  surely aunt alice exclaimed susan hotly it isnt quite fair or nice to bring back such ghastly memories why she touched my hand with the tips of her light fingers she is quite cold already  poppets hands are always cold replied her aunt imperturbably and i suspect that she and i know more about this wicked world than has brought shadows to your young brow well return to mr crimble my dear when susan is butterflying elsewhere she is so shockingly easily shocked  but it was susan herself who returned to the subject she came into my room where i sat readinga collection of the tiniest little books in the most sumptuous gilt morocco had been yet another of mrs monneries kindnessesand she stood for a moment musing out through my silk window blinds at the vast zinc tank on the roof  was that true she said at last did you really know some one who killed himself who was he what was he like  he was a young manin his twentyninth year i replied automatically dark short with gold spectacles a clergyman he was the curate at st petersbeechwood you know i was speaking in a low voice as if i might be overheard  it was extraordinary how swiftly mr crimble had faded into a vanishing shadow from the very instant of his death the world had begun to adjust itself to his absence and now nothing but a memorya black sad memory  but susans voice interrupted these faint musings a clergyman she was repeating but whywhy did hedo that  they said melancholia i suppose it was just impossibleor seemed impossiblefor him to go on living  but what made him melancholy how awful and how can aunt alice have said it like that  but surely argued i in my old contradictory fashion and spying about for a path of evasion its better to call things by their proper names what is the body after all not that i mean one has any right toto not die in ones own bed  and do you really think like thatthe body of no importance you why miss m aunt alice calls you her pocket venus and she means it too in her own sly way  its very kind of her said i breathing more freely some one i know always calls me midgetina or miss midge anything of that sort i dont mean miss monnerie that it doesnt matter what we are called why if that were so there wouldnt be any society at all would there we should all bewellanonymous deep inside i felt myself smile not that that makes much difference to good poetry  susan sighed how zigzaggedly you talk what has poetry to do with mr crimblethat was his name wasnt it  well it hasnt very much i confessed he hadnt the time for it  susan seated herself on a cushion on the floorand with how sharp a stab reminded me of fanny and the old carefree days of wuthering heights  surelyin spite of fannylife had definitely taken a tinge of miss brontës imagination since then but it was only the languor of susans movements and that because she seemed a little tired rather than merely indolent and if from fannys eyes had now stooped a serpent and now a blinded angel from these clear blue ones looked only a human being like myself even as i write that like myself i ponder but let it stay  so you really did know him susan persisted and it doesnt seem a nightmare even to think of him and who i say made it impossible for him to go on living so intense was her absorption in these questions that when they ceased her hands tightened round her knees and her small mouth remained ajar  you said what just now i prevaricated looking up at her  at this her blue eyes opened so wide i broke into a little laugh  no no no miss monnerie i hastened to explain not me it isnt my story though i was in itand to blame but please if you would be so kind dont mention it again to mrs monnerie and dont think about it any more  not think about it you must besides thoughts sometimes think themselves i always supposed that things like that only happened to quiteto different people you know was he  different i couldnt follow her he was the curate of st petersa friend of the pollackes  oh yes the pollackes said she and having glanced at me again said no more  the smallest confidence i find is a short cut to friendship and after this little conversation there was no ice to break between susan monnerie and myself and she often championed me in my little difficultieseven if only by her silence     chapter thirtyfour   miss monneries visits were less punctual though more frequent than percy maudlens and where is the toadlet i heard him drawl one afternoon as i was being carried downstairs by the lightfooted fleming on the padded tray which mrs monnerie had had made for the purpose  the toadlet my dear percy is about to take a little gentle exercise with me in the garden and you shall accompany us if you were the kind of fairytale hero i used to read of in my nursery you would discover the charm and live happy ever after but i see nothing of the heroic in you and little of the hereafter miss m is a feast of mercies  hm providence packs his mercies into precious small quarters at times he yawned  which suggests an uncivil speculation replied his aunt on the size of your hat  but candidly aunt alice he retorted is your little attachée quite all therei mean all of her that there is personally i wouldnt touch her if i could help it with a pair of tongs a nasty trick  then hah cried mrs monnerie in a large pleasant voice here is miss m percy has been exposing a wounded heart precious one he is hurt because you look at him as if there were positively nothing more of him than what is there to see  not at all aunt alice percy drawled with a jerk of his cane it was for precisely the opposite reason who knows you aint a witch miss m distilled heavens aunt alice you are not bringing cherry too  yes cherry was coming too with his globular eye and sneering nose and so poor percy with a cold little smile on his fine pale features had to accommodate himself to mrs monneries leisurely pace and she to mine while cherry disdainfully shuffled in our rear we were a singular quartette though there were only two or three small children in the palisaded garden to enjoy the spectacle and they after a few polite and muffled giggles returned to their dolls  it was a stifling afternoon as i trod the yellow gravel the quivering atmosphere all but blinded me with its reflected glare the only sounds to be heard were the clang of a milkmans handcart and the pirouettes of a distant piano  and what mrs monnerie suddenly inquired looking down on me with mauvetinted cheek from under her beribanded longhandled parasol what is miss m thinking about  as a matter of fact i was walking at that moment in imagination with mrs bowater at lyme regis but i seized the opportunity of hastening round from between aunt and nephew so that i could screen myself from the sun in mrs monneries ample shadow and inquired why london gardeners were so much attached to geraniums lobelias calceolarias and iceplants mightnt one just as well paint the border mrs monnerie red yellow and blue then it would lastrain snow anything  now ill wager percy you hadnt noticed that said mrs monnerie in triumph  i make it a practice he replied never to notice the obvious it is merely a kind of least common denominator as i believe you call em and he wafted away a yawn with his glove i take no interest in vulgar fractions  i took a little look at him out of the corner of my eye and wished that as a child i had paid more heed to my arithmetic lessons look mrs monnerie i cried piteously poor cherrys tongue is dangling right out of his head he looks so hot and tired  she swept me a radiant if contorted gleam percy would you take pity on poor dear cherry twice round i think will be as much as i can comfortably manage  so percy had to take poor dear cherry into his arms just like a baby and the quartette to all appearance became a trio  but my existence at no 2 was not always so monotonous as that mrs monnerie in spite of her age her ebony cane and a tendency to breathlessness was extremely active and alert if life is a fountain she preferred to be one of the larger bubbles as near as possible to its summit she almost succeeded in making me a minute replica of herself we shared the same manicurist milliner modiste and coiffeur and since it was not always practicable for mahometta to be carried off to these delectable mountains they were persuaded to attend upon her and that as punctually as the fawnfaced man mr godde who came to wind the clocks  whole mornings were spent in conclave in mrs monneries boudoirsusan sometimes of our company julius cæsar so my little roman history told me had hesitated over the crossing of one rubicon mrs monnerie and i confabulated over the fording of a dozen of its tributaries a day a specialista singularly bald man in a long black coatwas called in he eyed me this way he eyed me thatwith far more deference than i imagine mr pellew can have paid me at my christening he assured mrs monnerie of his confirmed belief that the mode of the moment was not of the smallest consequence so far as i was concerned the hard small hat he smiled the tightfitting sleeve and yet to judge by the clothes he did recommend i must have been beginning to look a pretty dowd at mrs bowaters  but even if madam prefers to dress in a style of her own choice he explained the difference if she will understand must still be in the fashion  but he himselfthough mrs monnerie i discovered after he was gone had not even noticed that he was baldhe himself interested me far more than his excellent advice and not least when he drew some papers out of a pocketbook and happened to let fall on the carpet the photograph of a fat little boy with an immense mop of curls so menquite elderly practical men can blush i thought to myself for dr phelps had rather flushed than blushed and my father used only to get red  since nothing perhaps could make me more exceptional in appearance than i had been made by providence i fell in with all mrs monneries fancies and wore what she pleasedpushing out of mind as well as i could all thought of bills i did more than that i really began to enjoy dressing myself up as if i were my own doll and when alone i would sit sometimes in a luxurious trance like a lily in a pot yet i did not entirely abandon my old little bowater habit of indoor exercise when i was alone in my room i would sometimes skip and on one of flemings afternoons out i even furbished up what i could remember of my four kinds of kentish hopscotch with a slab of jade for dump but in the very midst of such recreations i would surprise myself lost in a kind of vacancy apart from its humans and its furniture no 2 was an empty house  i do not mean that mrs monnerie was concerned only with externals sir william forbessmith advised that a little white meat should enrich my usual diet of milk and fruit and that i should have seasalt baths the latter were more enjoyable than the former though both no doubt helped to bring back the strength sapped out of me by the west end  my cheekbones gradually rounded their angles a livelier colour came to lip and skin and i began to be as selfconscious as a genuine beauty one twilight i remember i had slipped across from out of my bath for a pinch of the crystals which mrs monnerie had presented me with that afternoon for my nose also was accustoming itself to an artificial life an immense cheval lookingglass stood there and at one and the same instant i saw not only my own slim naked hastening figure reflected in its placid deeps but behind me that of fleming shadowily engrossed with a shock i came to a standstill helplessly meeting her peculiar stare only seven yards or so of dusky air divided us caught back by this unexpected encounter for one immeasurable moment i stood thus as if she and i were mere shapes in a picture and reality but a thought  then suddenly she recovered herself and with a murmur of apology was gone huddled up in my towel i sat motionless shrunken for a while almost to nothing in the dense sense of shame that had swept over me then suddenly i flung myself on my knees and prayedthough what about and to whom i cannot say after which i went back and bathed myself again  the extravagances of youth no doubt the worst pang was that though vaguely i knew that my most secret solitude had been for a while destroyed that long intercepted glance of halfderisive admiration had filled me with something sweeter than distress if only i knew what commonsized people really feel like in similar circumstances biographies tell me little and can one trust what is said in novels the only practical result of this encounter was that i emptied all mrs monneries priceless crystals forthwith into my bath and vowed never never again to desert plain water so for one evening my room smelt like a garden in damascus  as for fleming she never of course referred to this incident but our small talk was even smaller than before if indeed to percy toadlet was the aptest tag for me for fleming i fancy stuckup sufficed instinct told her that she was only by courtesy a ladysmaid   less for her own sake than for mine mrs monnerie and i scoured london for amusement even though she was irritated a little by my preference for the kind which may be called instructive the truth is that in all this smooth idleness and luxury a hunger for knowledge had seized on me as if cat to grass my mind were in search of an antidote  mrs monnerie had little difficulty in securing private views she must have known everybody that is anybodyas i once read of a countess in a book and i suppose there is not a very large number of this kind of person whenever our social engagements permitted we visited the show places galleries and museums unlike the rest of london i gazed at amenhoteps mummy in the late dusk of a summer evening and we had much to say to one another though but one whiff of the huge round library gave me a violent headache when the streets had to be faced fleming came with us in the carriage and i was disguised to look as much like a child as possiblea process that made me feel at least twenty years older the tower of london the zoo westminster abbey st paulseach in turn fell an early prey to my hunger for learning and experience as for the thames the very sight of it seemed to wash my small knowledge of english history clear as crystal  mrs monnerie yawned her way onthough my comments on these marvels of human enterprise occasionally amused her i made amends too by accompanying her to less welladvertised showplaces and patiently sat with her while she fondled unset and antique gems in a jewellers or inspected the china miniatures and embroideries in private collections if the mere look of the books in the british museum gave me a headache it is curious that the chamber of horrors at madame tussauds wax works did not and yet i dont know life itself had initiated me into this freemasonry i surveyed the guillotine without a shudder and eyed mr hare and charles peace with far less discomposure than general tom thumb or even robert burns in the respectable gallery above my one misfortune was that i could look at no murderer without instantly recomposing the imaginary scene of his crime within my mind and as after a while mrs monnerie decided to rest on a chair set for her by the polite attendant under the scaffold and we had the chamber nearly to ourselves i wandered on alone and perhaps supped rather too full of horrors for one evening  mrs monnerie would often question me well what do you think of that mammetinka or now then my inexhaustible little miss aristotle discourse on that  and like a bullfinch i piped up in response to the best of my ability my answers i fear were usually evasive for i had begun to see that she was making experiments on my mind and senses as well as on my manners and body she was a fancier and one day i ogled up at her with the pert remark that she now possessed a pocket barometer which would do its very utmost to remain at 31° if that was possible without being very dry  she received this little joke with extraordinary good humour when i come down in the world my dear she said and these horrid anarchists are doing their best to send us all skyhigh first well visit the courts of europe together like count boruwlaski do you think you could bring yourself to support your old friend in her declining years in a declining age  i smiled and touched her glove where thou goest i will go i replied and then could have bitten off my tongue in remorse pah gasped a secret voice so thats going the same way too is it  yet heaven knows i was not a puritanand never shall be i just adored things bright and beautiful music too in moderation was my delight and susan monnerie with her small sweet voice would sometimes sing to me in one room whilein an almost unbearable homesicknessi listened in another concerts in general however left every muscle of my body as stiff with rheumatism as it was after my visit to mr mosss farmhouse the unexpected blare of a brass band simply froze my spine and a really fine performance on the piano was sheer torture once indeed when mrs monneries carriage was one of a mellay clustered together while the queen drove by in the appalling clamour of the lancers trombones and kettledrums i fell prostrate in a kind of fit so it was my silly nerves that cheated me of my one and only chance to huzza a crowned head not if i may say so without disrespect so very many sizes larger than my own  alas mrs monnerie was an enthusiast for all the pleasures of the senses i verily believe that it was only my vanity which prevented me from becoming as inordinately fat as sir william forbessmiths white meat threatened to make me  brightest novelty of all was my first visit to a theatrethe london night the glare and clamour of the streets the packed white rows of faces the sealike noise of talk the glitter shimmer dazzleit filled my veins with quicksilver my heart seemed to be throbbing in my breast as fast as mrs monneries watch fortunately she had remembered to take our seats on the farther side from the brass and drums of the orchestra i restrained my shivers the lights went out and in the congregated gloom softly stole up the curtain on the ballet  perched up there in the velvet obscurity of our box i surveyed a woodland scene ruins distant mountains a rocky stream on which an enormous moon shone and actually moved in the theatrical heavens and when an exquisite figure floated pale gauzy and atiptoe into those artificial solitudes drenched with filmy light with a far cry of fanny my heart suddenly stood still and all the old stubborn infatuation flooded heavily back upon me once more  susan sat ghostlike serenely smiling percys narrow jaws were working on their hinges like those of a rabbit i had seen through my grandfathers spyglass nibbling a root of dandelion mrs monnerie reclined in her chair hands on lap with pursedup mouth and weary eyes there was nobody to confide in then but when from either side of the brightening stage flocked in winged creatures with lackadaisical arms and waxlike smilings whose paint and powder caught back my mind rather than my feelings my first lightoffoot was hovering beneath us close to the flaring footlights and she was now no more fanny than the circle of illuminated parchment over her head was the enchanting moon what a complicated world it was with all these layers the experience filled me with a hundred disquieting desires and yet again chiefest of them was that which made sensitive the stumps where if i turned into a bird my wings would grow and which bade me escape  shes getting devilish old and creaky on her pins yawned percy when the curtain had descended and i had sighingly shrunk back into my own tasselled nook from the noise and emptiness of actuality  no said mrs monnerie it is you percy who are getting old you were born blasé youll be positively yawning your head off at the last trump  dear aunt alice said percy squinting through his operaglasses nothing of the kind i shall be helping you to find the mislaid knucklebones besides its better to be born  but the rest of his sentenceand i listened to him only because i hated himpassed unheeded for all my attention had been drawn to susan the hand beside me had suddenly clutched at her silk skirt and a flush gay as the queens union jacks in bond street had mounted into her clear pale cheek as with averted chin she sat looking down upon some one in the stalls at sight of her blushing a richer fondness for her lightened my mind i followed her eye to its goal and gazed enthralled now up now down stringing all kinds of little beads of thoughts together until perhaps conscious that she was being watched she turned and caught me flamed up her cheeks yet hotter and now mine too for my spirits had suddenly sunk into my shoes at the remembrance of wanderslore and my ghostly gloating little dwarfish creature then once more darkness stole over the vast quieting house and the curtain reascended upon romance     chapter thirtyfive   instead of its being a month as had been arranged it was over six weeks before i was deposited again with my elegant dressingcasea mere flying visitoron mrs bowaters doorstep a waft of cooked air floated out into the june sunshine through the letterbox then in the open door just as of old flushed and hot in her black clothes there stood my old friend indescribably the same indescribably different she knelt down on her own doormat and we exchanged loving greetings once more i trod beneath the wreathing guardian horns circumnavigated the agestained eightday clock and so into my parlour  nothing was changed there stood the shepherdess ogling the shepherd there hung mr bowater there dangled the chandelier there angled the same halfdozen flies not a leg caster or antimacassar was out of place yet how steadfastly i had to keep my back turned on my landlady lest she should witness my discomfiture faded dingy crowded shrunkenit seemed unbelievable as i glanced around me that here i could have lived and breathed so many months and been so ridiculously miserable so tragically happy all that bygone happiness and wretchedness seemed for the moment mere waste and folly and not only thatcommon i climbed mr batess clumsy staircase put down my dressingcase and slowly removing my gloves faced dimly the curtained window beyond it lay the distant hills misty in the morning sunbeams the familiar meadows all but chinhigh with buttercups  oh mrs bowater i turned at last here i am you and the quiet skyi wish i had never gone away what is the use of being ones self if one is always changing  there comes a time miss when we dont change only the outer walls crumble away morsel by morsel so to speak but thats not for you yet still thats the reason me and the old sticks are just what we were at least to the eye and youwell therethe house has been like a cage with the bird gone  she stood looking at me with one long finger stretching bonily out on the black and crimson tablecloth a shining sea of loving kindness in her eyes i can see they have taken good care of you and all preened the pretty feathers why you are a bit plumper in figure miss only the voice a little different perhaps the last words were uttered almost beneath her breath  my voice mrs bowater oh they cannot have altered that  indeed they have miss neatertwisted as you might say but not scarcely to be noticed by any but a very old friend maybe you are a little tired with your long drive and those two solemnities on the box i remember the same thingthe change of voicewhen fanny came back from her first term at miss stebbings  how is she i inquired in even tones she has never written to me not a word  but strange to say as mrs bowater explained and not without a symptom of triumph thats just what fanny had done her letter was awaiting me on the mantelpiece tucked in behind a plushframed photograph  now let me see she went on theres hot water in your basin missi heard the carriage on the hill a pair of slippers to ease your feet in case in the hurry of packing theyd been forgot and your strawberries and cream are out there icing themselves on the tray so we shant be no time though disturbing news has come from mr bowater his leg not mending as it might have been foreseenbut that can wait  an unfamiliar miss m brushed her hair in front of me in the familiar lookingglass it was not that her monnerie raiment was particularly flattering or she indeed pleasanter to look atrather the contrary and i gazed long and earnestly into the glass but art has furtive and bewitching fingers while in my homemade clothes i had looked just myself in these i looked like one or other of my guardian angels or perhaps as an unprejudiced fleming would have expressed itthe perfect lady how gradual must have been the change in me to have passed thus unnoticed but i didnt want to think i felt dulled and dispirited even mrs bowater had not been so entranced to see me as i had anticipated it was tiresome to be disappointed i rummaged in a bottom drawer got out an old gown made a grimace at myself in my mind and sat down to fannys letter but then again what are externals who was this cooltempered miss m who was now scanning the once heartrending handwriting        dear midgetinawhen this will reach you i dont know but      somehow i cannot or rather i can imagine you the cynosure of the      complete peerage and prefer that my poor little letter should not      uprear its modest head in the midst of all that granjer you may      not agreebut if a few weeks of a high life that may possibly      continue into infinity has made no difference to you then fanny      is not among the prophets       we have not met sincewe parted but did you ever know a dead      past bury itself with such ingratiating rapidity have you in your      sublime passion for nature ever watched a sexton beetle but mind      you i have helped the further all that slips away the less i can      see i was to blame for it whats in your blood needs little help      from outside cynical it may sound but imagine the situation if i      had married him what could existence have been but a      nightmarelifeindeath vide s t coleridge now the dream      continuesfor us both       oh yes i can see your little face needling up at this but you      must remember dear midgetina that you will never never be able      to see things in a truly human perspective few people of course      try to you do but though your view may be delicate as gossamer      and clear as a glass marble it cant be fullsize boil a thing      down it isnt the same what remains has the virtues of an      essence but not the volume of its origin this sounds horribly      schoolbooky but i am quite convinced you are too concentrated      and i being what i am only the full volume can be my salvation      enough the text is as good as the sermonfar better in fact       now i am going to be still more callous my own little private      worries have come rightbeen made to im tit for tat that is      and wiser for it beyond words some day when society has taught      you all its lessons i will explain further anyhow first i send      you back £3 of what i owe you and thank you next i want you to      find out from mrs mummery as mother calls heror did if among      her distinguished acquaintance she knows any one with one or two      or at most three small and adorable children who need an excellent      governess things have made it undesirable for me to stay on here      much longer it shall be i who give notice or shall we say      terminate the engagement       be an angel then first wake up candidly to think me better      than i am is more grossly unfair than if i thought you taller than      you are next sweet cynosure find me a sinecure dont trouble      about salary you wouldnt you positive acorn of quixoticism      not if i owed you half a million but remember wanted by the end      of august at latest a lady wealthy amiable with two cherubic      doves in family boys preferred the simple naked fact being that      after this last bout of lifes fitful fever i pine for a nap       of course mother can see this letter if she wishes to and you      dont mind but personally i should prefer to have the bird      actually fluttering in my hand before she contemplates it in the      bush       i said pine just now do you ever find a word suddenly so      crammed with meaning that at any moment it threatens to explode      well midgetina thems my sentiments penitent i shall never be      until i take the veil but i have once or twice lately awoke in a      kind of glassy darknessbeyond all moonshinealone then if i      hadnt been born just thickribbed unmeltable icewell      vulgar vulgar fanny       fare thee well midgetina one cried god bless us and amen      the other prostituted though he may have been for scholastic      purposes w s knew something of life       yoursf   what was the alluring and horrifying charm for me of fannys letters this one set my mind as always wandering off into a maze there was a sour taste in it and yetit was all really and truly fanny i could see her unhappy eyes glittering through the mask she saw herselfperhaps more plainly than one should vulgar fanny as for its effect on me it was as if i had fallen into a bed of nettles and she herself picking me up had scoffed poor little midgekin and supplied the dock her cynicism was its own antidote i suppose the selfishness the vanity and impenetrable hardnesseven love had never been so blind as to ignore all that and now what love remained for her had the sharpest of sharp eyes  and yet though my little bowater parlour looked cheap and dingy after the splendours of no 2 fanny somehow survived every odious comparison she was very intelligent i whispered to myself mrs monnerie would certainly approve of that and i prickled at the thought and ii was too concentrated in spite of my plumping figure i could never never be fullsize if only fanny had meant that as a compliment or even as a kind of explanation to go on with no she had meant it for the truth and it must be far easier for a leopard to change his spots than his inside the accusation set all the machinery of my mind emptily whirring  my glance fell on my paris frock left in a shimmering slovenly ring on the floor it wandered off to fannys postal order spread over my lap like an expensive antimacassar she had worked for that money while i had never been anything more useful than an angel in fancy i saw her blooming in a house as sumptuous as mrs monneries bloom indeed i hated the thought yet realized too that it was safereven if for the time being not so profitableto be lifesize and as if out of the listening air a cold dart pierced me through suppose my messrs harris and harris and harris might not be such honest trustees as miss fenne had vouched for suppose they decamped with my £110 per annumi caught a horrifying glimpse of the wolf that was always sniffing at fannys door  mrs bowater brought in my luncheon andas i insistedher own too the ice from mr tidy the fishmongers had given a slightly marine flavour to the cream and i had to keep my face averted as much as possible from the scorched red chop sprawling and oozing on her plate how could she bring herself to eat it we are such stuff as dreams are made on said hamlet so then was mrs bowater what a mystery then was this mutton fat but chop or no chop it was a happy meal  having waved my extremely fannyish letter at her i rapidly dammed that current of her thoughts by explaining that i had changed my clothes not as a gleam from her eye had seemed to suspect because i was afraid of spoiling my london finery but in order to be really at home for the first time i surprised her muttering a grace over the bone on her plate then she removed the tray accepted a strawberry folded her hands in her lap and we began to talk she asked a hundred and one questions concerning my health and happiness but never once mentioned mrs monnerie and at last after a small pause filled by us both with the same thought she remarked that that young mr anon was nothing if not persistent  since i had gone not a week had passed she told me but he had come rapping at the door after dusk to inquire after me though why he should scowl like a pitchpot to hear that you are enjoying the lap of luxury the angular shoulders achieved a shrug at least as parisian as my discarded gown  why doesnt he write to me then twice in ten weeks  well its six miss ive counted though seemingly sixty but that being the question he is there to answer it at any time this evening or at six tomorrow morning if london ways havent cured you of earlyrising  so we went off together mrs bowater and i in the cool of the evening about half an hour after sunsetshe alas a little ruffled because i had refused to change back again into my monnerie finery but mrs bowater imagine such a thing in a real wild garden i protested but without mollifying her and without further explaininghow could i do thatthat the gown which miss sentimentality or miss coquette was actually wearing was that in which she had first met mr anon     chapter thirtysix   i trod close in mrs bowaters track as she convoyed me through a sea of greenery breaking here and there to my waist and even above my hat summer had been busy in wanderslore honeysuckle and acidsweet brier were in bloom sleeping bindweed and pimpernel the air was liquidly sweet with uncountable odours and the fading skies dyed bright the frowning front of the house about which the newcome swifts shrieked in their play over my wilderness mr anon looked peculiar standing alone there  having bidden him a gracious goodevening mrs bowater after a long ruminating glance at us decided that she would take a stroll through the grounds we watched her black figure trail slowly away up the overgrown terraces towards the house then he turned his clear dwelling eyes with that darker line encircling the greyblack iris fixed themselves on me his mouth tightshut  well he said at last almost wearily it has been a long waiting  i was unprepared for this sighing it has indeed i replied but it is exceedingly pleasant to see beechwood hill again i wrote but you did not answer my letter at least not the last  my voice dropped away every one of the fine little speeches i had thought to make forgotten  and now you are here  yes i said quickly a little timid of any silence between us and thats pleasant too you can have no notion what a stiff glaring garden it is up theregeraniums and gravel you know and windows windows windows they are wonderfully kind to mebut i dont much love it  then why stay he smiled still you are at least safely out of her clutches  clutches i hated the way we were talking thank you very much you forget you are speaking of one of my friends besides i can take care of myself he made no answer  you are so gloomy i continued sooh i dont knowabout everything its because you are always cooped up in one place i suppose one must take the worlda littleas it is you know why dont you go away travel see things oh if i were a man  his eyes watched my lips everything seemed to have turned sour to have waited and dreamed to have actually changed my clothes and come scuttling out in a silly longing excitementfor this why i felt more lonely and helpless under wanderslores evening sky than ever i had been in my cedarwood privacy in no 2  i mean it i mean it i broke out suddenly you domineer over me you pamper me up with silly storiestrailing clouds of glory i suppose they are not true its every one for himself in this world i can tell you and in future please understand i intend to be my own mistress simply because in a little private difficulty i asked you to help me  he turned irresolutely they have dipped you pretty deep in the dyepot  and what may i ask do you mean by that  i mean and he faced me that i am precisely what your friend miss bowater called me what more is there to say  and pray am i responsible for everything my friends say and to have dragged up that wretched fiasco after we had talked it out to the very dregs oh how i have been longing and longing to come home and this is what you make of it  he turned his face towards the west and its vast light irradiated his sharpboned features the sloping forehead beneath the straight black hair fume as i might resentment fainted away in me  you dont seem to understand i went on its the wastethe waste of it all why do you make it so that i cant talk naturally to you as friends talk if i am alone in the world so are you surely we can tell the truth to one another i am utterly wretched  there is only one truth that matters you do not love me why should you but thats the barrier and the charm of it is that not only the gods but the miserable humans if only they knew it would enjoy the sport  love i detest the very sound of the word what has it ever meant to me i should like to know in thisthis cage  scarcely a streak of gilding on the bars he sneered miserably still we are sharing the same language now  the same language selfpitying tears pricked into my eyes i turned my head away and in the silence stealthily out of a dark woody hollow nearer the house as if at an incantation broke a low sinister protracted rattle like the croaking of a toad i knew that sound it came straight out of lyndseycalled me back  ssh i whispered caught up with delight a nightjar listen lets go and look  i held out my hand his sent a shiver down my spine it was clammy cold as if he had just come out of the sea thrusting our way between the denser clumps of weeds we pushed on cautiously until we actually stood under the creatures enormous oak so elusive and deceitful was the throbbing croon of sound that it was impossible to detect on which naked branch in the black leafiness the bird sat churring the wafted fragrances the placid dusky air and far far above the delicate shallowing deepening of the faintstarred bluehow i longed to sip but one drop of drowsy mandragora and forget this fretting inconstant self  we stood listening and an old story i had read somewhere floated back into memory once did you ever hear it i whispered close to him there was a ghost came to a house near cirencester i read of it in a book and when it was asked are you a good spirit or a bad it made no answer but vanished the book saidi remember the very wordswith a curious perfume and most melodious twang with a curious perfume i repeated and most melodious twang there now would you like me to go like that oh if i were a moth i would flit in there and ask that old deaththing to catch me even if i cannot love you you are part of all this you feed my very self maynt that be enough  his grip tightened round my fingers the entrancing toneless dulcimer thrummed on  i leaned nearer as if to raise the shadowed lids above the brooding eyes what can i give youonly to be your peace i do assure you it is yours but i havent the secret of knowing what half the world means look at me is it not all a mystery oh i know it even though they jeer and laugh at me i beseech you be merciful and keep me what i am  so i pleaded and argued scarcely heeding the words i said yet i realize now that it was only my mind that wrestled with him there it was what came after that took the heart out of me there came a clap of wings and the bird swooped out of its secrecy into the air above us a moment showed his whitesplashed cindercoloured feathers in the dusk seemed to tumble as if brokenwinged upon the air squawked and was gone the interruption only hastened me on  still still listen i implored if time would but cease a while and let me breathe  there there he muttered i was unkind a filthy jealousy  but think there may never come another hour like this know know now that you have made me happy i can never be so alone again i share my secretest thoughtsmy imagination with you isnt that a kind of love i assure you that it is once i heard my mother talking and sometimes i have wondered myself if i am quite likeoh you know what they say a freak of nature tell me if by some enchantment i were really and indeed come from those snow mountains of yours and that sea would you recognize me would you no no its only a storywhy even all this green and loveliness is only skin deep if the old world were just to shrug its shoulders mr anon we should all big and little be clean gone  my words seemed merely to be like drops of water dripping upon a sponge wake i tugged at his hand look kneeling down sidelong i stooped my cheek up at him from a cool green mat of grass amid which a glowworm burned is this aa strangers face  he came no nearer surveyed me with a long quiet smile of infinitely sorrowful indulgence a strangers how else could it be if i love you  intoxicated in that earthy fragrance washed about with the colours of the motionless flowers it seemed i was merely talking to some one who could assure me that i was still in life still myself a strand of my hair had fallen loose and smiling its gold pin between my lips i looped it back oh but you seehavent i told youi cant love you perhaps i dont know what shall i do what shall i say now suppose i went on i like myself that much and i held my thumb and finger just ajar then i like you think of you hope for you why thatand i swept my hand clean across the empty zenith now do you understand  oh my dear my dear he said and smiled into my eyes  i laughed out in triumph at the success of my device and he laughed too as if in a conspiracy with meand with misery i could see sitting like an old hag at the door from which the sound came and out of the distance the nightjar set again to its churring  then i have made you a littlea little less unhappy i asked him and hid my face in my hands in a desolate peace and solitude  he knelt beside me held out his hand as if to touch me withdrew it again all presence of him distanced and vanished away in that small darkness i prayed not to think any more not to be exiled again intohow can i explain my meaning except by sayingmyself would some further world have withdrawn its veils and have let me in then and for ever if that lightless quiet could have continued a little longer is it the experience of every human being seemingly to trespass at times so close upon the confines of existence as that  it was his own harsh voice that broke the spell  wake wake it called in my ear the woman is looking for you we must go  my hands slipped from my face a slow sobbing breath drew itself into my body and there beneath evenings vacancy of twilight showed the transfigured scene of the garden and near me the anxious suffering face of this stranger faintly greened by the light of the worm  wake he bade me rapping softly with his bony finger on my hand i stared at him out of a dream     chapter thirtyseven   time and circumstance have strangely divided me from the miss m of those days i look back on her not with shame but with a shrug of my shoulders a sort of incredulous tolerancealmost as if she too were a stranger perhaps a few years hence i shall be looking back with an equal detachment on the miss m seated here at this moment with her books and her pen in the solitude of her thoughts vainly endeavouring to fret out and spin together mere memories that nobody will ever have the patience to read shall i then be able to tell myself what i want now give words to the vague desires that still haunt me shall i still be waiting on for some unconceived eventuality  there is too another small riddle of a different kind which i cannot answer in memory and imagination as i steadily gaze out of this familiar room recalling the past i am that very self in that distant garden of wanderslore but even as i look i am not only within myself there but also outside of myself i seem i mean actually to be contemplating as if with my own eyes those two queer silent figures returning through the drowsying mothhaunted flowers and grasses to the black vigilant woman awaiting them beside the garden house alas you poor blind thing i seem like a ghost to warn the one small creature have a care seize your happiness it is vanishing  all that i write then is an attempt only to tell not to explain i realize that sometimes i was pretending things yet did not know that i was pretending that often i acted with no more conscience or consciousness maybe than has a carrion crow that picks out the eyes of a lamb or a flower that draws in its petals at noon yet i knowknow absolutely that i was and am responsible not only for myself but for everything for my whole world and i cannot explain this either at times as if to free myself i had to stare at what appalled me i am sure for instance that mrs monnerie never dreamed that her mention of mr crimble sent me off in fancy at the first opportunity to that woeful outhouse in his mothers garden to look in on him thereagain but i did so look at him and was a little more at peace with him after that why then cannot i be at peace with one who loved me  maybe if i could have foreseen how i was to come to wanderslore again i should have been a less selfish showy and capricious companion to him that june evening but i was soon lapped back into my life in london and thought only of mr anon as i am apt to think of god namely when i needed his presence and his help as a matter of fact i had small time to think even the doubts and misgivings that occasionally woke me in the night melted like dreams in the morning every morrow blotted out its yesterdayas faded flowers are flung away out of a vase  in that vortex of visits and visitors that endless vista of amusements and eating and drinkingsome hidden spring of life in me began to fail what a little selfconscious affected donkey i became shrilly heehawing away the centre of a simpering throng plying me with flattery what airs i put on  if this life of mine had been a biography the author of it would have had the satisfaction of copying out from a pygmy blue morocco diary the names of all the celebrated and distinguished people i met at no 2 a few of them underlined in red the amusing thing is that like my father i was still a radical at heart and preferred low lifefleabane and chickweedto the fine flowers of culture which only means of course that in this i am a snob inside out nevertheless the attention i had shunned i now began to covet and like a famous artist or dancer would go sulky to bed if i had been left to blush at being unseen i forced myself to be more and more fastidious and tried to admire as little as possible i would even imitate and affect languid pretentiousnesses and effronteries and learned to be downright rude to people in a cultivated way as for small talk i soon accumulated a repertory of that and could use the fashionable slang and current conversations like a native all this intensely amused mrs monnerie for of course the more like the general run of these high livers i was the more conspicuous i became  the truth is the lionesss head was in peril of being turned and like a blind kitten in a bucket of water i came very near to being drowned in the social creambowl for what little i gained in public by all this silly vanity i paid a heavy price when alone i began to be fretful and utterly useless to myselfjust lived on from excitement to excitement and fleming soon had better reasons for detesting me than merely because i was horribly undersized  perhaps i am exaggerating but the truth is i find it extremely difficult to keep patience with mrs monneries pampered protégée she was weak and stupid yet learning had not lost its charm my mind persisted in being hungry however much satiated were my senses and fine feelings i even infected susan with my enthusiasm for indigestible knowledge for since mrs monnerie had begun to find my passion for shells fossils flints butterflies and stuffed animals a little wearisome it was her niece who now accompanied me to my many meccas in her stead by a happy chance we often met on these pilgrimages the dark straightnosed young man whom i had looked down upon at my first ballet and who also apparently was a fanatic  however deeply engrossed in mementoes of the dark or stone ages he might be he never failed to see us the moment we entered his echoing gallery he would lift his eyebrows his monocle would drop out and he would come sauntering over to meet us looking as fresh as apples cold with dew i liked captain valentine so much so that i sent an almost rapturous description of him to mr anon  he did not seem in the least to mind being seen in my company we had our little private jokes together we both enjoyed the company of susan he was so crisp and easy and quickwitted and yetto my unpractised eyelooked delightfully domesticatable even the crustiest old caretaker at a word and a smile from captain valentine would allow me to seat myself on the glass cases so i could gloat on their contents at leisure and certainly of the three of us i was by far the most diligent student  long hours too of the none too many which will make up my life would melt away like snow in mrs monneries library a button specially fixed for me in the wainscot would summon a manservant having ranged round the lofty walls i would point up at what books i wanted they would be strewn around me on the floorgilded and leathery volumes some of them almost of my own height and many times my weight i would open the lid turn the great pages and carefully sprawling on my elbows between them would pore for hours together on their coloured pictures of birds and flowers gems and glass ruins palaces mountainshunting cockfighting fashions fine ladies and foreign marvels and i dipped into novels so like the unpleasanter parts of my own life that they might just as well have been autobiographies  the secret charm of all this was that i was alone and while i was reading i ceased to worry i just drugged my mind with books i would go rooting and rummaging in mrs monneries library like a little pig after truffles there was hardly a subject i left untastedold plays and street ballads johnsons enormous dictionary that extraordinary book on melancholy with its borage and hellebore and the hatted young man in love bel and the dragon the newgate calendar i even nibbled at debrettand clean through all its ms the more i read the more ignorant i seemed to become and quite apart from this smattering jumble of knowledge i pushed my way through memoirs and romances at the very sight of which my poor godmother would have fainted dead off  they may have been harmful but i certainly cant say that i regret having read themwhich may be part of the harm you could tell the really bad ones almost at a sniff they had bad smells like a beetle cupboard or a scented old man i read on of witchcraft and devils yet hated the cloud they cast over melike some horrible treacle in the mind but as for the authors who just reasoned about time and god and miracles and so on i poked about in them willingly enough but my imagination went off the other waywith my heart in its pocket possibly without knowing it but i do know this that never to my dying day shall i learn what a commonsized person with a pen or a pencil can not make shocking or be shocked at it seemed to me that to some of these authors the whole universe was nothing better than a squid and a very much scandalized young woman would attempt to replace their works on the shelves  when in good faith i occasionally ventured to share or possibly to show off some curious scrap of information with mrs monnerie i thought her eyes would goggle out of her head it was perhaps my old mole habit that prevented me from dividing things up into the mentionable and unmentionable possibly i carried this habit to excess and yet of course remained the slave of my own small pruderies still i dont think it was either mrs monneries or percys pruderies that i had to be careful about to make him laugh was one of the most hateful of my experiences at no 2  i have read somewhere that the human instincts are unlike apollyon since they always degrade themselves by their disguises they dress themselves up as apes and mandrils he as a ringed supple selfflattering seductive serpent possibly that has something to do with it or is it that my instincts are also on a petty scale i dont know i hate and fear pain even more than most people and have fought pretty hard in the cause of selfpreservation on the other hand i havent the faintest wish in the world to perpetuate my species not that i might not have been happy in a husband and in my children i suppose that kind of thing comes on one just as naturally as breathing nevertheless i suspect i was born to be an old maid calling up spirits from the vasty deep has always seemed to me to be a far more dreadful mystery than death it is not indeed the ghosts of the dead and the past which i think should oppress the people i see around me but those of the children to come i thank god from the bottom of my heart for the happiness and misery of having been alive but my small mind reels when i brood on what the gift of it implies  well well well of one burden at least i can absolve mrs monneriethat of making me so sententious somehow or other but ever more sluggishly those few crowded summer months of my twentieth year wore away it is more of a mercy than a curse i suppose that time never stands still  meanwhile two events occurred which for the time being sobered and alarmed me a few days before i had actually planned to pay a second visit to mrs bowaters the almost incredible news reached me that she was sailing for south america it would hardly have surprised me more to hear that she was sailing for sirius she came to bid me goodbye it was mr bowater she told me she had been too confident of the good nursing far from mending in this world his leg threatened to carry him off into the next at these tidings shame thrust out a very ugly head at me from her retreat i had utterly forgotten the anxiety my poor old friend was in  she put on her spectacles with trembling fingers and pushed her husbands letter across to me the handwriting was bold and thick yet i fancied it looked a little weak in the loops        dear emilythe legs giving me the devil in this hole of a      place it looks as if i shouldnt get through with it i should be      greatly obliged if you would come out to me theyll give you all      the necessary information at the shipping office ask for pullen      my love to fanny whats she looking like now i should like to see      her before i go but better say nothing about it youve got about      a month or three weeks i should think if that       i remain your affec husband       joseph bowater   easy enough in appearance was mrs bowaters comment as she folded up this stained and flimsy letter again and stuffed it into her purse but its past even mr bowater to control what can be read between the lines  she looked at me dumbly the skin seemed to hang more loosely on her face in vain i tried to think of a comforting speech the tune of eternal father one of the hymns we used to sing on windy winter sunday evenings together had begun droning in my head the thought too was worrying me though i did not put it into words that mr bowater far rather than in buenos ayres would have preferred to find his last restingplace in nero deep or the virgins troughthose enormous pits of blue in the oceans which i myself had so often gloated on in his atlas we were old friends now he and i he was fannys father the very ferocity of his look had become a secret understanding between us and nowat this very moment perhapshe was dying the jaunty devil in his letter i am afraid affected me far more than mrs bowaters troubled face or even her courage  without a moments hesitation she had made up her mind to face the atlantics thousands of miles of wind and water to join the husband she had told me had long been worse than dead the very tone in which she uttered the word steamer was even more lugubrious than the enormous mocking hoot of a vessel that had once alarmed me out of the sea one still evening at lyme regis it was a horrifying prospect yet she just quietly said steamer and looked at me over her spectacles  while she was away the little house on beechwood hill bought thank god with my own money was to be shut up but it was mine if i cared to return to it and would ask a neighbour of hers mrs chantry for the key it would be fannys if anything happened to herself so dismal was all this that mrs bowater seemed already lost to me and i twice an orphan we talked on together in low cautious voices after a single sharp cold glance at my visitor fleming had left us to ourselves over an enormous silver teapot i grew so nervous at last watching mrs bowaters slow glances of disapproval at her surroundings her hot tired face and listening to her long drawn sighs that again and again i lost the thread of what she was saying and could answer yes or no only by instinct  what with an antiquated timetable a mislaid railway ticket and an impudent busconductor her journey had been a trying experience i discovered too that mrs bowater disliked the west end she had first knocked at no 4 by mistake its butler had known nothing whatever at all about any miss m and mrs bowater had been too considerate to specify my dimensions she had then shared a few hot moments in the porch of no 2 with a more fashionable visitorto neithers satisfaction a manservant had admitted her to mrs monneries marble halls and barefaced statuary and had apparently thought the large parcel she carried in her arms should have been delivered in the area  she bore no resentment though i myself felt a little uneasy life was like that she seemed to imply and she had been no party to it there was no doubt a better world where things would be differentit was extraordinary what a number of conflicting sentiments she could convey in a pause or a shut of her mouth black and erect she sat glooming over that alien teapot sipping mrs monneries colourless china tea firmly declining to grimace at its insipidity until she had told me all there was to tell  at last having gathered herself together she exhorted me to write to that young mr anon i see a fidelity one might almost say doglike miss on that face apart as i have reasons for supposing from a sufficiency in his pocket though the lord knows you are young yet and seemingly in no need of a home  parcel reticule umbrellashe bent over me with closed eyes and muttered shamefacedly that she had remembered me in her will and may god bless you miss im sure  i clutched the gloved hand in a sudden helpless paroxysm of grief and foreboding oh mrs bowater you forgive i choked and still no words would come  she was gone past recall and all the love and gratitude and remorse i had longed to express flooded up in me yet stuck up there in my chair my chief apprehension had been that fleming might come in again and cast yet another veiled sneering glance at my visitor  peering between the gilded balusters i watched my old friend droop away stiffly down the mild lustrous staircase bow to the man who opened the door for her and emerge into the sunny emptiness  maybe the thought had drifted across her mind that i had indeed been dipped in the dyepot but nowthese many years afterwardsthere is no more risk of misunderstanding it is eight oclock the light is fading chizzel hill glows green i hear her feebling step on the stairs she will peer at me over spectacles that now always straddle her nose i must put my pen and papers away and i too have made my will     chapter thirtyeight   mrs bowaters departure from englandand it seemed as if its very map in my mind had become dismally emptywas not my only anxiety my solicitors had hitherto been prompt their remittances almost monotonously identical in amount but my quarterly allowance on midsummer day had been followed by a letter a week or two after her goodbye it seemed to be in excellent english and yet it was all but unintelligible to me every rereading of itthe paper had apparently been dipped in water and driedincreased its obscurity and my alarm i knew nothing about money matters and the encyclopædia i consulted only made me more dejected and confused i remembered with remorse my poor fathers last troubles to answer the harrises was impossible and further study of their letter soon became unnecessary for i had learned it by heart  the one thing certain was that fannys wolf had begun scratching at my door that my income was in imminent danger i had long since squandered the greater part of what remained out of my savings after fanny had helped herself on presents and fallals merely i am afraid to show mrs monnerie that i too could be extravagant how much i owed her i could not even conjecture and had not dared to inquire to ask her counsel was equally impossible she was almost as remote from me in this respect as mrs bowater now in the centre of the atlantic as for fanny i had returned her postal orders and had heard no more  for days and days gloom hung over me like a thundercloud wherever i went i was followed by the spectres of the harrises then for a time as do all things foreboding and anxiety gradually faded off i plunged back into the creambowl with the deliberate intention of drowning trouble  meanwhile i had not forgotten fannys sinecure one mackerelskied afternoon mrs monnerie and i and susan were returning across the park from an at hometo meet miss m a small child of the house had richly entertained the company by howling with terror at sight of me until he had been removed by his nurse i bear him no grudge he made a peg on which to hang fannys proposal  and what can miss bowater do what are her qualifications mrs monnerie inquired pleasantly  she isdark andpale i replied staring a little giddily out of the carriage at the sheep munching their way over the london grass  dark and pale mused mrs monnerie well that goes nearer the bone perhaps than medals and certificates and that sort of thing still a rather jane eyreish kind of governess eh susan  unfortunately i was acquainted with only one of the miss brontës and that not charlotte  miss bowater is immensely clever mrs monnerie i hurried on and extremely popular withwith the other mistresses and that sort of thing shes not a bit what you might guess from what you might suppose  which means i gather commented mrs monnerie affably that miss bowater is the typical landladys daughter a perfect angel inor out ofthe house eh miss innocent  no said i i dont think miss bowater is an angel she is so interesting so herselfish you know she simply couldnt be happy at miss stebbingssthe school where shes teaching now its not salary mrs monnerie she is thinking ofjust two nice children and their mother thats all  this vindication of fanny left me uncomfortably hot i continued to gaze fixedly into the green distances of the park  yet all was well mrs monnerie appeared to be satisfied with my testimonial you shall give me her address little binbin and well have a look at the young lady she decided  yet i was none too happy at my success those familiar old friends of minemotivesbegan worrying me would the change be really good for fanny would itand i had better confess that this troubled me the mostwould it be really good for me i wanted to help her i wanted also to show her off and what a joy it would be if she should change into the fanny of my dreams on the other hand supposing she didnt on the whole i rather dreaded the thought of her appearance at no 2   susan followed me into my room who is this miss bowater she inquired besides i mean being your landladys daughter and that kind of thing  but my further little confidences failed to satisfy her  but why is she so not an angel then clever and lovelyits a rather unusual combination you know and yetshe reflectively smiled at me all candour and gentlenesswell not unique  i ran away as fast as ever i could with so endearing a complimentand tossed it back again over my shoulder you dont mean susan that you are not clever  i do my dear indeed i do i am so stupid that unless things are as plain and open as the nose on my face i feel like suffocating im dreadfully out of the fashiona horrible discredit to my sex as for miss bowater i was merely being odious that was all to be quite honest and hatefuli didnt like the sound of her and aunt alice is so easily carried away by any new scent if a things a novelty or just good to look at or what they call a work of artwhy the hunts up there wouldnt have been any use for the serpent in her eden mere things of course dont matter much except that they rather lumber up ones rooms and i prefer not to live in a museum its when it comes to persons still it isnt as if miss bowater was coming here  i remained silent thinking this speech over had it i speculated come to being a person in my own case  did you meet any other interesting people there miss monnerie went on as if casually turning off and on the while the little cluster of coloured electric globes that was on my table i mean besides miss bowater and that poor dreadfulyou know  no i said bluntly not many  you dont mind my asking these questions and just in exchange you solemn thing ill tell you a secret it will be like shutting it up in the delightfullest delicatest little rosebud of a box in that instants pause it was as if a dream had passed swiftly entrancingly across the grave smiling face  look she said stooping low and laying her slim left hand palm downwards across my table i did look and the first thing i noticed was how like herself that hand was and how much less vigorous and formidable than fannys and then i caught her meaning  oh susan i cried in a woeful voice gazing at the smouldering stones ringing that long slim third finger wherever i turn i hear that  hear what  why of love i mean  but why why the narrow brows lifted in faint distress i am going to be ever so happy  ah yes i know i know but why cant you be happy alone  she looked at me and a faint red dusked the delicate cheek not so happy not me i mean  you do love him then the words jerked out  why you strange thing how curiously you speak to me of course i love him i am going to marry him  but how do you know i persisted does it mean more to youwellthan the secret of everything i mean what comes when one is almost nothing does it make you more yourself or just break you in two or melt you awayoh like a mist that is gone and to every petal and blade of grass its drop of burning water  a shade of dismay almost of fearthe look a timid animal gives when startledstole into her eyes you ask such odd questions how can i answer them i know thisi would rather die than not is that what you mean  oh my voice fainted awaydisappointment darkness ennui only that  but what do you mean what are you saying have you been told all this it disturbs me your face is like  yes what is it like i cried in distress myself sinking back into myself as if hiding in a lair  i cant say she faltered i didnt know  we talked on but though i tried to blur over and withdraw what i had said she remained dissatisfied a thin edge of formality had for the moment pushed in between us  that night i addressed a belated letter to wanderslore reproaching mr anon for not writing to me telling him of mrs bowaters voyage and begging him to assure the gardenhouse and the fading summer flowers that they had not been deserted in my dreams   at a quarter to twelve one morning soon after this i was sitting with mrs monnerie on a stool beneath chakkas cage and susan was just about to leave uswas actually smoothing on the thumb of her glove when marvell announced that a miss bowater had called i turned cold all over and held my breath  ah whispered mrs monnerie your future mrs rochester my pet  every thought scuttled out of my head my needle jerked and pricked my thumb i gazed at the door never had i seen anything so untransparent then it opened andthere was fanny she was in dark graya gown i had never seen before a tight little hat was set demurely on her hair in that first moment she had not noticed me and i could steal a long steady look at the still light vigilant eyes drinking in at one steady draught their new surroundings her features wore the thinnest unfamiliar mask like a flower seen in an artificial light what wonder i had loved her my hands went numb and a sudden fatigue came over me  then her quiet travelling glance descended and hovered in secret colloquy with mine she dropped me a little smiling formal nod moistened her lips and composed herself for mrs monnerie and it was then i became conscious that susan had quietly slipped out of the room  it was a peculiar experience to listen to the catechism that followed from the absorption of her attitude the large sidelong head the motionless hands it was clear that mrs monnerie found a good deal to interest her in the dark attentive figure that stood before her if fanny had been joan of arc she could not have had a more singleminded reception yet i was enjoying a duel a duel not of wits but of intuitions between the sagacious sardonic watchful old lady soaked in knowledge of humanity but as far as i could discover with extraordinarily small respect for it andfanny and it seemed to me that fanny easily held her own just by being herself without revealing herself face figure voice that was all i could not take my eyes away if only i thought my own ghost would keep as quiet and hidden as that in the presence of others  perhaps i exaggerate love living or dying even if it is not blind cannot i suppose focus objects very precisely it sees only itself or disillusionment whether or not the duel was interrupted in the full light of the window fanny turned softly at the opening of the door marvell was announcing another caller at his name my heart leapt up like william wordsworths at the rainbow it was sir walter pollacke  this is your visitor poppet mrs monnerie waggishly assured me you shall have half an hours têteàtête     chapter thirtynine   so it was with a deep sighhalf of regret at being called away and all of joy at the thought of seeing my old friend againthat i followed marvells coattails over the threshold with a silly animallike affection i brushed purposely against fannys skirts as i passed her by and even smirked in a kind of secret triumph at percy maudlen who happened to be idling on the staircase as i hastened from room to room  the door of the library closed gently behind me as if with a breath of peace i pausedlooked across sir walter was standing at the further end of its high daylit solemn spaciousness he was deep in contemplation of a white marble bust that graced the lofty chimneypieceso rapt indeed that until i had walked up into the full stream of sunshine from a nearer window and had announced my approach with a cough he did not notice my entrance then he flicked round with an exclamation of welcome  my dear dear young lady he cried beaming down on me from between his peaked collartips over his little black bow the gold rim of his large eyeglasses pressed to his lip a farfar more refreshing sight would you believe it it was the pleasing little hobby of that oiled and curled monstrosity up thereheliogabalusto smother his guests in rosesliterally smother them now and he looked at me quizzically as if through a microscope the one question is how have you survived what i imagine must have been a similar ordeal not quite at the last gasp i hope comparatively happy its all we can hope for my dear in this world  i nodded hungrily viewing him meeting as best i could the bright blue eyes and realizing all in a moment the dark inward of my mind  those other eyes began thinking as well as looking well well thats right and now we must have a little quiet talk before his eminence reappears so our old friend mrs bowater has gone husbandhunting gallant soul she came to see me  squatted up on a crimson leather stool i must have looked the picture of astonishment  yes he assured me there are divinities that shape our ends and mrs bowater is one of them if anything can hasten her husbands recovery but never mind that she has left me in charge and here i am the question is can we have too many trustees guardians perhaps not look at the kohinoor now  i much preferred to continue to look at sir walter even though from the moment i had entered the room at least five or six voices had begun arguing in my mind and here as if positively in answer to them was his very wordtrustee i pounced on it like a wasp on a plum it was a piece of temerity that saved me fromwell as i sit thinking things over in quiet and leisure in my old stonecote the house of my childhood i dont know what it hasnt saved me from  too many trustees sir walter i breathed i suppose notif they are honest  but bless me my dear young lady his face seemed to be shining like the suns in mist whose heresies are these have they given you a french maid  fleming oh no i replied laughing out shes a woman of kent all but what i was really thinking is that i would if i mayand please forgive mevery much like to show you a letter i simply cant make head or tail of it but its dreadfullysuggestive  my dear i came in certain hope of being shown nothing less vital than your heart he retorted gallantly  so off i wentwith my visitor all encouraging smiles as he opened the door for meto fetch my lawyers bombshell  glasses on tip of his small hawklike nose sir walters glittering eyes seemed to master this obscure document at one swoop  hm he said cautiously and once more communed with the bust of heliogabalus now what did you think of it all was it worth six and eightpence do you think  i couldnt think it frightened me the shares you know whose shares of what im terribly terribly ignorant  ah he echoed the sharesas the blackbird said to the cherry tree and there was nobody you thought to discuss the letter with you didnt answer it  nobody said i with a shake of my head and smoothing my silk skirts over my knees  why of course not he sparkled you see how admirably things work out miss fenne mr pellew mrs bowater my wife tom o bedlam hypnos mrs monnerie mr bowater mrs bowater the harrises me pon my word youd think it was a plot now supposing i keep this lettercould you trust it with me for a whileand supposing i see these gentlemen and make a few inquiries and that in the meantimewewe bottle the cherries but first i must have a little more information your father my dear lets just unbosom ourselves of all this horrible old moneygrubbing and see exactly how we stand  i needed no second invitation and poured out helterskelter all how very little in my girlish folly that i knew about my fathers affairs and of how i had been left  and miss fenne now he peered out as if at my godmother herself why didnt she send word to france where is this providential stepgrandfather monsieur pierre de ronvel all this time not dead too  shamefully i had to confess that i did not know had not even inquired it is my miserable ingratitude i just blow hot and cold that is my nature  well well it may be so he smiled at me as if out of the distance with the serenest kindliness but you and i are going to share the temperate zonea cool steady trade wind  if only i smiled taking him up on this familiar ground if only i could keep clear of the tropicsand that sargasso sea  at this little sally he gleamed at me as goldenly as the spade guinea that dangled on his waistcoat then he rose and surveyed one by one a row of silent sumptuous tomes in their glazed retreat the sargasso sea hm hm hm and one might suppose he cast a comprehensive glance at the taciturn shelves around and above us one might suppose the tuppenny box would afford some of these a more sociable haven  but this was greek to me mrs monnerie is generous he went on indulgent groundsel seed sugar and a fleming yet perhaps the door might be pushed just an inch or two farther open eh what im meaning my dear is will you perhaps wait in patience a little and if anything should go amiss will you make me a promise to send just a wisp of a word and a penny stamp to an old friend who will be doing his best the first lawyer you know was a waif that was adopted by a tortoise and a fox now im going to be a molewith its fur on the bias as miss rossetti happened to noticeand burrow so you see all will come well  i must have been sitting very straight and awkward on my stool and not heeding what my face was telling  is there anything else distressing you my dear he asked anxiously almost timidly  only myself i muttered there doesnt seem to be any end to it all i grope on and on andthe kindness only makes it worse can there be a riddle sir walter that hasnt any answer i remember reading in a book that was given me that man comes into the world like morning mushrooms dont you think thats true even i mean ofeverybody   but his views on this subject were not to be shared with me for many a long day our halfhour was over and there stood mrs monnerie mushroomshaped it is true but suggesting nothing of the evanescent as she looked in on us from the mahogany doorway  how dye do sir walter she greeted him if it hadnt been for an exceedingly interesting young creature disguised i understand as a miss bowater i should have had the happiness of seeing you earlier and how is our peri looking do you think  how is our peri looking he repeated musingly poising himself and eyeing me on his flat gleaming boots why mrs monnerie as i suppose a peri should be lookinginto paradise  then my peri said mrs monnerie blandly ask sir walter to be a complete angel and stay to luncheon  mrs monnerie i remember was in an unusually vivacious humour at that meal and devoured immense quantities of salmon mayonnaise one might have supposed that fannys influence had added a slim crescent of silvery light to her habitual earthshine none the less when our guest was gone she seemed to subside into a shallow dejection and i into a much deeper we sate on together in an uneasy silence she pushing out her lips restlessly prodding cherry with her foot and occasionally uttering some inarticulate sound that was certainly not intended as conversation  i think mrs monnerie was in secret a more remarkable woman than she affected to be however thronged a room might be you could never be unaware that she was in it and in the gentle syllabub of polite conversation her silence was like that of an ancient rock with the whispering of the wavelets on the sands at its base i remember once seeing a comic picture of an old lady with a large feather in her bonnet placidly sitting on a campstool beneath a pollard willow on one side of a stream while a furious frothing bull stood snorting and rampaging on the other i think the old lady in the picture was meant to be britannia but whoever or whatever the bull might represent mrs monnerie reminded me of her she sat more heavily more passively in her chair than any one i have ever seen  of coursequite apart from intelligencethere must be many many layers in society and i cannot say at all how far mrs monnerie was from the topmost but i am sure she was able to look down on a good many of them while i was born always to be looking up i was looking up at mrs monnerie now from my stool widespread in her chair she had closed her eyes and to judge from her face she was dreaming it looked more faded than usual the puckers gave it a prunish look queer contorting expressions were floating across her features her soul seemed gently to rock in them like an empty boat at night on a dark river in the pride of my youthand a little uneasy over my confidences with sir walteri examined my patroness with a slight stirring of dismay  oh no no never to grow old not me a voice was saying in me yet after all i reminded myself i was looking only at mrs monneries outer case but then after all was it only that the resurrection of the body one may see day at a little hole says an old proverbi hope a kentish proverb and from mrs monnerie my thoughts drifted away to fanny she would grow old too should we know one another then should we understand and remember what it was to be young we had had our secrets  i came out of these reflections to find mrs monneries sleepy eyes fixed full upon me and herself marvellously cheered up by her nap she had thought very well of miss bowater she told me so well that she not only very soon found her a charming engagement as a morning governess to the two little girls of a rich fashionable widowjust fannys sinecurebut invited her to stay at no 2 as a companion to herself until a more permanent post offered itself  you and i want more company she assured me otherwise the flint will use up all the tinder or vice versa my dear a pretty creature and no fool she sings a little too she tells me so we shall have music wherever she goes  that afternoon both flint and tinderwhichever of us was whichwere kept very busy mrs monnerie fell into one of her long monologues broken only by chakkas griding on his bars and cherrys whimpering in his dreams it was another kind of white meat for me and though no doubt i was incapable of digesting all mrs monneries views on life society and the world at large i realized that if in the course of time it might be my fate to wither and wizen away i should still have my own company and plenty of internal entertainment i actually saw myself a little bentup old midget woman creeping down some stone steps out of a porch with a fanlight under a street lamp it curdled my blood that picture and yet i thought what must be must be i will endure to be a little bentup old midget woman creeping down stone steps out of a porch with a fanlight and i even nodded up at the street lamp  in response to a highspirited scrawl from fanny i sent her all that was left of my savings to purchase those horrible little etceteras that just feather down the scales midgetina it would be saintlike of you and you wont miss it there it was a desperate wrench to me to see the last of my money disappear i knew no more than the man in the moon where the next was to come from  i counted the days to fannys coming and dressed myself for the occasion in the most expensive gold and blue afternoon gown i possessed it must have been with a queer mixed motive in my head i sat waiting for her while beyond the gloomhung window raged a london thunderstorm with dense torrents of rain my little silver clock struck three and she entered my room like a black swan tossing from her small velveted head as she did so a few beads of rain from top to toe in deadest black she must have noticed my glance of wonderment  when you want to make a favourable impression on your social superiors midgetina the meeker you look the better she said  but this was not the only reason for her black only a day or two before she told me a letter had come from her mother my father is dead the words dropped out as if they were quite accustomed to one anothers company but those which followedbloodpoisoning mortification hung up in my mindin that interminable gallerya hideous picture i could only sit and stare at the motionless figure outlined against the sepulchral window  it is awful awful fanny i managed to whisper at last it never stops one after another they all go think how he must have longed to be home and now to be buriedout therenothing but strangers  a vacancy came over my mind in which i seemed to see the dead mr bowater of my photograph rising like lazarus in his gravecloths out of his foreign tomb and looking incredulously around him  and your mother fanny out there toothose miles and miles of sea away  fanny made no movement though i fancied that her eyes wandered uneasily towards the door i quite agree midgetina its awful she said but really and truly its worse for me i think i am like my father in some ways mother never really understood him you cant talk a man different and for that matter holding your tongue at him is not much good either you must just lie in wait for him withwell with your charms i suppose  the word sounded like a sneer still i dont mean to say that it was all pure filial bliss for me when he was at home until at least i grew up then he and i quarrelled too but thats pleasure itself by comparison with listening to other people at it he did his best to spoil me i suppose he wanted to make a lady of me she turned and smiled out of the window her underlip quivering and casting a faint shadow on the smooth skin beneath so here i am though i fear you cant make ladies of quite the correct consistency out of dressmakers clothes and a smatter of latin the salt will out but there she flung a little gesture with her glove as i say here i am  and as if for welcome a gleam of lightning danced at the window illumining us there and a crackling peal of thunder rolled hollowly off over the rooftops of the square we listened until the sound had emptied itself into quiet and only the rain in the gutters gurgled and babbled  do you know she went on with a faraway challenging thrill in her low mournful voice i dont think i have a solitary relation left in the world nowexcept mother they are all gone into a world of lightthough ive now and then suspected that a few of the disreputable ones have been buried alive theres nothing very dreadful in that life consists of course in shedding various kinds of skinand tanning the remainder  fanny then was unaware that mrs bowater was not her real mother and i think she never guessed it  nor have i i said not one as i looked at it there it seemed a fact more curious than tragic besides in the brooding darkness of that room it was fanny and i who were strange external beings not the memoried phantoms of my mother and father we had still to go on to live things out so you see fanny i continued after a pause i do know what it meansa little and we must try more than ever to be really one anothers friend mustnt we i mean if you think i can be  why i owe you pounds and pounds cried fanny gaily pushing back her handkerchief into her bodice here we arenot quite in the same box perhaps still strangers and pilgrims of course we must help one another just think of this house the servants the folly of it and all for madame monneriethough i wouldnt mind being in her shoes even for one season socialism my dear is all a question of shoes and this is poppetkins little boudoir a pygmy palace my dear and if only the lightning would last a little longer i might get a real glimpse of that elfin little exquisite over there in her beautiful blue brocade but then it will be roses all the way with you miss m you are independent and valued for yourself alone  how different people are fanny you always think first of the use of a thing and i stupidly just of ititself  do we she said indifferently and rose from her chair anyhow im here to be of use and who she remarked with a little yawn as she came to a pause again beside the streaming window who was that prim colourless girl with the pale blue eyes engaged to be married  but fanny she had her gloves on that morning i remember it as clearly asas i always remember everything where you are how could you possibly tell that susan monnerie was engaged  it was quite a simple problem fanny tranquilly assured me the ring bulged under the suède  her scornfulness piqued me a little anyhow i retorted susans eyes are not pale blue they are almost cornflowerchicory colour like the root of a candleflame  please midgetina fanny begged me dont let me canker your new adoration perhaps you preened your pretty feathers in them when they were fixed on the demigod susan i thought all the susans perished in the sixties or had fled down the area and who is he but she did not follow up her question all things come to him who waits she had rambled on inconsequently if he waits long enough and no doubt god would temper the wind to the shorn orphan even if she did look a perfect frump in mourning  you know you could never look a frump i replied indignantly even if you hadnt a rag on  fanny shrugged her dainty shoulders alas she said  but her orphan had brought me back with a guilty shock to what no doubt was an extremely fantastic panorama of buenos ayres and that swiftly back again to mr crimble for an instant or two i looked away perhaps it was my caution that betrayed me  its no use midgetina she sang across at me from her window whether its because the chemical reactions of your pat little brain are more intense than ordinary peoples or because you and i are en rapport i cant say but theres one thing we must agree upon at once never never again to mention his nameat least in this house the crimble chapter is closed  closed indeed but so sharp were her tones i hadnt the courage to warn her that even susan had read most of it fanny came near and stooping as susan had stooped began fidgeting with the button of my electric chandelier the little lamps shone wanly in our faces in the clouddarkened room  you see my dear she said playfully you think me all mockery and heartlessness and no doubt you are right but i want ease and security just like thatas if i were writing an essayease and security i dont care a dash about affectionat least without the aforesaid e and s i intend to please mrs monnerie and she is going to be grateful to me dont think i am being candid i should have no objection to saying just the same thing to mrs monnerie herself shed enjoy it wait you precious inchy imagewait until you need a sup of fatted calfsfoot jelly not because you are sick of husks but because you are deadly poor then you will understand these sumptuosities wait till they havent a hapenny in their pockets real or moral for their next meal they only look at thingsif that they cant know what they are even to be decently charitable one must have been a beggarand cursed the philanthropists oh i know and fannys race is for success  but surely fanny a thing is its looks if only you look long enough and i should just like to hear you talking if you were in my place besides what is the use of successin the end i mean you should see some of the actresses and singers and authors and that kind of thing mrs monnerie knows you wouldnt have realized the actresses were even beautiful unless you had been told so why you couldnt even say the world is a success except in the country what is truly the use of it then i had grown so eager in my argument that i had got up from my chair  the use you poor thing laughed fanny why only as a kind of facecream to ones natural pride  the day was lightening now but at that the whole darkness of my own situation drew close about me success indeed what was i nothing but a halfpennyless tame pet in no 2 what salve could restore to me my natural pride     chapter forty   in happier circumstances the next mornings post might have reassured me two letters straddled my breakfast tray for i always had this meal in my own room one of them was from wanderslorea long crooked roundabout letter that seemed to taunt upbraid and entreat me turn and turn about it ended with a proposal of marriage  in most of the novels i have read the heroine simply basks in such a proposal even though scarcely her fingertips are warmed by its rays for my part this letter far from making me happy or even complacent produced nothing but a feeling of fretfulness and shame thrusting it back into its envelope i listened a while as if an eavesdropper might have overheard my silent reading of itas if i must hide then with eyes fixed on my small coffeepot i sank into a low empty reverie  the world had not been so tender to my feelings as to refrain from introducing me to general tom thumb and miss mercy lavinia bump warren  a pair of them how quaint how romantic how touching i saw myselfgossamer veil dwarfed orangeblossom and gypsophila bouquet all complete perhaps mr pellewperhaps even miss fennes bishop would officiate possibly percy would be persuaded to give me away and what a gay little sniggling note in the morning post  i came out of these sardonic thoughts with cold hands and a sneer on my lips and the thought that i had seen quite as conspicuously paired human mates even though their size was beyond reproach thank goodness when i read my letter again slightly better feelings prevailed after all the merest cinder of love would have made my darkness light i shouldnt have cared for a thousand touchings then i was still myself a lightheaded lighthearted young woman for all my troubles and follies if i had loved him the rest of the worldmuch truer and sweeter within than it looks from withoutwould have vanished like a puff of smoke but not even loves ashes were in my heart except perhaps those in which fanny had scrawled her name  i beat about bruising wings and breast hating life hating the friend who had suddenly slammedto another door in my gilded cage you can never never go back to wanderslore now muttered my romantic heart friends we could have remainedonly the closer for adversity now all that was over and two human beings who might have been a refuge and reconciliation to one another amusedas well as amusingobservers of the world at large had been by this one piece of foolish excess divided for ever i simply couldnt bear to look ridiculous in my own eyes  my other letter was from sir w p he had seen the harrises those foxy tortoises had advanced a ridiculous £1 19s 7d of my september allowancethe price of a pair of monnerie bedroom slippers it was enclosedand sir walter begged me not to worry might he be my bank would i be so kind as to break it as soon as ever i wished meanwhile he would be making further inquires into my affairs  perhaps because sir w p was a business man he was less persuasive with his pen than with his tongue i thought he was merely humouring me fell into a violent rage and tore up not only his letter butnoodle that i wasthe harris order toointo the tiniest pieces and heaped them up like a soufflé on my tray mr anons i locked up in my old moneybox with the nightgown and the miss austen both letters wore like acid into my mind from that day onexcept for a few halfstifled or excited hoursthey were never out of remembrance   even the most valuable and expensive pet may become a vexation if it is continually showing illtemper and fractiousness mrs monnerie merely puckered her lips or shrugged her shoulders at my outbursts of vanity and insolence but drops of water will wear away a stone from being court favourite i gradually sank to being court fool in sheer ennui and desperation i waggled my bells and brandished my bladder a cat may look at a queen but it should i am sure make faces only at her ladiesinwaiting  fanny inherited yet another sinecure and it was not envy on my side that helped her to shine in it though i had my fits of jealousy she was determined to please and when fanny made up her mind circumstances seemed just to fawn at her feet life became a continuous game of chess the moves of which at times kept me awake and brooding in a far from wholesome fashion in my bed pawn of pawns and one at the point of being sacrificed i could only squint at the board indeed i deliberately shut my eyes to my own insignificance strutted about sulked sharpened my tongue like a serpent and became a perfect pest to myself when alone yet i knew in my heart that those whom i hoped to wound merely laughed at me behind my back that i was once more proving to the world that the smaller one is the greater is ones vanity  in the midst of this nightmare by a curious coincidence rose like a jackinthebox from out of my past the queerest of phantomsand proved himself real  i was sullenly stewing in my thoughts in the library one morning over a book which to this day i never weary of reading gilbert whites natural history of selborne it was the nearest i could get to the country the whim took me to try and become a little better acquainted with william markwick esq fls who had himself seen the sphinx stellatarum inserting its proboscis into the nectary of a flower while keeping constantly on the wing there seemed to be something in common just then between myself and the sphinx  i pressed my wainscot bell after an unusual delay in a drastically regulated household the door behind me gently opened i began simpering directions over my shoulder in the percy way with servantsand presently realized that all was not quite as it should be i turned to look and saw thrust in at the doorway an apparently bodiless protuberant head with black buttony eyes on either side a long long nose then the remainder of this figure squeezed reluctantly in it was adam waggett  guy fawkes himself caught lantern in hand among his powder barrels must have looked like adam waggett at this moment for a while i could only return his stare from the midst of a vortex of memories when at last i found my tongue and inquired peremptorily how he came there and what he was doing in the house he broke into a long gurgling strangulated guffaw of laughter i was already in a sour temperin spite of the sweetness of selborne as a boy he had been my acute aversion and here he was a grown man and as doltish and ludicrous as when he had roared at me in the moonlight from outside the kitchen window at stonecote his stupidity and disrespect made me almost inarticulate with rage  maybe the foolish creature feeling as strange as a cat in a new house was only expressing his joy and affection at sight of a familiar face but i had no time to consider motives in a fever of apprehension that his noise might be overheard my one thought now was to bring him to his senses i shook my fists at him and stamped my foot on the turkey carpetas if in snow he watched me in a stupefaction of admiration but at length his face solemnified and he realized that my angry gestures were not intended for his amusement  his mouth stood open he shook his head and unless my eyes deceived me set back his immense ears  beg pardon miss im sure he stuttered it was the schock and you inside the book there and the old times like and even though they was telling me that there was such asuch a young lady in the house but i wont utter a word miss not me only he stared round at the closed door and lowered his voice to an even huskier whisper except to tell you that pollies doing very nicely and whenever i sees herwell miss that thunderstorm and the old cow  at this his features gathered together for another outburst which i succeeded in stifling only by warning him that so long as he remained at mrs monneries he must completely forget the old cow and the thunderstorm and never address me in company or even glance in my direction if we happened to be together in the same room  mrs monnerie would be extremely angry adam to hear you laughing in the library and i am anxious that you should be a credit to lyndsey in your new situation  but you rang missat least the library did he replied now thoroughly contrite and mr marvell said you go along there waggett second door right first staircase so i come  yes i said but it was a mistake a mistake you understand now go away and remember  a few minutes afterwards marvell himself discreetly entered the room merely as it would appear to adjust the angles of a copy of the spectator that lay on the table  its very close this morning i remarked with as much dignity as i could muster  it is indeed miss said marvell stooping sedately to examine my bellpush he rose and brushed his fingers  they say miss the electricity gets into the wires when thunders in the air a wonderful invention but not as i am told entirely independent of changes in the weather i hope miss you havent been disturbed   when susan even paler and quieter than usual presently looked into the library she found its occupant still on the floor and brooding over the browns and greys the roses and ochres of a complete congregation of sphingidæ she stooped over me sprawling in so ungainly a fashion across my book  moths this morning what a very learned person you will become her voice was a little flat yet tender but i was still in the sulks and made no answer  i suppose she began again as if listlessly and straying over to the window i suppose it is very pleasant for you seeing so much of your friend miss bowater  caution whispered a warning and i tried to wriggle out of an answer by remarking that fannys mother was the kindest woman in the whole world  where is she now  in buenos ayres  really how curious family traits are the very moment i saw miss bowater i was quite certain that she was intended for an adventurous life and didnt you say that her father was an officer in the merchant service what is he like  mr bowater he diedout there only a week or two ago  how very very sad breathed susan and for miss bowater i never even guessed from her manner that she was in trouble of that kind and that i suppose shows a sort of courage you were perfectly right she is lovely and clever the face a little hard dont you think but very clever she seems to be prepared for what aunt alice is going to say long before she says it and i you know sometimes dont notice even the sting tilltill the buzzing is over she paused and you were able to make a real friend of her  susan had not the patience to wait until i could sort out an answer to this question i dont want to be intrusive she went on hurriedly toto ask horrid questions but is it true you dear thing that you may some day be leaving us  leaving you i echoed my thoughts crouching together like chicks under a hen  the reply came softly and reluctantly in that great cistern of air  why i understoodto be married  i leant heavily on my hands seeing not the plumes and colours of the sphinxes that swam up at me from the page but as if in a mist between them and me the softly smiling face of fanny at last i managed to overcome the slight physical sickness that had swept over me susan i said if a friend betrayed the very soul out of your body what would you do where would you go  betray i my dear and she broke into a confused explanation  it was a remark of percys she had been referring to a silly trivial remark not she was sure intended maliciously why every one teased every one didnt she know it and especially about the things that were most personal and well sacred it was nothing just that and she should not have repeated it  tell me exactly please said i  well aunt alice was talking of marriage and miss bowater smiled and aunt aliceyou know her mocking wayasked how at her agemiss bowatersshe had learned to look at the same time both charming and cynical dont forget my dear they were her very words that the cynicism wears the longer but miss bowater laughed and changed the subject by asking if she could do anything for your headache it was the afternoon you remember when you were lying down that was all  and mr maudlen  the fair cheek reddened oh percy made a jokeabout you just one of his usual horrid jokes my dearshe came and knelt down beside me and laid her gentle hand on my shoulder dont look soso awful its only how things go  i drew the hand down it smelled as fresh and sweet as jessamine  dont bother about me susan i said coldly just leave me to my moths i could show you scorpions and hornets ten times more dangerous than a mere deaths head you dont suppose i care why as you say even god has his little joke with some of us im quite used to it  dont dont she implored me you are overtired you poor little thing you go on reading and reading why your teeth are chattering  a faint brazen reverberation from out of the distance increased in intensity and died away it was adam performing on the gong susan had tried to be kind to me to treat me as if i were a normal fellowbeing i pressed the cool fingers to my lips  there susan i said with cheerful mockery except for my father and mother i do believe you are the first lifesize or anysize person i have ever kissed a midgets gratitude  ever so slightly the fingers constricted beneath my touch no doubt there was a sensation of the spidery in my embrace     chapter fortyone   but a devil of defiance had entered into me with a face as snakily sweet as i could make it i made my daintiest bow to mrs monneries gueststo lord chiltern a tall stiffish man who blinked at our introduction almost as solemnly and distastefully as had mrs bowaters henry and to lady diana templeton a glance at this lady reminded me spitefully of an old suspicion of mine that mrs monnerie usually invited her duller friends to luncheon and the clever to dinner not that she failed to enjoy the dull ones but it was in a different way  a long gilded queen anne mirror hung opposite my high chair so that whenever i glanced across i caught sight not only of myself with cheeks like carnations above my puffed blue gown but also of adam waggett ever and again his red hand was thrust over my shoulderthe hand that had held the wren and i was so sick at hearton yet another wrens behalfthat i could hardly repress a shudder poor adam whenever i think of him it is of a good yet weak and silly man he has found his eden so i have heard in new zealand now and i hope he has forgiven my little share in his life  throughout that dull luncheon my tongue went mincing on and onin sheer desperation lest any one should detect the state of mind i was in with pale eyes percy sniggered over his soup susan was silent and selfconscious captain valentine frowned and nibbled his small moustache lady diana templeton smiled like a mauvepink snapdragon and mrs monnerie led me on it was my last little success luncheon over i was helped down from my chair and allowed to run away  what was it lord chiltern was saying i paused on the threshold an exquisite little performance but isnt it a little selfish to hide her light under your admirable bushel mrs monnerie the stage now  the stage exclaimed mrs monnerie in consternation the childs as proud as lucifer she would faint at the very suggestion you have heard her deliciously sharp little tongue but her tantrums still shes a friendly and docile little creature and i am very well satisfied with her  and not merely that paced on the rather official voice i was noticing that something in the eyes almost disconcertingly absent yet penetrating she thinks she comes and goes in them i noticed the same peculiarity in poor willie arbuthnots and this little creature is scarcely more than a child  i think it is perfectly sad lord chiltern broke in a reedy vibrating voice in some circumstances it would be tragic its a mercy she does not realize  habit you know  listeners seldom hear such good things of themselves why then was it so furious an eavesdropper that hastened away with a face and gesture worthy of a sarah siddons  no my box remained locked yet thought i as i examined its contents any dexterous finger could have opened that tiny lockwith a hairpin and how else could my secret have been discovered fleming or fannyor both of them it maddened me to think of them in collusion i would take no more risks i tore mr anons letter into fragments and these again into bits yet smaller until they were almost like chaff these i collected together and put into an envelope which i addressed in sprawling capitals to miss fanny bowater at no 2  then for a sombre halfhour i communed intensely at the window with my tank it was hot and taciturn companynot a breath of air stirred my silk windowblindyet it managed to convey a few home truths and even to increase the light a little in which i could look at the bushel there were mercies i suppose out of the distance rolled the vague reverberation of the enormous city i watched the sparrows and they me when the time came for my afternoon walk i put on my hat with eyes fixed on my letter and finallyleft it behind me  was it for discretions sake or in shame i cannot say but i remember that during my slow descent to the empty hall i kept my eyes fixed with peculiar malignity on the milkwhite figure of a venus not lifesize thank heaven who had been surprised apparently in the very act of entering the water for a bathe why i singled her out for contempt i cannot say for she certainly looked a good deal more natural and modest than many of the fine ladies who heedlessly passed her by it was merely my old problem of the social layers over again and my mind was in such a state of humiliation and discomfort that i hadnt the energy even to smile at a marble goddess   fanny was awaiting me on my return a strand of hair was looped demurely and oldfashionedly round each small ear her clear unpowdered skin had the faint sheen of a rose she stood still and shimmering in the height of pleasant spirits yet i thought watchful and furtive through it all she had come she said to congratulate me on my latest conquest  mrs monnerie she told me had been pleased with my entertainment of the late first commissioner ofwas it good works but i must beware once a coquette midgetina soon quite heartless she twitted me  to which i called sourly as i stood drying my hands that pretty compliments must be judged by where they come from  come from indeed laughed fanny hes a positive peer of the realm and baths my dear every morning in the fount of honours you wouldnt be so flippant if  hallo whats this a letteraddressed to me where on earth did this come from  heels to head a sudden heat swept over me oh said i hollowly thats nothing fanny only a little joke and now you are here but surely i hurried on you dont really like that starchedup creature  but fanny was holding up my envelope between both her thumbs and forefingers and steadily smiling at me over its margin a joke midgetina and one of your very own how exciting and how bulgy may i open it i wouldnt miss it for the world  please fanny i have changed my mind let me have it i dont feel like jokes now  but honestly i do some jokes have such a deliciously serious side besides as you have just come in why didnt this go out with you to which i replied stubbornly that it was not her letter that i had thought better of it and that she had no right to question me if i didnt want to answer  i see her voice had glided steadily up the scale of suavity its a bit more of the dead past is it and you dont like thethe fragrance but surely if we are really talking about rightsand according to my experience there are none too many of them knocking about in this worldsurely i have the right to ask what pulpy mysteries are enclosed in an envelope addressed to me in what appears to be a feigned cacalligraphy look i am putting the thing on the floor so that we shall be onwellfairly equal terms even your sensitive sukie could not be more considerate than that could she all i want to know is whats inside that envelope if you refuse to say well and good i shall retire to my maidenly couch and feed on the blackest suppositions  it was a culdesac and the only thing to do was to turn back boldly and get out of it  well fanny i have told you that i thought better of sending it but i am not ashamed even if i am wrong i suppose you are at liberty to have your little jokes too and so is percy maudlen its a letter torn up thats all  a letterso i guessed who from  i gazed at her silently  yes  its hateful of you fanny from the hunchback  her astonishment surely could not have been pretence and what the devil you dear stammering little midgelet has your miserable little hunchback to do with me why send his scrawls to meand in bits  because said i i thought you had been making fun of him and me tothe others  the light hands lifted themselves the dark head tilted a little back and askew what a roundabout route she sighed but her face was false to the smooth scornful accents so you suspected me of spying on you i see and gentle susan monnerie was kind enough to smear a little poison on the fangs well midgetina love i tell you this its safer sometimes to lose your reputation than your temper but theres a limit  hush i whispered for i had sharper ears than fanny even when rage had not deafened her own i pounced on the envelopebut only just in time  its mr percy miss announced fleming and may he come in  hallo said that young man lounging greyly into view a bad penny miss m i happened to be passing buszards just now and there was the very thing miss bowater says you have a sweet tooth and they really are rather neat he had brought me the daintiest little box of french doll bonbons i glared at it i glared at himhardly in the mood for any more of his little jokesnot even one tied up with paleblue ribbon  theres another thing he went on susan told us that your birthday was coming alongaugust 25th isnt it and i have proposed a grand birthday party sort of general rag miss m in the chair dont you think its a ripping idea of mine miss bowater  most ripping said fanny meeting his long slow sneaking glance with a slight and seemingly involuntary lift of her narrow shoulder a long look i could not share passed between them i might have been a toy on the floor  but you dont look positively in the pink he turned to me now does she late hours eh you look crumpled doesnt she cherry too we must have in another vet the laugh died on his long lips his eyes roved stealthily from point to point of the basking afternoon room then once more sluggishly refastened on fanny i sat motionless watching his every turn and twist and repeating rapidly to myself go away my friend go away go away some nerve in him must have taken the message at last or he found fannys silence uneasy he squinnied a glinting curious look at me and as jauntily as selfconsciousness permitted took his departure  the door shut his presence fainted out into a phantasm and that into nothing at all and for sole evidence of him basked on my table beneath a thread of sunlight his blueribboned box  isnt he a ninny sighed fanny and yet my dear therebut for the grace of godgoes mr fanny bowater  her anger had evaporated there stood my familiar fanny again slim as a mast her light eyes coldly shining her bearing even the set of her foot showing already a faint gilding of mrs monnerie she laughedlooking straight across at me as if with a challenge  yes my dear its quite true im not a bit cross now milk and honey so you see even a fool may be a lightning conductor i forgive she pouted a kiss from the tips of her fingers i forget  and then she was gone too and i alone what an easy consoling thingnot to care but though fanny might forgive she must have found it unamusing to forget the next evenings post brought me an exquisitely written little fable signed f b and entitled asteroida and the yellow dwarf i couldnt enjoy it very much though no doubt it must have been exceedingly entertaining when read aloud  still fanny did not care while i myself was like those railway lines under the green bank i had seen on my journey to lyme regis a days neglect a nights dews and i was stained thick with rust a dull and heedless wretchedness took possession of me the one thought that kept recurring in every instant of solitude and most sharply in those instants which pounced on me in the midst of strangers was how to escape  i put away the envelope and its contents into my box again and late that night when i was secure from interruption i wrote to wanderslore nibbling a pen is no novelty to me but never in all my life have i spent so blank and hideous an hour merely in the effort to say no to one simple question so that it should sound almost as pleasant as yes and far more unselfish throw the stone indeed when my only desire was to heal the wound it might make  thank goodness my letter was kinder than i felt my candelabra burned stilly on cold in the blues i stood in my dressinggown and spectacling my eyes with my hands looked out of the chill glass into the london night only one high garret window shone out in the dark face of the houses who where was willie arbuthnot with the peculiar eyes had lord chiltern a tank on his roofhis backyard what a fool i had been to abandon myself and come here if they only knew how i despised them and the whole house asleep so much i despised them that not until i was dressing the following morning did i stoop into my indian mirror to see if i could discover what lord chiltern had meant  during the next few weeks mrs monneriewith ample provocationalmost yawned at sight of me in a bitter instant of rebellion our eyes met she detected the illwish in mine and was so much taken aback by it that i should hardly have recognized the set face that glared at me as hers at all well the fancier had wearied of her fancythat was all if i had been just an ordinary visitor she would soon have washed her hands of me but i was notorious and not so easily exchanged as bronchitic cherry had been for her new pekinese plum  possibly too the kind of aversion she now felt against me was a closer bond than even virtuosity or affection she would sit with a sullen stare under her heavy eyelids watching me grow more and more heated and clumsy over my scrap of embroidery or my game of patience meanwhile chakka would crack his nut and with stagnant eye sidle thievishly up and down the bars of his cage while plum gobbled up dainties or snored on his crimson cushion we three  usually i was left pretty much alone and what plans mrs monnerie was turning over to dispose of me were known only to herself what to do where to hide how to make myself small during those torpid august days i hardly knew my one desire was to keep out of sight one afternoon i remember after brooding for some hours under a dusty lilac bush in the square garden i strayed offmy eyes idly glancing from straw to hairpin to dead match in the dustdown a narrow deserted side street that led to a mews a string of washing hung in the sunlight from the windows skirting a small public house from which the smell of beer and spirits vapoured into the sunshine i presently found myself in a blackgreen churchyard among tombstones  a clear shadow slanted across the porch the door of the church stood open and after pausing for a moment on its flagstones i went in it was empty stone faces gazed sightlessly from its walls two red sanctuary lamps hung like faint rubies in the distant chancel i dragged out a cushion and sat down under the font the thin cloudy fragrance that hung in the gloom of the coloured windows stole in through my nostrils drugged my senses propping my chin on my hands i looked up through the air into the dark roof a pendulum ticked slowly from on high quiet began to steal over melong centuries of solitude had filled this vacancy as with a dream  it was as if some self within me were listening to the unknownbut to whom i could not answer i might as well have been born a pagan was this church merely the house of a god there were gods and temples all over the world was it a house of the god or only of their god in a sense i knew it was also my gods but how much more happily confident of his secret presence i had been in wildgrown wanderslore did this mean that i was actually so much alone in my world as to be different from all other human beings  a fluttering panic swept through my mind at the muffled thumping of the invisible pendulum i had forgotten that time never ceased to be wasting and the past stretched its panorama before my eyes no 2 the public house with the solitary thinking man i had seen pot in hand staring into the sawdust and this empty cavernous silence then back and backlyme regis mrs bowatersand fanny lyndsey my mother and father the garden no sylphs of the air no trancing music out of the waters now it was as if the past were surrounded with a great wall and the future clear and hard as glass you might explore the past in memory you couldnt scale its invisible walls  and there was mr crimblean immeasurable distance away yet he had still the strange power to arrest me to look out on me in my path must the future be all of its piece i stopped thinking again and my eyes wandered over my silk skirt and shoes  my ghost there was no doubt i was an exceedingly small human being it may sound absurd but i had never vividly realized it before and how solemnly sitting therelike a spider in wait for flies for goodness sake miss m i said to myself cheer up you are being deadly dull companyalways half afraid they darent really do anything to you you know face it out and even while i was muttering i was reading the words cut into a worn tombstone at my feet jenetta parkeronly twoandtwenty a year older than i yet she had lain here for two whole centuries and more and beneath her name i spelled out her epitaph        ah stranger breathe a sigh         for where i lie      is but a handful of bright beauty cast         it was and now is past   i repeated the words mechanically again and again and as if in obedience to her whisper a much more niggardly handful of none too bright a beauty did breathe a sigh and a prayerpart pity part melancholy and all happiness and relief i kissed my hand to jenetta crossed myself and bowed to the altardulled gems of light the glassand emerged into the graveyard a lamp had been lit an old man was shuffling along behind me he had come to lock up the church for an instant i debated whether or not to scuttle off down the greenbladed cobbles of the mews andtrust my luck no the sight of a punch and judy man gobbling some food out of a newspaper at the further corner scared me out of that little enterprise dusk was settling and i edged back as fast as i could to no 2  but it did me goodthat visit it was as if i had been looking back and up at my own small skull on a high shelf in some tranquil and dingy old laboratorya few bottles a spiders web and an occasional glint of moonlight how very brief the animation for so protracted a peace     chapter fortytwo   susans visits to her aunt were now less frequent percys multiplied duty seemed to have become a pleasure to him mrs monneries gaze would rest on him with a drowsy vigilance which it was almost impossible to distinguish from mere vacancy of mind he was fortunate in being her only nephew unfortunate in being himself and the son of a sister to whom mrs monnerie seemed very little attached still he appeared to be doing his best to cultivate his aunts graces would meander in attendance round and round the squares square garden while fannys arm had now almost supplanted mrs monneries ebony cane when mrs monnerie was too much fatigued for this mild exercise or otherwise engaged there was still my health to consider at least fanny seemed to think so but since percys conversation had small attractions for me it was far rather he who enjoyed the experience while i sat and stared at nothing under a tree  at less than nothingfor i was staring as usual chiefly at myself i seemed to have lost the secret of daydreaming and if the quantity of aversion that looked out of my eyes had matched its quality those piebald planetrees and poisonous laburnums would have been scorched as if with fire i shall never forget those interminable august days besieged by the roar and glare and soot and splendour and stare of london all but friendless absolutely penniless i had nothing but bits of clothes for bribes to keep fleming from mutiny i shrank from making her an open enemy though i knew as time went on that she disrelished me more and more she would even keep her nose averted from my clothes  as for fanny to judge from her animation when susan and captain valentine broke in upon us i doubt if anybody less complacent than percy would not have realized that she was often bored she would look at him with head on one side as if she had been painted like that for ever and ever in a picture she could idly hide behind her beauty and percy might as well have gone hunting echo or a rainbow she could make corrosive remarks in so seducing a voice that the poor creature hardly knew where the smart came from he would exclaim oh i say miss bowater and gape like a goldfish solely perhaps to have some one to discuss herself with fanny so far forgave and forgot my shortcomings as to pay me an occasional visit and had yawned how hideously expensive she found it to live with the rich but the only promise of help i could make was beyond any possibility of performance i promised none the less for my one dread was that she should guess what straits i was in for money  it is all very well to accuse percy maudlen of goldfishiness what kind of fish was i during the few months of my life at mrs monneriesuntil that is fannys arrivalshe had transported her queen bee as she sometimes called me to every conceivable social function and ceremony except a deathbed and a funeral why had i not played my cards a little more skilfully had not messrs de la rue designed a pack as if expressly for me and for my own particular little game of patience if perhaps i had shown more sense and less sensibility and had not been as i suppose in spite of all my airs and flauntings such an inward young woman what altitudes i might have scaled mrs monnerie indeed had once made me a promise to present me at court in the coming may it is true that this was a distinction that had been enjoyed by many of my predecessors in my own particular linebut i dont think my patroness would have dished me up in a pie  that being so my proud bosom might at this very moment be heaving beneath a locket adorned with the royal monogram in seed pearls and inscribed to the least of her subjects from the greatest of queens why i might have been the most talkedof and photographed débutante of the season but i must beware of sour grapes there was once a diogenes whom the gods shut up in a tubpoor mr wagginhorne he had been after all comparatively frugal with his azaleas  in all seriousness i profited far too little by mrs monneries generosities by my chances while i was with her i just grew hostile and so halfblind many of her friends of course were merely wealthy or fashionable but others were just natural human beings as fanny had discovered she not only delighted in people that were pleasant to look at she enjoyed also what i suppose is almost as rare intelligence  the society beauties now to be quite candid and i hope without the least tinge of jealousy i think they liked the look of mewell no better than i liked the look of excessively handsome men these exotics of either sex reminded me of petuniasthe headachy kind that are neither red nor blue but a mixture i always felt when i looked at them that they knew they were making me dizzy yet as a matter of fact i could hardly see their beauty for their clothes it must of course be extremely difficult to endure pure admiration true i never remember even the most tactful person examining me for the first time without showing some little symptom of discomposure but thats a very different thing  there was however another kind of beauty which i loved with all my heart it is difficult to express what i mean but to see a woman whose face seemed to be the picture of a dream of herself or a man whose face was absolutely the showing of his own mindi never wearied of that or at any rate i do not now in looking back  so much for outsides humanity our old cook mrs ballard used to say is very like a veal and ham pie its least digestible part is usually the crust i am only an amateur veal and ham pieist and the fact remains that i experienced just as much difficulty with what are called clever people they were like adam waggett in his sunday clothesa little too much of something to be quite all there i firmly believe that what one means is the best thing to say and the very last thing however unaffected most of these clever people said was seemingly what they meant their conversation rarely had more than an intellectual interest you asked for a penny and they gave you what only looked like a threepenny bit  perhaps this is nothing but prejudice but i have certainly always got on very much better with stupid people chiefly perhaps because i could share experiences with them and the latest thoughts did not matter so much clever mensand womensexperiences all seem to be in their heads and when i have seen a rich man clamber through the eye of a needle as poor mr crimble used to say i shall keep my eyes open for a clever one attempting the same feat it had been one of my absurd little amusements at mrs bowaters to imagine myself in strange placeskeeping company with a dishevelled comet in the cold wilds of space or walking about in the furnaces of the sun like shadrach and abednego not so now yet if i had had the patience and the far better sense to fix my attention on any one i disliked at mrs monneries so as to enter in no doubt i should so much have enlarged my inward self as to make it a match at last even for poor mr daniel lambert  on the other hand i sometimes met people at no 2 or when i was taken out by mrs monnerie whose faces looked as if they had been on an almost unbelievably long journeyand one not merely through this world though that helps i did try to explore those eyes and mouths and wrinkles and solitudes stranger than any comets i would find myself in at times alas they paid me extremely little attention though i wonder they did not see in my eyes how hungry i was for it they were as mysterious as what is called genius and what would i not give to have set eyes on sir isaac newton or nelson or john keatsall three of them comparatively little men  however absurdly pranked up with conceit i might be i knew in my heart that outwardly at any rate i was nothing much better than a curio to care for me was therefore a really difficult feat and apart from there being very little time for anything at mrs monneries i never caught any one making the attempt when the novelty of me had worn off i used to amuse myself by listening to mrs monneries friends talking to one anotherdiscussing plays and pictures and music and so onanything that was new and of course each other often on these occasions i hardly knew whether i was on my head or my heels  books had always been to me just a part of my life and music very nearly my death however much i forgot of it i wove what i could remember of my small reading round myself so to speak and i am sure it made the cocoon more comfortable as often as not these talkers argued about books as if their authors had made themcertainly not out of their power and lovebut merely for their readers to pick to pieces and about beauty too as if it were something you could eat with a spoon as for poetry one might have guessed from what they said that it meant no more thanwell its meaning as if a butterfly were a chrysalis i have sometimes all but laughed out it was so contrary to my own little oldfashioned notions certainly it was not my mothers way  but there what presumption this all is i had never been to school never been out of kent had never done anything nor been anything exceptand that halfheartedlymyself no wonder i was censorious  if i could have foreseen how interminably difficult a task it would prove to tack these memoirs together i am sure i should have profited a little more by the roarings of my fellow lions as a matter of fact i used merely to watch them sipping their tea and devouring their cake amid a languishing circle of admirers and to wonder if they found the cage as tedious as i did if they noticed me at all they were usually polite enough butlike the beautiesinclined to be absent and restless in my company so the odds were against me i had one advantage over them however for when i was no longer a novelty i could occasionally slip in unperceived behind an immense marquetry bureau there in the dust i could sit at peace comparing its back with its front and could enjoy at leisure the conversation beyond  nevertheless there was one old gentleman with whom i really made friends he was a bachelor and was not only the author of numbers of books but when he was a little boy had been presented by charles dickens himself with a copy of david copperfield and had actually sat on the young novelists knee no matter who it was he might be talking to he used to snap his fingers at me in the most exciting fashion whenever we saw each other in the distance and we often shared a quiet little talk together i standing on a highish chair perhaps and he squatting beside me his hands on his knees in some corner of mrs monneries enormous drawingroom well out of the mob  i once ventured to ask him how to write  his face grew very solemn lord have mercy upon me he said to write my dear young lady well there is only one recipe i have ever heard of take a quart or more of lifeblood mix it with a bottle of ink and a teaspoonful of tears and ask god to forgive the blots then he laughed at me and polished his eyeglasses with his silk pocket handkerchief  i surveyed this grisly mixture without flinching and laughed too and said tapping his arm with my fan but dear mr  would you have me die of anæmia  and he said i was a dear valuable creature and when next black pudding day tempted us we would collaborate  having heard his views i was tempted to push on and inquired as flatteringly as possible of a young portrait painter how he mixed his paints so as to get exactly the colours you want you know  he gently rubbed one longfingered hand over the other until there fell a lull in the conversation around us what i mix my paints with miss m whymerely with brains he replied my old novelist had forgotten the brains but i discovered in some book or other long afterwards that a still more celebrated artist had said that too so i suppose the mot is traditional  and last how to act for some mysterious reason i never asked any theatrical celebrity male or female how to do that  more or less intelligent questions i am afraid are not the only shortcut to good or even to polite conversation and i was such a dunce that i never really learned what topics are respectable and what not in consequence i often amused mrs monneries friends without knowing why they would exchange a kind of little ogling glance or with a silvery peal of laughter like bells cry how naïve  how i detested the word naïveit was simply my illbred earnestness still i made one valuable discovery that you could safely laugh or even titter at things which it was extremely bad manners to be serious about what you could be serious about without letting skeletons out of the cupboardthat was the riddle i had been brought up too privately ever to be able to answer it  how engrossing it all would have been if only the harrises could have trebled my income and if fanny had not known me so well there was even a joy in the ladies who shook their lorgnettes at me as if i were deaf or looked at me with their noses as one might say as if i were a bad or unsavoury joke on my part i could never succeed in forgetting that in spite of appearances they must be of flesh and blood and therefore the prey of them and of the world and the devil so i used to amuse myself by imagining how they would look in their bones or in rags or in heaven or as when they were children or again by an effort of fancy i would reduce them clothes and all to my proportions or even a little less and though these little inward exercises made me absentminded it made them ever so much more interesting and entertaining  how i managed not to expire in what for a country mouse was extremely like living in a bottle of champagne i dont know and if my silly little preferences suggest cynicismwell i may be smug enough but i dont and wont believe i am a cynic remember i was young besides i love human beings especially when they are very human and i have even tried to forgive miss m her miss mishness how can i be a cynic if i have tried to do that it is a far more difficult task than to make allowances for the poor wretched immortal waxwork creatures in madame tussauds chamber of horrors or even for the gentleman naturalist who shot and stuffed kents last golden oriole  nor have i ever for more than a moment shared with lemuel gulliver his none too nice disgust at the people of brobdingnag even at kindhearted glumdalclitch am i not myselfnot one of the quarrelsome fair folks of the woodsbut a yahoo gulliver of course was purposely made unaccustomed to the gigantic while i was born and bred though not to such an extreme in its midst and habit is second nature or as an old lyndsey proverb goes theres nowt like eels for eeliness  i am none the less ever so thankful that neither my ears nose nor eyes positively magnify so to speak i may be a little more sensitive to noises and smells than some people are but that again is probably only because i was brought up so fresh and quiet and privately i am far more backward than can be excused and in some things abominably slowwitted whether or not my feelings are pretty much of the usual size i cannot say what is more to the point is that in some of my happiest moments my inward self seems to be as remote from my body as the moon is from greenland and at otherseven though that body weighs me down to the earth like a stoneit is as if memory and consciousness stretched away into the ages far far beyond my green and dwindling barrow on chizzel hill and had shaken to the solitary nightcry of creation let there be light  but enough and to spare of all this egotism i must get back to my story     chapter fortythree   the fact is miss ms connection with good society was rapidly drawing to a close my smoky little candle had long since begun to gutter and sputter and enwreathe itself in a winding sheet it went out at last in a blaze of light for once in his life percy had conceived a notion of which his aunt cordially approvedmy birthday banquet heart and soul all my follies and misdemeanours forgotten she entered into this new device to give her snippety her moppet her pusskinetta her little binbin her fairy her petite sereine an exquisite setting  invitations were sent out to the elect on inchsquare cards embossed with my family crest and mottoa giant head and shoulders brandishing a club and non omnis moriar1 she not only postponed her annual departure from town but as did the great man in the parable compelled her friends to come in she exhausted her ingenuity on the menu the great on this occasion were to feast on the tiny a copy of it lies beside me now though unfortunately i did not examine it when i sat down to dinner last but not least percys pastrycooks messrs buszard designed a seventiered birthdaycake surrounded on its lowermost plateau by oneandtwenty sugarfigures about a quarter lifesize and each of them bearing on high a silver torch  their names were inscribed on their sugar pediments lady morgan the windsor fairy queen elizabeths mrs tomysen the empress julias andromeda the great little little great miss billing of tilbury anne rouse and poor ann colling the sicilian mlle caroline crachami who went to the anatomists nannette stocker 33 inches 33 lbs avoirdupois at 33 the blessed and tender anastasia boruwlaski gaganini the gentle miss selby of bath alethea the guernsey nymph madame teresa the corsican fairy mrs jeykll skinner the appalling nono mrs anne gibson née shepherd and the rest  it was a joke none the worse maybe for being old and peter the great must have turned in his grave in envy of mrs monneries ingenuity  it may scarcely be believed but i had become so hardened to such little waggeries that under the genial eye of mrs monnerie i made the circuit of this cake with a smile and even scolded her for omitting the redoubtable mrs bellamy with her lifesize family of nine i criticized the images too as not to be compared even as sugar with the alabaster william of windsor and blanche in the tower  the truth is when real revulsions of body and soul come they come in a gush all at once fleming on the night was actually putting the last touches to my coiffure when suddenly with a wicked curse i turned from the great glass and announced my decision tiny tortoiseshell comb uplifted she stood in the clear lustrousness looking in at my reflection queer thoughts darting about in her eyes at first she supposed it was but another fit of petulance then her hatred and disgust of me all but overcame her  she quietly argued i insisted but she was mortally afraid of mrs monnerie and rather than deliver my message to her sought out susan poor susan she too was afraid and it was her face rather than her love that won me over at last then she had to rush away to make what excuse she could for my unpunctuality it thus came about that mrs monneries guests had already sat down to table and were one and all being extremely amused by some story she was entertaining them with when marvell threw open the great mahogany doors for me and i made my solitary entry  in primrose silk à la pompadour a wreath of tightshut pimpernels in my hairit is just possible that mrs monnerie suspected i had chosen to come in late like this merely for effect but that would have been an even feebler exhibition of vanity than i was capable of all her guests were known to me even though only one of them was of my choosing for mrs bowater was in the argentine sir walter in france miss fenne on her deathbed mr pellew in retreat and mr crimble in his grave fanny was my all  she was sitting four or five chairs away from me on my left between percy who had on his right hand a beautiful longfaced girl in turquoise green and captain valentine further down and on the other side of the table sat lady maudlena seallike lady who according to fanny disapproved of me on religious groundswhile i was on mrs monneries left and next to lord chiltern alas even my old friend the black pudding was too far distant to do more than twinkle courage at me when our eyes met  recollections of that disastrous evening are clouded so evil with dreams my nights had been that i hardly knew whether i was awake or asleep but i recall the long perspective of the table the beards the busts the pearls the camellias and gardenias the cornucopias and that glistening folly castle my birthday cake marvell is behind me and adam waggett is ducketing in the luminous distance the clatter of many tongues beats on my ear mrs monnerie murmurs and gently rocks the great silver dishes dip and withdraw corks pop and the fumes of meat and wine cloud into the air in memory it is as if i myself were far away as if i had read of the scene in a book  but two moments stand vividly out of its unrealityand each of them to my shame a small wreathed silvergilt dish was placed before me automatically i thrust my spoon into its jelly and pecked at the flavourless morsels sheer nervousness had deprived me of my sense of taste but there was something in mrs monneries sly silence and lord chilterns solemn monocle and percys snigger that set me speculating  angelic tomtitiska sighed mrs monnerie i wager when she returns to paradise she will sit in a corner and forget to tune her harp  there was no shade of vexation in her voice only amiable amusement but those sitting near had overheard her little pleasantry and smilingly watched me as casting my eye down the menuconsommé aux nids dhirondelles filets de blanchailles à la diable ailes de caille aux petits pois minnie stratton sauterelles aux caroubes saint jean it was caught at last by a pretty gilt flourishing around the words suprême de langues de rossignols this then was the dainty jest the clou du repas the faint gold words shimmered back at me in an instant i was a child again at lyndsey lulling to sleep on my pillow amid the echoing songs of the nightingales that used to nest in its pleasant lanes i sat flaming my tongue clotted with disgust i simply couldnt swallow and didnt but never mind   this was my first mishap though her own appetite was capricious ranging from an almost incredible voracity to a scrap of dry toast nothing vexed mrs monnerie so much as to see my poor squeamish stomach revolting at the sight of meat she drew up a naked shoulder against me and the feast proceeded with its chief guest in the shade once i could soon have regained my composure now i languished careless even of the expression on my face not even the little mincing smile fanny always reserved for me in company could restore me and it was at her whisper that percy stole down and filled my acorn glass with a translucent green liquid which he had himself secured from the sideboard i watched the slow green flow of it from the lip of the decanter without a thought in my head lord chiltern endeavoured to restore my drooping spirits i had outrageously misjudged him he was not one of mrs monneries stupid friends and he really did his utmost to be kind to me if he should ever read these words may he be sure that miss m is grateful but his kindness fell on stony ground and when at length he rose to propose my health i crouched beneath him shameful haggard and woebegone  it was as minute a speech as was she whom it flattered and far more graceful nothing of course would satisfy its audience when the toast had been honoured but that miss m should reply one single desperate glance i cast at mrs monnerie she sat immovable as the sphinx there was no help for it knees knocking together utterly tonguetied i stood up in my chair and surveyed the two converging rows of smiling curious faces despair gave me counsel i stooped raised my glass and half in dread half in bravado tossed down its burning contents at a gulp  the green syrup coursed along vein and artery like molten lead a horrifying transparency began to spread over my mind it seemed it had become in that instant empty and radiant as a dome of glass all sounds hushed away things near faded into an infinite distance every face glossed with light as if varnished became lifeless brutal and inhuman the grotesque caricature of a shadowy countenance that hung somewhere remote in memory yet was invisible and irrevocable in this dead momentthe whole blazing scene like a nowhere of the imaginationmy wandering eyes met fannys she was softly languishing up at captain valentine her fingers toying with a rose and it seemed as though her once loved spirit cried homelessly out at me from space as if for refuge and recognition and a longhidden flood broke bounds in my heart all else forgotten and obeying mechanically the force of long habit i stepped up from my chair on to the table and staggered towards her upsetting as i went a shallow glass of bubbling wine it reeked up in the air around me  fanny fanny i called to her out of my swoon ah fanny holy dying holy dying sauve qui peut with empty shocking face she started back appalled like a wounded snake  oh she cried in horror into the sleep that was now mounting my body like a cloud oh her hand swept out blindly in my direction as if to fend me off at best my balance was insecure and though the velvet petals of her rose scarcely grazed my cheek the insane glaze of my mind was already darkening i toppled and fell in a heap beside her plate  footnote  1 to be truthful this is not my family motto nor crest but the real motto seemed a little too satirical to share with mrs monnerie and however overweening its substitute may appear i have now hopes and now misgivings that it is true     monks house     chapter fortyfour   thus then i came of age though not on st rosas day however dramatic and memorable i grant it was not a courteous method of acknowledging lord chilterns courtesy in the good old days the drunken dwarf would have been jovially tossed from hand to hand from mind to mind was my much milder penalty and yet this poor little contretemps was of a sort that required hushing up so it kept tongues wagging for many a day it was little comfort that percy shared my disgrace and even susan for giving way  she it was who had lifted my body from the table and carried it up into darkness and quiet in the half light of my bedroom i remember i opened my eyes for a momenteyes which refused to stay still in their sockets but were yet capable of noticing that the left hand which clasped mine had lost its ring i tried to point it out to her she was crying  philippina sober was awakened the next morning by the fingers of mrs monnerie herself she must have withdrawn the kindly sheet from my face and with nightmare still babbling on my lips i looked up into the familiar features a little grey and anxious but creased up into every appearance of goodwill  not so excessively unwisely then she rallied me and only the least little thought too well we have been quite anxious about bébé havent we fleming  quite madam a little indigestion thats all  yes yes a little indigestion thats all mrs monnerie agreed and i am sure poppet doesnt want those tiresome doctors with their horrid physic  i sat up blinking from one to the other i think it was the green stuff i muttered tongue and throat as dry as paper i could scarcely see out of my eyes for the racking stabs of pain beneath my skull  yes yes was the soothing response but you mustnt agitate yourself silly child dont open your eyes like that the heat of the room the excitement some little obstinate dainty now one of those darling little pills and a cooling draught perhaps thank you fleming  the door closed we were left alone mrs monneries scrutiny drifted away their shutters all but closed down on the blackbrown pupils my head pined for its pillows my shoulders for some vestige of defence but pined in vain for the first time i felt afraid of mrs monnerie she was thinking so densely and heavily  yet as if out of a cloud of pure absentmindedness dropped softly her next remark does pretty pusskin remember what she said to miss bowater no well then if she cant its quite certain nobody else canor wishes to i inquired merely because the poor thing who has been really nobly devoting herself to her duties seems so hurt well it shall be a little lessonto us all though one swallow does not make a summer my child one hornet can make things extremely unpleasant not that i a vast shrug of the shoulders completed the sentence a little talk and tact will soon set that right and i am perfectly satisfied perfectly satisfied with things as they are so thats settled some day you must tell me a little more about your family history meanwhile rest and quiet no more excitement no more company and no moreshe bent low over me with wagging headno more green stuff and thenher eyes rested on me with a peculiar zest rather than with any actual animositythen we must see what can be done for you  there came a tapand percy showed in the doorway  i thought aunt alice i thought he began but at sight of the morose heavy countenance lifted up to him he shut his mouth  thank you said mrs monnerie thank you sir galahad you did nothing of the kind  whereupon her nephew wheeled himself out of the room so swiftly that i could not detect what kind of exotics he was carrying in a little posy in his hand  so the invalid now a burden on the mind of her caretaker many times her own weight was exiled for ever from no 2 poor fleming sniffier and more disgusted than ever was deputed to carry me off to the smaller of mrs monneries country retreats a long lowroofed shallowstaired house lying in the green under the downs at croomham there i was to vegetate for a time and repent of my sins  percys fiery syrup took longer to withdraw its sweet influences than might have been foreseen indeed whenever i think of him its effects are faintly renewed though not i trust to the detriment of my style none too strong physically the miss m that sat up at her latticed window at monks house during those few last interminable august days was very busy with her thoughts as she looked down for hours together on the gnarled thickleafed old mulberrytree in the corner of the lawn that swept up to the very stones of the house and on the walled sundrugged garden beyond she was for ever debating that old old problem what could be done by herself with herself  the doves crooned the cawing rooks flapped black into the blue above the neighbouring woods the earth drowsed on it was a scene of peace and decay but i seemed to have lost the charm that could have made it mine i was an ishmael and worsei was still a prisoner no criminal at deaths door can have brooded more laboriously on his chances of escape no wonder the voices of childhood had whispered away  there came a long night of rain i lay listening to the whisper and clucking of its waters far away the lapwings called eeooeet eeooeet what follies i had been guilty of how wilily circumstance had connived at them yet i was no true penitent my heart was empty so parched up that neither love nor remorse had any place in it revenge seemed far sweeter driven into this corner i sent a desperate word to sir w it remained unanswered and this friend followed the rest into the wilderness of my ingratitude  but that brought me no relief for of all the sins i have ever committed envy and hatred seem to me the most unpleasant to practise i was to learn also that he who sows hatred shall gather rue and bed with thistles with eyes at last as anxious as jezebels i resumed my watch at the window but even if percy had ridden from london solely to order fleming to throw me down she would not have demeaned herself to set hands on me she might be bold but she too was fastidious  then fleming herself one afternoon softly and suddenly vanished awayon her summers holiday poor thing so acute was the chronic indigestion caused by her obstinate little dainty that she did not even bid me goodbye  she left me in charge of the housekeeper mrs french a stout flushed horsefaced woman who now and then came in and bawled goodhumouredly at me as if i were deaf but otherwise ignored me altogether i now spent most of my time in the garden listlessly wandering out of sight of the windows and gardeners along its lankflowered rosepetalled walks hating its beauty or i would sit where i could hear the waterdrops in a well the very thought of company was detestable i sat there halfdead without book or needle with scarcely a thought in my head in my library days at no 2 i had become a perfect slave to pleasures of the intellect but now dyspepsia had set in there too  my nights were pestered with dreams and my days with their vanishing spectres and i had no pollie to tell me what they forecast i suppose one must be more miserable and hunted in mind even than i was never to be a little sentimental when alone i would lean over the cold mouth of the well just able to discern in the cold mirror of water far beneath the face i was almost astonished to find reflected there shall i come too i would morbidly whisper and dart away  still just as with a weed in winter life was beginning to renew the sap within me and monks house was not only drowsy with age but gentle with whispers once at least in every twentyfour hours i would make a pilgrimage to its wroughtiron gates beside the square white lodge to gloat out between the metal floriations at the dusty country lane beyondwith its swallows and wagtails and dragonflies beneath the heatparched tranquil elms a slim stilted greyhound on one such visit stalked out from the lodge quite unaware of his company i turned about suddenly and stared clean down his arched throatwhite teeth and lolling tongue it was as if i had glanced into the jaws of destiny he turned his head whiningly yawned and stalked back into the shade  a day or two afterwards i made the acquaintance of the lodgekeepers daughter a child named rose about five years of age with a mop of coppercoloured curls bound up with a pale blue bow at first glimpse of me she had hopped back as if on springs into the house a moment after her whiteaproned mother appeared in the porch and with a pleasant nod at me bade the child smile at the pretty little lady finger in mouth rose wriggled and stared in a few days she grew accustomed to my small figure and though i would sometimes discover her saucerblue eyes fixed on me with a peculiar intensity we almost came to be friends she was not a very bright little girl yet i found myself wooing her with all the arts i knewin a scarcely conscious attempt i suppose to creep back by this small lane into the worlds and my own esteem  i made her wristlets of little flowers hacked her out cockle boats from the acorns told her halfforgotten stories and once had to trespass into the kitchen at the back of the lodge to tell her mother that she was fallen asleep was it mere fancy that read in the scared face she twisted round on the pretty little lady from over her saucepan avaunt evil eye i had become abominably selfconscious     chapter fortyfive   one such afternoon rose and i were sitting quietly together in the sunshine on the green grass bank when a smart short step sounded in the lane and who should come springily pacing out of the country through the gates but adam waggettred hands black boots and londonish billycock hat all complete adam must have been born in a fit of astonishment and when he dies so he will enter paradise he halted abruptly a ring of shifting sunshine through the leaves playing on his purple face and after one long glance of theatrical astonishment he burst into his familiar guffaw  this time the roar of him in the open air was nothing but a pleasure and the mere sound and sight of him set rose off laughing too her pink mouth was as clustered about with milkteeth as a fragment of honeycomb is with cells  well there i never miss he said at last with a slow friendly wink at the child where shall us three meet again i wonder he flicked the dust off his black button boots with his pockethandkerchief mopped his high bald forehead and then positively exploded into fragments of informationlike my fathers fireworks on guy fawkes day  he talked of young mr percys goingson of the august mr marvell of life at no 2 that miss bowater now shes a bit of all right shes toffee she is but his hat there had been a row and the captain too not that there was anything in that just a bit of silly jealousy like the women he could make a better guess than that he didnt know what the old lady would do without that miss bowaterthe old lady whose carriage would in a few days be rolling in between these very gates and thenhe began whistling a highland reel  the country air had evidently got into his head hand over hand he was swarming up the ladder of success his joie de vivre gleamed at every pore and ii just sat there passively drinking in this kitchentalk without attempting to stop him after all he was out of my past we were children of israel in a strange land and that hot face with its violent pantomime and hairplastered temples was as good as a play  he was once more settling his hat on his head and opening his mouth in preparation for a last bray of farewell when suddenly in the sunny afternoon hush a peculiar melancholy whining cry rose over the treetops and slowly stilled away as if shot from a bow roses greyhound leapt out of the lodge and was gone with head twisted over his shoulder adam stood listening somewherewhere whenthat sound had stirred the shadows of my imagination the day seemed to gather itself about me as if in a plot  in the silence that followed i heard the dustmuffled grinding of heavy wheels approaching and the low refreshing talk of homely kentish country voices adam stepped to the gate i clutched roses soft cool fingers and spongily ponderously there beyond the bars debouched into view a hugeshouldered molecoloured elephant its trunk sagging towards the dust its small lashfringed eye gleaming in the sun its bald stumpy tufted tail stiff and still behind it  on and on one after another in the elmshaded beams of the first of evening the outlandish animals the wheeled dens the gaudy piledup vans of pasteboard scenery the horses and ponies and riffraff of a travelling circus wound into and out of view before my eyes it was as if the lane itself were moving and all the rest of the world with rose and myself clutched hand in hand on our green bank had remained stark still probably the staring child supposed that this was one of my fairytales come true my own mind was humming with a thought far more fantastic ever and again a swarthy face had glanced in on our quiet garden the lion had glared into africa beyond my head but i was partly screened from view by rose and it was a woman and she all but the last of the dusty bedraggled company that alone caught a full clear sight of me  one flash of eye to eyewe knew each other she was the birdeyed earringed gipsy of my railway journey with pollie from lyndsey to beechwood even more hawklike bonier striding along now like a man in the dust and heat in her dingy coloured petticoats and great boots with one steelgrey dart of remembrance she swallowed me up like flame a moth her mouth relaxed into a foxy smile while her gaze tightened on me she turned herself about and shrilled out a strange word or two to some one who had gone before a sudden alarm leapt up in me in an instant i had whisked into hiding and found myself halfsuffocated with excitement peeping out of a bush in watch for what was to happen next  so swift had been my disappearance she seemed doubtful of her own senses a cage of leopards with a fairskinned goldhaired girl in white stockings lolling asleep on the chainedup tailboard trundled by and then my gipsy was joined by a thickset scowling man his face was bold and square and far more lowering than that of the famous pugilist mr sayersto whose coloured portrait i had become almost romantically attached in the library at no 2 this dangerouslooking individual filled me with a tremulous excitement and admiration if as in a dream my past seemed to have been waiting for that solitary elephant then my future was all of a simmer with him  he drew his thick hand out of his stomachpocket and scratched his cheek the afternoon hung so quiet that i heard the rasp of his finger nail against his sprouting beard he turned to mutter a sullen word or two at the woman beside him then more civilly and with a jerk of his squat thumb in my direction he addressed himself to adam adam listened his red ears erect on either side of his hat but his only answer was so violent a wag of his head that it seemed in danger of toppling off his body softly i laughed to myself the woman yelped at him the man bade her ferociously shut her gob adam clangedto the gates they moved on beast cage and men were vanished like a daydream a fitful breeze rustled the dry elmleaves the swifts coursed on in the shade   when the last faint murmur had died away i came out from behind my bush a country circus i remarked unconcernedly what did the man want adam  that hairy cat frowned at rosie whispered the child turning from me to catch at adams coattails not eat rosie  adam bent himself double and with an almost motherly tenderness stroked her bright red hair he straightened himself up spat modestly in the dust and with face still mottled by our recent experience expressed the opinion that the man was one of them low blackguardsexcusing plain english misswhod steal your chickens out of the very saucepan as for the womanwords failed him  i waited until his small round eye had rolled back in my direction yes adam i said but what did he say you mean she told him about me  well miss to speak equallike that was about the size of it the old liar said she had seen you before that you werewell there you area gold mine aa blessed gold mine her very words nearabout at that in an insuppressible gush of happiness i laughed out with him like a flageolet in a concourse of bassoons  but he didnt see me adam i took good care of that  thats just said adam with a tug at his black cravat whats going to give the pair of them a mighty unpleasant afternoon  i dismissed him smiled at the whimpering greyhound smiled at rose whose shyness at me had unaccountably whelmed over her again and followed in adams wake towards the house but not to enter it a blessedoh most blessed gold mine the word so sang in me that the whole gardenespaliered wall and bird and flowerleapt into life and beauty before my eyes then my prayer what prayer had been answered i squared my shoulders shuddereda lazarus come to life away i went and seating myself in a sunny corner a few paces from a hive of bees plucked a nectarine and surrendered myself to the intoxication of an idea not your master is dead but your mistress is come to life again i whispered to the bees and if i had been wearing a scarlet garter i would have tied it round their skep  money moneya few even of my handfuls of that and i was free i would teach them a lesson i would redeem myself ah if only i had had a fraction of fannys courage should i so long have remained wilting and festering at no 2 the sweet sharp juices of the clumsy fruit quenched my thirst to and fro swept the bees along their airy highway a spiked tree of lateblooming bugloss streamed its blue and purple into my eyes a year ago the very thought of exhibiting myself for filthy or any kind of lucre would have filled me with unspeakable shame but what else had i been doing those long dragging months what had miss m hired herself out to be but a pot of caviare to the gourmets puffed up with conceit and complacency i had been merely feeding on the worlds contempt sauced up as flattery nonsensical child  ah i can make honey too i nodded at the bees whereupon a wasp pounced out of nowhere upon my oozy fruit and i thrust it away into the weeds but how refreshing a draught is the thought of action how comforting the first returning trickle of selfesteem my body sank into motionlessness the shadows lengthened the august sun slid down the sky  dusk was abroad in the colder garden and the last bee home when with plans resolved on i stretched my stiffened limbs and made my way into the house excellent auguryso easy had been my daily habits that no one had noticed my absence supper was awaiting me i was ravenous up and down i stumped gnawing my biscuit and sipping my sweet country milk i had suddenly realized what the world meant to fannyan oyster for her sword somewhere i have read that every man of genius hides a woman in his breast well perhaps in mine a man was now stirringthe man that had occupied my aunt kitildas skirts it was high time  a moon just past its quarter was sinking in the heavens and silvering the jessamine at my window my bosom swelled with longing at the breath of the slow night airs monks housei too had my ghosts and would face them down would vanquish fate with the very weapons it had forged for my discomfiture in that sheltered halflight i stood myself before a downtilted lookingglass if i had been malshapen limbless contorted i would have drowned myself in mud rather than feed mans hunger for the monstrous and obscene no i was a beautiful thing even if god had been idly at play when he had shaped me and had then flung away the mould even if to mrs monnerie i was nothing much better than a disreputable marionette so i boasted myself percys chartreuse had been mere whey compared with the fleeting glimpse of a tame circus elephant   i tossed out on to the floor the old lyndsey finery which some homesick impulse had persuaded me to bring away in my trunk seated there with busy needle under the window sewing in every gewgaw and scrap of tinsel and finery i could lay hands on i prepared for the morrow how happy i was bats in the dewy dusklight cast faint flitting shadows on the casements a large dark moth hawked to and fro above my head it seemed i could spend eternity in this gentle ardent busyness to think that god had given me what might have been so dreadful a thing as solitude but which in reality while my thoughts and fingers were thus placidly occupied could be so sweet when at length i leaned out on the cold sill my work done wrists and shoulders aching with fatigue croomham clock struck two the moon was set but there as if in my own happy mind away to the east shone orion why sirius then must be in hiding under that quiet shoulder of the downs a dwindling meteor silvered across space i breathed a wish shivered and drew in  and there came that night a curious dream i dreamt that i was a great soldier and had won an enormous unparalleled battle glaring light streamed obliquely across a flat plain humped and hummocked with the bodies of the dead lying in disorder i was standing in arrogant reverie alone a few paces distantthough leagues away in beingfrom a group of other officers who were looking at me and i suffered the streaming light to fall upon me as i gazed into my joy and triumph with a kind of severe nonchalance but though my face under my threecornered hat can have expressed only calmness and resolution i knew in my heart that my thoughts were merely a thin wisp of smoke above the crater of a suppressed volcano lest i should be detected in this weakness i turned out of the glare and without premeditation began to step lightly and abstractedly from huddling mound to mound and as these heaps of the dead increased in size in the gloom after the white western light was gone so i diminished until i was but a kind of infinitesimal willothewisp gliding from peak to peak of an infernal mausoleum of which every eye though dead was watching me but there was one eye  and that is all of the dream that i could remember for then i awoke looking into the dark a pencil ray of moonlight was creeping across my bed peace unutterable over my drowsy eyes once more the clouds descended and once more i fell asleep     chapter fortysix   next day after a long lyinginwait i intercepted adam waggett and beckoned him into the shrubbery first i questioned him a bill of the circus he told me had already been left at the lodge its tents and booths and aunt sallies were even now being pitched in a meadow three or four miles distant and this side the neighbouring town so far so good i told him my plan he could do nothing but look at me like a fish with his little black eyes as i sat on a tree stump and marshalled my instructions  but my first crucial battle had been fought with adam waggett in the garden at lyndsey he had neither the courage nor even the cowardice to gainsay me after a tedious siege of his sluggish wits greed for the reward i promised him the assurance that if we were discovered the guilt should rest on me and maybe some soupçon of old sakes sake won him over the branches of the trees swayed and creaked above us in the sunshine and at last looking down on me with a wry face adam promised to do my bidding  six had but just struck that evening when there came the rap of his knuckles on my bedroom door he found me impatiently striding up and down in a scintillating bodice and skirts of scarlet lemon and silveras gay and gaudy an object as the waxen russian princess i had seen in one of mrs monneries cabinets my flaxen hair was plaited germanwise and tied in two thumping pigtails with a green ribbon i stood and looked at him he fumblingly folded his hands in front of him as he stood and looked back at me i was quivering like a flame in a lamp and never have i been so much flattered as by the silly stupefied stare on his face  how i was to be carried to the circus had been one of our most difficult problems this cunning creature had routed out from some lumberroom in the old house a capacious old cagenow rusty but stout and solidly madethat must once have housed the aged chakka  there miss he whispered triumphantly thats the ticket and right to a hinch  i confess i winced at his ticket but adam had cushioned and padded it for me and had hooded it over with a stout piece of sacking leaving the ring free apart from our furtive preparations evening quiet pervaded the house the maids were out sweethearting he explained mrs french had retired as usual to her own sittingroom fortune seemed to be smiling upon me  then adam i whispered the time has come jerk me as little as possible and if questions are asked you are taking the cage to be mended you understand and when we get there see no one but the man or the woman who spoke to you at the gates  well miss its a rum go said adam eyeing me with a grotesque grimace of anxiety  i looked up at him from the floor of the cage the rummer the go is adam the quicker we ought to be about it  he lowered the wiry dome over my head i bunched in my skirts and with the twist of a few hooks i was secure the faint squeak of his boots told me that he had stolen to the door to listen  all serene he whispered hoarsely through the sacking i felt myself lifted up and up we were on our way then like flies a cloud of misgivings settled upon my mind as best i could i drove them away and to give myself confidence began to count a shrill false whistling broke the silence adam was approaching the lodge a mocking screech of its gates and we were through after that apart from the occasional beat of hoofs or shoes a country goodnight or a husky cough of encouragement from adam i heard nothing more the gloom deepened the heat was oppressive i became a little seasick and pressing my mouth to a small slit between the bars sucked in what fresh air i could  midway on our journey adam climbed over a stile to rest a while and pushing back a corner of the sacking he asked me how i did  fine adam said i panting we are getting along famously  the fields were sweet and dusky it was a clear evening and refreshingly cool  you may smoke a pipe adam if you wish i called softly and while he puffed and i listened to the chirping of a cricket he told me of a young housemaid that was always chaffing and ridiculing him at no 2 it may be that she has taken a passing fancy to you said i looking up into the silent oak tree under which we were sitting on the other hand you may deserve it what is she like adam  black eyebrows said adam shows her teeth when she laughs but thats no reason why she should make a fool of a fellow  the real question is is she a nice modest girl said i and my bangles jangled as i raised my hand to my hair come adam theres no time to waste are you ready  he grunted his mind still far away shes a fair sneak he said rapping his pipebowl on a stone and so up and on  time seemed to have ceased to be in this jolting monotony unbroken except by an occasional giddying swing of my universe as adam transferred the cage from hand to hand swelteringly hot without but a little cold within i was startled by a faraway blare of music i clutched tight the slender bars the music ceased and out of the quiet that followed rose the moaning roar of a wild beast  my tongue pressed itself against my teeth the sacking trembled and a faint luminousness began to creep through its hempen strands shouting and screaming catcalls and laughter swelled near and now by the medley of smells and voices and the glint of naked lights floating in on me i realized that we had reached our goal  adam came to a standstill wheres the boss the tones were thick and muffled a feeble smile swept over my face i discovered i was holding my breath  a few paces now the din distanced a little and the glare diminished then sounded another voice hoarse and violent high above my head   the cage bumped to the ground and i heard adam cringingly explain ive got a bird here for you mister  a bird rang the jeer who wants your bloody bird be off  ay but it wont be a bloody bird gasped adam cajolingly when youve seen her pretty feathers  at this apparently recollection of adams face or voice returned to the showman he remained silent while with palsied fingers adam unlatched my bolts and bars bent almost double and halfstifled i sat there in sight my clothes spread brightly out about me the cool air swirled in and for a while my eyes dazzled at the bubbling blaze of a naphtha lamp suspended from the pole of the tent above the crisscross greenbladed grass at my feet i lifted my head  there stood adam in his black tailcoat rubbing his arm and there the showman still to the tips of my fingers i sat motionless gazing up into the hard highboned narrowbrowed face with its small restless eyes voraciously taking me in fortunately the choked beating of my heart was too small a sound for his ear and he was the first to withdraw from the encounter  my god he muttered and spat into a corner of the canvas boothwith its one dripping lamp its rough table and chair and a few oddments of his trade  and what my handsome young lady he went on in a low carneying tone and fidgeting with his hands what might be your little imbroglio  in a gush presence of mind returned to me and fear passed away i quietly listened to myself explaining without any concealment precisely what was my little imbroglio he burst out laughing  stagestruck eh theres a young lady now well whos to blame ee  he asked me my age my name where i came from if i could dance sing ride and stared so roundly at me that i seemed to see my garish colours reflected in the metallic grey of his eyes  all this was on his side of the bargain now came mine i folded tight my hands in my lap glanced up at the flaming lamp how much would he pay me  it was as if a shutter had descended over his face drat me said he when a young lady comes selling anything she asks her price  so i asked minefifteen guineas for four nights hire to look at that human animal you might have supposed the actual guineas had lodged in his throat it may be that shylocks was a more modest bargain i cannot say  at first thought it had seemed to me a monstrous sum but at that time i was ignorant of what a really fine midget fetched it was but half my old quarterly allowance with £2 over for adam i should need every penny of it and i had not come selling my soul without having first decided on its value the showman fumed and blustered but i sat close on chakkas abandoned stage perfectly still making no answer finding moreover in adam an unexpected stronghold for the wider gawked his frightened eyes at the showmans noise and gesticulations the more resolved i became with a last dreadful oath the showman all but kicked a hole in my cage  take me away adam i cried quaveringly we are wasting this gentlemans time  i smiled to myself in spite of the cold tremors that were shaking me all over with every nerve and sinew of his corpulent body he was coveting me and with a curse he at last accepted my terms i shrugged my shoulders but still refused to stir a finger until our contract had been written down in black and white maybe some tiny lovebird of courage roosts beneath every human skull maybe my mothers fine french blood had rilled to the surface however that may be there could be no turning back  he drew out a stump of pencil and a dirty envelope that my fine cock he said to adam as he wrote thats a woman and you make no mistake about it to hell with your fine ladies  it remains if not the most delicate certainly one of the most substantial compliments i ever earned in my life  thats that he pretended to groan presenting me with his scrawl ask a shark for a stamp and if ruined i must beruined i am  i leapt to my feet shook out my tumbled finery smiled into his stooping face and tucked the contract into my bodice thank you sir i said and i promise you shant be ruined if i can help it whereupon adam became exceedingly merry the danger now over   such are the facts concerning this little transaction so far as i can recall them yet i confess to being a little incredulous have i perhaps gilded my side of the bargaining if so i am sure my showman would be the last person to quarrel with me i am inclined to think he had taken a fancy to me anyhow i had wonwhat is perhaps even betterhis respect and though the pay came late when it was no longer needed and though it was the blackest money that ever touched my fingers it came and if anybody was the defaulter it was i  there was no time to lose my gipsy woman was sent for from the shooting gallery i shook hands with her she shook hands with adam who was then told to go about his business and to return to the tent when the circus was over the three of us showman woman and i conferred together and with extreme cordiality agreed what should be my little part in the performance the booth in which we had made our bargain was hastily prepared for my reception its table was to be my daïs a loose flap of canvas was hung to one side of it to screen me off from prying eyes when i was not on show my only dangerous rival it appeared was the spotted boy  there followed a deafening pealing of panpipes drumming of drum and yelling of voices in that monstrous din i was past thinking just being and i bridled to myself like a schoolgirl caught in a delicious naughtiness to hear the fine thingsthe charms and marvelswhich my showman was bawling about me then one by one at first a little owlishly the great public at the charge of 6d per adult and half price for children or fullgrowns under 3 foot were admitted to the presence of the signorina donna angélique the fairy princess of andalusia in spain so at any rate declares the printed handbill  in the attitude of madame recamier in the picture i reclined on a lustrous spread of crimson satin and rabbitskin draped over a small lump of wood for bolster to give support to my elbow and out of my paint and powder from amid this oasisand with repeated warnings not to touch screamed by my gipsyi met as pleasantly and steadily as i could the eyes of the grinning smirking awestruck facestownsfolk and village folk all agape and all sound kentish stock  that isnt real shes a doll lisped a crêpebonneted little girl who with skimpy legs dangling out of her petticoat had been hoisted up under her armpits for a clearer view i let a little pause come then turned my head on my hand and smiled leaned over and eased my tinselled slipper an audible sigh sweet as incense went up under the hollow of the booth i looked on softly from face to faceanother dream some captive beast mewed and brushed against the sides of a cage drawn up a yard or two from where i lay the lamp poured flame and smoke the canvas quietly flapped and was still wild ramped the merrygoround with its bells and hootings and the panpipes sobbed their liquid decoy the signorinas first reception was over  news of her spread like wildfire i could hear the showman bellowing at the press of people his guineas were fructifying and a peculiar rapturous gravity spread over me when ones very self is wrapt in the ordeal of the passing moment is lost like that out of time and space it seems wellanother presence had stolen into my mind had taken possession i cannot explain but in this it may be all men are equal whatever their lot so i suppose a flower breaks out of the bud and butterflies put off the mask of the chrysalis and rainbows mount the skies but i must try not to rhapsodize all i know is that even in that low selfsurrender some tiny spark of life in me could not be content to let my body remain a mere mute stock for the ignorant wonder of those curious eyes  the actual impulse however came from a young woman who when next the people had streamed in chanced to be standing close beside me she was a weaklooking thing yet reminded me in a sorrowful fashion of fanny caught back by her melancholy empty eyes i seemed to lose myself in their darkness to realize that she too was in trouble i craned up from my wooden bolster and whispered in her hair patience patience there shall be a happy issue my dear out of all your afflictions  only she herself and a weedy sallow young man in her company could have heard these words a glint of fright and desperation sprang into her largepupilled eyes but i smiled and we exchanged kindness she moistened her lips turned from me and clutching at the young mans arm edged her way out of the throng and vanished  and what sort be this un roared an oxfaced redhaired man from the back this un hung on his shoulder tiptoe fair young and blowsy  shell coin you money i cried pleasantly and spend it the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world  and him and him the toad cried the girl halfangrily at the shout of merriment that had shaken the tent  why pretty maid piped i the nearer the wine the sweeter the cork the plumper the pig the fatter the pork the yell that followed was a better advertisement than drum or panpipes the showman had discovered an oracle for the next halfhour my booth was a mass of sixpenniesthe squirming threepennies were told to wait it filled and emptied again and again like a black bottle in the dog days and when the spirit moved me i singled out a telltale face and told its fortunenot less shrewdly on the whole i think than mrs ballards book of fate  but it was a strangely exhausting experience i was inexpressibly relieved when it was over when the tentflap descended for the last time and i could rest from my labours puffed up no doubt with far too rich a conceit of myself but immeasurably grateful and happy comparative quiet descended on the meadows from a neighbouring tent broke shattering bursts of music clapping and thumping the fretful growling of the beasts the elephants trumpeting the firing of guns whoops caterwauling and the jangling of harness the grand circus was in progress and fantasy made a picture for me of every sound  presently my showman reappeared leading in a pacing smoothskinned cinnamonandmilkdappled pony bridled and saddled with silver and scarlet his silky mane daintily plaited his tail a sweeping plume he stood i should guess about half a hand higher than my childhoods mopsathe prettiest pygmy creature though obviously morose and unsettled in temper i took a good long look at his pink albino eye but a knack once acquired is quickly recovered i mounted him the stirrup was adjusted one of my german plaits was dandled over my shoulder and after a leisurely turn or two in the open i nodded that the highborn angélique was ready  the showman leering avariciously at me out of his shifty eyes led us on towards the huge ballooning tent its pennon fluttering darkly against the stars i believe if in that spirituous moment he had muttered fly with me fairest all cares forgotten id have been gone he held his peace  the brass band within wrenched and blared into the tune of the girl i left behind me chafing pawing snorting my steed with its rider paused in the entry then with a last smirk of encouragement from the gipsy woman the rein was loosed i bowed my head and the next moment as if in a floating vat of light i found myself cantering wellnigh soundlessly round the ring its circumference thronged tier above tier in the smokeladen air with ghostwhite rings of faces  i smiled fixedly tossing my fingers a piebald clown came wambling in to meet me struck his hand on his foolish heart and fell flat in the tan love at first sight over his prostrate body we ambled the illtempered little beast naggling at its bit and doing his utmost to unseat me the music ceased the cloud of witnesses loured come night come nero i didnt care edging the furious little creature into the centre of the ring i mastered him wheeled him in a series of obeisancesnorth south east west a hurricanesuch as even mr bowater can never have outriddena hurricane of applause burst bounds and all but swept me out of the saddle goodbye sweetheart goodbye sang cornet and trombone with a toss i swept my plaits starwards brandished my whip at the faces and galloped out into the night  my début was over i confess itthe very memory of it carries me away even now and even now i would maintain that it was at least a little more successful than that other less professional début which poor mr crimble and lady pollacke had left unacclaimed in beechwood high street     chapter fortyseven   my showman his hard face sleek with sweat insisted on counting out three huge platelike crown pieces into my lapfor a douceur i brushed them off on to the ground only to clinch the bargain he said his teeth grinned at me as if he would gladly have swallowed me whole  pick up the money said i coldly determined once and for all to keep him in his place its early days yet but when my back was turned covetous adam took charge of it  while we trudged along homewardfor in the deserted night the cage was unnecessary until i was too tired to go furtheri listened to the coins clanking softly together in adams pocket it was an intoxicating lullaby but such are the revulsions of success for hours and hours that night i lay sleepless once i got up and put my hand in where the crowns were to assure myself i was awake but the dream which visited mebetween the watches of remorsei shall keep to myself  with next days sun the signorina had become the talk of the countryside and adams vacant face must have stood him in good stead she had been such a draw he told me that the showman had decided to stay two more nights on the same pitch which was fortunate for us both especially as on the third afternoon heavy rain fell converting the green field into a morass with evening the clouds lifted and a fulling moon glazed the puddles and dimmed the glowworm lamps impulse is a capricious master i did my best for even when intuition fails my sex theres obstinacy to fall back upon but all that i had formerly achieved with ease had to be forced out of me that night with endless effort the oracle was unwilling when a genteel yet foxy looking man with whiskers and a high stiff collar under his chin sneakishly invited me to tell his fortune and i replied that prudent chickens roost high the thrust was a little too deft my audience was amused but nobody laughed  he seemed to be well known and the green look he cast me proved that the truth is not always palatable or discreet unseduced by the lumps of sugar which i had pilfered for him my peevish mount jibbed and bucked and all but flung the princess of andalusia into the sodden ring he succeeded in giving a painful wrench to her wrist which doubled the applause  a strange thing happened to me too that night when for the second or third time the crowd was flocking in to view me my eyes chanced to fall on a figure standing in the clouded light a little apart he was dressed in a highpeaked hat and a long and seemingly brown cassocklike garment with buttoned tunic and silverbuckled leather belt spurs were on his boots a light whip in his hand aloof his head a little bowed down his face in profile he stood there framed in the opening dusky levelfeatured deepeyeda stranger  what in me rushed as if on wings into his silent company a passionate longing beyond words burned in me i seemed to be carried away into a boundless wildernessstunted trees salt in the air a low enormous stretch of night sky space and this man master of soul and solitude  he never heeded me raised not an eyelid to glance into my tent if he had what then i was a nothing when next after the press of people i looked he was gone i saw him no more yet the girlish remembrance remains consoling this superannuated heart like a goblet of flowers in that secret chamber of the mind we call the imagination  the fall from that giddy moment into this practical world was abrupt sulky tired with the rain and the cumbersome cage and the showmans insults on our arrival at monks house adam was completely unnerved when he found our usual entry locked and bolted  he gibbered at me like a mountebank in the windy moonlight his conical head blotting out half the cloudwracked sky these gallivantings were as much as his place was worth he would wring the showmans neck he had a nail in his shoe he had been respectable all his life and what was i going to do about it a nice kettle of fish oh yes he had had a lick or two of the old ladys tongue already and he didnt want another whats more there was the mealymouthed marvell to reckon with  once free of the cage i faced him and desired to know whether he would be happier if i wrote at once to mrs monnerie and absolved him there and then look at yourself in your own mind i bade him what a sight is a coward and i fixed him with none too friendly an eye under the moon  his clumsiness in opening a window disturbed mrs french she came to the head of the staircase and leaned over while we crouched in a recess beneath but while the beams of the candle she carried were too feeble to pierce the well of darkness between us by twisting round my head i could see every movement and changing expression of the shape above methe frilled redflannel dressinggown the shawl over her head and her inflamed peering face surmounted with a front of hair in pins she was talking to herself in peculiar guttural mutterings but soon either because she was too sleepy or too indolent to search further she withdrew again and adam and i were free to creep up the glooming shallow staircase into safety  last but not least when i came to undress i found that my grandfathers little watch was gone in a fever i tumbled my clothes over again and again then i sat down and in memory went over the events of the evening and came at last to the thief there was no doubt of hima smallheaded puny man who almost with tears in his eyes had besought me to give him one of my buttons to take home to his crippled little daughter he had pressed close my thoughts had been far away i confess this loss unnerved mea haggard face looked out of my glass i scrambled into bed and sought refuge as quickly as possible from these heartburnings  after such depressing experiences adams resolution was at an even lower ebb next morning we met together under the sunny whispering pinetrees i wheedled argued adjured him in vain almost at my wits end at last i solemnly warned him that if we failed the showman the following evening he would assuredly have the law against us a pretty pair we shall look adam standing up there in the dockwith the black cap and the wigs and the policemen and everything and not a penny for our pains  he squinted at me in unfeigned alarm at this the lump in his throat went up and down and though possibly i had painted the picture in rather sombre colours this settled the matter i hope it taught adam to fight shy ever afterwards of adventuresses it certainly taught this adventuress that the mind may be subdued to what it works in like the dyers hand i cast a look of hatred after the weak silly man as he disappeared between the trees  the circus so the showman had warned me was moving on that day to another market town whippingtonsix miles or so from its present pitch though not more than four miles further away from croomham this would mean a long and wearisome trudge for us the next evening as i found on consulting an immense map of kent yet my heart sighed with delight at the discovery that as the dove flies we should be a full five miles nearer to beechwood if this little church on the map was st peters and this faint shading the woody contour of the hill why then that square dot was wanderslore i sprawled over the outspread county with sublime content my very last appearance was at hand liberty but a few hollow hours away  it is true i had promised my showman to think over his invitation to me to sign on as a permanent member of his troupe of clowns acrobats wild beasts and monstrosities he had engaged in return to pay me in full with a bit over at the close of the last performance but i had merely laughed and nodded not that i was in any true sense ashamed of what i had done not ashamed  but you cannot swallow your pride and your niceness without any discomfort i was conscious of a hardening of the skin of a grimness stealing over my mouth and of a tendency to stare at the world rather more boldly than modesty should at least so it seemed in reality it may have been that life was merely scraping off the cream quite a wholesome experience  on the practical side all was well two pounds to adam which i had promised to make three if he earned it would leave me with thirteen or twelve pounds odd apart from my clumsy douceur i thirsted for my wages with that sumtwo fivepound notes and say four halfsovereignssewn up if possible in my petticoat i should once more be my own mistress and i asked no more for the moment the future must take care of itself on one thing i was utterly resolvednever never to return to monks house or to no 2to that old squalid luxury dissembling and humiliation  no my monnerie days were over even though it had taken a full pound of their servile honey to secrete this ounce of rebellious wax  how oddly chance events knit themselves together that very morning i had received a belated and readdressed letter which smote like sunbeams on my hopes and plans it was from mrs bowater        dear miss mi send this line to say that i am still in the land      of the living i have buried my poor husband but have hopes some      day of bringing him home england is england when alls said and      done and i cant say i much approve of foreign parts its a fine      town and not what you might call foreign to look at the buildings      but moist and flat and the streets like a draughtboard and the      thought of the cattle upsets me everything topsyturvy too with      spring coming along and breaking out and we here on the brink of      september it has been an afflicting time though considering all      things he made a peaceful end with a smile on his face as you      would hardly consider possible       the next fortnight will see me on board the steamer again which i      can scarcely support the thought of though please god i shall      see it through i have spent many days alone here and the      strangeness of it all and the foreign faces bring up memories which      are happier forgotten but im often thinking what fine things you      must be doing in that fine place not as i think riches will buy      everything in this worldand a mercy tooor that im not anxious      at times you dont come to harm with that delicate frame and all      wrap up warm miss be watchful of your victuals and keep early      hours such being so im still hoping when i come home if im      spared you may be of a mind to come to beechwood hill again and      maybe settle down       i may say that i had my suspicions for some time that that young      mr anon was consumptive in the lungs but from what i gathered he      isnt only suffering from a stomach coughbad cooking and      exposing himself in all weathers i will say nothing nearer i      shall be easier off as money goes but you and me neednt think of      that fanny doesnt write much and which i didnt much expect she      is of an age now which must reap as it has sown though even      allowing for the accident of birth as they say a mothers a      mother till the end of the chapter i must now close may the lord      bless you miss wherever you may be       yours truly       e bowater mrs   surely this letter was a good omen it cheered me and yet it was disquieting too that afternoon i spent in the garden wandering irresolutely up and down under the blue sky and fretting at the impenetrable wall of time that separated me from the longedfor hour of freedom on a sunny stone near a foresty bed of asparagus i sat down at last tired and a little dispirited i was angry with myself for the last nights failure and for a kind of weakness that had come over me yet how different a creature was here today from that of only a week ago from the darkened soil the stalks sprang up stiffened and green with rain a snail reared up her horns beneath my stone an azure butterfly alighted on my knee slowly fanning its turquoise wings patterned with a delicate narrow black band on the one side and spots of black and orange like a paisley shawl beneath between silverknobbed antennæ its furry perplexed face and shining eyes looked out at me sharing my warmth i watched it idly how long we had been strangers and surely the closer one looked at anything that was not of mans making my thoughts drifted away i began daydreaming again  and it seemed that life was a thing that had neither any plan nor any purpose that i was sunk as if in a bog in ignorance of why or where or who i truly was the days melted on to be lost or remembered the spring into summer and then winter and death what was the meaning of it allthis enormous ocean of time and space in which i was lost never else than a stranger that couldnt be true of the men and women who really keep the worlds pot boiling all i could pray for was to sit like this for a while undisturbed and at peace with my own heart peacedid i so much as know the meaning of the word how dingy a patchwork i had made of everything and how customary were becoming these little passing fits of repining and remorse the one sole thing that comforted meapart from my blue butterflywas an echo in my head of those clapping hands whoops and catcallsand the white staring faces in the glare and a few months ago this would have seemed an incredible degradation  there stole into memory that last evening at wanderslore what would he think of me now i had done worse than forget him had learned in one single instant that for ever and ever however dearly i liked and valued him and delighted in his company i could not be in love with him i hid my face in my hands yet a curious quiet wish for his company sprang up in me how stiffnecked and affected i had been love was nothing but cheating let me but confess explain ask forgiveness unburden myself those hollow temples that jutting jaw the way he stooped on his hands and coughed my greataunt kitilda had died in her youth of consumption a sudden dread like a skeleton out of the sky stood up in my mind there was no time to delay tomorrow night adam or no adam i would set off to find him all would be well  as if in response to my thought a shadow stole over the stones beside me i looked up andaghastsaw fanny     chapter fortyeight   her head was turned away from me a striped parasol leaned over her shoulder with a faintly defiant tilt of her beautiful head as if exclaiming see strangeness i come she stepped firmly on over the turf a breath of some delicate indoor perfume was wafted across to my nostrils i clung to my stone watching her  simply because it seemed a meanness to play the spy on her in her solitude i called her name but her start of surprise was mere feigning the silk of her parasol encircled her shoulders like an immense nimbus her eyes dwelt on me as if gathering up the strands of an unpleasing memory  ah midgetina she called softly it is you is it on your little stone are you better the very voice seemed conscious of its own cadences what a delicious old garden the contrast  the contrast with a cold gathering apprehension at my heart i glanced around me why was it that of all people only fanny could so shrink me up like this into my body and there floated back to remembrance the vast dazzling room the flowerclotted table and in that hideous vertigo a face frenzied with disgust and rage a hand flung out to cast me off but i entered her trap none the less  contrast fanny  no no now my dear not quite so disingenuous as all that please you cant have quite forgotten the last time we met  there was nothing in that fanny only that the midge was drunk you should see the wasps over there in the nectarines  only she echoed lightly raising her eyebrows i am not sure that every one would put it quite like that you couldnt see yourself you see they call you little miss cassandra now woe woe you know mrs monnerie asked me if i thought you wereyou knowall there as they say  i dont care what they say  if i werent an old friend she returned with crooked lip you might be made to care i have brought the money you were kind enough to lend me ill give it you when i have unpackedtomorrow night  my body sank into a stillness that might well have betrayed its minds confusion to a close observer had she lingered satirically meaningly on those two last words i dont want the money fanny arent you generous enough to accept a gift  well said she it needs a good deal of generosity sometimes surely a gift depends upon the spirit in which it is given that last little message nowwas that shall we say an acceptable gift her tones lost their silkiness see here midgetina she went on harshly you and i are going to talk all this out but im thirsty i hate this spawning sun where are the nectarines  much against my will i turned my back on her and led her off to the beehives  one for you she said stooping forward balancing the sheeny toe of her shoe on the brown mould and the rest for me catch she dropped a waspbitten pulpy fruit into my hands now then its shadier here no eavesdroppers just you and me and god please sit down  there was no choice down i sat and she on a low wooden seat opposite me in the shade her folded parasol beside her the leafhung wall behind she bit daintily into the juicy nectarine poised between finger and thumb and watched me with a peculiar fixed smile as if of admiration on her pale face  tell me pretty binbin she began again what is the name of that spiked red and blue and violet thing behind your back it colours the edges of your delicate china cheeks most becoming  it was vipers buglossa stray i told her shifting my head uneasily beneath her scrutiny  ah yes vipers bugloss personally i prefer the common variety though no doubt that may stray too but fie fie you naughty thing she sprang up and plucked another nectarine you have been blacking your eyebrows i shouldnt have dreamt it of you what would mother say  listen fanny i said pronouncing the words as best i could with a tongue that seemed to be sticking to the roof of my mouth i am tired of the garden what do you really want to say to me i dont much care for youryour fun  and i just beginning to enjoy it theres contrarinessto say well now a good deal my dear i thought of writing but its bettersafer to talk the first thing is this while you have been malingering down here i have had to face the whole monnerie orchestra it hasnt been playing quite in tune and you know why that lovesick susan now and her nice young man but since you seem to be quite yourself againmore of yourself than ever in fact listen i gazed almost hypnotized through the sunshine into her shady face  what i am going to suggest she went on smoothly concerns only you and me if you and i are to go on living in the same housewhich heaven forbidi give you fair warning that we shall have nothing more to do with one another than is absolutely inevitable i am not so forgiving as i ought to be midgetina and insults rankle treachery still more the low voice trembled  oh yes you may roll your innocent little eyes and look as harmless as a chinese god but answer me this am i a hypocrite am i and while you are thinking it over hadnt you better tumble that absurd little pumpkin off your knee its staining your charming frock  i never said you were a hypocrite i choked  no the light gleamed on the whites of her eyes as they roved to and fro then i say you are fair to face false to back who first trapped me out stargazing in the small hours then played informer who wheedled her way on with her mincing humbugpoof naïvetéand set my own mother against me who told some oneyou know whothat i was not to be trusted and far better castoff who stuffed that lackadaisical idiot of a sukie monnerie with all those old horrors who warned that miserable little piece of deformity that i might comeborrowing who hoped to betray me by sending an envelope through the post packed with mousey bits of paper who made me a guy a laughingstock and poisoned oh its a long score miss m when i think of it all what ive enduredwell honestly when a wasp crawls out of my jam i remind myself that its stinged  the light smouldering eyes held me fast you mean i suppose fanny that youd just kill it i mumbled looking up into her distorted face i dont think i should much mind even that but its no use it would take hours to answer your questions you have only put them your own way they may sound true but in your heart you know they are false why should you bother to hurt me you knowyou know how idiotically i loved you  loved me false kill echoed fanny scornfully with a leer which transformed her beauty into a mere vulgar grimace is there any end to the deceits of the little gaby do you really suppose that to be loved is a new experience for me that im not smeared with it wherever i go that i care a snap of my fingers whether im loved or not that i couldnt win through without that is that what you suppose well then heres one more secret open your ears i am going to marry percy maudlen yes that weed of a creature you may remember my little prophecy when he brought his aunt alices manikin some lollipops well the grace of god is too leisurely and since you and i are both i suppose of the same sex i tell you i care no more for him than that she flung the nectarine stone at the beehive and i defy you defy you to utter a word i am glad i was born what i am all your pretty little triumphs first to last what are theyaccidents and insults isnt half the world kicking down the faces of those beneath them on the ladder i have had to fight for a place and i tell you this i am going to teach these supercilious moneysmelling ladies a lesson i am going to climb till i can sneer down on them and mrs monnerie is going to help me she doesnt care a jot for god or man but she enjoys intelligence and loves a fighter is that candour is it now  i detest percy maudlen i replied faintly and as for sneering that only makes another wall oh fanny do listen to yourself to what you are i swear im not the sneak you think me id help you if i could to my last breath indeed i would yes and soon i can  thank you and id rather suffocate than accept your helpnow listen to myself indeed thats just the pious hypocrite all over well declarations of love you know quite enough about for yourfor your age now you shall hear one of a different kind i tell you midgetina i hate you i cant endure the sight or sound or creep or thought of you any longer why because of your unspeakable masquerade you play the pygmy pygmy you are carried about cosseted smirked at fattened on nightingales tonguesthe last though youll ever eat but where have you come from what are you in your pastin your mind i ask you that a thing more everywhere more thieflike more detestable than a conscience look at me as we sit here now i am the monstrosity you see it you think it you hate even to touch me from first moment to last you have secretly despised meme im not accusing you you werent your own maker as often as not you dont know what you are saying you are just an automaton but these last nights i have lain awake and thought of it all it came on me as if my life had been nothing but a filthy aimless nightmare and chiefly because of you ive worked ive thought ive contrived and forced my way oh that house the wranglings the sermons did i make myself what i am ask to be born no its all a devilish plot and i say this that while things are as they are and this life is life and this world my world i refuse to be watched and taunted and goaded and defamed  her face stooped closer fascinating chilling me like a cold cloud with its bright hunted malevolent stare she stretched out a hand and wrung my shoulder listen i say come out of that trance i loathe you you holy imp you haunt me  my eyes shut i sat shivering empty of self listening as if lost in a fog in a place desperately strange to me and only a distant sea breaking and chafing on its stones far below then once more i became conscious of the steady and resolute droning of the bees felt the breathing of actuality on my hair on my cheek my eyes opened on a garden sucked dry of colour and reality and sought her out she had left me was standing a few paces distant now looking back as if dazed her lips pale her eyes darkringed  perhaps you didnt quite hear all that midgetina you led me on you force things out of me till i am sick but some day when you are as desperate as i have been it will come back to you then youll know what it is to be human but there cant be any misunderstanding left now can there  i shook my head no fanny i shall know you hate me  and i am free  what could she mean i nodded  she turned pushed up her parasol what a talk but better done with  yes fanny said i obediently much better done with  she gave me an odd glance out of the corner of her eye the queer thing is she went on what i wanted to say was something quite quite different to give you a friendly word of warning entirely on your own account you have a rival midgetina  the words glided away into silence the doves crooned on the housetop the sky was empty above the distant hills i did not stir and am thankful i had the cowardice to ask no questions  her name is angélique she lives in a castle in spain sighed the calm silky voice with the odd break or rasp in it i knew so well oh i agree a circusrider is nothing better than a mongrel a pariah worse probably yet this one has her little advantages as midgets go she beats you by at least four inches and rides sings dances tells fortunes quite a little woman of the world the only really troublesome thing about it is that she makes you jiltable my dear they are so very seductive these flounced up painted things no principle and oh my dear all this just as dear mrs monnerie has set her heart on finding her queen bee a nice little adequate drone for a husband  it was her last taunt it was over i had heard the worst the arrow i had been waiting for had sprung true to its mark its barb was sticking there in my side and yet as i mutely looked up at her i knew there was a word between us which neither could utter the empty air had swallowed up the sound of our voices its enormous lookingglass remained placid and indifferent it was as if all that we had said or for that matter suffered was of no account simply because we were not alone for the first instant in the intimacy of my love and hatred fanny seemed to be just any young woman standing there spiteful meaningless the virtue had gone out of her she made up her mouth glanced uneasily over her shoulder and turned away  we were never again to be alone together except in remembrance   i sat on in the garden till the last thin ray of sunlight was gone then in dread that my enemy might be looking down from the windows of the house i slipped and shuffled from bush to bush in the dusk and so at last made my way into the house and climbed the dark polished staircase as stealthily i passed a bedroom door ajar my look pierced through the crevice it was a long stretching shallow room and at the end of it in the crystal quiet stood fanny her arms laid on the chimneypiece her shoulder blades sticking out of her muslin gown her face hidden in her hands  why did i not venture in to speak to her i had never seen a figure so desolate and forsaken could things ever be so far gone as to say no to that i hesitated turned away she would think i had come only to beg for mercy  for hours i sat dully brooding what a trap i was in in my rummagings in the monnerie library i had once chanced on a few yellow cardboardcovered novels tucked away in a cupboard and had paddled in one or two of them now i realized that my life also was nothing but a shocker so people actually suffered and endured the horrible things written about in cheap common books  one by one i faced fannys charges in my mind none was true yet none was wholly false and none was of any consequence beside the fact that she execrated the very self in me of which i could not be conscious and what would she do what did all those covert threats and insinuations mean a husbandwhy had that such a dreadful power to wound me i heard my teeth begin to chatter again there was no defence no refuge anywhere if i could get no quiet i should go mad i looked up from my stool it was dark it was a scene made for me i could watch the miserable little occupant of its stage roving to and fro like one of my showmans cowed mangy beasts  the thought of the day still ahead of me through which i must somehow press on keep alive half stupefied me with dread we can shut our eyes and our mouths and our hearts why cannot we stop thinking the awful passive order of life its mechanicalness all that i could see was the blank white face of its clockbut no more of the wheels than of the winder no haste no intervention no stretchingout beyond ones finger tips so the world wore away life decayed the dunghill smoked mrs monnerie there stepping into her brougham ebony cane in hand marvell at her elbow mrs bowater languishing on board ship limp head in stiff frilling sir walter dumb the showman cursing his wretched men the bills being posted the implacable future mutely yawning the past unutterable everything in its orbit was there no help no refuge  the door opened and the skimpy little country girl who waited on me in flemings absence brought in my supper she bobbed me a scared curtsey and withdrew then she too had been poisoned against me i flung myself down on the floor crushing my hands against my ears yet through all this dazed helplessness in one resolve i never faltered i would keep my word to the showman and this night that was now in my room should be the last i would spend alive in monks house fanny must do her worst thoughts of her of my unhappy love and of her cruelty could bring no good yet i thought of her no less her very presence in the house lurked in the air in the silence like an apparitions  still stretched on the floor i woke to find the september constellations faintly silvering the pale blue crystal of the northern lights and the earth sighing as if for refuge from the rising moon my fears and troubles had fallen to rest beneath my dreams and i prepared myself for the morrows flight     chapter fortynine   when next fanny and i met it was in the cool greygreen summery drawingroom at monks house and mrs monnerie and susan shared tea with us one covert glance at mrs monneries face had reassured me that strange mask was as vigilant and secretive but as serene as when it had first smiled on me in the mauves and gildings of brunswick house she had set her world right again and was at peace with mankind as complacently as ever she stretched me out her finger she had not even taken the trouble to forgive me for my little scene had let it perish of its own insignificance oh i thought if i could be as lifesize as that i did not learn till many days afterwards however that she had had news of me from france good news which sir w trusting in my patience and commonsense had kept back from me until he could deliver it in person and we could enjoy it together  only one topic of conversation was ours that afternoonthat amazing prodigy of nature the spanish princess mrs monneries one regret that she herself had not discovered a star of such ineffably minute magnitude yet her teasing and sarcasm were so nimble and goodhumoured she insinuated so pleasantly her little drolleries and innuendoes that even if miss m had had true cause for envy and malice she could have taken no offence far from it  i looked out of the long open windows at the dipping flittering wagtails on the lawn shrugged my shoulders made little mouths at her with every appearance of wounded vanity did she really think i inquired earnestly that that shameless creature was as lovely as the showmans bills made her out to be mightnt it all be a cheat a trick didnt they always exaggeratejust to make money the more jovially she enjoyed my discomfiture nodding her head swaying in her chair the more i enjoyed my duplicity the real danger was that i should be a little too clever overact my part and arouse her suspicions  ah you little know you little know i muttered to myself sharply conscious the while of the still threatening presence of fanny but she meant to let me gothat was enough it was to be good riddance to bad rubbish there was nothing to fear from heryet her eyes lightly dwelling on me over her chelsea teacup she sat drinking us in well she should never taunt me with not having played up to her conception of me   well well mrs monnerie concluded all it means my dear is that you are not quite such a rarity as we supposed who is theres nothing unique in this old world though character even bad character never fails to make its mark ask mr pellew  but surely mrs monnerie said i it isnt character to sell yourself at twopence a look  mere scruples poppet she retorted think of it if only you could have pocketed that pretty little fastidiousness of yours the newspapers would now be ringing with your fame and the fortune you are too pernickety arent we all of us on show and arent nine out of ten of us striving to be more on show than we are entitled to be if mans first disobedience and the rest of it doesnt mean that then what i ask you mademoiselle bas bleu was the sour old puritan so concerned about assist me susan if i stumble  i wish i could aunt alice said susan sweetly cutting the cake you must ask miss bowater  please miss monnerie drawled fanny  whether or not said mrs monnerie crisply i beseech you children dont quarrel about it there is our beloved sovereign on her throne and there the last innocent little victim in its cradle and theres the old sun waggishly illuminating the whole creaking stage blind beggar and dog toby artists authors parsons statesmenheart and everything else or everything else but heart on sleeveand all on showevery one of themat something a look no my dear theres only one private life the next and according to some accounts that will be more public than ever and so twirls the merrygoround  her voice relapsed as it were into herself again and she drew in her lips she looked about her as if in faint surprise and in returning to its usual expression it seemed to me that her countenance had paused an instant in an exceedingly melancholy condition perhaps she had caught the glint of sympathy in my eye  but isnt that all choice mrs monnerie i leaned forward to ask and arent some people what one might call conspicuous simply because they are really and truly as it were superior to other people i dont mean betterjust superior  i think mrs monnerie murmured fanny deprecatingly shes referring to that ad infinitum jingleabout the fleas you know or was it dr watts midgetina  never mind about dr watts said mrs monnerie flatly the point from which we have strayed my dear is that even if you were not born great you were born exquisite and now heres this angélique rigmarole her face creased up into its old goodhumoured facetiousness was it three inches miss bowater  four mrs monnerie lipped fanny suavely  four pooh still thats what they say half a head or more my dear more exquisite perfect nonsense of course its physically impossible these radical newspapers and the absinthe too her small blackbrown eyes roamed round a little emptily absinthe was that a fanny story but there my child she added easily you shall see for yourself we dine with the padgwicksteggals and then go on together so thats settled it will be my first travelling circus since i was a child most amusing if the lion doesnt get out and theres none of those horrible accidents on the trapeze one goes in hope to see by the way miss bowater your letter was posted  oh yes mrs monneriethis afternoon but as you know i was a little doubtful about the address she hastened to pass me a plate of buttonsized ratafias and mrs monnerie slowly turned a smiling but not quite ingenuous face aside  what a curious experience the circus will be for you midgetina fanny was murmuring softly glancing back over her shoulder towards the teatable personally i believe the signorina angélique and the rest of it is only one of those horrible twisted up prodigies with all the bones out of place mightnt it mrs monnerie be a sort of shock you know for miss m shes still a little pale and peaky  she shall come i say and see for herself replied mrs monnerie petulantly  there was a pause mrs monnerie gazed vacantly at the tiers of hothouse flowers that decorated the windowrecess susan sate with a little forked frown between her brows she never seemed to derive the least enjoyment from this amiable harmless midgetbaiting not at any rate one hundredth part as much as i did fanny set plum begging for yet another ratafia and then after a long deep breath my skin all gooseflesh i looked straight across at my old friend  i dont think mrs monnerie i said if you dont mindi dont think i really wish to go  as if joshua had spoken the world stood still  mrs monnerie slowly turned her head another headache  no im perfectly well thank you but whatever i may have said i dont approve of that poor creature showing herself forfor money she is selling herself it must be because theres no other way out  finger and thumb outstretched above the cringing little dog fanny was steadily watching me with a jerk of my whole body i turned on her you agreed with me fanny didnt you in the garden yesterday afternoon  placidly drooped her lids trust plum trust  what croaked mrs monnerie you miss bowater guilty of that silly punctilio she was merely humouring you child it will be a most valuable experience you shall be perfectly protected pride eh or is it jealousy now what would you say if i promise to try and ransom the poor creaturebuy her out pension her off would that be a nice charitable little thing to do she might make you quite a pleasant companion  ah mrs monnerie please let me buy her out let me be the intermediary i found myself hands clasped in lap yearningly stooping towards her just like a passionate young lady in a novel  she replied ominously knitting her thick dark eyebrows and hows that to be done pray if you sulk here at home  i think aunt alice its an excellent plan cried susan much much more considerate she could write think of all those horrible people the poor thing may have been kidnapped forced to do her silly tricks like one of those wretched little barberedup french poodles anyhow i dont suppose shes thereor anywhere else for that matterfor fun  even susans sympathy had its sting  thank you susan was mrs monneries acid retort your delicate soul can always be counted on but advice my child is much the more valuable when asked for  of course i mustnt interfere mrs monnerie interposed fanny sweetly but wouldnt it perhaps be as well for you to see the poor thing first she maynt be quitequite a proper kind of person may she at least thats what the newspapers seem to suggest not of course that miss m wouldnt soon teach her better manners  mrs monneries head wagged gently in time to her shoe hm theres something in that miss worldlywise reports dont seem to flatter her but still i like my own way best poppet must come and see after all she should be the better judge  never before had mrs monnerie so closely resembled a puffedout tawny owl  i looked at her fixedly shook my head no no judge i spluttered im sorry mrs monnerie but i wont go  there was no misdoubting her anger now the brows forked the looseskinned hands twitched she lifted herself in her chair wont she said you vex me child and pray dont wriggle at me in that hysterical fashion you are beside yourself trembling like a mouse you have been mooning alone too much i can see run away and nurse that silly head and at the same time thank heaven that you have more time and less need of the luxury than some one else we know of it may be a low life but it needs courage ill say that for her  she swept her hands to her knees over her silken lap and turned upon susan     wanderslore     chapter fifty   i had been dismissed but mrs monneries anger had a curious potency for a moment i could scarcely see out of my eyes and the floor swayed under me as i scrambled down from my chair it took me at least a minute even with the help of a stool to open the door  like a naughty child i had been put in the corner and then sent to bed good there could be no going back now i could count on fannythe one thing she asked was to be free of me as for mrs monnerie her flushed and sullen countenance convinced me that my respite would be undisturbed there was only impulsive susan to think of and as if in answer there came a faint tap and the door softly opened to admit her gentle head and shoulders  ah my dear she whispered across at me im so sorry and so helpless dont take it too hardly i have been having my turn too  i twisted round wet face and hands as i stood stooping over my washbowl on its stool scrutinized her speechlessly and shook a dizzy head the door shut dearest susan as i think of her i seem to see one of those tiny tiny building rotifers collecting out of reality its exquisite house grace courage lovingkindness if i had been the merest miss hopomythumb i should still have been the coarsest little monster by comparison  scarce three safe hours remained to me i must be off at once to go looking for adam was out of the question even if i could find him i dared not risk him would it be possible for me to cover my six miles or more across undiscovered country in a hundred and eighty minutes in my bowater days perhaps but there had been months of idle fatted indoor no 2 in between a last forlorn dishonest project banished already more than once from my mind again thrust itself upto creep off to the nearest post office and with one of my crown pieces for a telegram cast myself on the generosity of mr anon no no i couldnt cheat myself like that  i was ready i pinned to the carpet a message for adam in case he should dare to be faithful to mejust four scribbled uncompromising words the bird is flown with eyes fixed on a starry knot of wood at the threshold i stood for a while with head bent listening at my door i might have been pausing between two worlds the house was quiet no voice cried stay i bowed solemnly to the gentle silent room behind me and with a prayer between my teeth bundle in hand stepped out into the future  unchallenged unobserved i slipped along the bluecarpeted corridor down the wide stairs and out of the porch after dodging from tree to tree from shrub to shrub along the meandering drive i turned off and skirting the lodge through a seeding forest of weeds and grasses squeezed through the railings and was in the lane from my map of kent i had traced out a rough little sketch of the route i must follow with the sun on my left hand i set off almost due north how still the world was in that silkblue sky with its placid mountainous clouds there was no heed of human doings  the shoes i had chosen were good sound bowaters and as i trudged on my spirits rose high i breathed in deep draughts of the sweet september air thomasina of bedlam had been summoned to tourney the wide worlds end no journey in sober fact it was a sorry little wretch of a young female scarcely more than a girl that went panting along in the dust and stones scrambling into cover of ditch and hedge at every sound or sight of life i look at her now and smile poor thing it needed at any rate a pinch of courage  cottages came into sight at an open door i heard the clatter of crockery and a woman scolding a child two gates beyond motionless as a block of wood an old old man stood leaning out of his garden of dahlias and tarnishing goldenrod in an instant in the dumb dust i was under his nose his clay pipe shattered on the stone like a wagtail i flitted and scampered all in a breath that little danger was safely over but it was not ruminating old gentlemen who caused me apprehension youthful adam waggetts were my dread  at the foot of the slope there came a stile and a footpath winding off nw but still curving in my direction i hesitated any risk seemed better than the hedgedin publicity of this dusty lane ducking under the stile i climbed the hill and presently found myself clambering across an immense hummocky field part stubble part fresh plough then a meadow and cows then once more downhill a drowsy farmyard with its stacks and calves and chickens to the left and at bottom of the slope a filthy quagmire where an immense sow wallowed giving suck to her squalling piglets her glinting amorous eyes took me in stone on to stone i skipped across a brook dowsing one leg to the thigh in its bubbling water it was balm in gilead for i was in a perfect fume of heat and my lungs were panting like bellows  i sat down for a breathing space on the sunset side of a haystack in the shade of the hazels on the verge of the green descending field rabbits were feeding and playing and i began to think supposing i did reach the new pitch in time the wreck i should be then mrs monnerieand fanny my thoughts skimmed hastily on what then as soon as my showman had paid me i must creep away by myself out of sight at once that was certain i must tell him that adam was waiting for me and then well after a few hours rest in some shed or under a haystack somehow or other i should have to find out the way and press on to wanderslore thered be a full moon that would be a comfort i knew the night once safely there with money in my pocket i could with a perfectly free conscience ask mr anon to find me a lodging perhaps not very far from his own a laughable situation but we would be the best of friends now that all thatthat nonsense was over a deep sigh drawn as it were from the depths of my bowels rose up and subsided what a strange thing that one must fall in love couldnt jump into it and then well mrs bowater would soon be home and perhaps sir walter had circumvented the harrises suppose not well even at the very worst at say ten say even fifteen shillings a week my thirteen pounds would last me for months and months say four  and as i said four a gate clackedto not many yards distant and a slow footfall sounded fortunately for me the path i had been following skirted the other side of my haystack gathering myself close under the hay i peeped out a tall spare man in a low peaked cap and leather leggings came cautiously swinging along his face was long lean severe his eyes were fixed in a steady gaze as if he were a human automaton stalking on and the black barrel of a gun sloped down from under his arm i drew in closer his footsteps passed died away the evening breeze blew chill a few moments afterwards a shattering report came echoing on from wood to wood seeming to knock on my very breastbone this was no place for me with one scared glance at the huddling wood i took to my heels nor paused until the path through the spinney became so rutted that i was compelled to pick my way  a cold gloom had closed in on my mind i cursed clodhopping shoes and bundle envied the dead rabbit that had danced its airy dance and was done as likely as not i had already lost my way and i plodded on along the stony paths pausing only to quench my thirst with the rough juice of the blackberries that straggled at the wayside i wonder if the knight of furious fancies was as volatile  but yet another shock was awaiting me the footpath dipped there came a hedge and another stile and i scuffled down the bank into the very lane which i had left more than an hour ago i knew that white house on the hill had seen it with adam under the moon it stood not much more than a mile from the lodge gates my short cut had been a detour and now the sun was down  i drew back and examined my scribble of map there was no help for it henceforward i must keep to the road my thick shoes beat up the dust one of my heels had blistered my bundle grew heavier with every step but fear had left me some other master cracked his whip at me as i shambled on as doggedly and devilmaycare as a tramp  i was stooping in the wayside ditch in one more attempt to ease my foot when once again i heard hoofs approaching with head pushed between the dusty tussocks i stared along the flat white road a small and seemingly empty cart was bowling along in the dust as it drew near my ears began to sing my heart stood still i knew that battered cart that roughhaired thicklegged pony suddenly i craned up in horror for it seemed that the face peering low over the splashboard in my direction was that of a deathshead grinning at me out of its gloom then with a cry of joy i was up and out into the road hi hi i screamed up at him  it was mr anon the pony was reined back on to its haunches the cart stood still and my stranger and i were incredulously gazing at one another as if across eternity as if all the world beside were a dream that asked no awakening  half dragged and half lifted into the cart by what signs i could for speech was impossible i bade him turn back it unmanned me to see the quiet and love in his face without a word he wheeled the rearing pony round under the elmboughs and for many minutes we swung on together at an ungainly gallop swaying from this side to that the astonishment of every wayfarer we met or overtook on our way at length he turned into a grasstrack under a rusting hedge festooned with woodbine and feathery travellers joy and we smiled at one another as if in all history there had never been anything quite so strange as this  you are ill he said oh my dear what have they done to you  i denied it emphatically wiping my cheeks and forehead with the hem of my skirtfor my handkerchief was stuffed into my shoe look at me i smiled up at him confident and happy was my face lying about me oh i knew what a dreadful object i must be but then ive been tramping for hours and hours in the dust and whyhavent you come to meet me to give me a lift  what foolish speeches makes a happy heart indeed mr anon had come to meet me but not exactly there and then he fetched out of his pocket the minute note that had summoned him here it is still faintly scented        mrs monnerie sends her compliments and would miss ms friend      very kindly call at monks house croomham at three oclock on      friday afternoon mrs monnerie is anxious about miss ms health   oh fanny fanny precisely how far she had taken mrs monneries name in vain in this letter i have never inquired and now i suppose mrs percy maudlen would not trouble to tell me but i can vow that in spite of the grime on my face the happiest smile shone through as i stuffed it into my bodice so this was all that her harrowing husband had come toa summoning of friend to friend if every little malicious plot ended like this what a paradise the world would be all tiredness passed away though perhaps it continued to effervesce in my head a little it seemed that i had been climbing on and on and now suddenly the mist had vanished and mountain and snow lay spread out around me in eternal peace and solitude if susan monneries was my first strangers kiss mr anons were my quietest tears  his crazy cart seemed more magical than all the carpets of arabia i poured out my storythough not quite to its dregs this very afternoon i told him i was writing to youin my mind and you see you have come the shaggy pony tugged at the coarse grass i could hear the trickling sands in the great hour glass and chattered on in vain hope to hold them back  you are not listening only watching i blamed him  his lips moved he glanced away yet i had already foreseen the conflict awaiting me and all his arguments and entreaties that i should throw over the showman and drive straight on with him into the gathering evening towards wanderslore were in vain  look he said as if for straw to break the camels back and drew out by its ribbon my bowater latchkey  no said i not even that i sleep out tonight and surely surely i kept repeating he must understand how could i possibly be at rest with a broken promise what cared i now for what was past and gone think what a joy what sheer fun it would be to face mrs monnerie for the last time and she unaware of it nothing nothing could amuse her more when she hears of it he should come and see hear the crowd yell he mustnt be so solemn about things do try and see the humour of it i besought him  but the moneythat little incentivei kept to myself  he stared heavily into the silvery copse that bordered the track motionless in their bright withering leaves its trees hung down their tasselled branches beneath the darkening sky then much against his will he turned his pony towards the high road the wheel gridded on a stone he raised his whip  hst i whispered clutching at the arm that held the rein crouching low we watched the great monnerie carriage with its stiffnecked blinkered stepping greys and gleaming lamps sweep by  there i laughed up at him lifting myself one hand upon his knee there but for the grace of god goes miss m  the queer creature frowned into my smiling face and flicked the pony with his whip and here he muttered moodily who knows but by the grace of god go i   anxiety gone now and responsibility but a light thing my tongue rattled on quite as noisily as the cart kents rich cornfields were around us their stubble a pale washedout gold in the last light of evening here and there on the hills a row or two of ungarnered stooks stood solemnly carved out against the sky most of the hopgardens too had been dismantled though a few we passed with their slowtwirling dusky vistas and labyrinths were still wreathed with bines their scent drifted headily on the stillness and as with eyes peeping over the edge of the cart i watched these beloved homelike hills and fields and orchards glide by i shrilled joyfully at my companion every thought and fancy that came into my head many of them no doubt recent deposits from the library at no 2  i told him i remember how tired i was of the pernicketiness of my life and amused him with a description of my tank you would hardly believe it but i have never once heard the least faint whisper of water in it and if i had been a nice simple savage i dare say i should have prayed to it instead of which when one night i saw a star over the housetop i merely shrugged my shoulders my mind was so rancid i hated it i was so shut in thats what it was  he stroked the little thickcoated horse with the lash of his whip and smiled round at me  on i went shouldnt life be a high road didnt he think surely not a hot silly zigzag of short cuts leading back to the place you started from and you too old or stupid perhaps to begin again didnt he hunger too to see the great things of the world the ruins of babylon the wall of china the himalayas and the pyramidsat nightblack and sand  my ghost said i had he ever thought of the enormous solitudes of the sahara or those remote places where gigantic images stare blindly through the centuries at the starstheir builders just a pinch of dust some day i promised him out of the abandonment of my heart we would sail away he and i to his pygmy land surf and snow and singing sanddunes and fruits on the trees and birds in the air we would liveoh happy as all this and i swept my hands across hill and dale ever ever afterwards as they do mr anon in those absurd incredible fairytales you know  he smiled again cast a look into the distance touched my hand  perhaps he was wishing the while that that piercing pining voice of mine would keep silence so that my presence might not disturb his own brooding thoughts i could only guess at pleasing him yet i felt still feel that he was glad of my company and never for a moment sorry we had met     chapter fiftyone   but our brief hour was drawing to an end we were now passing little groups of country people and children in the quiet evening we ourselves talked no more the old pony plodded up yet another hill we went clattering down its deep descent and there in the green bowl of a meadow sloping down from its woody fringes above lay scattered the bellying booths the gaudy wagons and cages of the circus all but hidden in the trees above them a crooked tarnished weathercock glinted in the sunset afterglow lights twinkled against the dying daylight the brightpainted merrygoround with its staring motionless galloping horses was bathed in the shine of its flares a thin plume of steam softly ascending from its brassrimmed funnel  a knot of country boys gabbling at one another like starlings shrilled a cheer as we came rattling over a stone bridge beneath which a stream shallowly washed its bank of osiers i laughed at them waved my hand at this they yelled danced in the road threw dust into the air not perhaps a very friendly return but how happy i was all anxiety and responsibility gone now  the faint rank smell of the wild beasts mingling with the evening air was instilling its intoxication in my brain i longed for darkness the din and glare longed for my tent and the gaping faces for the smoky wind to fan my cheek as i bobbed cantering round the ring it must have been a ridiculously childish face that ever and again scrutinized my companions nothing for me in that lookingglass how slow a face his was he was refusing to look at me it dismayed and fretted me to find him so sombre and dour  his glance shifted to and fro under a frown that expressed a restless anxiety his silence seemed to reproach me oh well when the day was over and mademoiselles finery packed up in its bundle again and the paint washed off and the last echo of applause from the crowded benches had died away and my pay was safe in my pocket then he would know that the stake i had played for had been my freedom my very self then surely his heart would lighten and he would praise me and we could go in peace would he not realize too that even my small body had its value and was admired in a dismal world that cared not a jot for the spirit that inhabited it  the showman stood by the tent a gaudy silk scarf knotted round his neck my leanbreasted gipsy woman spangled there beside him with her black hair looped round her narrow bony head and her loose dusty puckered boots showing beneath her skirts there was a clear lustre in the lampstarred air and the spectacle of man and woman of resting wheel and cropping horse meadow and hill poured a livelong blessing into my heart even the cowed enfeebled lion with the mange of age and captivity in his skin seemed to drowse content and the satinskinned leopardsalmost within pat of paw of the flaxenhaired girl in the white stockings who leaned idly against the wheelpaced their den as if in pride it was the same old story my heart could not contain it all yet to whom tell its secrets  a roomier tent had been prepared for me we were ushered into it by the showman with a mock obeisance that swelled the veins on his forehead almost to bursting the gipsys birdlike eyes pierced and darted from one to the other of us her skinny hand concealing her mouth i felt as light as a feather and thankful that my mudcaked shoes and petticoats were hardly discernible as none too elegantly i scrambled down from the cart  the showman watched me with that sly covetous grin about his mouth that i knew so well though the stare with which he had greeted mr anon had been more insolent than friendly i had cut the time rather close he told me but better late than never as for that longnosed rat with the cage he hadnt been much smitten with the looks of him and he was not the man to ask questions of a lady not he here i was and he hoped i had come for good a rough life but a merry up with the lark until down under the daisies and every man jack of them ready to kiss the ground i walked on and the fat womanjust pining good money away she was with longing to mother the little stranger  i nodded my head at him with a smile as worldlywise as i could make it its the last taste that counts mr showman i said politely every one has been exceedingly kind to me and my love please to the fat woman this is my friend mr anon he has come to take care of me we shall go backgo on together  the showman broke into a laugh but his face hardened again as grinding one jaw slowly on the other he turned to mr anon maybe the young gentleman was anxious to enjoy a taste of the life on his own account he asked me could he ride a bit of steeplechasing there was plenty of horseflesha double turn beauty and the beast now or perhaps another spotted boy love or money just name the figure treat him fair and square and he wouldnt refuse a genuine offer though naturally every inch made a difference and a foot twelve times as much and looks were looks  there was little enough to enjoy in the sound of all this apparently the mere sight of mr anon had soured the showman many of his words were greek to me and to judge from the womans yelps of laughter their meaning was none of the daintiest i shrugged my shoulders smiled spread out my hands and with a word or two fenced him off pretending to be flattered he looked at the woman as if to say theres manners for you she made a sudden ferocious grimace we were a singular four in the tent  but it would be false to profess that i hadnt a sneaking admiration for the man and i kept glancing uneasily at the young gentleman who was so blackly ignoring his advances to say the least of it it was a little unintelligent of mr anon not to take things as they came if only for my sake  but you must please try and help me a little i pleaded when the showman and the gipsy had left us to ourselves for a moment its only his fun hes really not a bad sort of man underneath you cant say theres a spirit of evil in that great hulking creature now can you i am not the least bit afraid of him  he glanced at me without turning his head involuntarily i sighed things never were so easy as one supposed or hoped they would be  already my fingers were busy at the knots of my bundle and for a while simply because what mr anon was saying was so monstrous and incredible i continued to fumble at them without attempting to answer him he was forbidding me to keep my word forbidding me to show myself just ordering me to come away no no he must be crazy i had never understood him there must be some old worm in his mind he was telling me in so many words that to lie a prey to the mobs curiosity had been a disgracesoiling me for ever   the cruel stupidity of it with head bent low and burning cheek i heard his harsh voice knell on and onnot persuading or conciliating or pleading with mei could have forgiven him that easily enough but flatly commanding me to listen and obey  for mercys sake i broke in hurriedly at last thats enough of that if just sitting here and talking to ones fellowcreatures has smeared me over as you say it has why i must wait till jordan to be clean you should have seen that great wallowing sow this evening she wasnt ashamed of herself cant you understand that i simply had to get free youd see it was for your sake too perhaps if you had had the patience to listen but there never mind i understand you cant endure my company any longer thats what it means well then if that is so theres no help for it you must just go and i must be alone again  but no there was a difference he stubbornly maintained what was done was done he was not speaking of the past i knew nothing about the world it was my very innocence that had kept me safe andwell the courage my innocence and the courage thrown in but couldnt i wouldnt i see he argued the need was over now he was with me there was nothing to be afraid of he would protect me surelyoh you know in your heart you couldnt have enjoyed all that  oh said i poisonously so you dont think that to cheat the blackguard as you call him at the last momentand please dont suppose i have forgotten what you have called other friends of mineyou dont think that to break every promise i have made wouldnt be wallowing worse than oh thank you for the wallowing i shall remember that  but my dear my dear he began i never  i say i am not your dear i broke in furiously one moment you dictate to me as if i were a child and the next as if i hadnt been used to that pretence that wheedling all my life long as if i had ever been treated like an ordinary human beingcoddled up smuggled about whispered at why a scullery maids is paradise compared with the life ive led and as for the vile mob and the rest of it i tell you ive enjoyed every minute of them i make them clap their great ugly hands i make them ashamed of themselves they cant help themselves they just and ive comforted some of them too whats more i tell you i love them they are my own people and id die for them if they would only forget whats between us andand share it all you be careful maybe i shall stay here for good they dont wince at my company they dont come creeping and crawling why arent we all on show who set the world spinning i tell you i hate thatthat hypocrisy what does it amount to pray but that youd like the pretty simpering doll all to yourself  a hooting screech broke the quiet that followed the merrygoround had set to its evenings labours faster and faster jangled the pipes and chiming        i dreampt that i dweelt in mararble halls      with vassals and serfs by my siiide   and at the sound anger and pride died down in me i lifted my face from the ground  im sorry i muttered but you dont know what i have gone through these last weeks and even if i were a hundred times as ashamed of myself as you think i ought to be i couldnti cant go back i have promised its written down only once morethis one night and i swear it shall be the last my mouth crooked itself into a smile you shall pray for me on the hill i said then lead me off to a nunnery yourself  and still i could not whispermoney the word stuck in my throat  he seemed not to have heard the miserable things i had been saying without a syllable of retaliation he came a little nearer and stood over me we were all but in darkness now though lights were beating on the canvas of our tent it was quite quite simple he said the showman was no fool he couldnt compel me to exhibit myself against my will a contract was a contract of course but what if both parties to it agreed to break it and supposing the showman refused to agreewhat then there was a far better plan if only i would listen as soon as he had been made to realize that nothing on earth could persuade me to show myself again he would accept any alternative ill take your place smiled mr anon  take my place  so this was the plan he had been brooding over on our journey no wonder he had been absentminded cold with dread i gazed at him in the obscurity of the tent a glimpse of adams rabbit face as he had stood brazening out his fears of the showman on that first night of adventure had darted through my mind and this mandwarfed shrunken emaciated  a terrifying compassion gushed up into my heart breaking down barriers that i never knew were there it was the instant in my life i think when i came nearest to being a mother  ssh i implored him you dont understand you can have no notion of what you are saying i am a woman they darent harm me but you theyand besides the craftier argument floated into my mind besides mrs monnerie  but the sentence remained unfinished the flap of the tent had lifted the figure of the showman loomed up in the entry against the lights and the darkening sky he was in excellent humour he rattled the money in his pocket and breathed the smell of whisky into the tent peering into it as if he were uncertain whether it was occupied or not  thats right then he began huskily thats as it should be ten minutes your ladyship and maybe the young gentleman would give a hand with the drum outside while you get through with the titivating  his shape was only vaguely discernible as he stood gently rocking there it was mr anon who answered him for a little while the showman seemed to be too much astounded to reply then he lost control of himself a torrent of imprecations spouted out of his mouth he threatened to call in the police the mob he shook his brassringed whip in our faces i had never seen a man of his kind really angry before he looked like a beast like the apollyon straddling the path in my pilgrims progress his roaring all but stunned me swept over me as if i were nothinga leaf in the wind i think i could have listened to him all but in mere curiosityas to an equinoctial gale when one is safe in bedif he had not been so near and the tent so small and gloomy and if mr anon had not been standing in silence within reach of his hands but his fury spent itself at last slowly his head turned on his heavy shoulders he seemed suddenly to have forgotten his rage and became coaxing and conciliatory he had a sounding calflike voice and it rose up and down an eavesdropper outside the tent would have supposed he was on the verge of tears  he was sure the young lady had no intention of cheating him of doing the dirty why hed as lief send off there and then to the great house for the flunkey and the cage what had i to complain of wasnt it private enough should he make it a level bobanob and no thruppenies there was nothing to be afraid of god bless you sir she wouldnt cheat an honest man not she  people were swarming into the fair from miles around and real gentry in their carriages amongst them like as had never been seen before did we want to ruin him what should we think now if we had paid down good money to come and see the neatest little piece of female shape as ever god almighty smuggled out of heaven and in we went and stuck up there was a genta nicespoken respectable gent he agreed with a contemptuous heave of his massive shoulders but a gent no less and him gowked up on the table there why half as big again and mouthing mouthing like a the hideous words poured on  his great body gently rocked above me his thumbs hookedin under his armpits his whip dangling till that moment i had scarcely realized that the scene in which i sat was real i had been so harassed and stupefied by his noise but now he had begun to think of what he was saying in those last words an unnameable insult lurked he was looking at us seeing us approaching us as if in a dream  a horror of the spirit came over me and as if rapt away from myself i stared sheer up at him  beware my friend i cried up at him have a care i see a rope around your neck  it was the truth in the gloom actually with my own eyes i saw a noose loosely dangling there over his round heavy shoulders  so to this day i see my showman his circus i believe continues to roam the english countryside and by the mercy of heaven he will die in his bed or better still in the bracken but i suppose like most of us he was a slave to his own superstitions or perhaps it was my very littleness combined with the memory of some old story he had heard as a boy that intimidated him his mouth opened his whip shook the grin of a wild beast swept over his face but he said no more  yet his none the less was half the victory nothing on earth could now have dissuaded me from keeping my bargain his words had bitterly frightened me no one else should be gowked up there i turned my back on him he could go i was ready  but if i could be obstinate so too could mr anon and when at last our argument was over i in sheer weariness had agreed to a compromise it was that i should show myself and he take my place in the circus the showmans money was safe that was all he cared about if humpty liked to petticoat himself up like a doxy and take my turn in the ringwhy it was a rank smelling robbery but let himlet him he bawled for the woman flung a last curse at us and withdrew  we were aloneonly the vacancy of the tent between us beyond the narrow slit i could see the merry jostling crowds hoydens and hobbledehoys with their penny squirts and pasteboard noses and tin trumpets a strange luminousness bathed their faces and clothes beautifying them with light and shadow carpeting with its soft radiance the rough greygreen grass the harvest moon was brightening i went near to him and touched his sleeve his lips contracted his shoulder drew in from my touch  listen i pleaded one hourthat is all that evening in wandersloredo you remember all my troubles over yes i know i have brought you to this but then we can talk then you shall forgive me  he stretched out his hand a shuffling step a light were approaching i fled back snatched up my bundle and climbed up into the darkness behind my canvas curtain the next moment gigantic shadows rushed furiously into hiding the tent was swamped with the flaring of the naphthalamp which the gipsywoman had come to hang to the tentpole to light my last séance  a few hasty minutes and stealing out i bade mr anon look all angéliques fair hair had been tied into a bob and draped mantillafashion with a thick black veil a black coarse fringe torn from the head of a doll which i had found in the bottom of my trunk dangled over her forehead her eyebrows were angled up like a chinamans her cheeks were chalkwhite except for a dab of red on the bone and she was dressed in a flounced gown jet black and yellow which i had cobbled up overnight and had padded out bust hips and shoulders to nearly double my natural size a spreading topaz brooch was on her breast chains of beads and coral dangled to her waist and a silk fan lay on her arm  i swept him a curtsey i dreamt that i dweelt in mararble halls i piped out in a quavering falsetto the folly of taking things so solemnly what was humanity but a dressedup ape had not my fair saint isobel de flores painted her cheeks and garlanded her hair and all his answer was to clench his teeth he turned away with a shudder  the drum reverberated the panpipes squealed i signed to him to hide himself in the recess among my discarded clothes out of sight of peeping eyes and arranged my person on the satin and rabbitskins  the tent flap lifted and the mob pressed in stretching out in a queue like a serpent i caught a glimpse in the pale saffron moonlight of the crowd beyond the sixpences danced in the tray once more the flap descended my audience stilled i looked from one to the other smiling defiant  why bob said she was a pale pinchedup snippet of a thing with golden hair whispered a slip of a girl to a smooth little woman at her side  ay my goff and a waist like a weddingring responded a wide mouth in a large red face peering over  ah lady warbled the signorina fair today and foul tomorrow believe what you are told clanked the bell in the churchyard stuffing my pretty ask the goose  so went the signorinas last little orgy it would be a lie to profess that she or rather some black hidden ghost in her did not enjoy it my monstrous disguise that ferment of humanity those owlish faces the lurking shame the danger the poisonous excitement swept me clean out of myself anything to be free for a while from pernickety miss m but that i suppose is the experience of every gambler and wastrel and jezebel in the world every one of his kind one must not open the door too wide  but this was not all on other nights i had been alone now i was fervidly conscious of unseen hungering eyes watching every turn and glance and gesture my dingy daïs was no longer in actuality i lived in that one watchers mindin his imagination and deep beneath this insane excitement lay a gentle longing happiness oh when this vile tinsel show was over and these swarming faces had melted into thin air and the moonlit empty night was ours what would i not pour out for his peace and comfort what gratitude and tenderness for all that he had been to me and done and said why we seemed never even to have spoken to each othernot self to self and there was all the world to tell  hotter ranker grew the fetid atmosphere i could scarcely breathe in my monstrous mummery but clearly the showman was making a rich bargain of me and rumour of a midget that was golden as aphrodite one night and black as pitch the next only thickened the swarm at lengthlong expectedthere came a pause yet another country urchin flat on his stomach in the grass with head goggling up at me from the hem of the canvas was dragged out screeching and laughing by his breeches but i had caught the accents of a wellknown voice and crouching with head wrenched aside to listen i heard the gipsys whining reply  my moment had come a pulse began its tattoo in my head to remain helplessly lying there was impossible i thrust myself on to my feet and drawing back a pace or two stood hunched up on the crimson spread of satin beside my wooden bolster the canvas lifted and one by one the little party of gentry stooped and filed in     chapter fiftytwo   mrs monnerie had paid for elbow room it was the last private view in this world we were to share together the sight of her capacious figure with its great bonnet and the broad dark face beneath now suddenly become strange and hostile filled me with a vague sense of desolation yet i know she has forgiven me had i not pocketed my pretty little fastidiousness  what fanny had planned to do if miss m plain and simple had occupied the signorinas table i cannot even guess for the spectacle of the squat black gloating guy she actually found there she was utterly unprepared it seemed as i looked at her that myself had faintedhad withdrawn out of my bodylike the spirit in sleep or maybe not to be too nice about it i merely became my disguise with mind emptied of every thought i sank into an almost lifeless stagnancy and with a heavy settled stare out of my black and yellow from under the coarse fringe that brushed my brows i met her eyes out of time and place in a lightless vacant solitude we wrestled for mastery at length the sneering incredulous smile slowly faded from the pale lovely face leaving it twisted up as if after a nauseous draught of physic her gaze faltered and fell her bosom rose she coughed and turned away  hideous monstrous murmured mrs monnerie to the tall expressionless figure that stood beside her the abject evil of the creature  her dark appraising glance travelled over mefeet hands body lacedraped head it swept across my eyes as if they were less significant than bits of china stuck in a cocoanut  no miss bowater she turned massively round on her you were perfectly right it seems as usualbut a dangerous habit my dear my little ransoming scheme must wait a bit just as well perhaps that our patients dainty nerves should have been spared this particular little initiation could one have imagined it  mr padgwicksteggall merely raised his eyebrows i shouldnt have cared to try he drawled and the lady beside him made a little mouth and laid her gloved hand on his arm  but madame is forgetting whined the signorina in a broken nosy english over her outspread fan madame is forgetting its alive oh truly and i clasped my arms even tighter across my padded chest my body involuntarily rocking to and fro though not with amusement  madame is forgetting nothing of the kind retorted mrs monnerie heartily the princess is an angelangéliqueadorable she turned to the gipsy woman and slipped a coin into the clawlike fingers well goodnight she nodded at me we are perfectly satisfied  la la madame my stuttering voice called after her the words leaping out from some old hidingplace in my mind je vous remercie madame rien ne va plus noir gagne  her ebony stick shook beneath her hand unspeakable she angrily ejaculated stumping her way out a positive outrage against humanity  i shut my eyes but the silent laughter that had once overtaken me in my bedroom at mrs bowaters scarcely sounded in my head and mrs monnerie could more easily survive the little exchange than i my body was dull and aching as if after a severe fall the booth was filling for the last time  little life was left in the inert figure that faced this new assortment of her fellowcreatures how strangely dissimilar one from another how horrifyingly alike a faint premonition bade me be on my guard under the wavering flame of the lamp my glance moved slowly on from face to face eye on to eye and behind every one a watcher whom now i dared not wait to challenge empty or cynical disgusted malevolent or blankly curious they met me none pitiful none saddened or afflicted on former nights why had they grown so hostile this then was to smother in the bog  but one face there was known to me and that known well hoping perhaps to take me unaware or may it have been to snatch a secret word with me fanny had slipped back into the tent again and was now steadily regarding me from behind the throng a throng so densely packed together that the canvas walls bulged behind them and the tentpole bent beneath the strain yet so much alone were she and i in that last infinite moment that we might have been whispering together after death and this time suddenly overwhelmed with selfloathing it was i who turned away  when stretching my cramped limbs i drew back exhausted and shivering from the empty tent i thought for an instant that the figure which sat crouching in the corner of the recess was asleep but no with head averted sweat gleaming on his forehead he rose to his feet his consciousness had been my theatre in a degree past even my realization  then that is over was all he said now it is my turn  the voice was flat and indifferent but he could not conceal his disgust of what had passed nor his dread of what was to come why i thought angrily once more as i looked at him why did he exaggerate things like this even a drowning man can sink three times and still cheat the water what cared ithe night was nearly over we should have won release why consider it so deeply but even while i pleaded with him to let me finish the wretched businessevery savour of adventure and daring and romance gone from it nowi was conscious of the trussedup monstrosity that confronted him he could not endure even a glance at my painted face i stepped back from him with a hidden grimace past even praying for then so be it  i heard the nimble stepping of the ponys hoofs on the worn turf a sullen malice smouldered in its reddish luminous eyes when i clutched at its bridle it jerked back its sensitive head as if teased with a gadfly the gipsy daubed vermilion on my friends sallow cheeks she shook out the tarnished finery she had brought with her and hung it round the stooping shoulders she plastered down his black hair above his eyes and thrust a ridingwhip into his hand  there my fine pretty gentleman she smirked at him king of the carrots i lay even your own mammie wouldnt know you now not even if you tried it straddlelegs tug at the knot lovey its fast but it wont strangle you as for you you she suddenly flamed at me all very fly and cunning but if id had the fixing of it you wouldnt have diddled me not you i know your shop slick off double quick i warn you or youll have the mob at your heels now then master  she grasped at the bridle slapped the toothbared sensitive muzzle with her hand i drew back cowed and speechless the sour thought died in my mindbetter perhaps if we had missed each other on the road the pony jerked and snatched back its head   he was gone and now i was quite alone what was there to fear only his contempt his loathing of this last humiliation but that too would soon be nothing but a memory as always the present would glide into the past yet a dreadful foreboding daunted me coarse canvas walls and roof table beaten grass my very hands and clothes had become menacing and unreal the lamp hissed and bubbled as if at any moment it would burst asunder alone afraid ashamed in the foulness of the tent i looked around me in the silence and beyond abovethe universe of night and space all my life but the feeble rustlings of a mouse in straw  as i stripped off my miserable gewgaws i discovered myself talking into my solitude weeping beseeching though eyes were dry and tongue silent i scoured away the chalk and paint and cleansed as far as possible my travelstained clothes from my bit of lookingglass a scared and shining face looked out oh my dear i whispered but not to its reflection it is as clean now and for ever as i can make it i tied up my bundle  it was impossible to cheat away the moments any longer i sat down and listened a distant roar of welcome like that of a wave breaking over a wreck had been borne across as the band broke into its welcoming tune i saw the ring its tall lankcheeked master in his white shirt and coattails the lights the sidling squalling clown and the slim exquisite creature with its ungainly rider ambling on and on where sat fanny amidst that rabble what were her thoughts was mrs monnerie already yawning over the low beggarly scene a few minutes now i began to count a scream human or animal rose faint and awful in the distance and died away  i climbed down the ladder and looked out of the tent farspread the fields and wooded hills lay as if in a swoon beneath the blazing moonlight the scattered lamps on the slope shone dim as glowworms only a few figures loitered in the gleam of the sideshows and so engrossed and still sat the watching multitude beneath the enormous mushroom of the tent so thinly floated out its strains of music that the hollow clucking of the stream over its pebbles beneath the wanstoned bridge was audible a few isolated stars glittered faintly in the heights of the sky what was happening now why did he not hasten i was ready my life prepared i could bear no more waiting a whip cracked the music ceased silence one moment now  again the whip cracked and then as if at a signal a vast protracted unanimous bawl poured up into space a spout of sound like a gigantic invisible flower that wasnt applause but you know that wasnt applause i heard myself muttering there can be no mistaking the sound of human mockery there can be no mistaking that brutal wrench at the heart under ones very ribs i leapt round where i stood in a kind of giddiness  the shout died away an indiscriminate clamour broke outclapping of hands beating of feet whistling hootings booings catcalls and these all but drowned by cymbal drum trombone goodbye sweetheart goodbye it was over unlike mrs monnerie the mob was imperfectly satisfied but all was well the elephant massive imperturbablethe sagacious elephant with the hurdygurdy must now be swinging into the ring  i ran out over the trampled grass to meet the approaching groupshowman gipsy trembling sweating pony its rider stooped forward on the saddle clutching its pommel as if afraid of falling he pushed himself off lurched unsteadily lifted and let fall his arm in an attempt to stroke the milkwhite snapping muzzle the strings of his cloak were already broken he edged from beneath it and with his left hand clumsily brushed the dust and damp from his face  he hadnt quite the knack of it the showman was explaining stirrup a morsel too short maybe all the strength lady and the ginger by god but not the knack you understand and we offered him a quieter little animal too but what i say is a bargains a bargain thats what i say a bit dazedlike sir eh my you did come a cropper  sst are you hurt i whispered  the head shook his moonwashed face smiled at me  come now come now i implored him tugging at his arm before the crowd  he recoiled as if my touch had scalded him  we go i turned to the showman  hands thrust under his leathern belt he looked fixedly at me and then at the woman her eyes glittered glassily back at him  thats it the young lady knows best hes twisted his shoulder lady wrenched it more weight than size as you might say shell know where to make her friend comfortable trust the ladies never you be afraid of that now then mary fetch up the gentlemans cart  the woman with one wolfish glance into his face obeyed  there sir is that easier push the rags in there behind his back itll save the jolts lord love you i wouldnt split on the pair of you not me i know the old old story there thats it now then your ladyship no more weight in the hand than a mushroom all serene mary home sweet home thats the tune sir aint it drive easy now and off we go     chapter fiftythree   noiselessly turned the wheels in the grass we were descending the hill a jolt and we were in the road a hedgerow shut us out from the two shrouded watchers by the tent the braying music fainted away and apart from the trotting hoofs and the grinding of the wheels in the dust the only sound i heard was an occasional lofty crackle in space as a rocketour last greeting from the circusstooping on its fiery course strewed its coloured stars into the moonlight then the rearing hillside shut us out  speechlessly from the floor of the cart i watched the stooping figure above me ever and again at any sudden lurch against a stone he shrank down then slowly lifted himself turned his head and smiled  thats the tune sir thats the tune sir the words aimlessly repeated themselves in my brain as if bringing me a message i could not grasp or understand what was i thinking about a voice kept asking me a strange sluggish look dwelt in the dilated pupils under the drooping lids when the moonbeams struck in on us from between the branches his right hand hung loosely down i clasped itstonecold  listen tell me i entreated you fell i heard them calling andand the clapping what then i could speak no louder but he seemed scarcely able to hear me  my shoulder he answered thickly as if the words came sluggishly and were halfstrange to him i fell nothing nothing only that i love you  the breath sighed itself away i leaned my cheek against the unanswering hand and chafed it with mine where now where now  we must keep awake i called beguilingly into the slumbrous face after a long silence as if to a child awake  a sigh as he smiled in answer shook him from head to foot  you are thirsty whats this on your coat look there is a gate ill creep through and get help i scrambled up endeavouring in vain to clutch at the reins  but no his head stirred its no the left hand still held them fast only  wait  was it waitthat last faint word it fell into my mind like a leaf into a torrent and before i could be sure of it the sound was gone  instinct neither his nor mine guided us on through the winding lanes up hill and down along the margin of sleeping wood and lightdappled stream over a level crossing whose dewrusted rails gleamed in the moon then up once more the retreating hillside hollowly echoing to every clap of hoof against stone there was no strength or will left in me only thoughts which in the dark within between waking and sleeping seemed like hovering flies to veer and dartfantasies fragments of dream rather than thoughts  i realized how sorely he was hurt yet not then in my stupidity and horroror is it that i refused to confess it to myselfthat his hurt was mortal morning would come soon i grasped tight the hand in mine then help in this monotony and weariness of mind and body the passing trees seemed to dance and gesticulate before my eyes a torturing drowsiness crept over me which in vain thrusting up my eyelids with my fingers beating my senseless feet on the floor of the cart i tried to dispel once i remember i rose and threw my cape over his shoulder at last i must have slept  for the next thing i became conscious of was that the cart was at a standstill and that the pony stood cropping the thymesweet turf by the wayside i touched the cold dark hand hush my dear we are here  but i expected no answer the head was sunken between the heavy shoulders the pallid features were set in an empty stare there wasnt a sound in the whole world far or near oh but you havent said a single word to me it was the only speech in my minda reproach it died on my lips i drew away what was thisa dreadful fear plucked at my sleeve fear of the company i was in of a solitude never so much as tasted before i leapt out of the cart stood up in the dust and in the creeping light stared about me  every window of the creeperhung cottage was shrouded its gate latched i struggled to climb the fence to fling a stone through the casement the moon shone glassily in the cold skies but daybreak was in the east i must wait till morning with eyes fixed on the motionless head i sat down in the grass by the wayside ever and again after solemnly turning to survey me the pony dragged the cart on a foot or two under the willows nibbling the dewy grass  roused suddenly from stupor by the howling of a dog i leapt up who called where was i what had i forgotten in renewed and dreadful recognition i looked vacantly around me a strangeness had come his company was mine no longer  dawn brightened the voice of a thrush pealed out of the orchard beyond the stone wallwild and sweet as in spring i crouched on the ground elbows on knees and now kept steady watch upon those nighthung upper windows at last a curtain was drawn aside an invisible face within must have looked down upon us in the lane the casement was unlatched and thrust open and a grey tousled head pushed out as if in alarm into the keen morning at sight of it a violent hiccoughing seized me so that when an old woman appeared at her door and hobbled out to the cart i could not make myself understood her sleepbleared faded eyes surveyed me with horror and suspicionas if in my smallness there i looked scarcely human she shook her crooked fingers at me to scare me off then stooping put her head into the cart i cried out and ran     chapter fiftyfour   the sun had burned for some hours in the heavens when bleeding with thorns and on fire with nettles and stinking mayweed i dragged myself out of the undergrowth into a lowlying corner of the desolate garden near by lay a pool of water under an old ruinous wall swept by the foliage of an ash on a flat shelving stone at its brink i knelt down bathed my face and drank  all that day i spent in the neighbourhood of the water overhung with the colourless trumpets of convolvulus occasionally i edged on but only to keep pace with the sunbeams for i was deathly cold and as soon as shadow drew over me fits of shivering returned for some hours i slept but so shallowly that i heard my own voice gabbling in dreams  when i awoke the western sky was an ocean of saffron and gold amidst its haze stood up the distant clustered chimneys of wanderslore and i realized i must be in an outlying hollow of the parkfarthest from beechwood hill i sat up bound back my hair and bathing my swollen feet in the dark icecold water i watched the splendour fade  while there was still light in the sky i set out for the cottage again but soon found myself in such distress amongst the tangled weeds and grasses which at every movement flung their stifling dust and seeds and pollen over me that i was compelled to give up the attempt with senseless tears dropping down my cheeks i returned to the pool and made my bed in the withered bracken  so passed the next days when once more the cloudless heat of the sun had diminished i made another attempt to press back by the way i had come if only to look up at those windows again but i was dazed and exhausted lost my way and keeping watch until daybreak i returned again to the pool sitting there i tried to control my misery and be calm wait wait i am coming was my one inarticulate thought surely that other solitude must be the easier to bear but it was in vain he was dead and i had killed himpride vanity greed obstinacy lovelessness every flower and fading leaf bore witness against me  now and again i quenched my thirst and rambled off a little way in search of a few fallen hazel nuts and blackberries and attempted to ease the pain and distress i was in but i knew in my heart that a few such days must see the last of me and i had no other desire evening came with its faint stars my mind at last seemed to empty itself of thought and until dark fell a self sat at the windows of my eyes gazing heedlessly out over that peace and beauty without consciousness even of grief and despair nocturnal creatures began to stir in weed and thicket a thin mist to rise for a while i kept watch until sense left me and i slept  a waning misshapen moon hung over the garden when i awoke my mind still clear empty so empty that i might but just have reentered the world after the lapse of ages in this silvery hush of night winged shapes were wheeling around and above me piercing the air with mad strident cries with sight strangely sharpened and powerful i gazed tranquilly up and supposed for a while these birds were swallows idly i watched them scarcely conscious whether they were real or creatures of the imagination  darting swooping in the mild blaze of the moonlight with gaping beaks and whirring wings they swept wavered tumbled above their motionless pastures ghostlyfluttering featheryplumed moths their prey at last a continuous churring like the noise of a rattle near at hand betrayed them i lay in my solitude in the midst of a whirling flock of nightjars few in number but beside themselves with joy on the eve of their autumnal flight  i can only grope my way now through vague and baffling memories maybe it was the frenzied excitement of these madly happy birds that shed itself into my defenceless mind after rousing me into the night i knew too well with full vigilant eyes i am standing again a few paces from the brink of the pool looking up into a moonlit bush of deadly nightshade its noxious flowering over and hung with its black gleaming cherrylike fruit i cannot recall having ever given a thought to this poisonous plant in wanderslore during my waking hours though in my old happy reconnoitrings of the garden i had sometimes chanced on the coralred clusters of the woody nightshadethe bittersweet and had afterwards seen it in blossom  it may be that only a part of my mind was fully awake while the rest dreamed on yet as i strive to return in imagination to that solitary hour i am certain that a complete realization was mine of the power distilled into those alluring lightglossed berries and slave of my drowsy senses i fixed gaze and appetite on them as though from childhood up they had been my one greed and desire even then as if for proof that they were real my eyes wandered recognized low in the west glaring altair amid the faint outspread wings of aquila pondered on the sparklike radiance struck out by the moonbeams from the fragments of tile that protruded here and there from the crumbling wall beyond the pool and softly returned once more to the evil bush  then for an instant i fancied that out of the nearer shadows a halfseen form had stolen up close behind me and was watching me fancy or not it caused me no fear i turned about where i stood and from this gentle eminence scanned the immense autumnal garden with its coursing nightbirds and distant motionless woods no i was alone by my self conscious only of an unfathomable quiet and i stooped and took up one of the ripe fruits that had fallen to the ground ah ah called a faraway voice within me ah ah what are you at nowa voice like none i had ever heard in the world until that moment yet i raised the fruit to my lips  its bitter juices jetted out upon cheek mouth and tongue for ever staining me with their dye their very rancour shocked my body wide awake struck suddenly through with frightful cold and terror i flung the vile thing down and scoured my mouth with the draggled hem of my skirt oh god oh god i cried then turned ran a few steps tripped turned back and cast myself down crushing my eyes with my hands and in helpless confusion began to pray  minutes hours passedi know not but at last with throat parched and swollen and hands and cheeks and scalp throbbing with an unnatural heat i raised my eyes two moons were in the sky hideously revolving amid interwoven arcs of coloured light and running backward and forward i called out in the silence a gigantic nightjar swirled on me plucking at my hair a maddening vertigo seized me i went stumbling and staggering down to my stone and drenched head and breast in the flashing black and silver water  it was a momentary refreshment and in its influence memory began droning of the past confused abhorrent images mocked my helpless dreamings there was a placebeyondout of these shadows unattainable a piercing vindictive voice was calling me no hope now i was damned in senseless hallucination i began systematically laboriously a frenzied search leaf pebble crawling nightcreaturewith slow animallike care i turned them over one by one seeking and seeking     lyndsey     chapter fiftyfive and last   and yet again i pauselong after these last words were writtento look back across the intervening years at that young woman what indeed was her insane mind seeking what assurance reconciliation i know not but there she herself was found nails worn to the quick feet shoeless a hunted anatomy her fret and fever were to pass away but what has all this experience done for methat wildest happiest cruellest dearest blackest twelvemonth of my life one more unanswerable question but thank god i live on have even finished the task i set myself and in spite of fits and moods of depression distaste and weariness have been happy in it even when most contemptuous and ashamed of myself i have still found comfort in the belief that truth is a wholesome medicine though in essence it be humanly unattainable and my work has taught me this toonot to fret so foolishly as once i did at being small and insignificant in body to fear a great deal more remaining pygmyminded and pygmyspirited i used to try to set myself against the worldbut no need to enter further into that we cannot see ourselves as others see us but that is no excuse for not wearing spectacles and even up here in my peaceful lonely old stonecote i must beware of a mind swept and garnished moreover my hour must come again and his  that being so of this i am certain that it will be impossible to free myself to escape from this world unless in peace and amity i can take every shred of it every friend and every enemy all that these eyes have seen these senses discovered with me i know that and perhaps for that very reason in spite of the loving gratitude that overcomes me at the thought of what my existence might have been i sometimes dread the ease and quiet and seclusion in which i live and this tale itself as mrs monnerie had said what is it but once more to have drifted into being on show againin a book that is so and so i must leave it hoping against hope that one friend at any rate will consent in his love and wisdom to take me seriously and to remember me not with scorn or even with pity but as if life for life we had shared the world on equal terms  m
