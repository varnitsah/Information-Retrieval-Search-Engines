50294621	lamia  by john keats     part 1       upon a time before the faery broods      drove nymph and satyr from the prosperous woods      before king oberons bright diadem      sceptre and mantle claspd with dewy gem      frighted away the dryads and the fauns      from rushes green and brakes and cowslipd lawns      the eversmitten hermes empty left      his golden throne bent warm on amorous theft      from high olympus had he stolen light      on this side of joves clouds to escape the sight      of his great summoner and made retreat      into a forest on the shores of crete      for somewhere in that sacred island dwelt      a nymph to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt      at whose white feet the languid tritons poured      pearls while on land they witherd and adored      fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont      and in those meads where sometime she might haunt      were strewn rich gifts unknown to any muse      though fancys casket were unlockd to choose      ah what a world of love was at her feet      so hermes thought and a celestial heat      burnt from his winged heels to either ear      that from a whiteness as the lily clear      blushd into roses mid his golden hair      fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare      from vale to vale from wood to wood he flew      breathing upon the flowers his passion new      and wound with many a river to its head      to find where this sweet nymph prepard her secret bed      in vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found      and so he rested on the lonely ground      pensive and full of painful jealousies      of the woodgods and even the very trees      there as he stood he heard a mournful voice      such as once heard in gentle heart destroys      all pain but pity thus the lone voice spake      when from this wreathed tomb shall i awake      when move in a sweet body fit for life      and love and pleasure and the ruddy strife      of hearts and lips ah miserable me      the god dovefooted glided silently      round bush and tree softbrushing in his speed      the taller grasses and fullflowering weed      until he found a palpitating snake      bright and cirquecouchant in a dusky brake          she was a gordian shape of dazzling hue      vermilionspotted golden green and blue      striped like a zebra freckled like a pard      eyed like a peacock and all crimson barrd      and full of silver moons that as she breathed      dissolvd or brighter shone or interwreathed      their lustres with the gloomier tapestries      so rainbowsided touchd with miseries      she seemd at once some penanced lady elf      some demons mistress or the demons self      upon her crest she wore a wannish fire      sprinkled with stars like ariadnes tiar      her head was serpent but ah bittersweet      she had a womans mouth with all its pearls complete      and for her eyes what could such eyes do there      but weep and weep that they were born so fair      as proserpine still weeps for her sicilian air      her throat was serpent but the words she spake      came as through bubbling honey for loves sake      and thus while hermes on his pinions lay      like a stoopd falcon ere he takes his prey          fair hermes crownd with feathers fluttering light      i had a splendid dream of thee last night      i saw thee sitting on a throne of gold      among the gods upon olympus old      the only sad one for thou didst not hear      the soft lutefingerd muses chaunting clear      nor even apollo when he sang alone      deaf to his throbbing throats long long melodious moan      i dreamt i saw thee robed in purple flakes      break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks      and swiftly as a bright phoebean dart      strike for the cretan isle and here thou art      too gentle hermes hast thou found the maid      whereat the star of lethe not delayd      his rosy eloquence and thus inquired      thou smoothlippd serpent surely high inspired      thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes      possess whatever bliss thou canst devise      telling me only where my nymph is fled      where she doth breathe bright planet thou hast said      returnd the snake but seal with oaths fair god      i swear said hermes by my serpent rod      and by thine eyes and by thy starry crown      light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown      then thus again the brilliance feminine      too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine      free as the air invisibly she strays      about these thornless wilds her pleasant days      she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet      leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet      from weary tendrils and bowd branches green      she plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen      and by my power is her beauty veild      to keep it unaffronted unassaild      by the loveglances of unlovely eyes      of satyrs fauns and bleard silenus sighs      pale grew her immortality for woe      of all these lovers and she grieved so      i took compassion on her bade her steep      her hair in weird syrops that would keep      her loveliness invisible yet free      to wander as she loves in liberty      thou shalt behold her hermes thou alone      if thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon      then once again the charmed god began      an oath and through the serpents ears it ran      warm tremulous devout psalterian      ravishd she lifted her circean head      blushd a live damask and swiftlisping said      i was a woman let me have once more      a womans shape and charming as before      i love a youth of corintho the bliss      give me my womans form and place me where he is      stoop hermes let me breathe upon thy brow      and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now      the god on halfshut feathers sank serene      she breathd upon his eyes and swift was seen      of both the guarded nymph nearsmiling on the green      it was no dream or say a dream it was      real are the dreams of gods and smoothly pass      their pleasures in a long immortal dream      one warm flushd moment hovering it might seem      dashd by the woodnymphs beauty so he burnd      then lighting on the printless verdure turnd      to the swoond serpent and with languid arm      delicate put to proof the lythe caducean charm      so done upon the nymph his eyes he bent      full of adoring tears and blandishment      and towards her stept she like a moon in wane      faded before him cowerd nor could restrain      her fearful sobs selffolding like a flower      that faints into itself at evening hour      but the god fostering her chilled hand      she felt the warmth her eyelids opend bland      and like new flowers at morning song of bees      bloomd and gave up her honey to the lees      into the greenrecessed woods they flew      nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do          left to herself the serpent now began      to change her elfin blood in madness ran      her mouth foamd and the grass therewith besprent      witherd at dew so sweet and virulent      her eyes in torture fixd and anguish drear      hot glazd and wide with lidlashes all sear      flashd phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear      the colours all inflamd throughout her train      she writhd about convulsd with scarlet pain      a deep volcanian yellow took the place      of all her mildermooned bodys grace      and as the lava ravishes the mead      spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede      made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars      eclipsd her crescents and lickd up her stars      so that in moments few she was undrest      of all her sapphires greens and amethyst      and rubiousargent of all these bereft      nothing but pain and ugliness were left      still shone her crown that vanishd also she      melted and disappeard as suddenly      and in the air her new voice luting soft      cried lycius gentle lyciusborne aloft      with the bright mists about the mountains hoar      these words dissolvd cretes forests heard no more          whither fled lamia now a lady bright      a fullborn beauty new and exquisite      she fled into that valley they pass oer      who go to corinth from cenchreas shore      and rested at the foot of those wild hills      the rugged founts of the peraean rills      and of that other ridge whose barren back      stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack      southwestward to cleone there she stood      about a young birds flutter from a wood      fair on a sloping green of mossy tread      by a clear pool wherein she passioned      to see herself escapd from so sore ills      while her robes flaunted with the daffodils          ah happy lyciusfor she was a maid      more beautiful than ever twisted braid      or sighd or blushd or on springflowered lea      spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy      a virgin purest lippd yet in the lore      of love deep learned to the red hearts core      not one hour old yet of sciential brain      to unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain      define their pettish limits and estrange      their points of contact and swift counterchange      intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart      its most ambiguous atoms with sure art      as though in cupids college she had spent      sweet days a lovely graduate still unshent      and kept his rosy terms in idle languishment          why this fair creature chose so fairily      by the wayside to linger we shall see      but first tis fit to tell how she could muse      and dream when in the serpent prisonhouse      of all she list strange or magnificent      how ever where she willd her spirit went      whether to faint elysium or where      down through tresslifting waves the nereids fair      wind into thetis bower by many a pearly stair      or where god bacchus drains his cups divine      stretchd out at ease beneath a glutinous pine      or where in plutos gardens palatine      mulcibers columns gleam in far piazzian line      and sometimes into cities she would send      her dream with feast and rioting to blend      and once while among mortals dreaming thus      she saw the young corinthian lycius      charioting foremost in the envious race      like a young jove with calm uneager face      and fell into a swooning love of him      now on the mothtime of that evening dim      he would return that way as well she knew      to corinth from the shore for freshly blew      the eastern soft wind and his galley now      grated the quaystones with her brazen prow      in port cenchreas from egina isle      fresh anchord whither he had been awhile      to sacrifice to jove whose temple there      waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare      jove heard his vows and betterd his desire      for by some freakful chance he made retire      from his companions and set forth to walk      perhaps grown wearied of their corinth talk      over the solitary hills he fared      thoughtless at first but ere eves star appeared      his phantasy was lost where reason fades      in the calmd twilight of platonic shades      lamia beheld him coming near more near      close to her passing in indifference drear      his silent sandals swept the mossy green      so neighbourd to him and yet so unseen      she stood he passd shut up in mysteries      his mind wrappd like his mantle while her eyes      followd his steps and her neck regal white      turndsyllabling thus ah lycius bright      and will you leave me on the hills alone      lycius look back and be some pity shown      he did not with cold wonder fearingly      but orpheuslike at an eurydice      for so delicious were the words she sung      it seemd he had lovd them a whole summer long      and soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up      leaving no drop in the bewildering cup      and still the cup was fullwhile he afraid      lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid      due adoration thus began to adore      her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure      leave thee alone look back ah goddess see      whether my eyes can ever turn from thee      for pity do not this sad heart belie      even as thou vanishest so i shall die      stay though a naiad of the rivers stay      to thy far wishes will thy streams obey      stay though the greenest woods be thy domain      alone they can drink up the morning rain      though a descended pleiad will not one      of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune      thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine      so sweetly to these ravishd ears of mine      came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade      thy memory will waste me to a shade      for pity do not meltif i should stay      said lamia here upon this floor of clay      and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough      what canst thou say or do of charm enough      to dull the nice remembrance of my home      thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam      over these hills and vales where no joy is      empty of immortality and bliss      thou art a scholar lycius and must know      that finer spirits cannot breathe below      in human climes and live alas poor youth      what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe      my essence what serener palaces      where i may all my many senses please      and by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease      it cannot beadieu so said she rose      tiptoe with white arms spread he sick to lose      the amorous promise of her lone complain      swoond murmuring of love and pale with pain      the cruel lady without any show      of sorrow for her tender favourites woe      but rather if her eyes could brighter be      with brighter eyes and slow amenity      put her new lips to his and gave afresh      the life she had so tangled in her mesh      and as he from one trance was wakening      into another she began to sing      happy in beauty life and love and every thing      a song of love too sweet for earthly lyres      while like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires      and then she whisperd in such trembling tone      as those who safe together met alone      for the first time through many anguishd days      use other speech than looks bidding him raise      his drooping head and clear his soul of doubt      for that she was a woman and without      any more subtle fluid in her veins      than throbbing blood and that the selfsame pains      inhabited her frailstrung heart as his      and next she wonderd how his eyes could miss      her face so long in corinth where she said      she dwelt but half retird and there had led      days happy as the gold coin could invent      without the aid of love yet in content      till she saw him as once she passd him by      where gainst a column he leant thoughtfully      at venus temple porch mid baskets heapd      of amorous herbs and flowers newly reapd      late on that eve as twas the night before      the adonian feast whereof she saw no more      but wept alone those days for why should she adore      lycius from death awoke into amaze      to see her still and singing so sweet lays      then from amaze into delight he fell      to hear her whisper womans lore so well      and every word she spake enticd him on      to unperplexd delight and pleasure known      let the mad poets say whateer they please      of the sweets of fairies peris goddesses      there is not such a treat among them all      haunters of cavern lake and waterfall      as a real woman lineal indeed      from pyrrhas pebbles or old adams seed      thus gentle lamia judgd and judgd aright      that lycius could not love in half a fright      so threw the goddess off and won his heart      more pleasantly by playing womans part      with no more awe than what her beauty gave      that while it smote still guaranteed to save      lycius to all made eloquent reply      marrying to every word a twinborn sigh      and last pointing to corinth askd her sweet      if twas too far that night for her soft feet      the way was short for lamias eagerness      made by a spell the triple league decrease      to a few paces not at all surmised      by blinded lycius so in her comprized      they passd the city gates he knew not how      so noiseless and he never thought to know          as men talk in a dream so corinth all      throughout her palaces imperial      and all her populous streets and temples lewd      mutterd like tempest in the distance brewd      to the widespreaded night above her towers      men women rich and poor in the cool hours      shuffled their sandals oer the pavement white      companiond or alone while many a light      flared here and there from wealthy festivals      and threw their moving shadows on the walls      or found them clusterd in the corniced shade      of some archd temple door or dusky colonnade          muffling his face of greeting friends in fear      her fingers he pressd hard as one came near      with curld gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown      slowsteppd and robed in philosophic gown      lycius shrank closer as they met and past      into his mantle adding wings to haste      while hurried lamia trembled ah said he      why do you shudder love so ruefully      why does your tender palm dissolve in dew      im wearied said fair lamia tell me who      is that old man i cannot bring to mind      his featureslycius wherefore did you blind      yourself from his quick eyes lycius replied      tis apollonius sage my trusty guide      and good instructor but tonight he seems      the ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams          while yet he spake they had arrived before      a pillard porch with lofty portal door      where hung a silver lamp whose phosphor glow      reflected in the slabbed steps below      mild as a star in water for so new      and so unsullied was the marble hue      so through the crystal polish liquid fine      ran the dark veins that none but feet divine      could eer have touchd there sounds aeolian      breathd from the hinges as the ample span      of the wide doors disclosd a place unknown      some time to any but those two alone      and a few persian mutes who that same year      were seen about the markets none knew where      they could inhabit the most curious      were foild who watchd to trace them to their house      and but the flitterwinged verse must tell      for truths sake what woe afterwards befel      twould humour many a heart

last      more grievous torment than a hermits fast      that is a doubtful tale from faery land      hard for the nonelect to understand      had lycius livd to hand his story down      he might have given the moral a fresh frown      or clenchd it quite but too short was their bliss      to breed distrust and hate that make the soft voice hiss      besides there nightly with terrific glare      love jealous grown of so complete a pair      hoverd and buzzd his wings with fearful roar      above the lintel of their chamber door      and down the passage cast a glow upon the floor          for all this came a ruin side by side      they were enthroned in the even tide      upon a couch near to a curtaining      whose airy texture from a golden string      floated into the room and let appear      unveild the summer heaven blue and clear      betwixt two marble shaftsthere they reposed      where use had made it sweet with eyelids closed      saving a tythe which love still open kept      that they might see each other while they almost slept      when from the slope side of a suburb hill      deafening the swallows twitter came a thrill      of trumpetslycius startedthe sounds fled      but left a thought a buzzing in his head      for the first time since first he harbourd in      that purplelined palace of sweet sin      his spirit passd beyond its golden bourn      into the noisy world almost forsworn      the lady ever watchful penetrant      saw this with pain so arguing a want      of something more more than her empery      of joys and she began to moan and

with pain      beseeching him the while his hand she wrung      to change his purpose he thereat was stung      perverse with stronger fancy to reclaim      her wild and timid nature to his aim      besides for all his love in self despite      against his better self he took delight      luxurious in her sorrows soft and new      his passion cruel grown took on a hue      fierce and sanguineous

not a friend so being left alone      lycius was gone to summon all his kin      and knowing surely she could never win      his foolish heart from its mad pompousness      she set herself highthoughted how to dress      the misery in fit magnificence      she did so but tis doubtful how and whence      came and who were her subtle servitors      about the halls and to and from the doors      there was a noise of wings till in short space      the glowing banquetroom shone with widearched grace      a haunting music sole perhaps and lone      supportress of the faeryroof made

on his hair they all movd to the feast      in white robes and themselves in order placed      around the silken couches wondering      whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring          soft went the music the soft air along      while fluent greek a voweld undersong      kept up among the guests discoursing low      at first for scarcely was the wine at flow      but when the

    the leaves of willow and of adders tongue      and for the youth quick let us strip for him      the thyrsus that his watching eyes may swim      into forgetfulness and for the sage      let

her texture she is given      in the dull catalogue of common things      philosophy will clip an angels wings      conquer all mysteries by rule and line      empty the haunted air and gnomed mine
