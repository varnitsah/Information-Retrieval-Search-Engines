57530536	the coral island by rm ballantyne    chapter one  beginningmy early life and characteri thirst for adventure in foreign lands and go to sea  roving has always been and still is my ruling passion the joy of my heart the very sunshine of my existence  in childhood in boyhood and in mans estate i have been a rover not a mere rambler among the woody glens and upon the hilltops of my own native land but an enthusiastic rover throughout the length and breadth of the wide wide world  it was a wild black night of howling storm the night on which i was born on the foaming bosom of the broad atlantic ocean  my father was a seacaptain my grandfather was a seacaptain my greatgrandfather had been a marine  nobody could tell positively what occupation his father had followed but my dear mother used to assert that he had been a midshipman whose grandfather on the mothers side had been an admiral in the royal navy  at any rate we knew that as far back as our family could be traced it had been intimately connected with the great watery waste  indeed this was the case on both sides of the house for my mother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages and so spent the greater part of her life upon the water  thus it was i suppose that i came to inherit a roving disposition soon after i was born my father being old retired from a seafaring life purchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast of england and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the shores of that sea which had for so many years been his home  it was not long after this that i began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within me  for some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength so that i came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby knees by walking on them and made many attempts to stand up and walk like a manall of which attempts however resulted in my sitting down violently and in sudden surprise  one day i took advantage of my dear mothers absence to make another effort and to my joy i actually succeeded in reaching the doorstep over which i tumbled into a pool of muddy water that lay before my fathers cottage door  ah how vividly i remember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a group of cackling ducks and the tenderness with which she stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body from this time forth my rambles became more frequent and as i grew older more distant until at last i had wandered far and near on the shore and in the woods around our humble dwelling and did not rest content until my father bound me apprentice to a coastingvessel and let me go to sea  for some years i was happy in visiting the seaports and in coasting along the shores of my native land  my christian name was ralph and my comrades added to this the name of rover in consequence of the passion which i always evinced for travelling  rover was not my real name but as i never received any other i came at last to answer to it as naturally as to my proper name  and as it is not a bad one i see no good reason why i should not introduce myself to the reader as ralph rover  my shipmates were kind goodnatured fellows and they and i got on very well together  they did indeed very frequently make game of and banter me but not unkindly and i overheard them sometimes saying that ralph rover was a queer oldfashioned fellow  this i must confess surprised me much and i pondered the saying long but could come at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my oldfashionedness lay  it is true i was a quiet lad and seldom spoke except when spoken to  moreover i never could understand the jokes of my companions even when they were explained to me which dulness in apprehension occasioned me much grief  however i tried to make up for it by smiling and looking pleased when i observed that they were laughing at some witticism which i had failed to detect  i was also very fond of inquiring into the nature of things and their causes and often fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my mind  but in all this i saw nothing that did not seem to be exceedingly natural and could by no means understand why my comrades should call me an oldfashioned fellow  now while engaged in the coasting trade i fell in with many seamen who had travelled to almost every quarter of the globe and i freely confess that my heart glowed ardently within me as they recounted their wild adventures in foreign landsthe dreadful storms they had weathered the appalling dangers they had escaped the wonderful creatures they had seen both on the land and in the sea and the interesting lands and strange people they had visited  but of all the places of which they told me none captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the coral islands of the southern seas  they told me of thousands of beautiful fertile islands that had been formed by a small creature called the coral insect where summer reigned nearly all the year round where the trees were laden with a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit where the climate was almost perpetually delightful yet where strange to say men were wild bloodthirsty savages excepting in those favoured isles to which the gospel of our saviour had been conveyed  these exciting accounts had so great an effect upon my mind that when i reached the age of fifteen i resolved to make a voyage to the south seas  i had no little difficulty at first in prevailing on my dear parents to let me go but when i urged on my father that he would never have become a great captain had he remained in the coasting trade he saw the truth of what i said and gave his consent  my dear mother seeing that my father had made up his mind no longer offered opposition to my wishes  but oh ralph she said on the day i bade her adieu come back soon to us my dear boy for we are getting old now ralph and may not have many years to live  i will not take up my readers time with a minute account of all that occurred before i took my final leave of my dear parents  suffice it to say that my father placed me under the charge of an old messmate of his own a merchant captain who was on the point of sailing to the south seas in his own ship the arrow  my mother gave me her blessing and a small bible and her last request was that i would never forget to read a chapter every day and say my prayers which i promised with tears in my eyes that i would certainly do  soon afterwards i went on board the arrow which was a fine large ship and set sail for the islands of the pacific ocean    chapter two  the departurethe seamy companionssome account of the wonderful sights we saw on the great deepa dreadful storm and a frightful wreck  it was a bright beautiful warm day when our ship spread her canvas to the breeze and sailed for the regions of the south  oh how my heart bounded with delight as i listened to the merry chorus of the sailors while they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor  the captain shouted the men ran to obey the noble ship bent over to the breeze and the shore gradually faded from my view while i stood looking on with a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream  the first thing that struck me as being different from anything i had yet seen during my short career on the sea was the hoisting of the anchor on deck and lashing it firmly down with ropes as if we had now bid adieu to the land for ever and would require its services no more  there lass cried a broadshouldered jacktar giving the fluke of the anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was completedthere lass take a good nap now for we shant ask you to kiss the mud again for many a long day to come  and so it was  that anchor did not kiss the mud for many long days afterwards and when at last it did it was for the last time  there were a number of boys in the ship but two of them were my special favourites  jack martin was a tall strapping broadshouldered youth of eighteen with a handsome goodhumoured firm face  he had had a good education was clever and hearty and lionlike in his actions but mild and quiet in disposition  jack was a general favourite and had a peculiar fondness for me  my other companion was peterkin gay  he was little quick funny decidedly mischievous and about fourteen years old  but peterkins mischief was almost always harmless else he could not have been so much beloved as he was  hallo youngster cried jack martin giving me a slap on the shoulder the day i joined the ship come below and ill show you your berth you and i are to be messmates and i think we shall be good friends for i like the look o you  jack was right  he and i and peterkin afterwards became the best and staunchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves  i shall say little about the first part of our voyage  we had the usual amount of rough weather and calm also we saw many strange fish rolling in the sea and i was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of flyingfish dart out of the water and skim through the air about a foot above the surface  they were pursued by dolphins which feed on them and one flyingfish in its terror flew over the ship struck on the rigging and fell upon the deck  its wings were just fins elongated and we found that they could never fly far at a time and never mounted into the air like birds but skimmed along the surface of the sea  jack and i had it for dinner and found it remarkably good  when we approached cape horn at the southern extremity of america the weather became very cold and stormy and the sailors began to tell stories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape  cape horn said one is the most horrible headland i ever doubled ive sailed round it twice already and both times the ship was amost blowd out o the water  ive been round it once said another an that time the sails were split and the ropes frozen in the blocks so that they wouldnt work and we wos all but lost  an ive been round it five times cried a third an every time wos wuss than another the gales wos so treemendous  and ive been round it no times at all cried peterkin with an impudent wink in his eye an that time i wos blowd inside out  nevertheless we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather and in the course of a few weeks afterwards were sailing gently before a warm tropical breeze over the pacific ocean  thus we proceeded on our voyagesometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze at other times floating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious inhabitants of the deep all of which although the sailors thought little of them were strange and interesting and very wonderful to me  at last we came among the coral islands of the pacific and i shall never forget the delight with which i gazedwhen we chanced to pass oneat the pure white dazzling shores and the verdant palmtrees which looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine  and often did we three long to be landed on one imagining that we should certainly find perfect happiness there  our wish was granted sooner than we expected  one night soon after we entered the tropics an awful storm burst upon our ship  the first squall of wind carried away two of our masts and left only the foremast standing  even this however was more than enough for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it  for five days the tempest raged in all its fury  everything was swept off the decks except one small boat  the steersman was lashed to the wheel lest he should be washed away and we all gave ourselves up for lost  the captain said that he had no idea where we were as we had been blown far out of our course and we feared much that we might get among the dangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the pacific  at daybreak on the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead it was an island encircled by a reef of coral on which the waves broke in fury  there was calm water within this reef but we could see only one narrow opening into it  for this opening we steered but ere we reached it a tremendous wave broke on our stern tore the rudder completely off and left us at the mercy of the winds and waves  its all over with us now lads said the captain to the men  get the boat ready to launch we shall be on the rocks in less than halfanhour  the men obeyed in gloomy silence for they felt that there was little hope of so small a boat living in such a sea  come boys said jack martin in a grave tone to me and peterkin as we stood on the quarterdeck awaiting our fatecome boys we three shall stick together  you see it is impossible that the little boat can reach the shore crowded with men  it will be sure to upset so i mean rather to trust myself to a large oar  i see through the telescope that the ship will strike at the tail of the reef where the waves break into the quiet water inside so if we manage to cling to the oar till it is driven over the breakers we may perhaps gain the shore  what say you will you join me  we gladly agreed to follow jack for he inspired us with confidence although i could perceive by the sad tone of his voice that he had little hope and indeed when i looked at the white waves that lashed the reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury i felt that there was but a step between us and death  my heart sank within me but at that moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother and i remembered those words which were among the last that she said to me ralph my dearest child always remember in the hour of danger to look to your lord and saviour jesus christ  he alone is both able and willing to save your body and your soul  so i felt much comforted when i thought thereon  the ship was now very near the rocks  the men were ready with the boat and the captain beside them giving orders when a tremendous wave came towards us  we three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar and had barely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like thunder  at the same moment the ship struck the foremast broke off close to the deck and went over the side carrying the boat and men along with it  our oar got entangled with the wreck and jack seized an axe to cut it free but owing to the motion of the ship he missed the cordage and struck the axe deep into the oar  another wave however washed it clear of the wreck  we all seized hold of it and the next instant we were struggling in the wild sea  the last thing i saw was the boat whirling in the surf and all the sailors tossed into the foaming waves  then i became insensible  on recovering from my swoon i found myself lying on a bank of soft grass under shelter of an overhanging rock with peterkin on his knees by my side tenderly bathing my temples with water and endeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead    chapter three  the coral islandour first cogitations after landing and the result of themwe conclude that the island is uninhabited  there is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in recovering from a state of insensibility which is almost indescribable a sort of dreamy confused consciousness a halfwaking halfsleeping condition accompanied with a feeling of weariness which however is by no means disagreeable  as i slowly recovered and heard the voice of peterkin inquiring whether i felt better i thought that i must have overslept myself and should be sent to the masthead for being lazy but before i could leap up in haste the thought seemed to vanish suddenly away and i fancied that i must have been ill  then a balmy breeze fanned my cheek and i thought of home and the garden at the back of my fathers cottage with its luxuriant flowers and the sweetscented honeysuckle that my dear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch  but the roaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to flight and i was back again at sea watching the dolphins and the flyingfish and reefing topsails off the wild and stormy cape horn  gradually the roar of the surf became louder and more distinct  i thought of being wrecked far far away from my native land and slowly opened my eyes to meet those of my companion jack who with a look of intense anxiety was gazing into my face  speak to us my dear ralph whispered jack tenderly  are you better now  i smiled and looked up saying better  why what do you mean jack im quite well  then what are you shamming for and frightening us in this way said peterkin smiling through his tears for the poor boy had been really under the impression that i was dying  i now raised myself on my elbow and putting my hand to my forehead found that it had been cut pretty severely and that i had lost a good deal of blood  come come ralph said jack pressing me gently backward lie down my boy youre not right yet  wet your lips with this water its cool and clear as crystal  i got it from a spring close at hand  there now dont say a wordhold your tongue he said seeing me about to speak  ill tell you all about it but you must not utter a syllable till you have rested well  oh dont stop him from speaking jack said peterkin who now that his fears for my safety were removed busied himself in erecting a shelter of broken branches in order to protect me from the windwhich however was almost unnecessary for the rock beside which i had been laid completely broke the force of the gale  let him speak jack its a comfort to hear that hes alive after lying there stiff and white and sulky for a whole hour just like an egyptian mummynever saw such a fellow as you are ralphalways up to mischief  youve almost knocked out all my teeth and more than halfchoked me and now you go shamming dead  its very wicked of you indeed it is  while peterkin ran on in this style my faculties became quite clear again and i began to understand my position  what do you mean by saying i halfchoked you peterkin said i  what do i mean  is english not your mothertongue or do you want me to repeat it in french by way of making it clearer  dont you remember  i remember nothing said i interrupting him after we were thrown into the sea  hush peterkin said jack youre exciting ralph with your nonsenseill explain it to you  you recollect that after the ship struck we three sprang over the bow into the sea  well i noticed that the oar struck your head and gave you that cut on the brow which nearly stunned you so that you grasped peterkin round the neck without knowing apparently what you were about  in doing so you pushed the telescope which you clung to as if it had been your lifeagainst peterkins mouth  pushed it against his mouth interrupted peterkin say crammed it down his throat  why theres a distinct mark of the brass rim on the back of my gullet at this moment  well well be that as it may continued jack you clung to him ralph till i feared you really would choke him  but i saw that he had a good hold of the oar so i exerted myself to the utmost to push you towards the shore which we luckily reached without much trouble for the water inside the reef is quite calm  but the captain and crew what of them  i inquired anxiously  jack shook his head  are they lost  no they are not lost i hope but i fear there is not much chance of their being saved  the ship struck at the very tail of the island on which we are cast  when the boat was tossed into the sea it fortunately did not upset although it shipped a good deal of water and all the men managed to scramble into it but before they could get the oars out the gale carried them past the point and away to leeward of the island after we landed i saw them endeavouring to pull towards us but as they had only one pair of oars out of the eight that belonged to the boat and as the wind was blowing right in their teeth they gradually lost ground  then i saw them put about and hoist some sort of saila blanket i fancy for it was too small for the boatand in halfanhour they were out of sight  poor fellows  i murmured sorrowfully  but the more i think about it ive better hope of them continued jack in a more cheerful tone  you see ralph ive read a great deal about these south sea islands and i know that in many places they are scattered about in thousands over the sea so theyre almost sure to fall in with one of them before long  im sure i hope so said peterkin earnestly  but what has become of the wreck jack  i saw you clambering up the rocks there while i was watching ralph  did you say she had gone to pieces  no she has not gone to pieces but she has gone to the bottom replied jack  as i said before she struck on the tail of the island and stove in her bow but the next breaker swung her clear and she floated away to leeward  the poor fellows in the boat made a hard struggle to reach her but long before they came near her she filled and went down  it was after she had foundered that i saw them trying to pull to the island  there was a long silence after jack had ceased speaking and i have no doubt that each was revolving in his mind our extraordinary position for my part i cannot say that my reflections were very agreeable  i knew that we were on an island for jack had said so but whether it was inhabited or not i did not know  if it should be inhabited i felt certain from all i had heard of south sea islanders that we should be roasted alive and eaten  if it should turn out to be uninhabited i fancied that we should be starved to death  oh thought i if the ship had only struck on the rocks we might have done pretty well for we could have obtained provisions from her and tools to enable us to build a shelter but nowalas alas we are lost  these last words i uttered aloud in my distress  lost ralph exclaimed jack while a smile overspread his hearty countenance  saved you should have said  your cogitations seem to have taken a wrong road and led you to a wrong conclusion  do you know what conclusion i have come to said peterkin  i have made up my mind that its capitalfirstratethe best thing that ever happened to us and the most splendid prospect that ever lay before three jolly young tars  weve got an island all to ourselves  well take possession in the name of the king  well go and enter the service of its black inhabitants  of course well rise naturally to the top of affairs white men always do in savage countries  you shall be king jack ralph prime minister and i shall be  the courtjester interrupted jack  no retorted peterkin ill have no title at all  i shall merely accept a highly responsible situation under government for you see jack im fond of having an enormous salary and nothing to do  but suppose there are no natives  then well build a charming villa and plant a lovely garden round it stuck all full of the most splendiferous tropical flowers and well farm the land plant sow reap eat sleep and be merry  but to be serious said jack assuming a grave expression of countenancewhich i observed always had the effect of checking peterkins disposition to make fun of everythingwe are really in rather an uncomfortable position  if this is a desert island we shall have to live very much like the wild beasts for we have not a tool of any kindnot even a knife  yes we have that said peterkin fumbling in his trousers pocket from which he drew forth a small penknife with only one blade and that was broken  well thats better than nothingbut come said jack rising we are wasting our time in talking instead of doingyou seem well enough to walk now ralphlet us see what we have got in our pockets and then let us climb some hill and ascertain what sort of island we have been cast upon for whether good or bad it seems likely to be our home for some time to come    chapter four  we examine into our personal property and make a happy discoveryour island describedjack proves himself to be learned and sagacious above his fellowscurious discoveriesnatural lemonade  we now seated ourselves upon a rock and began to examine into our personal property  when we reached the shore after being wrecked my companions had taken off part of their clothes and spread them out in the sun to dry for although the gale was raging fiercely there was not a single cloud in the bright sky  they had also stripped off most part of my wet clothes and spread them also on the rocks  having resumed our garments we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care and laid their contents out on a flat stone before us and now that our minds were fully alive to our condition it was with no little anxiety that we turned our several pockets inside out in order that nothing might escape us  when all was collected together we found that our worldly goods consisted of the following articles  first a small penknife with a single blade broken off about the middle and very rusty besides having two or three notches on its edge peterkin said of this with his usual pleasantry that it would do for a saw as well as a knife which was a great advantage  second an old germansilver pencilcase without any lead in it  third a piece of whipcord about six yards long  fourth a sailmakers needle of a small size  fifth a ships telescope which i happened to have in my hand at the time the ship struck and which i had clung to firmly all the time i was in the water indeed it was with difficulty that jack got it out of my grasp when i was lying insensible on the shore  i cannot understand why i kept such a firm hold of this telescope  they say that a drowning man will clutch at a straw  perhaps it may have been some such feeling in me for i did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were wrecked  however we felt some pleasure in having it with us now although we did not see that it could be of much use to us as the glass at the small end was broken to pieces  our sixth article was a brass ring which jack always wore on his little finger  i never understood why he wore it for jack was not vain of his appearance and did not seem to care for ornaments of any kind  peterkin said it was in memory of the girl he left behind him  but as he never spoke of this girl to either of us i am inclined to think that peterkin was either jesting or mistaken  in addition to these articles we had a little bit of tinder and the clothes on our backs  these last were as follows  each of us had on a pair of stout canvas trousers and a pair of sailors thick shoes  jack wore a red flannel shirt a blue jacket and a red kilmarnock bonnet or nightcap besides a pair of worsted socks and a cotton pockethandkerchief with sixteen portraits of lord nelson printed on it and a unionjack in the middle  peterkin had on a striped flannel shirtwhich he wore outside his trousers and belted round his waist after the manner of a tunicand a round black straw hat  he had no jacket having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea but this was not of much consequence as the climate of the island proved to be extremely mildso much so indeed that jack and i often preferred to go about without our jackets  peterkin had also a pair of white cotton socks and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it  my own costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt a blue jacket a black cap and a pair of worsted socks besides the shoes and canvas trousers already mentioned  this was all we had and besides these things we had nothing else but when we thought of the danger from which we had escaped and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck on the reef during the night we felt very thankful that we were possessed of so much although i must confess we sometimes wished that we had had a little more  while we were examining these things and talking about them jack suddenly started and exclaimed  the oar  we have forgotten the oar  what good will that do us said peterkin  theres wood enough on the island to make a thousand oars  ay lad replied jack but theres a bit of hoopiron at the end of it and that may be of much use to us  very true said i let us go fetch it  and with that we all three rose and hastened down to the beach  i still felt a little weak from loss of blood so that my companions soon began to leave me behind but jack perceived this and with his usual considerate goodnature turned back to help me  this was now the first time that i had looked well about me since landing as the spot where i had been laid was covered with thick bushes which almost hid the country from our view  as we now emerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together i cast my eyes about and truly my heart glowed within me and my spirits rose at the beautiful prospect which i beheld on every side  the gale had suddenly died away just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed our ship upon the rocks and had nothing more to do after accomplishing that  the island on which we stood was hilly and covered almost everywhere with the most beautiful and richly coloured trees bushes and shrubs none of which i knew the names of at that timeexcept indeed the cocoanut palms which i recognised at once from the many pictures that i had seen of them before i left home  a sandy beach of dazzling whiteness lined this brightgreen shore and upon it there fell a gentle ripple of the sea  this last astonished me much for i recollected that at home the sea used to fall in huge billows on the shore long after a storm had subsided  but on casting my glance out to sea the cause became apparent  about a mile distant from the shore i saw the great billows of the ocean rolling like a green wall and falling with a long loud roar upon a low coral reef where they were dashed into white foam and flung up in clouds of spray  this spray sometimes flew exceedingly high and every here and there a beautiful rainbow was formed for a moment among the falling drops  we afterwards found that this coral reef extended quite round the island and formed a natural breakwater to it  beyond this the sea rose and tossed violently from the effects of the storm but between the reef and the shore it was as calm and as smooth as a pond  my heart was filled with more delight than i can express at sight of so many glorious objects and my thoughts turned suddenly to the contemplation of the creator of them all  i mention this the more gladly because at that time i am ashamed to say i very seldom thought of my creator although i was constantly surrounded by the most beautiful and wonderful of his works  i observed from the expression of my companions countenance that he too derived much joy from the splendid scenery which was all the more agreeable to us after our long voyage on the salt sea  there the breeze was fresh and cold but here it was delightfully mild and when a puff blew off the land it came laden with the most exquisite perfume that can be imagined  while we thus gazed we were startled by a loud huzza from peterkin and on looking towards the edge of the sea we saw him capering and jumping about like a monkey and ever and anon tugging with all his might at something that lay upon the shore  what an odd fellow he is to be sure said jack taking me by the arm and hurrying forward  come let us hasten to see what it is  here it is boyshurrah  come along  just what we want cried peterkin as we drew near still tugging with all his power firstrate just the very ticket  i need scarcely say to my readers that my companion peterkin was in the habit of using very remarkable and peculiar phrases  and i am free to confess that i did not well understand the meaning of some of them such for instance as the very ticket but i think it my duty to recount everything relating to my adventures with a strict regard to truthfulness in as far as my memory serves me so i write as nearly as possible the exact words that my companions spoke  i often asked peterkin to explain what he meant by ticket but he always answered me by going into fits of laughter  however by observing the occasions on which he used it i came to understand that it meant to show that something was remarkably good or fortunate  on coming up we found that peterkin was vainly endeavouring to pull the axe out of the oar into which it will be remembered jack struck it while endeavouring to cut away the cordage among which it had become entangled at the bow of the ship  fortunately for us the axe had remained fast in the oar and even now all peterkins strength could not draw it out of the cut  ah that is capital indeed cried jack at the same time giving the axe a wrench that plucked it out of the tough wood  how fortunate this is  it will be of more value to us than a hundred knives and the edge is quite new and sharp  ill answer for the toughness of the handle at any rate cried peterkin my arms are nearly pulled out of the sockets  but see here our luck is great  there is iron on the blade  he pointed to a piece of hoopiron as he spoke which had been nailed round the blade of the oar to prevent it from splitting  this also was a fortunate discovery  jack went down on his knees and with the edge of the axe began carefully to force out the nails  but as they were firmly fixed in and the operation blunted our axe we carried the oar up with us to the place where we had left the rest of our things intending to burn the wood away from the iron at a more convenient time  now lads said jack after we had laid it on the stone which contained our little all i propose that we should go to the tail of the island where the ship struck which is only a quarter of a mile off and see if anything else has been thrown ashore  i dont expect anything but it is well to see  when we get back here it will be time to have our supper and prepare our beds  agreed cried peterkin and i together as indeed we would have agreed to any proposal that jack made for besides his being older and much stronger and taller than either of us he was a very clever fellow and i think would have induced people much older than himself to choose him for their leader especially if they required to be led on a bold enterprise  now as we hastened along the white beach which shone so brightly in the rays of the setting sun that our eyes were quite dazzled by its glare it suddenly came into peterkins head that we had nothing to eat except the wild berries which grew in profusion at our feet  what shall we do jack said he with a rueful look  perhaps they may be poisonous  no fear replied jack confidently  i have observed that a few of them are not unlike some of the berries that grow wild on our own native hills  besides i saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few minutes ago and what wont kill the birds wont kill us  but look up there peterkin continued jack pointing to the branched head of a cocoanut palm  there are nuts for us in all stages  so there are cried peterkin who being of a very unobservant nature had been too much taken up with other things to notice anything so high above his head as the fruit of a palmtree  but whatever faults my young comrade had he could not be blamed for want of activity or animal spirits  indeed the nuts had scarcely been pointed out to him when he bounded up the tall stem of the tree like a squirrel and in a few minutes returned with three nuts each as large as a mans fist  you had better keep them till we return said jack  let us finish our work before eating  so be it captain go ahead cried peterkin thrusting the nuts into his trousers pocket  in fact i dont want to eat just now but i would give a good deal for a drink  oh that i could find a spring but i dont see the smallest sign of one hereabouts  i say jack how does it happen that you seem to be up to everything  you have told us the names of halfadozen trees already and yet you say that you were never in the south seas before  im not up to everything peterkin as youll find out ere long replied jack with a smile but i have been a great reader of books of travel and adventure all my life and that has put me up to a good many things that you are perhaps not acquainted with  oh jack thats all humbug  if you begin to lay everything to the credit of books ill quite lose my opinion of you cried peterkin with a look of contempt  ive seen a lot o fellows that were always poring over books and when they came to try to do anything they were no better than baboons  you are quite right retorted jack and i have seen a lot of fellows who never looked into books at all who knew nothing about anything except the things they had actually seen and very little they knew even about these  indeed some were so ignorant that they did not know that cocoanuts grew on cocoanut trees  i could not refrain from laughing at this rebuke for there was much truth in it as to peterkins ignorance  humph maybe youre right answered peterkin but i would not give tuppence for a man of books if he had nothing else in him  neither would i said jack but thats no reason why you should run books down or think less of me for having read them  suppose now peterkin that you wanted to build a ship and i were to give you a long and particular account of the way to do it would not that be very useful  no doubt of it said peterkin laughing  and suppose i were to write the account in a letter instead of telling you in words would that be less useful  wellno perhaps not  well suppose i were to print it and send it to you in the form of a book would it not be as good and useful as ever  oh bother  jack youre a philosopher and thats worse than anything cried peterkin with a look of pretended horror  very well peterkin we shall see returned jack halting under the shade of a cocoanut tree  you said you were thirsty just a minute ago  now jump up that tree and bring down a nutnot a ripe one bring a green unripe one  peterkin looked surprised but seeing that jack was in earnest he obeyed  now cut a hole in it with your penknife and clap it to your mouth old fellow said jack  peterkin did as he was directed and we both burst into uncontrollable laughter at the changes that instantly passed over his expressive countenance  no sooner had he put the nut to his mouth and thrown back his head in order to catch what came out of it than his eyes opened to twice their ordinary size with astonishment while his throat moved vigorously in the act of swallowing  then a smile and a look of intense delight overspread his face except indeed the mouth which being firmly fixed to the hole in the nut could not take part in the expression but he endeavoured to make up for this by winking at us excessively with his right eye  at length he stopped and drawing a long breath exclaimed  nectar perfect nectari say jack youre a britonthe best fellow i ever met in my lifeonly taste that said he turning to me and holding the nut to my mouth  i immediately drank and certainly i was much surprised at the delightful liquid that flowed copiously down my throat  it was extremely cool and had a sweet taste mingled with acid in fact it was the likest thing to lemonade i ever tasted and was most grateful and refreshing  i handed the nut to jack who after tasting it said now peterkin you unbeliever  i never saw or tasted a cocoanut in my life before except those sold in shops at home but i once read that the green nuts contain that stuff and you see it is true  and pray asked peterkin what sort of stuff does the ripe nut contain  a hollow kernel answered jack with a liquid like milk in it but it does not satisfy thirst so well as hunger  it is very wholesome food i believe  meat and drink on the same tree cried peterkin washing in the sea lodging on the groundand all for nothing  my dear boys were set up for life  it must be the ancient paradisehurrah and peterkin tossed his straw hat in the air and ran along the beach hallooing like a madman with delight  we afterwards found however that these lovely islands were very unlike paradise in many things  but more of this in its proper place  we had now come to the point of rocks on which the ship had struck but did not find a single article although we searched carefully among the coral rocks which at this place jutted out so far as nearly to join the reef that encircled the island  just as we were about to return however we saw something black floating in a little cove that had escaped our observation  running forward we drew it from the water and found it to be a long thick leather boot such as fishermen at home wear and a few paces farther on we picked up its fellow  we at once recognised these as having belonged to our captain for he had worn them during the whole of the storm in order to guard his legs from the waves and spray that constantly washed over our decks  my first thought on seeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned but jack soon put my mind more at rest on that point by saying that if the captain had been drowned with the boots on he would certainly have been washed ashore along with them and that he had no doubt whatever he had kicked them off while in the sea that he might swim more easily  peterkin immediately put them on but they were so large that as jack said they would have done for boots trousers and vest too  i also tried them but although i was long enough in the legs for them they were much too large in the feet for me  so we handed them to jack who was anxious to make me keep them but as they fitted his large limbs and feet as if they had been made for him i would not hear of it so he consented at last to use them  i may remark however that jack did not use them often as they were extremely heavy  it was beginning to grow dark when we returned to our encampment so we put off our visit to the top of a hill till next day and employed the light that yet remained to us in cutting down a quantity of boughs and the broad leaves of a tree of which none of us knew the name  with these we erected a sort of rustic bower in which we meant to pass the night  there was no absolute necessity for this because the air of our island was so genial and balmy that we could have slept quite well without any shelter but we were so little used to sleeping in the open air that we did not quite relish the idea of lying down without any covering over us  besides our bower would shelter us from the nightdews or rain if any should happen to fall  having strewed the floor with leaves and dry grass we bethought ourselves of supper  but it now occurred to us for the first time that we had no means of making a fire  now theres a fix  what shall we do said peterkin while we both turned our eyes to jack to whom we always looked in our difficulties jack seemed not a little perplexed  there are flints enough no doubt on the beach said he but they are of no use at all without a steel  however we must try  so saying he went to the beach and soon returned with two flints  on one of these he placed the tinder and endeavoured to ignite it but it was with great difficulty that a very small spark was struck out of the flints and the tinder being a bad hard piece would not catch  he then tried the bit of hoopiron which would not strike fire at all and after that the back of the axe with no better success  during all these trials peterkin sat with his hands in his pockets gazing with a most melancholy visage at our comrade his face growing longer and more miserable at each successive failure  oh dear he sighed i would not care a button for the cooking of our victualsperhaps they dont need itbut its so dismal to eat ones supper in the dark and we have had such a capital day that its a pity to finish off in this glum style  oh i have it he cried starting up the spyglassthe big glass at the end is a burningglass  you forget that we have no sun said i  peterkin was silent  in his sudden recollection of the telescope he had quite overlooked the absence of the sun  ah boys ive got it now exclaimed jack rising and cutting a branch from a neighbouring bush which he stripped of its leaves  i recollect seeing this done once at home  hand me the bit of whipcord  with the cord and branch jack soon formed a bow  then he cut a piece about three inches long off the end of a dead branch which he pointed at the two ends  round this he passed the cord of the bow and placed one end against his chest which was protected from its point by a chip of wood the other point he placed against the bit of tinder and then began to saw vigorously with the bow just as a blacksmith does with his drill while boring a hole in a piece of iron  in a few seconds the tinder began to smoke in less than a minute it caught fire and in less than a quarter of an hour we were drinking our lemonade and eating cocoanuts round a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep while the smoke flames and sparks flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging palmtrees and cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower  that night the starry sky looked down through the gently rustling trees upon our slumbers and the distant roaring of the surf upon the coral reef was our lullaby    chapter five  morning and cogitations connected therewithwe luxuriate in the sea try our diving powers and make enchanting excursions among the coral groves at the bottom of the oceanthe wonders of the deep enlarged upon  what a joyful thing it is to awaken on a fresh glorious morning and find the rising sun staring into your face with dazzling brilliancy to hear the birds twittering in the bushes and to hear the murmuring of a rill or the soft hissing ripples as they fall upon the seashore  at any time and in any place such sights and sounds are most charming but more especially are they so when one awakens to them for the first time in a novel and romantic situation with the soft sweet air of a tropical climate mingling with the fresh smell of the sea and stirring the strange leaves that flutter overhead and around one or ruffling the plumage of the stranger birds that fly inquiringly around as if to demand what business we have to intrude uninvited on their domains when i awoke on the morning after the shipwreck i found myself in this most delightful condition and as i lay on my back upon my bed of leaves gazing up through the branches of the cocoanut trees into the clear blue sky and watched the few fleecy clouds that passed slowly across it my heart expanded more and more with an exulting gladness the like of which i had never felt before  while i meditated my thoughts again turned to the great and kind creator of this beautiful world as they had done on the previous day when i first beheld the sea and the coral reef with the mighty waves dashing over it into the calm waters of the lagoon  while thus meditating i naturally bethought me of my bible for i had faithfully kept the promise which i gave at parting to my beloved motherthat i would read it every morning and it was with a feeling of dismay that i remembered i had left it in the ship  i was much troubled about this  however i consoled myself with reflecting that i could keep the second part of my promise to hernamely that i should never omit to say my prayers  so i rose quietly lest i should disturb my companions who were still asleep and stepped aside into the bushes for this purpose  on my return i found them still slumbering so i again lay down to think over our situation  just at that moment i was attracted by the sight of a very small parrot which jack afterwards told me was called a paroquet  it was seated on a twig that overhung peterkins head and i was speedily lost in admiration of its brightgreen plumage which was mingled with other gay colours  while i looked i observed that the bird turned its head slowly from side to side and looked downwards first with the one eye and then with the other  on glancing downwards i observed that peterkins mouth was wide open and that this remarkable bird was looking into it  peterkin used to say that i had not an atom of fun in my composition and that i never could understand a joke  in regard to the latter perhaps he was right yet i think that when they were explained to me i understood jokes as well as most people  but in regard to the former he must certainly have been wrong for this bird seemed to me to be extremely funny and i could not help thinking that if it should happen to faint or slip its foot and fall off the twig into peterkins mouth he would perhaps think it funny too  suddenly the paroquet bent down its head and uttered a loud scream in his face this awoke him and with a cry of surprise he started up while the foolish bird flew precipitately away  oh you monster cried peterkin shaking his fist at the bird  then he yawned and rubbed his eyes and asked what oclock it was  i smiled at this question and answered that as our watches were at the bottom of the sea i could not tell but it was a little past sunrise  peterkin now began to remember where we were  as he looked up into the bright sky and snuffed the scented air his eyes glistened with delight and he uttered a faint hurrah and yawned again  then he gazed slowly round till observing the calm sea through an opening in the bushes he started suddenly up as if he had received an electric shock uttered a vehement shout flung off his garments and rushing over the white sands plunged into the water  the cry awoke jack who rose on his elbow with a look of grave surprise but this was followed by a quiet smile of intelligence on seeing peterkin in the water  with an energy that he only gave way to in moments of excitement jack bounded to his feet threw off his clothes shook back his hair and with a lionlike spring dashed over the sands and plunged into the sea with such force as quite to envelop peterkin in a shower of spray  jack was a remarkably good swimmer and diver so that after his plunge we saw no sign of him for nearly a minute after which he suddenly emerged with a cry of joy a good many yards out from the shore  my spirits were so much raised by seeing all this that i too hastily threw off my garments and endeavoured to imitate jacks vigorous bound but i was so awkward that my foot caught on a stump and i fell to the ground  then i slipped on a stone while running over the sand and nearly fell again much to the amusement of peterkin who laughed heartily and called me a slow coach while jack cried out come along ralph and ill help you  however when i got into the water i managed very well for i was really a good swimmer and diver too  i could not indeed equal jack who was superior to any englishman i ever saw but i infinitely surpassed peterkin who could only swim a little and could not dive at all  while peterkin enjoyed himself in the shallow water and in running along the beach jack and i swam out into the deep water and occasionally dived for stones  i shall never forget my surprise and delight on first beholding the bottom of the sea  as i have before stated the water within the reef was as calm as a pond and as there was no wind it was quite clear from the surface to the bottom so that we could see down easily even at a depth of twenty or thirty yards  when jack and i dived into shallower water we expected to have found sand and stones instead of which we found ourselves in what appeared really to be an enchanted garden  the whole of the bottom of the lagoon as we called the calm water within the reef was covered with coral of every shape size and hue  some portions were formed like large mushrooms others appeared like the brain of a man having stalks or necks attached to them but the most common kind was a species of branching coral and some portions were of a lovely palepink colour others were pure white  among this there grew large quantities of seaweed of the richest hues imaginable and of the most graceful forms while innumerable fishesblue red yellow green and stripedsported in and out amongst the flowerbeds of this submarine garden and did not appear to be at all afraid of our approaching them  on darting to the surface for breath after our first dive jack and i rose close to each other  did you ever in your life ralph see anything so lovely said jack as he flung the spray from his hair  never i replied  it appears to me like fairy realms  i can scarcely believe that we are not dreaming  dreaming cried jack  do you know ralph im halftempted to think that we really are dreaming  but if so i am resolved to make the most of it and dream another dive so here goesdown again my boy  we took the second dive together and kept beside each other while under water and i was greatly surprised to find that we could keep down much longer than i ever recollect having done in our own seas at home  i believe that this was owing to the heat of the water which was so warm that we afterwards found we could remain in it for two and three hours at a time without feeling any unpleasant effects such as we used to experience in the sea at home  when jack reached the bottom he grasped the coral stems and crept along on his hands and knees peeping under the seaweed and among the rocks  i observed him also pick up one or two large oysters and retain them in his grasp as if he meant to take them up with him so i also gathered a few  suddenly he made a grasp at a fish with blue and yellow stripes on its back and actually touched its tail but did not catch it  at this he turned towards me and attempted to smile but no sooner had he done so than he sprang like an arrow to the surface where on following him i found him gasping and coughing and spitting water from his mouth  in a few minutes he recovered and we both turned to swim ashore  i declare ralph said he that i actually tried to laugh under water  so i saw i replied and i observed that you very nearly caught that fish by the tail  it would have done capitally for breakfast if you had  breakfast enough here said he holding up the oysters as we landed and ran up the beachhallo peterkin  here you are boy split open these fellows while ralph and i put on our clothes  theyll agree with the cocoanuts excellently i have no doubt  peterkin who was already dressed took the oysters and opened them with the edge of our axe exclaiming now thats capital  theres nothing im so fond of  ah thats lucky remarked jack  ill be able to keep you in good order now master peterkin  you know you cant dive any better than a cat  so sir whenever you behave ill you shall have no oysters for breakfast  im very glad that our prospect of breakfast is so good said i for im very hungry  here then stop your mouth with that ralph said peterkin holding a large oyster to my lips  i opened my mouth and swallowed it in silence and really it was remarkably good  we now set ourselves earnestly about our preparations for spending the day  we had no difficulty with the fire this morning as our burningglass was an admirable one and while we roasted a few oysters and ate our cocoanuts we held a long animated conversation about our plans for the future  what those plans were and how we carried them into effect the reader shall see hereafter    chapter six  an excursion into the interior in which we make many valuable and interesting discoverieswe get a dreadful frightthe breadfruit treewonderful peculiarity of some of the fruittreessigns of former inhabitants  our first care after breakfast was to place the few articles we possessed in the crevice of a rock at the farther end of a small cave which we discovered near our encampment  this cave we hoped might be useful to us afterwards as a storehouse  then we cut two large clubs off a species of very hard tree which grew near at hand  one of these was given to peterkin the other to me and jack armed himself with the axe  we took these precautions because we purposed to make an excursion to the top of the mountains of the interior in order to obtain a better view of our island  of course we knew not what dangers might befall us by the way so thought it best to be prepared  having completed our arrangements and carefully extinguished our fire we sallied forth and walked a short distance along the seabeach till we came to the entrance of a valley through which flowed the rivulet before mentioned  here we turned our backs on the sea and struck into the interior  the prospect that burst upon our view on entering the valley was truly splendid  on either side of us there was a gentle rise in the land which thus formed two ridges about a mile apart on each side of the valley  these ridgeswhich as well as the low grounds between them were covered with trees and shrubs of the most luxuriant kindcontinued to recede inland for about two miles when they joined the foot of a small mountain  this hill rose rather abruptly from the head of the valley and was likewise entirely covered even to the top with trees except on one particular spot near the left shoulder where was a bare and rocky place of a broken and savage character  beyond this hill we could not see and we therefore directed our course up the banks of the rivulet towards the foot of it intending to climb to the top should that be possibleas indeed we had no doubt it was  jack being the wisest and boldest among us took the lead carrying the axe on his shoulder  peterkin with his enormous club came second as he said he should like to be in a position to defend me if any danger should threaten  i brought up the rear but having been more taken up with the wonderful and curious things i saw at starting than with thoughts of possible danger i had very foolishly left my club behind me  although as i have said the trees and bushes were very luxuriant they were not so thickly crowded together as to hinder our progress among them  we were able to wind in and out and to follow the banks of the stream quite easily although it is true the height and thickness of the foliage prevented us from seeing far ahead  but sometimes a juttingout rock on the hillsides afforded us a position whence we could enjoy the romantic view and mark our progress towards the foot of the hill  i was particularly struck during the walk with the richness of the undergrowth in most places and recognised many berries and plants that resembled those of my native land especially a tall elegantly formed fern which emitted an agreeable perfume  there were several kinds of flowers too but i did not see so many of these as i should have expected in such a climate  we also saw a great variety of small birds of bright plumage and many paroquets similar to the one that awoke peterkin so rudely in the morning  thus we advanced to the foot of the hill without encountering anything to alarm us except indeed once when we were passing close under a part of the hill which was hidden from our view by the broad leaves of the bananatrees which grew in great luxuriance in that part  jack was just preparing to force his way through this thicket when we were startled and arrested by a strange pattering or rumbling sound which appeared to us quite different from any of the sounds we had heard during the previous part of our walk  hallo cried peterkin stopping short and grasping his club with both hands whats that  neither of us replied but jack seized his axe in his right hand while with the other he pushed aside the broad leaves and endeavoured to peer amongst them  i can see nothing he said after a short pause  i think it  again the rumbling sound came louder than before and we all sprang back and stood on the defensive  for myself having forgotten my club and not having taken the precaution to cut another i buttoned my jacket doubled my fists and threw myself into a boxing attitude  i must say however that i felt somewhat uneasy and my companions afterwards confessed that their thoughts at this moment had been instantly filled with all they had ever heard or read of wild beasts and savages torturings at the stake roastings alive and suchlike horrible things  suddenly the pattering noise increased with tenfold violence  it was followed by a fearful crash among the bushes which was rapidly repeated as if some gigantic animal were bounding towards us  in another moment an enormous rock came crashing through the shrubbery followed by a cloud of dust and small stones and flew close past the spot where we stood carrying bushes and young trees along with it  pooh is that all exclaimed peterkin wiping the perspiration off his forehead  why i thought it was all the wild men and beasts in the south sea islands galloping on in one grand charge to sweep us off the face of the earth instead of a mere stone tumbling down the mountainside  nevertheless remarked jack if that same stone had hit any of us it would have rendered the charge you speak of quite unnecessary peterkin  this was true and i felt very thankful for our escape  on examining the spot more narrowly we found that it lay close to the foot of a very rugged precipice from which stones of various sizes were always tumbling at intervals  indeed the numerous fragments lying scattered all round might have suggested the cause of the sound had we not been too suddenly alarmed to think of anything  we now resumed our journey resolving that in our future excursions into the interior we would be careful to avoid this dangerous precipice  soon afterwards we arrived at the foot of the hill and prepared to ascend it  here jack made a discovery which caused us all very great joy  this was a tree of a remarkably beautiful appearance which jack confidently declared to be the celebrated breadfruit tree  is it celebrated inquired peterkin with a look of great simplicity  it is replied jack  thats odd now rejoined peterkin i never heard of it before  then its not so celebrated as i thought it was returned jack quietly squeezing peterkins hat over his eyes but listen you ignorant boobie and hear of it now  peterkin readjusted his hat and was soon listening with as much interest as myself while jack told us that this tree is one of the most valuable in the islands of the south that it bears two sometimes three crops of fruit in the year that the fruit is very like wheaten bread in appearance and that it constitutes the principal food of many of the islanders  so said peterkin we seem to have everything ready prepared to our hands in this wonderful islandlemonade ready bottled in nuts and loafbread growing on the trees  peterkin as usual was jesting nevertheless it is a curious fact that he spoke almost the literal truth  moreover continued jack the breadfruit tree affords a capital gum which serves the natives for pitching their canoes the bark of the young branches is made by them into cloth and of the wood which is durable and of a good colour they build their houses  so you see lads that we have no lack of material here to make us comfortable if we are only clever enough to use it  but are you sure that thats it asked peterkin  quite sure replied jack for i was particularly interested in the account i once read of it and i remember the description well  i am sorry however that i have forgotten the descriptions of many other trees which i am sure we have seen today if we could but recognise them  so you see peterkin im not up to everything yet  never mind jack said peterkin with a grave patronising expression of countenance patting his tall companion on the shouldernever mind jack you know a good deal for your age  youre a clever boy sira promising young man and if you only go on as you have begun sir you will  the end of this speech was suddenly cut short by jack tripping up peterkins heels and tumbling him into a mass of thick shrubs where finding himself comfortable he lay still basking in the sunshine while jack and i examined the breadfruit tree  we were much struck with the deep rich green colour of its broad leaves which were twelve or eighteen inches long deeply indented and of a glossy smoothness like the laurel  the fruit with which it was loaded was nearly round and appeared to be about six inches in diameter with a rough rind marked with lozengeshaped divisions  it was of various colours from light peagreen to brown and rich yellow jack said that the yellow was the ripe fruit  we afterwards found that most of the fruittrees on the island were evergreens and that we might when we wished pluck the blossom and the ripe fruit from the same tree  such a wonderful difference from the trees of our own country surprised us not a little  the bark of the tree was rough and lightcoloured the trunk was about two feet in diameter and it appeared to be twenty feet high being quite destitute of branches up to that height where it branched off into a beautiful and umbrageous head we noticed that the fruit hung in clusters of twos and threes on the branches but as we were anxious to get to the top of the hill we refrained from attempting to pluck any at that time  our hearts were now very much cheered by our good fortune and it was with light and active steps that we clambered up the steep sides of the hill  on reaching the summit a new and if possible a grander prospect met our gaze  we found that this was not the highest part of the island but that another hill lay beyond with a wide valley between it and the one on which we stood  this valley like the first was also full of rich treessome dark and some light green some heavy and thick in foliage and others light feathery and graceful while the beautiful blossoms on many of them threw a sort of rainbow tint over all and gave to the valley the appearance of a garden of flowers among these we recognised many of the breadfruit trees laden with yellow fruit and also a great many cocoanut palms  after gazing our fill we pushed down the hillside crossed the valley and soon began to ascend the second mountain  it was clothed with trees nearly to the top but the summit was bare and in some places broken  while on our way up we came to an object which filled us with much interest  this was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down with an axe  so then we were not the first who had viewed this beautiful isle  the hand of man had been at work there before us  it now began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited although we had not seen any traces of man until now  but a second glance at the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so now than formerly for the surface of the wood was quite decayed and partly covered with fungus and green matter so that it must have been cut many years ago  perhaps said peterkin some ship or other has touched here long ago for wood and only taken one tree  we did not think this likely however because in such circumstances the crew of a ship would cut wood of small size and near the shore whereas this was a large tree and stood near the top of the mountain in fact it was the highest large tree on the mountain all above it being wood of very recent growth  i cant understand it said jack scratching the surface of the stump with his axe  i can only suppose that the savages have been here and cut it for some purpose known only to themselves  but hallo what have we here  as he spoke jack began carefully to scrape away the moss and fungus from the stump and soon laid bare three distinct traces of marks as if some inscription or initials had been cut thereon  but although the traces were distinct beyond all doubt the exact form of the letters could not be made out  jack thought they looked like js but we could not be certain  they had apparently been carelessly cut and long exposure to the weather had so broken them up that we could not make out what they were  we were exceedingly perplexed at this discovery and stayed a long time at the place conjecturing what these marks could have been but without avail so as the day was advancing we left it and quickly reached the top of the mountain  we found this to be the highest point of the island and from it we saw our kingdom lying as it were like a map around us  as i have always thought it impossible to get a thing properly into ones understanding without comprehending it i shall beg the readers patience for a little while i describe our island thus shortly  it consisted of two mountains the one we guessed at five hundred feet the other on which we stood at one thousand  between these lay a rich beautiful valley as already said  this valley crossed the island from one end to the other being high in the middle and sloping on each side towards the sea  the large mountain sloped on the side farthest from where we had been wrecked gradually towards the sea but although when viewed at a glance it had thus a regular sloping appearance a more careful observation showed that it was broken up into a multitude of very small valesor rather dells and glensintermingled with little rugged spots and small but abrupt precipices here and there with rivulets tumbling over their edges and wandering down the slopes in little white streams sometimes glistening among the broad leaves of the breadfruit and cocoanut trees or hiding altogether beneath the rich underwood  at the base of this mountain lay a narrow brightgreen plain or meadow which terminated abruptly at the shore  on the other side of the island whence we had come stood the smaller hill at the foot of which diverged three valleysone being that which we had ascended with a smaller vale on each side of it and separated from it by the two ridges before mentioned  in these smaller valleys there were no streams but they were clothed with the same luxuriant vegetation  the diameter of the island seemed to be about ten miles and as it was almost circular in form its circumference must have been thirty miles perhaps a little more if allowance be made for the numerous bays and indentations of the shore  the entire island was belted by a beach of pure white sand on which laved the gentle ripples of the lagoon  we now also observed that the coral reef completely encircled the island but it varied its distance from it here and therein some places being a mile from the beach in others a few hundred yards but the average distance was halfamile  the reef lay very low and the spray of the surf broke quite over it in many places  this surf never ceased its roar for however calm the weather might be there is always a gentle swaying motion in the great pacific which although scarce noticeable out at sea reaches the shore at last in a huge billow  the water within the lagoon as before said was perfectly still  there were three narrow openings in the reef one opposite each end of the valley which i have described as crossing the island the other opposite our own valley which we afterwards named the valley of the wreck  at each of these openings the reef rose into two small green islets covered with bushes and having one or two cocoanut palms on each  these islets were very singular and appeared as if planted expressly for the purpose of marking the channel into the lagoon  our captain was making for one of these openings the day we were wreckedand would have reached it too i doubt not had not the rudder been torn away  within the lagoon were several pretty low coral islands just opposite our encampment and immediately beyond these out at sea lay about a dozen other islands at various distances from halfamile to ten milesall of them as far as we could discern smaller than ours and apparently uninhabited  they seemed to be low coral islands raised but little above the sea yet covered with cocoanut trees  all this we noted and a great deal more while we sat on the top of the mountain  after we had satisfied ourselves we prepared to return but here again we discovered traces of the presence of man  these were a pole or staff and one or two pieces of wood which had been squared with an axe  all of these were however very much decayed and they had evidently not been touched for many years  full of these discoveries we returned to our encampment  on the way we fell in with the traces of some fourfooted animal but whether old or of recent date none of us were able to guess  this also tended to raise our hopes of obtaining some animal food on the island so we reached home in good spirits quite prepared for supper and highly satisfied with our excursion  after much discussion in which peterkin took the lead we came to the conclusion that the island was uninhabited and went to bed    chapter seven  jacks ingenuitywe get into difficulties about fishing and get out of them by a method which gives us a cold bathhorrible encounter with a shark  for several days after the excursion related in the last chapter we did not wander far from our encampment but gave ourselves up to forming plans for the future and making our present abode comfortable  there were various causes that induced this state of comparative inaction  in the first place although everything around us was so delightful and we could without difficulty obtain all that we required for our bodily comfort we did not quite like the idea of settling down here for the rest of our lives far away from our friends and our native land  to set energetically about preparations for a permanent residence seemed so like making up our minds to saying adieu to home and friends for ever that we tacitly shrank from it and put off our preparations for one reason and another as long as we could  then there was a little uncertainty still as to there being natives on the island and we entertained a kind of faint hope that a ship might come and take us off but as day after day passed and neither savages nor ships appeared we gave up all hope of an early deliverance and set diligently to work at our homestead  during this time however we had not been altogether idle  we made several experiments in cooking the cocoanut most of which did not improve it  then we removed our goods and took up our abode in the cave but found the change so bad that we returned gladly to the bower besides this we bathed very frequently and talked a great dealat least jack and peterkin did i listened  among other useful things jack who was ever the most active and diligent converted about three inches of the hoopiron into an excellent knife  first he beat it quite flat with the axe then he made a rude handle and tied the hoopiron to it with our piece of whipcord and ground it to an edge on a piece of sandstone  when it was finished he used it to shape a better handle to which he fixed it with a strip of his cotton handkerchiefin which operation he had as peterkin pointed out torn off one of lord nelsons noses  however the whipcord thus set free was used by peterkin as a fishingline  he merely tied a piece of oyster to the end of it  this the fish were allowed to swallow and then they were pulled quickly ashore  but as the line was very short and we had no boat the fish we caught were exceedingly small  one day peterkin came up from the beach where he had been angling and said in a very cross tone ill tell you what jack im not going to be humbugged with catching such contemptible things any longer  i want you to swim out with me on your back and let me fish in deep water  dear me peterkin replied jack i had no idea you were taking the thing so much to heart else i would have got you out of that difficulty long ago  let me see and jack looked down at a piece of timber on which he had been labouring with a peculiar gaze of abstraction which he always assumed when trying to invent or discover anything  what say you to building a boat he inquired looking up hastily  take far too long was the reply cant be bothered waiting  i want to begin at once  again jack considered  i have it he cried  well fell a large tree and launch the trunk of it in the water so that when you want to fish youve nothing to do but to swim out to it  would not a small raft do better said i  much better but we have no ropes to bind it together with  perhaps we may find something hereafter that will do as well but in the meantime let us try the tree  this was agreed on so we started off to a spot not far distant where we knew of a tree that would suit us which grew near the waters edge as soon as we reached it jack threw off his coat and wielding the axe with his sturdy arms hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour without stopping  then he paused and while he sat down to rest i continued the work  then peterkin made a vigorous attack on it so that when jack renewed his powerful blows a few minutes cutting brought it down with a terrible crash  hurrah  now for it cried jack  let us off with its head  so saying he began to cut through the stem again at about six yards from the thick end  this done he cut three strong short poles or levers from the stout branches with which to roll the log down the beach into the sea for as it was nearly two feet thick at the large end we could not move it without such helps  with the levers however we rolled it slowly into the sea  having been thus successful in launching our vessel we next shaped the levers into rude oars or paddles and then attempted to embark  this was easy enough to do but after seating ourselves astride the log it was with the utmost difficulty we kept it from rolling round and plunging us into the water  not that we minded that much but we preferred if possible to fish in dry clothes  to be sure our trousers were necessarily wet as our legs were dangling in the water on each side of the log but as they could be easily dried we did not care  after halfanhours practice we became expert enough to keep our balance pretty steadily  then peterkin laid down his paddle and having baited his line with a whole oyster dropped it into deep water  now then jack said he be cautious steer clear o that seaweed there thats it gently nowgently  i see a fellow at least a foot long down there coming toha thats it  oh bother hes off  did he bite said jack urging the log onwards a little with his paddle  bite  ay he took it into his mouth but the moment i began to haul he opened his jaws and let it out again  let him swallow it next time said jack laughing at the melancholy expression of peterkins visage  there hes again cried peterkin his eyes flashing with excitement look out  now then  no  yes  no  why the brute wont swallow it  try to haul him up by the mouth then cried jack  do it gently  a heavy sigh and a look of blank despair showed that poor peterkin had tried and failed again  never mind lad said jack in a voice of sympathy well move on and offer it to some other fish  so saying jack plied his paddle but scarcely had he moved from the spot when a fish with an enormous head and a little body darted from under a rock and swallowed the bait at once  got him this timethats a fact cried peterkin hauling in the line hes swallowed the bait right down to his tail i declare  oh what a thumper  as the fish came struggling to the surface we leaned forward to see it and overbalanced the log  peterkin threw his arms round the fishs neck and in another instant we were all floundering in the water  a shout of laughter burst from us as we rose to the surface like three drowned rats and seized hold of the log  we soon recovered our position and sat more warily while peterkin secured the fish which had wellnigh escaped in the midst of our struggles  it was little worth having however  but as peterkin remarked it was better than the smouts he had been catching for the last two or three days so we laid it on the log before us and having rebaited the line dropped it in again for another  now while we were thus intent upon our sport our attention was suddenly attracted by a ripple on the sea just a few yards away from us  peterkin shouted to us to paddle in that direction as he thought it was a big fish and we might have a chance of catching it  but jack instead of complying said in a deep earnest tone of voice which i never before heard him use haul up your line peterkin seize your paddle  quickits a shark  the horror with which we heard this may well be imagined for it must be remembered that our legs were hanging down in the water and we could not venture to pull them up without upsetting the log  peterkin instantly hauled up the line and grasping his paddle exerted himself to the utmost while we also did our best to make for shore  but we were a good way off and the log being as i have before said very heavy moved but slowly through the water  we now saw the shark quite distinctly swimming round and round us its sharp fin every now and then protruding above the water  from its active and unsteady motions jack knew it was making up its mind to attack us so he urged us vehemently to paddle for our lives while he himself set us the example  suddenly he shouted look out there he comes and in a second we saw the monstrous fish dive close under us and turn halfover on his side  but we all made a great commotion with our paddles which no doubt frightened it away for that time as we saw it immediately after circling round us as before  throw the fish to him cried jack in a quick suppressed voice well make the shore in time yet if we can keep him off for a few minutes  peterkin stopped one instant to obey the command and then plied his paddle again with all his might  no sooner had the fish fallen on the water than we observed the shark to sink  in another second we saw its white breast rising for sharks always turn over on their sides when about to seize their prey their mouths being not at the point of their heads like those of other fish but as it were under their chins  in another moment his snout rose above the water his wide jaws armed with a terrific double row of teeth appeared the dead fish was engulfed and the shark sank out of sight  but jack was mistaken in supposing that it would be satisfied  in a very few minutes it returned to us and its quick motions led us to fear that it would attack us at once  stop paddling cried jack suddenly  i see it coming up behind us now obey my orders quickly  our lives may depend on it  ralph peterkindo your best to balance the log  dont look out for the shark  dont glance behind you  do nothing but balance the log  peterkin and i instantly did as we were ordered being only too glad to do anything that afforded us a chance or a hope of escape for we had implicit confidence in jacks courage and wisdom  for a few seconds that seemed long minutes to my mind we sat thus silently but i could not resist glancing backward despite the orders to the contrary  on doing so i saw jack sitting rigid like a statue with his paddle raised his lips compressed and his eyebrows bent over his eyes which glared savagely from beneath them down into the water  i also saw the shark to my horror quite close under the log in the act of darting towards jacks foot  i could scarce suppress a cry on beholding this  in another moment the shark rose  jack drew his leg suddenly from the water and threw it over the log  the monsters snout rubbed against the log as it passed and revealed its hideous jaws into which jack instantly plunged the paddle and thrust it down its throat so violent was this act that jack rose to his feet in performing it the log was thereby rolled completely over and we were once more plunged into the water  we all rose spluttering and gasping in a moment  now then strike out for shore cried jackhere peterkin catch hold of my collar and kick out with a will  peterkin did as he was desired and jack struck out with such force that he cut through the water like a boat while i being free from all encumbrance succeeded in keeping up with him  as we had by this time drawn pretty near to the shore a few minutes more sufficed to carry us into shallow water and finally we landed in safety though very much exhausted and not a little frightened by our terrible adventure    chapter eight  the beauties of the bottom of the sea tempt peterkin to divehow he did itmore difficulties overcomethe water gardencurious creatures of the seathe tankcandles missed very much and the candlenut tree discoveredwonderful account of peterkins first voyagecloth found growing on a treea plan projected and arms prepared for offence and defencea dreadful cry  our encounter with the shark was the first great danger that had befallen us since landing on this island and we felt very seriously affected by it especially when we considered that we had so often unwittingly incurred the same danger before while bathing  we were now forced to take to fishing again in the shallow water until we should succeed in constructing a raft  what troubled us most however was that we were compelled to forego our morning swimmingexcursions  we did indeed continue to enjoy our bathe in the shallow water but jack and i found that one great source of our enjoyment was gone when we could no longer dive down among the beautiful coral groves at the bottom of the lagoon  we had come to be so fond of this exercise and to take such an interest in watching the formations of coral and the gambols of the many beautiful fish amongst the forest of red and green seaweeds that we had become quite familiar with the appearance of the fish and the localities that they chiefly haunted  we had also become expert divers  but we made it a rule never to stay long under water at a time jack told me that to do so often was bad for the lungs and instead of affording us enjoyment would ere long do us a serious injury  so we never stayed at the bottom as long as we might have done but came up frequently to the top for fresh air and dived down again immediately sometimes when jack happened to be in a humorous frame he would seat himself at the bottom of the sea on one of the braincorals as if he were seated on a large paddockstool and then make faces at me in order if possible to make me laugh under water  at first when he took me unawares he nearly succeeded and i had to shoot to the surface in order to laugh but afterwards i became aware of his intentions and being naturally of a grave disposition i had no difficulty in restraining myself  i used often to wonder how poor peterkin would have liked to be with us and he sometimes expressed much regret at being unable to join us  i used to do my best to gratify him poor fellow by relating all the wonders that we saw but this instead of satisfying seemed only to whet his curiosity the more so one day we prevailed on him to try to go down with us  but although a brave boy in every other way peterkin was very nervous in the water and it was with difficulty we got him to consent to be taken down for he could never have managed to push himself down to the bottom without assistance  but no sooner had we pulled him down a yard or so into the deep clear water than he began to struggle and kick violently so we were forced to let him go when he rose out of the water like a cork gave a loud gasp and a frightful roar and struck out for the land with the utmost possible haste  now all this pleasure we were to forego and when we thought thereon jack and i felt very much depressed in our spirits  i could see also that peterkin grieved and sympathised with us for when talking about this matter he refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it  as however a mans difficulties usually set him upon devising methods to overcome them whereby he often discovers better things than those he may have lost so this our difficulty induced us to think of searching for a large pool among the rocks where the water should be deep enough for diving yet so surrounded by rocks as to prevent sharks from getting at us  and such a pool we afterwards found which proved to be very much better than our most sanguine hopes anticipated  it was situated not more than ten minutes walk from our camp and was in the form of a small deep bay or basin the entrance to which besides being narrow was so shallow that no fish so large as a shark could get inat least not unless he should be a remarkably thin one  inside of this basin which we called our water garden the coral formations were much more wonderful and the seaweed plants far more lovely and vividly coloured than in the lagoon itself  and the water was so clear and still that although very deep you could see the minutest object at the bottom  besides this there was a ledge of rock which overhung the basin at its deepest part from which we could dive pleasantly and whereon peterkin could sit and see not only all the wonders i had described to him but also see jack and me creeping amongst the marine shrubbery at the bottom likeas he expressed ittwo great white seamonsters  during these excursions of ours to the bottom of the sea we began to get an insight into the manners and customs of its inhabitants and to make discoveries of wonderful things the like of which we never before conceived  among other things we were deeply interested with the operations of the little coral insect which i was informed by jack is supposed to have entirely constructed many of the numerous islands in the pacific ocean  and certainly when we considered the great reef which these insects had formed round the island on which we were cast and observed their ceaseless activity in building their myriad cells it did at first seem as if this might be true but then again when i looked at the mountains of the island and reflected that there were thousands of such many of them much higher in the south seas i doubted that there must be some mistake here  but more of this hereafter  i also became much taken up with the manners and appearance of the anemones and starfish and crabs and seaurchins and suchlike creatures and was not content with watching those i saw during my dives in the water garden but i must needs scoop out a hole in the coral rock close to it which i filled with salt water and stocked with sundry specimens of anemones and shellfish in order to watch more closely how they were in the habit of passing their time  our burningglass also now became a great treasure to me as it enabled me to magnify and so to perceive more clearly the forms and actions of these curious creatures of the deep  having now got ourselves into a very comfortable condition we began to talk of a project which we had long had in contemplationnamely to travel entirely round the island in order first to ascertain whether it contained any other productions which might be useful to us and second to see whether there might be any place more convenient and suitable for our permanent residence than that on which we were now encamped  not that we were in any degree dissatisfied with it  on the contrary we entertained quite a homefeeling to our bower and its neighbourhood but if a better place did exist there was no reason why we should not make use of it  at any rate it would be well to know of its existence  we had much earnest talk over this matter  but jack proposed that before undertaking such an excursion we should supply ourselves with good defensive arms for as we intended not only to go round all the shore but to descend most of the valleys before returning home we should be likely to meet in withhe would not say dangersbut at least with everything that existed on the island whatever that might be  besides said jack it wont do for us to live on cocoanuts and oysters always  no doubt they are very excellent in their way but i think a little animal food now and then would be agreeable as well as good for us and as there are many small birds among the trees some of which are probably very good to eat i think it would be a capital plan to make bows and arrows with which we could easily knock them over  firstrate cried peterkin  you will make the bows jack and ill try my hand at the arrows  the fact is im quite tired of throwing stones at the birds  i began the very day we landed i think and have persevered up to the present time but ive never hit anything yet  you forget said i you hit me one day on the shin  ah true replied peterkin and a precious shindy you kicked up in consequence  but you were at least four yards away from the impudent paroquet i aimed at so you see what a horribly bad shot i am  but jack said i you cannot make three bows and arrows before tomorrow and would it not be a pity to waste time now that we have made up our minds to go on this expeditionsuppose that you make one bow and arrow for yourself and we can take our clubs  thats true ralph  the day is pretty far advanced and i doubt if i can make even one bow before dark  to be sure i might work by firelight after the sun goes down  we had up to this time been in the habit of going to bed with the sun as we had no pressing call to work o nights and indeed our work during the day was usually hard enoughwhat between fishing and improving our bower and diving in the water garden and rambling in the woodsso that when night came we were usually very glad to retire to our beds  but now that we had a desire to work at night we felt a wish for candles  wont a good blazing fire give you light enough inquired peterkin  yes replied jack quite enough but then it will give us a great deal more than enough of heat in this warm climate of ours  true said peterkin i forgot that  it would roast us  well as youre always doing that at any rate remarked jack we could scarcely call it a change  but the fact is ive been thinking over this subject before  there is a certain nut growing in these islands which is called the candlenut because the natives use it instead of candles and i know all about it and how to prepare it for burning  then why dont you do it interrupted peterkin  why have you kept us in the dark so long you vile philosopher  because said jack i have not seen the tree yet and im not sure that i should know either the tree or the nuts if i did see them  you see i forget the description  ah thats just the way with me said peterkin with a deep sigh  i never could keep in my mind for halfanhour the few descriptions i ever attempted to remember  the very first voyage i ever made was caused by my mistaking a descriptionor forgetting it which is the same thing and a horrible voyage it was  i had to fight with the captain the whole way out and made the homeward voyage by swimming  come peterkin said i you cant get even me to believe that  perhaps not but its true notwithstanding returned peterkin pretending to be hurt at my doubting his word  let us hear how it happened said jack while a goodnatured smile overspread his face  well you must know began peterkin that the very day before i went to sea i was greatly taken up with a game at hockey which i was playing with my old schoolfellows for the last time before leaving themyou see i was young then ralph  peterkin gazed in an abstracted and melancholy manner out to seawell in the midst of the game my uncle who had taken all the bother and trouble of getting me bound prentice and rigged out came and took me aside and told me that he was called suddenly away from home and would not be able to see me aboard as he had intended  however said he the captain knows you are coming so thats not of much consequence but as youll have to find the ship yourself you must remember her name and description dye hear boy  i certainly did hear but im afraid i did not understand for my mind was so taken up with the game which i saw my side was losing that i began to grow impatient and the moment my uncle finished his description of the ship and bade me goodbye i bolted back to my game with only a confused idea of three masts and a greenpainted taffrail and a gilt figurehead of hercules with his club at the bow  next day i was so much cast down with everybody saying goodbye and a lot o my female friends cryin horribly over me that i did not start for the harbour where the ship was lying among a thousand others till it was almost too late  so i had to run the whole way when i reached the pier there were so many masts and so much confusion that i felt quite humblebumbled in my faculties  now said i to myself peterkin youre in a fix  then i fancied i saw a gilt figurehead and three masts belonging to a ship just about to start so i darted on board but speedily jumped on shore again when i found that two of the masts belonged to another vessel and the figurehead to a third  at last i caught sight of what i made sure was ita fine large vessel just casting off her moorings  the taffrail was green  three mastsyes that must be itand the gilt figurehead of hercules  to be sure it had a threepronged pitchfork in its hand instead of a club but that might be my uncles mistake or perhaps hercules sometimes varied his weapons  cast off roared a voice from the quarterdeck hold on cried i rushing frantically through the crowd  hold on hold on repeated some of the bystanders while the men at the ropes delayed for a minute  this threw the captain into a frightful rage for some of his friends had come down to see him off and having his orders contradicted so flatly was too much for him  however the delay was sufficient  i took a race and a good leap the ropes were cast off the steamtug gave a puff and we started  suddenly the captain walks up to me where did you come from you scamp and what do you want here  please sir said i touching my cap im your new prentice come aboard  new prentice said he stamping ive got no new prentice  my boys are all aboard already  this is a trick you young blackguard youve run away you have  and the captain stamped about the deck and swore dreadfully for you see the thought of having to stop the ship and lower a boat and lose halfanhour all for the sake of sending a small boy ashore seemed to make him very angry  besides it was blowin fresh outside the harbour so that to have let the steamer alongside to put me into it was no easy job  just as we were passing the pierhead where several boats were rowing into the harbour the captain came up to me  youve run away you blackguard he said giving me a box on the ear  no i havent said i angrily for the box was by no means a light one  harkee boy can you swim  yes said i  then do it and seizing me by my trousers and the nape of my neck he tossed me over the side into the sea  the fellows in the boats at the end of the pier backed their oars on seeing this but observing that i could swim they allowed me to make the best of my way to the pierheadso you see ralph that i really did swim my first homeward voyage  jack laughed and patted peterkin on the shoulder  but tell us about the candlenut tree said i  you were talking about it  very true said jack but i fear i can remember little about it  i believe the nut is about the size of a walnut and i think that the leaves are white but i am not sure  eh ha hum exclaimed peterkin i saw a tree answering to that description this very day  did you cried jack  is it far from this  no not halfamile  then lead me to it said jack seizing his axe  in a few minutes we were all three pushing through the underwood of the forest headed by peterkin  we soon came to the tree in question which after jack had closely examined it we concluded must be the candlenut tree  its leaves were of a beautiful silvery white and formed a fine contrast to the darkgreen foliage of the surrounding trees  we immediately filled our pockets with the nuts after which jack said  now peterkin climb that cocoanut tree and cut me one of the long branches  this was soon done but it cost some trouble for the stem was very high and as peterkin usually pulled nuts from the younger trees he was not much accustomed to climbing the high ones  the leaf or branch was a very large one and we were surprised at its size and strength  viewed from a little distance the cocoanut tree seems to be a tall straight stem without a single branch except at the top where there is a tuft of featherylooking leaves that seem to wave like soft plumes in the wind  but when we saw one of these leaves or branches at our feet we found it to be a strong stalk about fifteen feet long with a number of narrow pointed leaflets ranged alternately on each side  but what seemed to us the most wonderful thing about it was a curious substance resembling cloth which was wrapped round the thick end of the stalk where it had been cut from the tree  peterkin told us that he had the greatest difficulty in separating the branch from the stem on account of this substance as it was wrapped quite round the tree and he observed round all the other branches thus forming a strong support to the large leaves while exposed to high winds  when i call this substance cloth i do not exaggerate  indeed with regard to all the things i saw during my eventful career in the south seas i have been exceedingly careful not to exaggerate or in any way to mislead or deceive my readers  this cloth i say was remarkably like to coarse brown cotton cloth  it had a seam or fibre down the centre of it from which diverged other fibres about the size of a bristle  there were two layers of these fibres very long and tough the one layer crossing the other obliquely and the whole was cemented together with a still finer fibrous and adhesive substance  when we regarded it attentively we could with difficulty believe that it had not been woven by human hands  this remarkable piece of cloth we stripped carefully off and found it to be above two feet long by a foot broad and we carried it home with us as a great prize  jack now took one of the leaflets and cutting out the central spine or stalk hurried back with it to our camp  having made a small fire he baked the nuts slightly and then peeled off the husks  after this he wished to bore a hole in them which not having anything better at hand at the time he did with the point of our useless pencilcase  then he strung them on the cocoanut spine and on putting a light to the topmost nut we found to our joy that it burned with a clear beautiful flame upon seeing which peterkin sprang up and danced round the fire for at least five minutes in the excess of his satisfaction  now lads said jack extinguishing our candle the sun will set in an hour so we have no time to lose  i shall go and cut a young tree to make my bow out of and you had better each of you go and select good strong sticks for clubs and well set to work at them after dark  so saying he shouldered his axe and went off followed by peterkin while i took up the piece of newly discovered cloth and fell to examining its structure  so engrossed was i in this that i was still sitting in the same attitude and occupation when my companions returned  i told you so cried peterkin with a loud laughoh ralph youre incorrigible  see theres a club for you  i was sure when we left you looking at that bit of stuff that we would find you poring over it when we came back so i just cut a club for you as well as for myself  thank you peterkin said i  it was kind of you to do that instead of scolding me for a lazy fellow as i confess i deserve  oh as to that returned peterkin ill blow you up yet if you wish it only it would be of no use if i did for youre a perfect mule  as it was now getting dark we lighted our candle and placing it in a holder made of two crossing branches inside of our bower we seated ourselves on our leafy beds and began to work  i intend to appropriate the bow for my own use said jack chipping the piece of wood he had brought with his axe  i used to be a pretty fair shot oncebut whats that youre doing he added looking at peterkin who had drawn the end of a long pole into the tent and was endeavouring to fit a small piece of the hoopiron to the end of it  im going to enlist into the lancers answered peterkin  you see jack i find the club rather an unwieldy instrument for my delicately formed muscles and i flatter myself i shall do more execution with a spear  well if length constitutes power said jack youll certainly be invincible  the pole which peterkin had cut was full twelve feet long being a very strong but light and tough young tree which merely required thinning at the butt to be a serviceable weapon  thats a very good idea said i  whichthis inquired peterkin pointing to the spear  yes i replied  humph said he youd find it a pretty tough and matteroffact idea if you had it stuck through your gizzard old boy  i mean the idea of making it is a good one said i laughing  and now i think of it ill change my plan too  i dont think much of a club so ill make me a sling out of this piece of cloth  i used to be very fond of slinging ever since i read of david slaying goliath the philistine and i was once thought to be expert at it  so i set to work to manufacture a sling  for a long time we all worked very busily without speaking  at length peterkin looked up  i say jack im sorry to say i must apply to you for another strip of your handkerchief to tie on this rascally head with  its pretty well torn at any rate so you wont miss it  jack proceeded to comply with this request when peterkin suddenly laid his hand on his arm and arrested him  hist man said he be tender  you should never be needlessly cruel if you can help it  do try to shave past lord nelsons mouth without tearing it if possible  thanks  there are plenty more handkerchiefs on the cocoanut trees  poor peterkin with what pleasant feelings i recall and record his jests and humorous sayings now  while we were thus engaged we were startled by a distant but most strange and horrible cry  it seemed to come from the sea but was so far away that we could not clearly distinguish its precise direction rushing out of our bower we hastened down to the beach and stayed to listen  again it came quite loud and distinct on the night aira prolonged hideous cry something like the braying of an ass  the moon had risen and we could see the islands in and beyond the lagoon quite plainly but there was no object visible to account for such a cry  a strong gust of wind was blowing from the point whence the sound came but this died away while we were gazing out to sea  what can it be said peterkin in a low whisper while we all involuntarily crept closer to each other  do you know said jack i have heard that mysterious sound twice before but never so loud as tonight  indeed it was so faint that i thought i must have merely fancied it so as i did not wish to alarm you i said nothing about it  we listened for a long time for the sound again but as it did not come we returned to the bower and resumed our work  very strange said peterkin quite gravelydo you believe in ghosts ralph  no i answered i do not  nevertheless i must confess that strange unaccountable sounds such as we have just heard make me feel a little uneasy  what say you to it jack  i neither believe in ghosts nor feel uneasy he replied  i never saw a ghost myself and i never met with any one who had and i have generally found that strange and unaccountable things have almost always been accounted for and found to be quite simple on close examination i certainly cant imagine what that sound is but im quite sure i shall find out before long and if its a ghost illill  eat it cried peterkin  yes ill eat itnow then my bow and two arrows are finished so if youre ready we had better turn in  by this time peterkin had thinned down his spear and tied an iron point very cleverly to the end of it i had formed a sling the lines of which were composed of thin strips of the cocoanut cloth plaited and jack had made a stout bow nearly five feet long with two arrows feathered with two or three large plumes which some bird had dropped  they had no barbs but jack said that if arrows were well feathered they did not require iron points but would fly quite well if merely sharpened at the point which i did not know before  a feathered arrow without a barb said he is a good weapon but a barbed arrow without feathers is utterly useless  the string of the bow was formed of our piece of whipcord part of which as he did not like to cut it was rolled round the bow  although thus prepared for a start on the morrow we thought it wise to exercise ourselves a little in the use of our weapons before starting so we spent the whole of the next day in practising  and it was well we did so for we found that our arms were very imperfect and that we were far from perfect in the use of them  first jack found that the bow was much too strong and he had to thin it  also the spear was much too heavy and so had to be reduced in thickness although nothing would induce peterkin to have it shortened  my sling answered very well but i had fallen so much out of practice that my first stone knocked off peterkins hat and narrowly missed making a second goliath of him however after having spent the whole day in diligent practice we began to find some of our former expertness returning at least jack and i did  as for peterkin being naturally a neathanded boy he soon handled his spear well and could run full tilt at a cocoanut and hit it with great precision once out of every five times  but i feel satisfied that we owed much of our rapid success to the unflagging energy of jack who insisted that since we had made him captain we should obey him and he kept us at work from morning till night perseveringly at the same thing  peterkin wished very much to run about and stick his spear into everything he passed but jack put up a cocoanut and would not let him leave off running at that for a moment except when he wanted to rest  we laughed at jack for this but we were both convinced that it did us much good  that night we examined and repaired our arms ere we lay down to rest although we were much fatigued in order that we might be in readiness to set out on our expedition at daylight on the following morning    chapter nine  prepare for a journey round the islandsagacious reflections mysterious appearances and startling occurrences  scarcely had the sun shot its first ray across the bosom of the broad pacific when jack sprang to his feet and hallooing in peterkins ear to awaken him ran down the beach to take his customary dip in the sea  we did not as was our wont bathe that morning in our water garden but in order to save time refreshed ourselves in the shallow water just opposite the bower  our breakfast was also despatched without loss of time and in less than an hour afterwards all our preparations for the journey were completed  in addition to his ordinary dress jack tied a belt of cocoanut cloth round his waist into which he thrust the axe  i was also advised to put on a belt and carry a short cudgel or bludgeon in it for as jack truly remarked the sling would be of little use if we should chance to come to close quarters with any wild animal  as for peterkin notwithstanding that he carried such a long and i must add frightfullooking spear over his shoulder we could not prevail on him to leave his club behind for said he a spear at close quarters is not worth a button  i must say that it seemed to me that the club was to use his own style of language not worth a buttonhole for it was all knotted over at the head something like the club which i remember to have observed in picturebooks of jack the giantkiller besides being so heavy that he required to grasp it with both hands in order to wield it at all  however he took it with him and in this manner we set out upon our travels  we did not consider it necessary to carry any food with us as we knew that wherever we went we should be certain to fall in with cocoanut treeshaving which we were amply supplied as peterkin said with meat and drink and pockethandkerchiefs  i took the precaution however to put the burningglass into my pocket lest we should want fire  the morning was exceedingly lovely  it was one of that very still and peaceful sort which made the few noises that we heard seem to be quiet noises i know no other way of expressing this ideanoises which so far from interrupting the universal tranquillity of earth sea and sky rather tended to reveal to us how quiet the world round us really was such sounds as i refer to were the peculiar melancholyyet it seemed to me cheerfulplaint of seabirds floating on the glassy waters or sailing in the sky also the subdued twittering of little birds among the bushes the faint ripples on the beach and the solemn boom of the surf upon the distant coral reef  we felt very glad in our hearts as we walked along the sands side by side  for my part i felt so deeply overjoyed that i was surprised at my own sensations and fell into a reverie upon the causes of happiness  i came to the conclusion that a state of profound peace and repose both in regard to outward objects and within the soul is the happiest condition in which man can be placed for although i had many a time been most joyful and happy when engaged in bustling energetic active pursuits or amusements i never found that such joy or satisfaction was so deep or so pleasant to reflect upon as that which i now experienced  and i was the more confirmed in this opinion when i observedand indeed as told by himselfthat peterkins happiness was also very great yet he did not express this by dancing as was his wont nor did he give so much as a single shout but walked quietly between us with his eye sparkling and a joyful smile upon his countenance  my reader must not suppose that i thought all this in the clear and methodical manner in which i have set it down here  these thoughts did indeed pass through my mind but they did so in a very confused and indefinite manner for i was young at that time and not much given to deep reflections  neither did i consider that the peace whereof i write is not to be found in this worldat least in its perfectionalthough i have since learned that by religion a man may attain to a very great degree of it  i have said that peterkin walked along the sands between us  we had two ways of walking together about our island  when we travelled through the woods we always did so in single file as by this method we advanced with greater facility the one treading in the others footsteps  in such cases jack always took the lead peterkin followed and i brought up the rear  but when we travelled along the sands which extended almost in an unbroken line of glistening white round the island we marched abreast as we found this method more sociable and every way more pleasant  jack being the tallest walked next the sea and peterkin marched between us as by this arrangement either of us could talk to him or he to us while if jack and i happened to wish to converse together we could conveniently do so over peterkins head peterkin used to say in reference to this arrangement that had he been as tall as either of us our order of march might have been the same for as jack often used to scold him for letting everything we said to him pass in at one ear and out at the other his head could of course form no interruption to our discourse  we were now fairly started  halfamiles walk conveyed us round a bend in the land which shut out our bower from view and for some time we advanced at a brisk pace without speaking though our eyes were not idle but noted everythingin the woods on the shore or in the sea that was interesting  after passing the ridge of land that formed one side of our valleythe valley of the wreckwe beheld another small vale lying before us in all the luxuriant loveliness of tropical vegetation  we had indeed seen it before from the mountaintop but we had no idea that it would turn out to be so much more lovely when we were close to it  we were about to commence the exploration of this valley when peterkin stopped us and directed our attention to a very remarkable appearance in advance along the shore  whats yon think you said he levelling his spear as if he expected an immediate attack from the object in question though it was full halfamile distant  as he spoke there appeared a white column above the rocks as if of steam or spray  it rose upwards to a height of several feet and then disappeared  had this been near the sea we would not have been so greatly surprised as it might in that case have been the surf for at this part of the coast the coral reef approached so near to the island that in some parts it almost joined it  there was therefore no lagoon between and the heavy surf of the ocean beat almost up to the rocks but this white column appeared about fifty yards inland  the rocks at the place were rugged and they stretched across the sandy beach into the sea  scarce had we ceased expressing our surprise at this sight when another column flew upwards for a few seconds not far from the spot where the first had been seen and disappeared and so at long irregular intervals these strange sights recurred  we were now quite sure that the columns were watery or composed of spray but what caused them we could not guess so we determined to go and see  in a few minutes we gained the spot which was very rugged and precipitous and moreover quite damp with the falling of the spray we had much ado to pass over dryshod  the ground also was full of holes here and there  now while we stood anxiously waiting for the reappearance of these waterspouts we heard a low rumbling sound near us which quickly increased to a gurgling and hissing noise and a moment afterwards a thick spout of water burst upwards from a hole in the rock and spouted into the air with much violence and so close to where jack and i were standing that it nearly touched us  we sprang aside but not before a cloud of spray descended and drenched us both to the skin  peterkin who was standing farther off escaped with a few drops and burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter on beholding our miserable plight  mind your eye he shouted eagerly there goes another  the words were scarcely out of his mouth when there came up a spout from another hole which served us exactly in the same manner as before  peterkin now shrieked with laughter but his merriment was abruptly put a stop to by the gurgling noise occurring close to where he stood  wherell it spout this time i wonder he said looking about with some anxiety and preparing to run  suddenly there came a loud hiss or snort a fierce spout of water burst up between peterkins legs blew him off his feet enveloped him in its spray and hurled him to the ground  he fell with so much violence that we feared he must have broken some of his bones and ran anxiously to his assistance but fortunately he had fallen on a clump of tangled herbage in which he lay sprawling in a most deplorable condition  it was now our turn to laugh but as we were not yet quite sure that he was unhurt and as we knew not when or where the next spout might arise we assisted him hastily to jump up and hurry from the spot  i may here add that although i am quite certain that the spout of water was very strong and that it blew peterkin completely off his legs i am not quite certain of the exact height to which it lifted him being somewhat startled by the event and blinded partially by the spray so that my power of observation was somewhat impaired for the moment  whats to be done now asked peterkin ruefully  make a fire lad and dry ourselves replied jack  and here is material ready to our hand said i picking up a dried branch of a tree as we hurried up to the woods  in about an hour after this mishap our clothes were again dried  while they were hanging up before the fire we walked down to the beach and soon observed that these curious spouts took place immediately after the fall of a huge wave never before it and moreover that the spouts did not take place excepting when the billow was an extremely large one from this we concluded that there must be a subterraneous channel in the rock into which the water was driven by the larger waves and finding no way of escape except through these small holes was thus forced up violently through them  at any rate we could not conceive any other reason for these strange waterspouts and as this seemed a very simple and probable one we forthwith adopted it  i say ralph whats that in the water  is it a shark said jack just as we were about to quit the place  i immediately ran to the overhanging ledge of rock from which he was looking down into the sea and bent over it  there i saw a very faint pale object of a greenish colour which seemed to move slightly while i looked at it  its like a fish of some sort said i  hallo peterkin cried jack  fetch your spear heres work for it  but when we tried to reach the object the spear proved to be too short  there now said peterkin with a sneer you were always telling me it was too long  jack now drove the spear forcibly towards the object and let go his hold  but although it seemed to be well aimed he must have missed for the handle soon rose again and when the spear was drawn up there was the palegreen object in exactly the same spot slowly moving its tail  very odd said jack  but although it was undoubtedly very odd and although jack and all of us plunged the spear at it repeatedly we could neither hit it nor drive it away so we were compelled to continue our journey without discovering what it was  i was very much perplexed at this strange appearance in the water and could not get it out of my mind for a long time afterwards  however i quieted myself by resolving that i would pay a visit to it again at some more convenient season    chapter ten  make discovery of many excellent roots and fruitsthe resources of the coral island gradually unfoldedthe banyan treeanother tree which is supported by natural plankswaterfowl founda very remarkable discovery and a very peculiar murderwe luxuriate on the fat of the land  our examination of the little valley proved to be altogether most satisfactory  we found in it not only similar trees to those we had already seen in our own valley but also one or two others of a different species  we had also the satisfaction of discovering a peculiar vegetable which jack concluded must certainly be that of which he had read as being very common among the south sea islanders and which was named taro  also we found a large supply of yams and another root like a potato in appearance  as these were all quite new to us we regarded our lot as a most fortunate one in being thus cast on an island which was so prolific and so well stored with all the necessaries of life  long afterwards we found out that this island of ours was no better in these respects than thousands of other islands in those seas  indeed many of them were much richer and more productive but that did not render us the less grateful for our present good fortune  we each put one of these roots in our pocket intending to use them for our supperof which more hereafter  we also saw many beautiful birds here and traces of some fourfooted animal again meanwhile the sun began to descend so we returned to the shore and pushed on round the spouting rocks into the next valley  this was that valley of which i have spoken as running across the entire island it was by far the largest and most beautiful that we had yet looked upon  here were trees of every shape and size and hue which it is possible to conceive of many of which we had not seen in the other valleys for the stream in this valley being larger and the mould much richer than in the valley of the wreck it was clothed with a more luxuriant growth of trees and plants  some trees were dark glossy green others of a rich and warm hue contrasting well with those of a pale light green which were everywhere abundant  among these we recognised the broad dark heads of the breadfruit with its golden fruit the pure silvery foliage of the candlenut and several species which bore a strong resemblance to the pine while here and there in groups and in single trees rose the tall forms of the cocoanut palms spreading abroad and waving their graceful plumes high above all the rest as if they were a superior race of stately giants keeping guard over these luxuriant forests  oh it was a most enchanting scene and i thanked god for having created such delightful spots for the use of man  now while we were gazing around us in silent admiration jack uttered an exclamation of surprise and pointing to an object a little to one side of us said  thats a banyan tree  and whats a banyan tree inquired peterkin as we walked towards it  a very curious one as you shall see presently replied jack  it is called the aoa here if i recollect rightly and has a wonderful peculiarity about it  what an enormous one it is to be sure  it repeated peterkin  why there are dozens of banyans here what do you mean by talking bad grammar  is your philosophy deserting you jack  there is but one tree here of this kind returned jack as you will perceive if you will examine it  and sure enough we did find that what we had supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one  its bark was of a light colour and had a shining appearance the leaves being lanceshaped small and of a beautiful peagreen  but the wonderful thing about it was that the branches which grew out from the stem horizontally sent down long shoots or fibres to the ground which taking root had themselves become trees and were covered with bark like the tree itself  many of these fibres had descended from the branches at various distances and thus supported them on natural pillars some of which were so large and strong that it was not easy at first to distinguish the offspring from the parent stem  the fibres were of all sizes and in all states of advancement from the pillars we have just mentioned to small cords which hung down and were about to take root and thin brown threads still far from the ground which swayed about with every motion of wind  in short it seemed to us that if there were only space afforded to it this single tree would at length cover the whole island  shortly after this we came upon another remarkable tree which as its peculiar formation afterwards proved extremely useful to us merits description  it was a splendid chestnut but its proper name jack did not know  however there were quantities of fine nuts upon it some of which we put in our pockets  but its stem was the most wonderful part of it  it rose to about twelve feet without a branch and was not of great thickness on the contrary it was remarkably slender for the size of the tree  but to make up for this there were four or five wonderful projections in this stem which i cannot better describe than by asking the reader to suppose that five planks of two inches thick and three feet broad had been placed round the trunk of the tree with their edges closely fixed to it from the ground up to the branches and that these planks had been covered over with the bark of the tree and incorporated with it  in short they were just natural buttresses without which the stem could not have supported its heavy and umbrageous top  we found these chestnuts to be very numerous  they grew chiefly on the banks of the stream and were of all sizes  while we were examining a small tree of this kind jack chipped a piece off a buttress with his axe and found the wood to be firm and easily cut  he then struck the axe into it with all his force and very soon split it off close to the treefirst however having cut it across transversely above and below  by this means he satisfied himself that we could now obtain short planks as it were all ready sawn of any size and thickness that we desired which was a very great discovery indeed perhaps the most important we had yet made  we now wended our way back to the coast intending to encamp near the beach as we found that the mosquitoes were troublesome in the forest on our way we could not help admiring the birds which flew and chirped around us  among them we observed a pretty kind of paroquet with a green body a blue head and a red breast also a few beautiful turtledoves and several flocks of woodpigeons  the hues of many of these birds were extremely vividbright green blue and scarlet being the prevailing tints  we made several attempts throughout the day to bring down one of these both with the bow and the slingnot for mere sport but to ascertain whether they were good for food  but we invariably missed although once or twice we were very near hitting  as evening drew on however a flock of pigeons flew past  i slung a stone into the midst of them at a venture and had the good fortune to kill one  we were startled soon after by a loud whistling noise above our heads and on looking up saw a flock of wild ducks making for the coast  we watched these and observing where they alighted followed them up until we came upon a most lovely blue lake not more than two hundred yards long embosomed in verdant trees  its placid surface which reflected every leaf and stem as if in a mirror was covered with various species of wild ducks feeding among the sedges and broadleaved waterplants which floated on it while numerous birds like waterhens ran to and fro most busily on its margin  these all with one accord flew tumultuously away the instant we made our appearance  while walking along the margin we observed fish in the water but of what sort we could not tell  now as we neared the shore jack and i said we would go a little out of our way to see if we could procure one of those ducks so directing peterkin to go straight to the shore and kindle a fire we separated promising to rejoin him speedily  but we did not find the ducks although we made a diligent search for halfanhour  we were about to retrace our steps when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights that we had yet beheld  just in front of us at the distance of about ten yards grew a superb tree which certainly was the largest we had yet seen on the island its trunk was at least five feet in diameter with a smooth grey bark above this the spreading branches were clothed with lightgreen leaves amid which were clusters of brightyellow fruit so numerous as to weigh down the boughs with their great weight  this fruit seemed to be of the plum species of an oblong form and a good deal larger than the magnum bonum plum  the ground at the foot of this tree was thickly strewn with the fallen fruit in the midst of which lay sleeping in every possible attitude at least twenty hogs of all ages and sizes apparently quite surfeited with a recent banquet  jack and i could scarce restrain our laughter as we gazed at these coarse fat illlooking animals while they lay groaning and snoring heavily amid the remains of their supper  now ralph said jack in a low whisper put a stone in your slinga good big oneand let fly at that fat fellow with his back toward you ill try to put an arrow into yon little pig  dont you think we had better put them up first  i whispered  it seems cruel to kill them while asleep  if i wanted sport ralph i would certainly set them up but as we only want pork well let them lie  besides were not sure of killing them so fire away  thus admonished i slung my stone with so good aim that it went bang against the hogs flank as if against the head of a drum but it had no other effect than that of causing the animal to start to its feet with a frightful yell of surprise and scamper away  at the same instant jacks bow twanged and the arrow pinned the little pig to the ground by the ear  ive missed after all cried jack darting forward with uplifted axe while the little pig uttered a loud squeal tore the arrow from the ground and ran away with it along with the whole drove into the bushes and disappeared though we heard them screaming long afterwards in the distance  thats very provoking now said jack rubbing the point of his nose  very i replied stroking my chin  well we must make haste and rejoin peterkin said jack its getting late  and without further remark we threaded our way quickly through the woods towards the shore  when we reached it we found wood laid out the fire lighted and beginning to kindle up with other signs of preparation for our encampment but peterkin was nowhere to be found  we wondered very much at this but jack suggested that he might have gone to fetch water so he gave a shout to let him know that we had arrived and sat down upon a rock while i threw off my jacket and seized the axe intending to split up one or two billets of wood  but i had scarce moved from the spot when in the distance we heard a most appalling shriek which was followed up by a chorus of yells from the hogs and a loud hurrah  i do believe said i that peterkin has met with the hogs  when greek meets greek said jack soliloquising then comes the tug of  hurrah shouted peterkin in the distance  we turned hastily towards the direction whence the sound came and soon descried peterkin walking along the beach towards us with a little pig transfixed on the end of his long spear  well done my boy exclaimed jack slapping him on the shoulder when he came up  youre the best shot amongst us  look here jack cried peterkin as he disengaged the animal from his spear  do you recognise that hole said he pointing to the pigs ear and are you familiar with this arrow eh  well i declare said jack  of course you do interrupted peterkin but pray restrain your declarations at this time and lets have supperfor im uncommonly hungry i can tell you  and its no joke to charge a whole herd of swine with their greatgrandmother bristling like a giant porcupine at the head of them  we now set about preparing supper and truly a good display of viands we made when all was laid out on a flat rock in the light of the blazing fire  there was first of all the little pig then there were the taroroot and the yam and the potato and six plums and lastly the woodpigeon  to these peterkin added a bit of sugarcane which he had cut from a little patch of that plant which he had found not long after separating from us and said he the patch was somewhat in a square form which convinces me it must have been planted by man  very likely replied jack  from all we have seen im inclined to think that some of the savages must have dwelt here long ago  we found no small difficulty in making up our minds how we were to cook the pig  none of us had ever cut up one before and we did not know exactly how to begin besides we had nothing but the axe to do it with our knife having been forgotten  at last jack started up and said  dont let us waste more time talking about it boyshold it up peterkin  there lay the hind leg on this block of woodso and he cut it off with a large portion of the haunch at a single blow of the axe  now the otherthats it  and having thus cut off the two hind legs he made several deep gashes in them thrust a sharppointed stick through each and stuck them up before the blaze to roast  the woodpigeon was then split open quite flat washed clean in salt water and treated in a similar manner  while these were cooking we scraped a hole in the sand and ashes under the fire into which we put our vegetables and covered them up  the taroroot was of an oval shape about ten inches long and four or five thick  it was of a mottledgrey colour and had a thick rind  we found it somewhat like an irish potato and exceedingly good  the yam was roundish and had a rough brown skin  it was very sweet and well flavoured  the potato we were surprised to find was quite sweet and exceedingly palatable as also were the plumsand indeed the pork and pigeon toowhen we came to taste them  altogether this was decidedly the most luxurious supper we had enjoyed for many a day  jack said it was outofsight better than we ever got on board ship and peterkin said he feared that if we should remain long on the island he would infallibly become a glutton or an epicure whereat jack remarked that he need not fear that for he was both already  and so having eaten our fill not forgetting to finish off with a plum we laid ourselves comfortably down to sleep upon a couch of branches under the overhanging ledge of a coral rock    chapter eleven  effects of overeating and reflections thereonhumble advice regarding cold waterthe horrible cry accounted forthe curious birds called penguinspeculiarity of the cocoanut palmquestions on the formation of coral islandsmysterious footstepsstrange discoveries and sad sights  when we awoke on the following morning we found that the sun was already a good way above the horizon so i came to the conclusion that a heavy supper is not conducive to early rising  nevertheless we felt remarkably strong and well and much disposed to have our breakfast first however we had our customary morning bathe which refreshed us greatly  i have often wondered very much in after years that the inhabitants of my own dear land did not make more frequent use of this most charming element wateri mean in the way of cold bathing  of course i have perceived that it is not convenient for them to go into the sea or the rivers in winter as we used to do on the coral island but then i knew from experience that a large washingtub and a sponge do form a most pleasant substitute  the feelings of freshness of cleanliness of vigour and extreme hilarity that always followed my bathes in the sea and even when in england my ablutions in the washtubwere so delightful that i would sooner have gone without my breakfast than without my bathe in cold water  my readers will forgive me for asking whether they are in the habit of bathing thus every morning and if they answer no they will pardon me for recommending them to begin at once of late years since retiring from the stirring life of adventure which i have led so long in foreign climes i have heard of a system called the coldwater cure  now i do not know much about that system so i do not mean to uphold it neither do i intend to run it down  perhaps in reference to it i may just hint that there may be too much of a good thingi know not  but of this i am quite certain that there may also be too little of a good thing and the great delight i have had in cold bathing during the course of my adventurous career inclines me to think that it is better to risk taking too much than to content ones self with too little  such is my opinion derived from much experience but i put it before my readers with the utmost diffidence and with profound modesty knowing that it may possibly jar with their feelings of confidence in their own ability to know and judge as to what is best and fittest in reference to their own affairs  but to return from this digression for which i humbly crave forgiveness  we had not advanced on our journey much above a mile or so and were just beginning to feel the pleasant glow that usually accompanies vigorous exercise when on turning a point that revealed to us a new and beautiful cluster of islands we were suddenly arrested by the appalling cry which had so alarmed us a few nights before  but this time we were by no means so much alarmed as on the previous occasion because whereas at that time it was night now it was day and i have always found though i am unable to account for it that daylight banishes many of the fears that are apt to assail us in the dark  on hearing the sound peterkin instantly threw forward his spear  now what can it be said he looking round at jack  i tell you what it is if we are to go on being pulled up in a constant state of horror and astonishment as we have been for the last week the sooner were out o this island the better notwithstanding the yams and lemonade and pork and plums  peterkins remark was followed by a repetition of the cry louder than before  it comes from one of these islands said jack  it must be the ghost of a jackass then said peterkin for i never heard anything so like  we all turned our eyes towards the cluster of islands where on the largest we observed curious objects moving on the shore  soldiers they arethats flat cried peterkin gazing at them in the utmost amazement  and in truth peterkins remark seemed to me to be correct for at the distance from which we saw them they appeared to be an army of soldiers  there they stood rank and file in lines and in squares marching and countermarching with blue coats and white trousers while we were looking at them the dreadful cry came again over the water and peterkin suggested that it must be a regiment sent out to massacre the natives in cold blood  at this remark jack laughed and said  why peterkin they are penguins  penguins repeated peterkin  ay penguins peterkin penguinsnothing more or less than big seabirds as you shall see one of these days when we pay them a visit in our boat which i mean to set about building the moment we return to our bower  so then our dreadful yelling ghosts and our murdering army of soldiers remarked peterkin have dwindled down to penguinsbig seabirds  very good  then i propose that we continue our journey as fast as possible lest our island should be converted into a dream before we get completely round it  now as we continued on our way i pondered much over this new discovery and the singular appearance of these birds of which jack could only give us a very slight and vague account and i began to long to commence our boat in order that we might go and inspect them more narrowly  but by degrees these thoughts left me and i began to be much taken up again with the interesting peculiarities of the country which we were passing through  the second night we passed in a manner somewhat similar to the firstat about twothirds of the way round the island as we calculatedand we hoped to sleep on the night following at our bower  i will not here note so particularly all that we said and saw during the course of this second day as we did not make any further discoveries of great importance  the shore along which we travelled and the various parts of the woods through which we passed were similar to those which have been already treated of  there were one or two observations that we made however and these were as follows  we saw that while many of the large fruitbearing trees grew only in the valleys and some of them only near the banks of the streams where the soil was peculiarly rich the cocoanut palm grew in every place whatsoevernot only on the hillsides but also on the seashore and even as has been already stated on the coral reef itself where the soil if we may use the name was nothing better than loose sand mingled with broken shells and coral rock  so near to the sea too did this useful tree grow that in many places its roots were washed by the spray from the breakers  yet we found the trees growing thus on the sands to be quite as luxuriant as those growing in the valleys and the fruit as good and refreshing also  besides this i noticed that on the summit of the high mountain which we once more ascended at a different point from our first ascent were found abundance of shells and broken coral formations which jack and i agreed proved either that this island must have once been under the sea or that the sea must once have been above the island in other words that as shells and coral could not possibly climb to the mountaintop they must have been washed upon it while the mountaintop was on a level with the sea  we pondered this very much and we put to ourselves the question what raised the island to its present height above the sea  but to this we could by no means give to ourselves a satisfactory reply  jack thought it might have been blown up by a volcano and peterkin said he thought it must have jumped up of its own accord  we also noticed what had escaped us before that the solid rocks of which the island was formed were quite different from the live coral rocks on the shore where the wonderful little insects were continually working  they seemed indeed to be of the same materiala substance like limestone but while the coral rocks were quite full of minute cells in which the insects lived the other rocks inland were hard and solid without the appearance of cells at all  our thoughts and conversations on this subject were sometimes so profound that peterkin said we should certainly get drowned in them at last even although we were such good divers  nevertheless we did not allow his pleasantry on this and similar points to deter us from making our notes and observations as we went along  we found several more droves of hogs in the woods but abstained from killing any of them having more than sufficient for our present necessities  we saw also many of their footprints in this neighbourhood  among these we also observed the footprints of a smaller animal which we examined with much care but could form no certain opinion as to them  peterkin thought they were those of a little dog but jack and i thought differently  we became very curious on this matter the more so that we observed these footprints to lie scattered about in one locality as if the animal which had made them was wandering round about in a very irregular manner and without any object in view  early in the forenoon of our third day we observed these footprints to be much more numerous than ever and in one particular spot they diverged off into the woods in a regular beaten track which was however so closely beset with bushes that we pushed through it with difficulty  we had now become so anxious to find out what animal this was and where it went to that we determined to follow the track and if possible clear up the mystery  peterkin said in a bantering tone that he was sure it would be cleared up as usual in some frightfully simple way and prove to be no mystery at all  the beaten track seemed much too large to have been formed by the animal itself and we concluded that some larger animal had made it and that the smaller one made use of it  but everywhere the creeping plants and tangled bushes crossed our path so that we forced our way along with some difficulty  suddenly as we came upon an open space we heard a faint cry and observed a black animal standing in the track before us  a wild cat cried jack fitting an arrow to his bow and discharging it so hastily that he missed the animal and hit the earth about halfafoot to one side of it  to our surprise the wild cat did not fly but walked slowly towards the arrow and snuffed at it  thats the most comical wild cat i ever saw cried jack  its a tame wild cat i think said peterkin levelling his spear to make a charge  stop cried i laying my hand on his shoulder  i do believe the poor beast is blind  see it strikes against the branches as it walks along it must be a very old one and i hastened towards it  only think said peterkin with a suppressed laugh of a superannuated wild cat  we now found that the poor cat was not only blind or nearly so but extremely deaf as it did not hear our footsteps until we were quite close behind it  then it sprang round and putting up its back and tail while the black hair stood all on end uttered a hoarse mew and a fuff  poor thing said peterkin gently extending his hand and endeavouring to pat the cats head  poor pussy chee chee chee puss puss puss cheetie pussy  no sooner did the cat hear these sounds than all signs of anger fled and advancing eagerly to peterkin it allowed itself to be stroked and rubbed itself against his legs purring loudly all the time and showing every symptom of the most extreme delight  its no more a wild cat than i am cried peterkin taking it in his arms its quite tamepoor pussy cheetie pussy  we now crowded around peterkin and were not a little surprisedand to say truth a good deal affectedby the sight of the poor animals excessive joy  it rubbed its head against peterkins cheek licked his chin and thrust its head almost violently into his neck while it purred more loudly than i ever heard a cat purr before and appeared to be so much overpowered by its feelings that it occasionally mewed and purred almost in the same breath  such demonstrations of joy and affection led us at once to conclude that this poor cat must have known man before and we conjectured that it had been left either accidentally or by design on the island many years ago and was now evincing its extreme joy at meeting once more with human beings  while we were fondling the cat and talking about it jack glanced round the open space in the midst of which we stood  hallo exclaimed he this looks something like a clearing  the axe has been at work here  just look at these treestumps  we now turned to examine these and without doubt we found trees that had been cut down here and there also stumps and broken branchesall of which however were completely covered over with moss and bore evidence of having been in this condition for some years  no human footprints were to be seen either on the track or among the bushes but those of the cat were found everywhere  we now determined to follow up the track as far as it went and peterkin put the cat down but it seemed to be so weak and mewed so very pitifully that he took it up again and carried it in his arms where in a few minutes it fell sound asleep  about ten yards farther on the felled trees became more numerous and the track diverging to the right followed for a short space the banks of a stream  suddenly we came to a spot where once must have been a rude bridge the stones of which were scattered in the stream and those on each bank entirely covered over with moss  in silent surprise and expectancy we continued to advance and a few yards farther on beheld under the shelter of some breadfruit trees a small hut or cottage  i cannot hope to convey to my readers a very correct idea of the feelings that affected us on witnessing this unexpected sight  we stood for a long time in silent wonder for there was a deep and most melancholy stillness about the place that quite overpowered us and when we did at length speak it was in subdued whispers as if we were surrounded by some awful or supernatural influence  even peterkins voice usually so quick and lively on all occasions was hushed now for there was a dreariness about this silent lonely uninhabited cottageso strange in its appearance so far away from the usual dwellings of man so old decayed and deserted in its aspect that fell upon our spirits like a thick cloud and blotted out as with a pall the cheerful sunshine that had filled us since the commencement of our tour round the island  the hut or cottage was rude and simple in its construction  it was not more than twelve feet long by ten feet broad and about seven or eight feet high  it had one window or rather a small frame in which a window might perhaps once have been but which was now empty  the door was exceedingly low and formed of rough boards and the roof was covered with broad cocoanut and plantain leaves  but every part of it was in a state of the utmost decay  moss and green matter grew in spots all over it  the woodwork was quite perforated with holes the roof had nearly fallen in and appeared to be prevented from doing so altogether by the thick matting of creeping plants and the interlaced branches which years of neglect had allowed to cover it almost entirely while the thick luxuriant branches of the breadfruit and other trees spread above it and flung a deep sombre shadow over the spot as if to guard it from the heat and the light of day  we conversed long and in whispers about this strange habitation ere we ventured to approach it and when at length we did so it was at least on my part with feelings of awe  at first jack endeavoured to peep in at the window but from the deep shadow of the trees already mentioned and the gloom within he could not clearly discern objects so we lifted the latch and pushed open the door  we observed that the latch was made of iron and almost eaten away with rust  in the like condition were also the hinges which creaked as the door swung back  on entering we stood still and gazed around us while we were much impressed with the dreary stillness of the room  but what we saw there surprised and shocked us not a little there was no furniture in the apartment save a little wooden stool and an iron pot the latter almost eaten through with rust  in the corner farthest from the door was a low bedstead on which lay two skeletons embedded in a little heap of dry dust  with beating hearts we went forward to examine them  one was the skeleton of a man the other that of a dog which was extended close beside that of the man with its head resting on his bosom  now we were very much concerned about this discovery and could scarce refrain from tears on beholding these sad remains  after some time we began to talk about what we had seen and to examine in and around the hut in order to discover some clue to the name or history of this poor man who had thus died in solitude with none to mourn his loss save his cat and his faithful dog  but we found nothingneither a book nor a scrap of paper  we found however the decayed remnants of what appeared to have been clothing and an old axe  but none of these things bore marks of any kind and indeed they were so much decayed as to convince us that they had lain in the condition in which we found them for many years  this discovery now accounted to us for the treestump at the top of the mountain with the initials cut on it also for the patch of sugarcane and other traces of man which we had met with in the course of our rambles over the island  and we were much saddened by the reflection that the lot of this poor wanderer might possibly be our own after many years residence on the island unless we should be rescued by the visit of some vessel or the arrival of natives  having no clue whatever to account for the presence of this poor human being in such a lonely spot we fell to conjecturing what could have brought him there  i was inclined to think that he must have been a shipwrecked sailor whose vessel had been lost here and all the crew been drowned except himself and his dog and cat  but jack thought it more likely that he had run away from his vessel and had taken the dog and cat to keep him company we were also much occupied in our minds with the wonderful difference between the cat and the dog  for here we saw that while the one perished like a loving friend by its masters side with its head resting on his bosom the other had sought to sustain itself by prowling abroad in the forest and had lived in solitude to a good old age however we did not conclude from this that the cat was destitute of affection for we could not forget its emotions on first meeting with us but we saw from this that the dog had a great deal more of generous love in its nature than the cat because it not only found it impossible to live after the death of its master but it must needs when it came to die crawl to his side and rest its head upon his lifeless breast  while we were thinking on these things and examining into everything about the room we were attracted by an exclamation from peterkin  i say jack said he here is something that will be of use to us  what is it said jack hastening across the room  an old pistol replied peterkin holding up the weapon which he had just pulled from under a heap of broken wood and rubbish that lay in a corner  that indeed might have been useful said jack examining it if we had any powder but i suspect the bow and the sling will prove more serviceable  true i forgot that said peterkin but we may as well take it with us for the flint will serve to strike fire with when the sun does not shine  after having spent more than an hour at this place without discovering anything of further interest peterkin took up the old cat which had lain very contentedly asleep on the stool whereon he had placed it and we prepared to take our departure  in leaving the hut jack stumbled heavily against the doorpost which was so much decayed as to break across and the whole fabric of the hut seemed ready to tumble about our ears  this put it into our heads that we might as well pull it down and so form a mound over the skeleton  jack therefore with his axe cut down the other doorpost which when it was done brought the whole hut in ruins to the ground and thus formed a grave to the bones of the poor recluse and his dog  then we left the spot having brought away the iron pot the pistol and the old axe as they might be of much use to us hereafter  during the rest of this day we pursued our journey and examined the other end of the large valley which we found to be so much alike to the parts already described that i shall not recount the particulars of what we saw in this place  i may however remark that we did not quite recover our former cheerful spirits until we arrived at our bower which we did late in the evening and found everything just in the same condition as we had left it three days before    chapter twelve  something wrong with the tankjacks wisdom and peterkins impertinencewonderful behaviour of a crabgood wishes for those who dwell far from the seajack commences to build a little boat  rest is sweet as well for the body as for the mind  during my long experience amid the vicissitudes of a chequered life i have found that periods of profound rest at certain intervals in addition to the ordinary hours of repose are necessary to the wellbeing of man  and the nature as well as the period of this rest varies according to the different temperaments of individuals and the peculiar circumstances in which they may chance to be placed  to those who work with their minds bodily labour is rest to those who labour with the body deep sleep is rest to the downcast the weary and the sorrowful joy and peace are rest  nay further i think that to the gay the frivolous the reckless when sated with pleasures that cannot last even sorrow proves to be rest of a kind although perchance it were better that i should call it relief than rest  there is indeed but one class of men to whom rest is deniedthere is no rest to the wicked  at this i do but hint however as i treat not of that rest which is spiritual but more particularly of that which applies to the mind and to the body  of this rest we stood much in need on our return home and we found it exceedingly sweet when we indulged in it after completing the journey just related  it had not indeed been a very long journey nevertheless we had pursued it so diligently that our frames were not a little prostrated  our minds were also very much exhausted in consequence of the many surprises frequent alarms and much profound thought to which they had been subjected so that when we lay down on the night of our return under the shelter of the bower we fell immediately into very deep repose  i can state this with much certainty for jack afterwards admitted the fact and peterkin although he stoutly denied it i heard snoring loudly at least two minutes after lying down  in this condition we remained all night and the whole of the following day without awaking once or so much as moving our positions  when we did awake it was near sunset and we were all in such a state of lassitude that we merely rose to swallow a mouthful of food  as peterkin remarked in the midst of a yawn we took breakfast at teatime and then went to bed again where we lay till the following forenoon  after this we arose very greatly refreshed but much alarmed lest we had lost count of a day  i say we were much alarmed on this head for we had carefully kept count of the days since we were cast upon our island in order that we might remember the sabbathday which day we had hitherto with one accord kept as a day of rest and refrained from all work whatsoever  however on considering the subject we all three entertained the same opinion as to how long we had slept and so our minds were put at ease  we now hastened to our water garden to enjoy a bathe and to see how did the animals which i had placed in the tank  we found the garden more charming pellucid and inviting than ever and jack and i plunged into its depths and gambolled among its radiant coral groves while peterkin wallowed at the surface and tried occasionally to kick us as we passed below  having dressed i then hastened to the tank but what was my surprise and grief to find nearly all the animals dead and the water in a putrid condition  i was greatly distressed at this and wondered what could be the cause of it  why you precious humbug said peterkin coming up to me how could you expect it to be otherwise  when fishes are accustomed to live in the pacific ocean how can you expect them to exist in a hole like that  indeed peterkin i replied there seems to be truth in what you say nevertheless now i think of it there must be some error in your reasoning for if i put in but a few very small animals they will bear the same proportion to this pond that the millions of fish bear to the ocean  i say jack cried peterkin waving his hand come here like a good fellow  ralph is actually talking philosophy  do come to our assistance for hes out o sight beyond me already  whats the matter inquired jack coming up while he endeavoured to scrub his long hair dry with a towel of cocoanut cloth  i repeated my thoughts to jack who i was happy to find quite agreed with me  the best plan he said will be to put very few animals at first into your tank and add more as you find it will bear them  and look here he added pointing to the sides of the tank which for the space of two inches above the waterlevel were encrusted with salt you must carry your philosophy a little further ralph  that water has evaporated so much that it is too salt for anything to live in  you will require to add fresh water now and then in order to keep it at the same degree of saltness as the sea  very true jack that never struck me before said i  and now i think of it continued jack it seems to me that the surest way of arranging your tank so as to get it to keep pure and in good condition will be to imitate the ocean in it in fact make it a miniature pacific  i dont see how you can hope to succeed unless you do that  most true said i pondering what my companion said  but i fear that that will be very difficult  not at all cried jack rolling his towel up into a ball and throwing it into the face of peterkin who had been grinning and winking at him during the last five minutesnot at all  look here  there is water of a certain saltness in the sea well fill your tank with seawater and keep it at that saltness by marking the height at which the water stands on the sides  when it evaporates a little pour in fresh water from the brook till it comes up to the mark and then it will be right for the salt does not evaporate with the water  then theres lots of seaweed in the sea well go and get one or two bits of seaweed and put them into your tank  of course the weed must be alive and growing to little stones or you can chip a bit off the rocks with the weed sticking to it  then if you like you can throw a little sand and gravel into your tank and the things complete  nay not quite said peterkin who had been gravely attentive to this offhand advicenot quite  you must first make three little men to dive in it before it can be said to be perfect and that would be rather difficult i fear for two of them would require to be philosophers but hallo whats thisi say ralph look here  theres one o your crabs up to something uncommon  its performing the most remarkable operation for a crab i ever sawtaking off its coat i do believe before going to bed  we hastily stooped over the tank and certainly were not a little amused at the conduct of one of the crabs which still survived its companions it was one of the common small crabs like to those that are found running about everywhere on the coast of england  while we gazed at it we observed its back to split away from the lower part of its body and out of the gap thus formed came a soft lump which moved and writhed unceasingly  this lump continued to increase in size until it appeared like a bunch of crabs legs and indeed such it proved in a very few minutes to be for the points of the toes were at length extricated from the hole in its back the legs spread out the body followed and the crab walked away quite entire even to the points of its nipperclaws leaving a perfectly entire shell behind it so that when we looked it seemed as though there were two complete crabs instead of one  well exclaimed peterkin drawing a long breath ive heard of a man jumping out of his skin and sitting down in his skeleton in order to cool himself but i never expected to see a crab do it  we were in truth much amazed at this spectacle and the more so when we observed that the new crab was larger than the crab that it came out of  it was also quite soft but by next morning its skin had hardened into a good shell  we came thus to know that crabs grow in this way and not by the growing of their shells as we had always thought before we saw this wonderful operation  now i considered well the advice which jack had given me about preparing my tank and the more i thought of it the more i came to regard it as very sound and worthy of being acted on  so i forthwith put his plan in execution and found it to answer excellently wellindeed much beyond my expectation for i found that after a little experience had taught me the proper proportion of seaweed and animals to put into a certain amount of water the tank needed no further attendance  and moreover i did not require ever afterwards to renew or change the seawater but only to add a very little fresh water from the brook now and then as the other evaporated  i therefore concluded that if i had been suddenly conveyed along with my tank into some region where there was no salt sea at all my little sea and my seafish would have continued to thrive and to prosper notwithstanding  this made me greatly to desire that those people in the world who live far inland might know of my wonderful tank and by having materials like to those of which it was made conveyed to them thus be enabled to watch the habits of those most mysterious animals that reside in the sea and examine with their own eyes the wonders of the great deep  for many days after this while peterkin and jack were busily employed in building a little boat out of the curious natural planks of the chestnuttree i spent much of my time in examining with the burningglass the marvellous operations that were constantly going on in my tank  here i saw those anemones which cling like little red yellow and green blobs of jelly to the rocks put forth as it were a multitude of arms and wait till little fish or other small animalcules unwarily touched them when they would instantly seize them fold arm after arm round their victims and so engulf them in their stomachs here i saw the ceaseless working of those little coral insects whose efforts have encrusted the islands of the pacific with vast rocks and surrounded them with enormous reefs and i observed that many of these insects though extremely minute were very beautiful coming out of their holes in a circle of fine threads and having the form of a shuttlecock  here i saw curious little barnacles opening a hole in their backs and constantly putting out a thin feathery hand with which i doubt not they dragged their food into their mouths  here also i saw those crabs which have shells only on the front of their bodies but no shell whatever on their remarkably tender tails so that in order to find a protection to them they thrust them into the empty shells of whelks or some such fish and when they grow too big for one change into another  but most curious of all i saw an animal which had the wonderful power when it became ill of casting its stomach and its teeth away from it and getting an entirely new set in the course of a few months  all this i saw and a great deal more by means of my tank and my burningglass but i refrain from setting down more particulars here as i have still much to tell of the adventures that befell us while we remained on this island    chapter thirteen  notable discovery at the spouting cliffsthe mysterious green monster explainedwe are thrown into unutterable terror by the idea that jack is drownedthe diamond cave  come jack cried peterkin one morning about three weeks after our return from our long excursion lets be jolly today and do something vigorous  im quite tired of hammering and bammering hewing and screwing cutting and butting at that little boat of ours that seems as hard to build as noahs ark  let us go on an excursion to the mountaintop or have a hunt after the wild ducks or make a dash at the pigs  im quite flatflat as bad gingerbeerflat as a pancake in fact i want something to rouse meto toss me up as it were  eh what do you say to it  well answered jack throwing down the axe with which he was just about to proceed towards the boat if thats what you want i would recommend you to make an excursion to the waterspouts  the last one we had to do with tossed you up a considerable height perhaps the next will send you higherwho knowsif youre at all reasonable or moderate in your expectations  jack my dear boy said peterkin gravely you are really becoming too fond of jesting  its a thing i dont at all approve of and if you dont give it up i fear that for our mutual good we shall have to part  well then peterkin replied jack with a smile what would you have  have said peterkin  i would have nothing  i didnt say i wanted to have i said that i wanted to do  by the bye said i interrupting their conversation i am reminded by this that we have not yet discovered the nature of yon curious appearance that we saw near the waterspouts on our journey round the island  perhaps it would be well to go for that purpose  humph ejaculated peterkin i know the nature of it well enough  what was it said i  it was of a mysterious nature to be sure said he with a wave of his hand while he rose from the log on which he had been sitting and buckled on his belt into which he thrust his enormous club  well then let us away to the waterspouts cried jack going up to the bower for his bow and arrowsand bring your spear peterkin it may be useful  we now having made up our minds to examine into this matter sallied forth eagerly in the direction of the waterspout rocks which as i have before mentioned were not far from our present place of abode  on arriving there we hastened down to the edge of the rocks and gazed over into the sea where we observed the palegreen object still distinctly visible moving its tail slowly to and fro in the water  most remarkable said jack  exceedingly curious said i  beats everything said peterkinnow jack he added you made such a poor figure in your last attempt to stick that object that i would advise you to let me try it  if it has got a heart at all ill engage to send my spear right through the core of it if it hasnt got a heart ill send it through the spot where its heart ought to be  fire away then my boy replied jack with a laugh  peterkin immediately took the spear poised it for a second or two above his head then darted it like an arrow into the sea  down it went straight into the centre of the green object passed quite through it and came up immediately afterwards pure and unsullied while the mysterious tail moved quietly as before  now said peterkin gravely that brute is a heartless monster ill have nothing more to do with it  im pretty sure now said jack that it is merely a phosphoric light but i must say im puzzled at its staying always in that exact spot  i also was much puzzled and inclined to think with jack that it must be phosphoric light of which luminous appearance we had seen much while on our voyage to these seas  but said i there is nothing to hinder us from diving down to it now that we are sure it is not a shark  true returned jack stripping off his clothes  ill go down ralph as im better at diving than you arenow then peterkin out o the road  jack stepped forward joined his hands above his head bent over the rocks and plunged into the sea  for a second or two the spray caused by his dive hid him from view then the water became still and we saw him swimming far down in the midst of the green object  suddenly he sank below it and vanished altogether from our sight  we gazed anxiously down at the spot where he had disappeared for nearly a minute expecting every moment to see him rise again for breath but fully a minute passed and still he did not reappear  two minutes passed and then a flood of alarm rushed in upon my soul when i considered that during all my acquaintance with him jack had never stayed under water more than a minute at a timeindeed seldom so long  oh peterkin  i said in a voice that trembled with increasing anxiety something has happened  it is more than three minutes now  but peterkin did not answer and i observed that he was gazing down into the water with a look of intense fear mingled with anxiety while his face was overspread with a deadly paleness  suddenly he sprang to his feet and rushed about in a frantic state wringing his hands and exclaiming oh jack  jack  he is gone  it must have been a shark and he is gone for ever  for the next five minutes i know not what i did the intensity of my feelings almost bereft me of my senses  but i was recalled to myself by peterkin seizing me by the shoulders and staring wildly into my face while he exclaimed ralph  ralph perhaps he has only fainted  dive for him ralph  it seemed strange that this did not occur to me sooner  in a moment i rushed to the edge of the rocks and without waiting to throw off my garments was on the point to spring into the waves when i observed something black rising up through the green object  in another moment jacks head rose to the surface and he gave a wild shout flinging back the spray from his locks as was his wont after a dive  now we were almost as much amazed at seeing him reappear well and strong as we had been at first at his nonappearance for to the best of our judgment he had been nearly ten minutes under waterperhaps longerand it required no exertion of our reason to convince us that this was utterly impossible for mortal man to do and retain his strength and faculties it was therefore with a feeling akin to superstitious awe that i held down my hand and assisted him to clamber up the steep rocks  but no such feeling affected peterkin  no sooner did jack gain the rocks and seat himself on one panting for breath than he threw his arms round his neck and burst into a flood of tears  oh jack  jack said he where were you  what kept you so long  after a few moments peterkin became composed enough to sit still and listen to jacks explanation although he could not restrain himself from attempting to wink every two minutes at me in order to express his joy at jacks safety  i say he attempted to wink but i am bound to add that he did not succeed for his eyes were so much swollen with weeping that his frequent attempts only resulted in a series of violent and altogether idiotical contortions of the face that were very far from expressing what he intended  however i knew what the poor fellow meant by it so i smiled to him in return and endeavoured to make believe that he was winking  now lads said jack when we were composed enough to listen to him yon green object is not a shark it is a stream of light issuing from a cave in the rocks  just after i made my dive i observed that this light came from the side of the rock above which we are now sitting so i struck out for it and saw an opening into some place or other that appeared to be luminous within  for one instant i paused to think whether i ought to venture  then i made up my mind and dashed into it for you see peterkin although i take some time to tell this it happened in the space of a few seconds so that i knew i had wind enough in me to serve to bring me out o the hole and up to the surface again well i was just on the point of turningfor i began to feel a little uncomfortable in such a placewhen it seemed to me as if there was a faint light right above me  i darted upwards and found my head out of water  this relieved me greatly for i now felt that i could take in air enough to enable me to return the way i came  then it all at once occurred to me that i might not be able to find the way out again but on glancing downwards my mind was put quite at rest by seeing the green light below me streaming into the cave just like the light that we had seen streaming out of it only what i now saw was much brighter  at first i could scarcely see anything as i gazed around me it was so dark but gradually my eyes became accustomed to it and i found that i was in a huge cave part of the walls of which i observed on each side of me  the ceiling just above me was also visible and i fancied that i could perceive beautiful glittering objects there but the farther end of the cave was shrouded in darkness  while i was looking around me in great wonder it came into my head that you two would think i was drowned so i plunged down through the passage again in a great hurry rose to the surface andhere i am  when jack concluded his recital of what he had seen in this remarkable cave i could not rest satisfied till i had dived down to see it which i did but found it so dark as jack had said that i could scarcely see anything  when i returned we had a long conversation about it during which i observed that peterkin had a most lugubrious expression on his countenance  whats the matter peterkin said i  the matter he replied  its all very well for you two to be talking away like mermaids about the wonders of this cave but you know i must be content to hear about it while you are enjoying yourselves down there like mad dolphins  its really too bad  im very sorry for you peterkinindeed i am said jack but we cannot help you  if you would only learn to dive  learn to fly you might as well say retorted peterkin in a very sulky tone  if you would only consent to keep still said i we would take you down with us in ten seconds  hum returned peterkin suppose a salamander was to propose to you only to keep still and he would carry you through a blazing fire in a few seconds what would you say  we both laughed and shook our heads for it was evident that nothing was to be made of peterkin in the water  but we could not rest satisfied till we had seen more of this cave so after further consultation jack and i determined to try if we could take down a torch with us and set fire to it in the cavern  this we found to be an undertaking of no small difficulty but we accomplished it at last by the following means first we made a torch of a very inflammable nature out of the bark of a certain tree which we cut into strips and after twisting cemented together with a kind of resin or gum which we also obtained from another tree neither of which trees however was known by name to jack  this when prepared we wrapped up in a great number of plies of cocoanut cloth so that we were confident it could not get wet during the short time it should be under water  then we took a small piece of the tinder which we had carefully treasured up lest we should require it as before said when the sun should fail us also we rolled up some dry grass and a few chips which with a little bow and drill like those described before we made into another bundle and wrapped it up in cocoanut cloth  when all was ready we laid aside our garments with the exception of our trousers which as we did not know what rough scraping against the rocks we might be subjected to we kept on  then we advanced to the edge of the rocksjack carrying one bundle with the torch i the other with the things for producing fire  now dont weary for us peterkin should we be gone some time said jack  well be sure to return in halfanhour at the very latest however interesting the cave should be that we may relieve your mind  farewell said peterkin coming up to us with a look of deep but pretended solemnity while he shook hands and kissed each of us on the cheekfarewell  and while you are gone i shall repose my weary limbs under the shelter of this bush and meditate on the changefulness of all things earthly with special reference to the forsaken condition of a poor shipwrecked sailorboy  so saying peterkin waved his hand turned from us and cast himself upon the ground with a look of melancholy resignation which was so well feigned that i would have thought it genuine had he not accompanied it with a gentle wink  we both laughed and springing from the rocks together plunged head first into the sea  we gained the interior of the submarine cave without difficulty and on emerging from the waves supported ourselves for some time by treading water while we held the two bundles above our heads  this we did in order to let our eyes become accustomed to the obscurity  then when we could see sufficiently we swam to a shelving rock and landed in safety  having wrung the water from our trousers and dried ourselves as well as we could under the circumstances we proceeded to ignite the torch  this we accomplished without difficulty in a few minutes and no sooner did it flare up than we were struck dumb with the wonderful objects that were revealed to our gaze  the roof of the cavern just above us seemed to be about ten feet high but grew higher as it receded into the distance until it was lost in darkness  it seemed to be made of coral and was supported by massive columns of the same material immense icicles as they appeared to us hung from it in various places these however were formed not of ice but of a species of limestone which seemed to flow in a liquid form towards the point of each where it became solid  a good many drops fell however to the rock below and these formed little cones which rose to meet the points above some of them had already met and thus we saw how the pillars were formed which at first seemed to us as if they had been placed there by some human architect to support the roof  as we advanced farther in we saw that the floor was composed of the same material as the pillars and it presented the curious appearance of ripples such as are formed on water when gently ruffled by the wind  there were several openings on either hand in the walls that seemed to lead into other caverns but these we did not explore at this time  we also observed that the ceiling was curiously marked in many places as if it were the fretwork of a noble cathedral and the walls as well as the roof sparkled in the light of our torch and threw back gleams and flashes as if they were covered with precious stones  although we proceeded far into this cavern we did not come to the end of it and we were obliged to return more speedily than we would otherwise have done as our torch was nearly expended  we did not observe any openings in the roof or any indications of places whereby light might enter but near the entrance to the cavern stood an immense mass of purewhite coral rock which caught and threw back the little light that found an entrance through the caves mouth and thus produced we conjectured the palegreen object which had first attracted our attention  we concluded also that the reflecting power of this rock was that which gave forth the dim light that faintly illumined the first part of the cave  before diving through the passage again we extinguished the small piece of our torch that remained and left it in a dry spotconceiving that we might possibly stand in need of it if at any future time we should chance to wet our torch while diving into the cavern  as we stood for a few minutes after it was out waiting till our eyes became accustomed to the gloom we could not help remarking the deep intense stillness and the unutterable gloom of all around us and as i thought of the stupendous dome above and the countless gems that had sparkled in the torchlight a few minutes before it came into my mind to consider how strange it is that god should make such wonderful and exquisitely beautiful works never to be seen at allexcept indeed by chance visitors such as ourselves  i afterwards found that there were many such caverns among the islands of the south seas some of them larger and more beautiful than the one i have just described  now ralph are you ready said jack in a low voice that seemed to echo up into the dome above  quite ready  come along then said he and plunging off the ledge of the rock into the water we dived through the narrow entrance  in a few seconds we were panting on the rocks above and receiving the congratulations of our friend peterkin    chapter fourteen  strange peculiarity of the tidesalso of the twilightpeterkins remarkable conduct in embracing a little pig and killing a big sowsage remarks on jestingalso on love  it was quite a relief to us to breathe the pure air and to enjoy the glad sunshine after our long ramble in the diamond cave as we named it for although we did not stay more than halfanhour away it seemed to us much longer  while we were dressing and during our walk home we did our best to satisfy the curiosity of poor peterkin who seemed to regret with lively sincerity his inability to dive  there was no help for it however so we condoled with him as we best could  had there been any great rise or fall in the tide of these seas we might perhaps have found it possible to take him down with us at low water but as the tide never rose or fell more than eighteen inches or two feet this was impossible  this peculiarity of the tideits slight rise and fallhad not attracted our observation till some time after our residence on the island  neither had we observed another curious circumstance until we had been some time there  this was the fact that the tide rose and fell with constant regularity instead of being affected by the changes of the moon as in our own country and as it is in most other parts of the worldat least in all those parts with which i am acquainted  every day and every night at twelve oclock precisely the tide is at the full and at six oclock every morning and evening it is ebb  i can speak with much confidence on this singular circumstance as we took particular note of it and never found it to alter  of course i must admit we had to guess the hour of twelve midnight and i think we could do this pretty correctly but in regard to twelve noon we are quite positive because we easily found the highest point that the sun reached in the sky by placing ourselves at a certain spot whence we observed the sharp summit of a cliff resting against the sky just where the sun passed  jack and i were surprised that we had not noticed this the first few days of our residence here and could only account for it by our being so much taken up with the more obvious wonders of our novel situation i have since learned however that this want of observation is a sad and very common infirmity of human nature there being hundreds of persons before whose eyes the most wonderful things are passing every day who nevertheless are totally ignorant of them  i therefore have to record my sympathy with such persons and to recommend to them a course of conduct which i have now for a long time myself adoptednamely the habit of forcing my attention upon all things that go on around me and of taking some degree of interest in them whether i feel it naturally or not  i suggest this the more earnestly though humbly because i have very frequently come to know that my indifference to a thing has generally been caused by my ignorance in regard to it  we had much serious conversation on this subject of the tides and jack told us in his own quiet philosophical way that these tides did great good to the world in many ways particularly in the way of cleansing the shores of the land and carrying off the filth that was constantly poured into the sea therefromwhich peterkin suggested was remarkably tidy of it to do  poor peterkin could never let slip an opportunity to joke however inopportune it might be which at first we found rather a disagreeable propensity as it often interrupted the flow of very agreeable conversationand indeed i cannot too strongly record my disapprobation of this tendency in general but we became so used to it at last that we found it no interruption whatever  indeed strange to say we came to feel that it was a necessary part of our enjoyment such is the force of habit and found the sudden outbursts of mirth resulting from his humorous disposition quite natural and refreshing to us in the midst of our more serious conversations  but i must not misrepresent peterkin  we often found to our surprise that he knew many things which we did not and i also observed that those things which he learned from experience were never forgotten  from all these things i came at length to understand that things very opposite and dissimilar in themselves when united do make an agreeable whole as for example we three on this our island although most unlike in many things when united made a trio so harmonious that i question if there ever met before such an agreeable triumvirate  there was indeed no note of discord whatever in the symphony we played together on that sweet coral island and i am now persuaded that this was owing to our having been all tuned to the same keynamely that of love  yes we loved one another with much fervency while we lived on that island and for the matter of that we love each other still  and while i am on this subject or rather the subject that just preceded itnamely the tidesi may here remark on another curious natural phenomenon  we found that there was little or no twilight in this island  we had a distinct remembrance of the charming long twilight at home which some people think the most delightful part of the day though for my part i have always preferred sunrise and when we first landed we used to sit down on some rocky point or eminence at the close of our days work to enjoy the evening breeze but no sooner had the sun sunk below the horizon than all became suddenly dark  this rendered it necessary that we should watch the sun when we happened to be out hunting for to be suddenly left in the dark while in the woods was very perplexing as although the stars shone with great beauty and brilliancy they could not pierce through the thick umbrageous boughs that interlaced above our heads  but to return  after having told all we could to peterkin about the diamond cave under spouting cliff as we named the locality we were wending our way rapidly homewards when a grunt and a squeal were borne down by the land breeze to our ears  thats the ticket was peterkins remarkable exclamation as he started convulsively and levelled his spear  hist cried jack these are your friends peterkin  they must have come over expressly to pay you a friendly visit for it is the first time we have seen them on this side of the island  come along cried peterkin hurrying towards the wood while jack and i followed smiling at his impatience  another grunt and halfadozen squeals much louder than before came down the valley  at this time we were just opposite the small vale which lay between the valley of the wreck and spouting cliff  i say peterkin cried jack in a hoarse whisper  well what ist  stay a bit man  these grunters are just up there on the hillside  if you go and stand with ralph in the lee of yon cliff ill cut round behind and drive them through the gorge so that youll have a better chance of picking out a good one  now mind you pitch into a fat young pig peterkin added jack as he sprang into the bushes  wont i just said peterkin licking his lips as we took our station beside the cliff  i feel quite a tender affection for young pigs in my heart  perhaps it would be more correct to say in my tum  there they come cried i as a terrific yell from jack sent the whole herd screaming down the hill  now peterkin being unable to hold back crept a short way up a very steep grassy mound in order to get a better view of the hogs before they came up and just as he raised his head above its summit two little pigs which had outrun their companions rushed over the top with the utmost precipitation  one of these brushed close past peterkins ear the other unable to arrest its headlong flight went as peterkin himself afterwards expressed it bash into his arms with a sudden squeal which was caused more by the force of the blow than the will of the animal and both of them rolled violently down to the foot of the mound  no sooner was this reached than the little pig recovered its feet tossed up its tail and fled shrieking from the spot  but i slung a large stone after it which being fortunately well aimed hit it behind the ear and felled it to the earth  capital ralph thats your sort cried peterkin who to my surprise and great relief had risen to his feet apparently unhurt though much dishevelled  he rushed frantically towards the gorge which the yells of the hogs told us they were now approaching  i had made up my mind that i would abstain from killing another as if peterkin should be successful two were more than sufficient for our wants at the present time  suddenly they all burst forthtwo or three little round ones in advance and an enormous old sow with a drove of hogs at her heels  now peterkin said i theres a nice little fat one just spear it  but peterkin did not move he allowed it to pass unharmed  i looked at him in surprise and saw that his lips were compressed and his eyebrows knitted as if he were about to fight with some awful enemy  what is it  i inquired with some trepidation  suddenly he levelled his spear darted forward and with a yell that nearly froze the blood in my veins stabbed the old sow to the heart nay so vigorously was it done that the spear went in at one side and came out at the other  oh peterkin said i going up to him what have you done  done  ive killed their greatgreatgrandmother thats all said he looking with a somewhat awestruck expression at the transfixed animal  hallo whats this said jack as he came up  why peterkin you must be fond of a tough chop  if you mean to eat this old hog shell try your jaws i warrant  what possessed you to stick her peterkin  why the fact is i want a pair of shoes  what have your shoes to do with the old hog said i smiling  my present shoes have certainly nothing to do with her replied peterkin nevertheless she will have a good deal to do with my future shoes  the fact is when i saw you floor that pig so neatly ralph it struck me that there was little use in killing another  then i remembered all at once that i had long wanted some leather or tough substance to make shoes of and this old grandmother seemed so tough that i just made up my mind to stick herand you see ive done it  that you certainly have peterkin said jack as he was examining the transfixed animal  we now considered how we were to carry our game home for although the distance was short the hog was very heavy  at length we hit on the plan of tying its four feet together and passing the spearhandle between them  jack took one end on his shoulder i took the other on mine and peterkin carried the small pig  thus we returned in triumph to our bower laden as peterkin remarked with the glorious spoils of a noble hunt  as he afterwards spoke in similarly glowing terms in reference to the supper that followed there is every reason to believe that we retired that night to our leafy beds in a high state of satisfaction    chapter fifteen  boatbuilding extraordinarypeterkin tries his hand at cookery and fails most signallythe boat finishedcurious conversation with the cat and other matters  for many days after this jack applied himself with unremitting assiduity to the construction of our boat which at length began to look something like one  but those only who have had the thing to do can entertain a right idea of the difficulty involved in such an undertaking with no other implements than an axe a bit of hoopiron a sailneedle and a broken penknife  but jack did it  he was of that disposition which will not be conquered  when he believed himself to be acting rightly he overcame all obstacles  i have seen jack when doubtful whether what he was about to do were right or wrong as timid and vacillating as a little girl and i honour him for it  as this boat was a curiosity in its way a few words here relative to the manner of its construction may not be amiss  i have already mentioned the chestnuttree with its wonderful buttresses or planks  this tree then furnished us with the chief part of our material  first of all jack sought out a limb of a tree of such a form and size as while it should form the keel a bend at either end should form the stem and sternposts  such a piece however was not easy to obtain but at last he procured it by rooting up a small tree which had a branch growing at the proper angle about ten feet up its stem with two strong roots growing in such a form as enabled him to make a flatsterned boat  this placed he procured three branching roots of suitable size which he fitted to the keel at equal distances thus forming three strong ribs  now the squaring and shaping of these and the cutting of the grooves in the keel was an easy enough matter as it was all work for the axe in the use of which jack was become wonderfully expert but it was quite a different affair when he came to nailing the ribs to the keel for we had no instrument capable of boring a large hole and no nails to fasten them with  we were indeed much perplexed here but jack at length devised an instrument that served very well  he took the remainder of our hoopiron and beat it into the form of a pipe or cylinder about as thick as a mans finger  this he did by means of our axe and the old rusty axe we had found at the house of the poor man at the other side of the island  this when made red hot bored slowly through the timbers and the better to retain the heat jack shut up one end of it and filled it with sand  true the work was very slowly done but it mattered notwe had little else to do  two holes were bored in each timber about an inch and a half apart and also down into the keel but not quite through  into these were placed stout pegs made of a tree called ironwood and when they were hammered well home the timbers were as firmly fixed as if they had been nailed with iron  the gunwales which were very stout were fixed in a similar manner  but besides the wooden nails they were firmly lashed to the stem and sternposts and ribs by means of a species of cordage which we had contrived to make out of the fibrous husk of the cocoanut  this husk was very tough and when a number of the threads were joined together they formed excellent cordage  at first we tied the different lengths together but this was such a clumsy and awkward complication of knots that we contrived by careful interlacing of the ends together before twisting to make good cordage of any size or length we chose  of course it cost us much time and infinite labour but jack kept up our spirits when we grew weary and so all that we required was at last constructed  planks were now cut off the chestnuttrees of about an inch thick these were dressed with the axebut clumsily for an axe is illadapted for such work  five of these planks on each side were sufficient and we formed the boat in a very rounded barrellike shape in order to have as little twisting of the planks as possible for although we could easily bend them we could not easily twist them  having no nails to rivet the planks with we threw aside the ordinary fashion of boatbuilding and adopted one of our own  the planks were therefore placed on each others edges and sewed together with the tough cordage already mentioned they were also thus sewed to the stem the stern and the keel  each stitch or tie was six inches apart and was formed thus three holes were bored in the upper plank and three in the lower the holes being above each otherthat is in a vertical line  through these holes the cord was passed and when tied formed a powerful stitch of threeply  besides this we placed between the edges of the planks layers of cocoanut fibre which as it swelled when wetted would we hoped make our little vessel watertight  but in order further to secure this end we collected a large quantity of pitch from the breadfruit tree with which when boiled in our old iron pot we paid the whole of the inside of the boat and while it was yet hot placed large pieces of cocoanut cloth on it and then gave it another coat above that  thus the interior was covered with a tough watertight material while the exterior being uncovered and so exposed to the swelling action of the water was we hoped likely to keep the boat quite dry  i may add that our hopes were not disappointed  while jack was thus engaged peterkin and i sometimes assisted him but as our assistance was not much required we more frequently went ahunting on the extensive mudflats at the entrance of the long valley which lay nearest to our bower  here we found large flocks of ducks of various kinds some of them bearing so much resemblance to the wild ducks of our own country that i think they must have been the same  on these occasions we took the bow and the sling with both of which we were often successful though i must confess that i was the least so our suppers were thus pleasantly varied and sometimes we had such a profusion spread out before us that we frequently knew not with which of the dainties to begin  i must also add that the poor old cat which we had brought home had always a liberal share of our good things and so well was it looked after especially by peterkin that it recovered much of its former strength and seemed to improve in sight as well as hearing  the large flat stone or rock of coral which stood just in front of the entrance to our bower was our table  on this rock we had spread out the few articles we possessed the day we were shipwrecked and on the same rock during many a day afterwards we spread out the bountiful supply with which we had been blessed on our coral island  sometimes we sat down at this table to a feast consisting of hot rollsas peterkin called the newly baked breadfruita roast pig roast duck boiled and roasted yams cocoanuts taro and sweet potatoes which we followed up with a dessert of plums apples and plantainsthe last being a largesized and delightful fruit which grew on a large shrub or tree not more than twelve feet high with lightgreen leaves of enormous length and breadth  these luxurious feasts were usually washed down with cocoanut lemonade  occasionally peterkin tried to devise some new disha conglomerate as he used to say but these generally turned out such atrocious compounds that he was ultimately induced to give up his attempts in extreme disgustnot forgetting however to point out to jack that his failure was a direct contradiction to the proverb which he jack was constantly thrusting down his throatnamely that where theres a will theres a way  for he had a great will to become a cook but could by no means find a way to accomplish that end  one day while peterkin and i were seated beside our table on which dinner was spread jack came up from the beach and flinging down his axe exclaimed  there lads the boats finished at last  so weve nothing to do now but shape two pair of oars and then we may put to sea as soon as we like  this piece of news threw us into a state of great joy for although we were aware that the boat had been gradually getting near its completion it had taken so long that we did not expect it to be quite ready for at least two or three weeks  but jack had wrought hard and said nothing in order to surprise us  my dear fellow cried peterkin youre a perfect trump  but why did you not tell us it was so nearly ready  wont we have a jolly sail tomorrow eh  dont talk so much peterkin said jack and pray hand me a bit of that pig  certainly my dear cried peterkin seizing the axe  what part will you have  a leg or a wing or a piece of the breastwhich  a hind leg if you please answered jack and pray be so good as to include the tail  with all my heart said peterkin exchanging the axe for his hoopiron knife with which he cut off the desired portion  im only too glad my dear boy to see that your appetite is so wholesale and theres no chance whatever of its dwindling down into retail againat least in so far as this pig is concernedralph lad why dont you laugh eh he added turning suddenly to me with a severe look of inquiry  laugh said i  what at peterkin  why should i laugh  both jack and peterkin answered this inquiry by themselves laughing so immoderately that i was induced to believe i had missed noticing some good joke so i begged that it might be explained to me but as this only produced repeated roars of laughter i smiled and helped myself to another slice of plantain  well but continued peterkin i was talking of a sail tomorrow cant we have one jack  no replied jack we cant have a sail but i hope we shall have a row as i intend to work hard at the oars this afternoon and if we cant get them finished by sunset well light our candlenuts and turn them out of hands before we turn into bed  very good said peterkin tossing a lump of pork to the cat who received it with a mew of satisfaction  ill help you if i can  afterwards continued jack we will make a sail out of the cocoanut cloth and rig up a mast and then we shall be able to sail to some of the other islands and visit our old friends the penguins  the prospect of being so soon in a position to extend our observations to the other islands and enjoy a sail over the beautiful sea afforded us much delight and after dinner we set about making the oars in good earnest  jack went into the woods and blocked them roughly out with the axe and i smoothed them down with the knife while peterkin remained in the bower spinning or rather twisting some strong thick cordage with which to fasten them to the boat  we worked hard and rapidly so that when the sun went down jack and i returned to the bower with four stout oars which required little to be done to them save a slight degree of polishing with the knife  as we drew near we were suddenly arrested by the sound of a voice  we were not a little surprised at thisindeed i may almost say alarmed for although peterkin was undoubtedly fond of talking we had never up to this time found him talking to himself  we listened intently and still heard the sound of a voice as if in conversation  jack motioned me to be silent and advancing to the bower on tiptoe we peeped in  the sight that met our gaze was certainly not a little amusing  on the top of a log which we sometimes used as a table sat the black cat with a very demure expression on its countenance and in front of it sitting on the ground with his legs extended on either side of the log was peterkin  at the moment we saw him he was gazing intently into the cats face with his nose about four inches from it his hands being thrust into his breeches pockets  cat said peterkin turning his head a little on one side i love you  there was a pause as if peterkin awaited a reply to this affectionate declaration  but the cat said nothing  do you hear me cried peterkin sharply  i love youi do  dont you love me  to this touching appeal the cat said mew faintly  ah thats right  youre a jolly old rascal  why did you not speak at once eh and peterkin put forward his mouth and kissed the cat on the nose  yes continued peterkin after a pause i love you  dyou think id say so if i didnt you black villain  i love you because ive got to take care of you and to look after you and to think about you and to see that you dont die  mew meaw said the cat  very good continued peterkin quite true i have no doubt  but youve no right to interrupt me sir  hold your tongue till i have done speaking  moreover cat i love you because you came to me the first time you ever saw me and didnt seem to be afraid and appeared to be fond of me though you didnt know that i wasnt going to kill you  now that was brave that was bold and very jolly old boy and i love you for iti do  again there was a pause of a few minutes during which the cat looked placid and peterkin dropped his eyes upon its toes as if in contemplation  suddenly he looked up  well cat what are you thinking about now  wont speak eh  now tell me dont you think its a monstrous shame that those two scoundrels jack and ralph should keep us waiting for our supper so long  here the cat arose put up its back and stretched itself yawned slightly and licked the point of peterkins nose  just so old boy youre a clever fellowi really do believe the brute understands me said peterkin while a broad grin overspread his face as he drew back and surveyed the cat  at this point jack burst into a loud fit of laughter  the cat uttered an angry fuff and fled while peterkin sprang up and exclaimed  bad luck to you jack  youve nearly made the heart jump out of my body you have  perhaps i have replied jack laughing as we entered the bower but as i dont intend to keep you or the cat any longer from your supper i hope that youll both forgive me  peterkin endeavoured to turn this affair off with a laugh  but i observed that he blushed very deeply at the time we discovered ourselves and he did not seem to relish any allusion to the subject afterwards so we refrained from remarking on it ever after though it tickled us not a little at the time  after supper we retired to rest and to dream of wonderful adventures in our little boat and distant voyages upon the sea    chapter sixteen  the boat launchedwe visit the coral reefthe great breaker that never goes downcoral insectsthe way in which coral islands are madethe boats sailwe tax our ingenuity to form fishhookssome of the fish we sawand a monstrous whalewonderful shower of little fish waterspouts  it was a bright clear beautiful morning when we first launched our little boat and rowed out upon the placid waters of the lagoon  not a breath of wind ruffled the surface of the deep  not a cloud spotted the deepblue sky  not a sound that was discordant broke the stillness of the morning although there were many soundssweet tiny and melodiousthat mingled in the universal harmony of nature  the sun was just rising from the pacifics ample bosom and tipping the mountaintops with a red glow  the sea was shining like a sheet of glass yet heaving with the long deep swell that all the world round indicates the life of ocean and the bright seaweeds and the brilliant corals shone in the depths of that pellucid water as we rowed over it like rare and precious gems  oh it was a sight fitted to stir the soul of man to its profoundest depths and if he owned a heart at all to lift that heart in adoration and gratitude to the great creator of this magnificent and glorious universe  at first in the strength of our delight we rowed hither and thither without aim or object  but after the effervescence of our spirits was abated we began to look about us and to consider what we should do  i vote that we row to the reef cried peterkin  and i vote that we visit the islands within the lagoon said i  and i vote we do both cried jack so pull away boys  as i have already said we had made four oars but our boat was so small that only two were necessary  the extra pair were reserved in case any accident should happen to the others  it was therefore only needful that two of us should row while the third steered by means of an oar and relieved the rowers occasionally  first we landed on one of the small islands and ran all over it but saw nothing worthy of particular notice  then we landed on a larger island on which were growing a few cocoanut trees  not having eaten anything that morning we gathered a few of the nuts and breakfasted  after this we pulled straight out to sea and landed on the coral reef  this was indeed a novel and interesting sight to us  we had now been so long on shore that we had almost forgotten the appearance of breakers for there were none within the lagoon  but now as we stood beside the foamcrested billow of the open sea all the enthusiasm of the sailor was awakened in our breasts and as we gazed on the widespread ruin of that single magnificent breaker that burst in thunder at our feet we forgot the coral island behind us we forgot our bower and the calm repose of the scented woods we forgot all that had passed during the last few months and remembered nothing but the storms the calms the fresh breezes and the surging billows of the open sea  this huge ceaseless breaker to which i have so often alluded was a much larger and more sublime object than we had at all imagined it to be  it rose many yards above the level of the sea and could be seen approaching at some distance from the reef  slowly and majestically it came on acquiring greater volume and velocity as it advanced until it assumed the form of a clear watery arch which sparkled in the bright sun  on it came with resistless and solemn majesty the upper edge lipped gently over and it fell with a roar that seemed as though the heart of ocean were broken in the crash of tumultuous water while the foamclad coral reef appeared to tremble beneath the mighty shock  we gazed long and wonderingly at this great sight and it was with difficulty we could tear ourselves away from it  as i have once before mentioned this wave broke in many places over the reef and scattered some of its spray into the lagoon but in most places the reef was sufficiently broad and elevated to receive and check its entire force in many places the coral rocks were covered with vegetationthe beginning as it appeared to us of future islands  thus on this reef we came to perceive how most of the small islands of those seas are formed  on one part we saw the spray of the breaker washing over the rocks and millions of little active busy creatures continuing the work of building up this living rampart  at another place which was just a little too high for the waves to wash over it the coral insects were all dead for we found that they never did their work above water they had faithfully completed the mighty work which their creator had given them to do and they were now all dead  again in other spots the ceaseless lashing of the sea had broken the dead coral in pieces and cast it up in the form of sand  here seabirds had alighted little pieces of seaweed and stray bits of wood had been washed up seeds of plants had been carried by the wind and a few lovely blades of bright green had already sprung up which when they died would increase the size and fertility of these emeralds of ocean  at other places these islets had grown apace and were shaded by one or two cocoanut trees which grew literally in the sand and were constantly washed by the ocean sprayyet as i have before remarked their fruit was most refreshing and sweet to our taste  again at this time jack and i pondered the formation of the large coral islands  we could now understand how the low ones were formed but the larger islands cost us much consideration yet we could arrive at no certain conclusion on the subject  having satisfied our curiosity and enjoyed ourselves during the whole day in our little boat we returned somewhat wearied and withal rather hungry to our bower  now said jack as our boat answers so well we will get a mast and sail made immediately  so we will cried peterkin as we all assisted to drag the boat above highwater mark  well light our candle and set about it this very night  hurrah my boys pull away  as we dragged our boat we observed that she grated heavily on her keel and as the sands were in this place mingled with broken coral rocks we saw portions of the wood being scraped off  hallo cried jack on seeing this that wont do  our keel will be worn off in no time at this rate  so it will said i pondering deeply as to how this might be prevented  but i am not of a mechanical turn naturally so i could conceive no remedy save that of putting a plate of iron on the keel but as we had no iron i knew not what was to be done  it seems to me jack i added that it is impossible to prevent the keel being worn off thus  impossible cried peterkin  my dear ralph you are mistaken there is nothing so easy  how  i inquired in some surprise  why by not using the boat at all replied peterkin  hold your impudent tongue peterkin said jack as he shouldered the oars  come along with me and ill give you work to do  in the first place you will go and collect cocanut fibre and set to work to make sewingtwine with it  please captain interrupted peterkin ive got lots of it made alreadymore than enough as a little friend of mine used to be in the habit of saying every day after dinner  very well continued jack then youll help ralph to collect cocoanut cloth and cut it into shape after which well make a sail of it  ill see to getting the mast and the gearing so lets to work  and to work we went right busily so that in three days from that time we had set up a mast and sail with the necessary rigging in our little boat  the sail was not indeed very handsome to look at as it was formed of a number of oblong patches of cloth but we had sewed it well by means of our sailneedle so that it was strong which was the chief pointjack had also overcome the difficulty about the keel by pinning to it a false keel  this was a piece of tough wood of the same length and width as the real keel and about five inches deep  he made it of this depth because the boat would be thereby rendered not only much more safe but more able to beat against the windwhich in a sea where the tradewinds blow so long and so steadily in one direction was a matter of great importance  this piece of wood was pegged very firmly to the keel and we now launched our boat with the satisfaction of knowing that when the false keel should be scraped off we could easily put on anotherwhereas should the real keel have been scraped away we could not have renewed it without taking our boat to pieces which peterkin said made his marrow quake to think upon  the mast and sail answered excellently and we now sailed about in the lagoon with great delight and examined with much interest the appearance of our island from a distance  also we gazed into the depths of the water and watched for hours the gambols of the curious and brightcoloured fish among the corals and seaweed  peterkin also made a fishingline and jack constructed a number of hooks some of which were very good others remarkably bad  some of these hooks were made of ironwoodwhich did pretty well the wood being extremely hardand jack made them very thick and large  fish there are not particular  some of the crooked bones in fishheads also answered for this purpose pretty well  but that which formed our best and most serviceable hook was the brass fingerring belonging to jack  it gave him not a little trouble to manufacture it  first he cut it with the axe then twisted it into the form of a hook  the barb took him several hours to cut  he did it by means of constant sawing with the broken penknife  as for the point an hours rubbing on a piece of sandstone made an excellent one  it would be a matter of much time and labour to describe the appearance of the multitudes of fish that were day after day drawn into our boat by means of the brass hook  peterkin always caught themfor we observed that he derived much pleasure from fishingwhile jack and i found ample amusement in looking on also in gazing down at the coral groves and in baiting the hook  among the fish that we saw but did not catch were porpoises and swordfish whales and sharks  the porpoises came frequently into our lagoon in shoals and amused us not a little by their bold leaps into the air and their playful gambols in the sea  the swordfish were wonderful creaturessome of them apparently ten feet in length with an ivory spear six or eight feet long projecting from their noses  we often saw them darting after other fish and no doubt they sometimes killed them with their ivory swords  jack remembered having heard once of a swordfish attacking a ship which seemed strange indeed but as they are often in the habit of attacking whales perhaps it mistook the ship for one  this swordfish ran against the vessel with such force that it drove its sword quite through the thick planks and when the ship arrived in harbour long afterwards the sword was found still sticking in it  sharks did not often appear but we took care never again to bathe in deep water without leaving one of our number in the boat to give us warning if he should see a shark approaching  as for the whales they never came into our lagoon but we frequently saw them spouting in the deep water beyond the reef  i shall never forget my surprise the first day i saw one of these huge monsters close to me  we had been rambling about on the reef during the morning and were about to reembark in our little boat to return home when a loud blowing sound caused us to wheel rapidly round  we were just in time to see a shower of spray falling and the flukes or tail of some monstrous fish disappear in the sea a few hundred yards off  we waited some time to see if he would rise again as we stood the sea seemed to open up at our very feet an immense spout of water was sent with a snort high into the air and the huge blunt head of a spermwhale rose before us  it was so large that it could easily have taken our little boat along with ourselves into its mouth  it plunged slowly back into the sea like a large ship foundering and struck the water with its tail so forcibly as to cause a sound like a cannonshot  we also saw a great number of flyingfish although we caught none and we noticed that they never flew out of the water except when followed by their bitter foe the dolphin from whom they thus endeavoured to escape but of all the fish that we saw none surprised us so much as those that we used to find in shallow pools after a shower of rain and this not on account of their appearance for they were ordinarylooking and very small but on account of their having descended in a shower of rain  we could account for them in no other way because the pools in which we found these fish were quite dry before the shower and at some distance above highwater mark  jack however suggested a cause which seemed to me very probable  we used often to see waterspouts in the sea  a waterspout is a whirling body of water which rises from the sea like a sharppointed pillar  after rising a good way it is met by a long tongue which comes down from the clouds and when the two have joined they look something like an hourglass  the waterspout is then carried by the windsometimes gently sometimes with violenceover the sea sometimes up into the clouds and then bursting asunder it descends in a deluge  this often happens over the land as well as over the sea and it sometimes does much damage but frequently it passes gently away  now jack thought that the little fish might perhaps have been carried up in a waterspout and so sent down again in a shower of rain  but we could not be certain as to this point yet we thought it likely  during these delightful fishing and boating excursions we caught a good many eels which we found to be very good to eat  we also found turtles among the coral rocks and made excellent soup in our iron kettle moreover we discovered many shrimps and prawns so that we had no lack of variety in our food and indeed we never passed a week without making some new and interesting discovery of some sort or other either on the land or in the sea    chapter seventeen  a monster wave and its consequencesthe boat lost and foundpeterkins terrible accidentsupplies of food for a voyage in the boatwe visit penguin island and are amazed beyond measureaccount of the penguins  one day not long after our little boat was finished we were sitting on the rocks at spouting cliff and talking of an excursion which we intended to make to penguin island the next day  you see said peterkin it might be all very well for a stupid fellow like me to remain here and leave the penguins alone but it would be quite inconsistent with your characters as philosophers to remain any longer in ignorance of the habits and customs of these birds so the sooner we go the better  very true said i  there is nothing i desire so much as to have a closer inspection of them  and i think said jack that you had better remain at home peterkin to take care of the cat for im sure the hogs will be at it in your absence out of revenge for your killing their greatgrandmother so recklessly  stay at home cried peterkin  my dear fellow you would certainly lose your way or get upset if i were not there to take care of you  ah true said jack gravely that did not occur to me  no doubt you must go  our boat does require a good deal of ballast and all that you say peterkin carries so much weight with it that we wont need stones if you go  now while my companions were talking a notable event occurred which as it is not generally known i shall be particular in recording here  while we were talking as i have said we noticed a dark line like a low cloud or fogbank on the seaward horizon  the day was a fine one though cloudy and a gentle breeze was blowing but the sea was not rougher or the breaker on the reef higher than usual  at first we thought that this looked like a thundercloud and as we had had a good deal of broken weather of late accompanied by occasional peals of thunder we supposed that a storm must be approaching  gradually however this line seemed to draw nearer without spreading up over the sky as would certainly have been the case if it had been a stormcloud still nearer it came and soon we saw that it was moving swiftly towards the island but there was no sound till it reached the islands out at sea  as it passed these islands we observed with no little anxiety that a cloud of white foam encircled them and burst in spray into the air it was accompanied by a loud roar  this led us to conjecture that the approaching object was an enormous wave of the sea but we had no idea how large it was till it came near to ourselves when it approached the outer reef however we were awestruck with its unusual magnitude and we sprang to our feet and clambered hastily up to the highest point of the precipice under an indefinable feeling of fear  i have said before that the reef opposite spouting cliff was very near to the shore while just in front of the bower it was at a considerable distance out to sea  owing to this formation the wave reached the reef at the latter point before it struck at the foot of spouting cliff  the instant it touched the reef we became aware for the first time of its awful magnitude  it burst completely over the reef at all points with a roar that seemed louder to me than thunder and this roar continued for some seconds while the wave rolled gradually along towards the cliff on which we stood  as its crest reared before us we felt that we were in great danger and turned to flee but we were too late  with a crash that seemed to shake the solid rock the gigantic billow fell and instantly the spoutingholes sent up a gush of waterspouts with such force that they shrieked on issuing from their narrow vents  it seemed to us as if the earth had been blown up with water  we were stunned and confused by the shock and so drenched and blinded with spray that we knew not for a few moments whither to flee for shelter  at length we all three gained an eminence beyond the reach of the water  but what a scene of devastation met our gaze as we looked along the shore  this enormous wave not only burst over the reef but continued its way across the lagoon and fell on the sandy beach of the island with such force that it passed completely over it and dashed into the woods levelling the smaller trees and bushes in its headlong course  on seeing this jack said he feared our bower must have been swept away and that the boat which was on the beach must have been utterly destroyed  our hearts sank within us as we thought of this and we hastened round through the woods towards our home  on reaching it we found to our great relief of mind that the force of the wave had been expended just before reaching the bower but the entrance to it was almost blocked up by the tornup bushes and tangled heaps of seaweed having satisfied ourselves as to the bower we hurried to the spot where the boat had been left but no boat was there  the spot on which it had stood was vacant and no sign of it could we see on looking around us  it may have been washed up into the woods said jack hurrying up the beach as he spoke  still no boat was to be seen and we were about to give ourselves over to despair when peterkin called to jack and said  jack my friend you were once so exceedingly sagacious and wise as to make me acquainted with the fact that cocoanuts grow upon trees  will you now be so good as to inform me what sort of fruit that is growing on the top of yonder bush for i confess to being ignorant or at least doubtful on the point  we looked towards the bush indicated and there to our surprise beheld our little boat snugly nestled among the leaves  we were very much overjoyed at this for we would have suffered any loss rather than the loss of our boat  we found that the wave had actually borne the boat on its crest from the beach into the woods and there launched it into the heart of this bush which was extremely fortunate for had it been tossed against a rock or a tree it would have been dashed to pieces whereas it had not received the smallest injury  it was no easy matter however to get it out of the bush and down to the sea again  this cost us two days of hard labour to accomplish  we had also much ado to clear away the rubbish from before the bower and spent nearly a week in constant labour ere we got the neighbourhood to look as clean and orderly as before for the uprooted bushes and seaweed that lay on the beach formed a more dreadfully confusedlooking mass than one who had not seen the place after the inundation could conceive  before leaving the subject i may mention for the sake of those who interest themselves in the curious natural phenomena of our world that this gigantic wave occurs regularly on some of the islands of the pacific once and sometimes twice in the year  i heard this stated by the missionaries during my career in those seas  they could not tell me whether it visited all of the islands but i was certainly assured that it occurred periodically in some of them  after we had got our home put to rights and cleared of the debris of the inundation we again turned our thoughts to paying the penguins a visit  the boat was therefore overhauled and a few repairs done  then we prepared a supply of provisions for we intended to be absent at least a night or twoperhaps longer  this took us some time to do for while jack was busy with the boat peterkin was sent into the woods to spear a hog or two and had to search long sometimes ere he found them  peterkin was usually sent on this errand when we wanted a pork chop which was not seldom because he was so active and could run so wonderfully fast that he found no difficulty in overtaking the hogs but being dreadfully reckless he almost invariably tumbled over stumps and stones in the course of his wild chase and seldom returned home without having knocked the skin off his shins  once indeed a more serious accident happened to him  he had been out all the morning alone and did not return at the usual time to dinner  we wondered at this for peterkin was always very punctual at the dinnerhour  as suppertime drew near we began to be anxious about him and at length sallied forth to search the woods  for a long time we sought in vain but a little before dark we came upon the tracks of the hogs which we followed up until we came to the brow of a rather steep bank or precipice  looking over this we beheld peterkin lying in a state of insensibility at the foot with his cheek resting on the snout of a little pig which was pinned to the earth by the spear  we were dreadfully alarmed but hastened to bathe his forehead with water and had soon the satisfaction of seeing him revive  after we had carried him home he related to us how the thing had happened  you must know said he i walked about all the forenoon till i was as tired as an old donkey without seeing a single grunternot so much as a track of one but as i was determined not to return emptyhanded i resolved to go without my dinner and  what exclaimed jack did you really resolve to do that  now jack hold your tongue returned peterkin  i say that i resolved to forego my dinner and to push to the head of the small valley where i felt pretty sure of discovering the hogs  i soon found that i was on the right scent for i had scarcely walked halfamile in the direction of the small plumtree we found there the other day when a squeak fell on my ear  ho ho said i there you go my boys and i hurried up the glen  i soon started them and singling out a fat pig ran tilt at him  in a few seconds i was up with him and stuck my spear right through his dumpy body  just as i did so i saw that we were on the edge of a precipicewhether high or low i knew not but i had been running at such a pace that i could not stop so the pig and i gave a howl in concert and went plunging over together  i remembered nothing more after that till i came to my senses and found you bathing my temples and ralph wringing his hands over me  but although peterkin was often unfortunate in the way of getting tumbles he was successful on the present occasion in hunting and returned before evening with three very nice little hogs  i also was successful in my visit to the mudflats where i killed several ducks so that when we launched and loaded our boat at sunrise the following morning we found our store of provisions to be more than sufficient part had been cooked the night before and on taking note of the different items we found the account to stand thus    10 breadfruits two baked eight unbaked   20 yams six roasted the rest raw   6 taroroots   50 fine large plums   6 cocoanuts ripe   6 ditto green for drinking   4 large ducks and two small ones raw   3 cold roast pigs with stuffing  i may here remark that the stuffing had been devised by peterkin specially for the occasion  he kept the manner of its compounding a profound secret so i cannot tell what it was but i can say with much confidence that we found it to be atrociously bad and after the first tasting scraped it carefully out and threw it overboard  we calculated that this supply would last us for several days but we afterwards found that it was much more than we required especially in regard to the cocoanuts of which we found large supplies wherever we went  however as peterkin remarked it was better to have too much than too little as we knew not to what straits we might be put during our voyage  it was a very calm sunny morning when we launched forth and rowed over the lagoon towards the outlet in the reef and passed between the two green islets that guarded the entrance  we experienced some difficulty and no little danger in passing the surf of the breaker and shipped a good deal of water in the attempt but once past the billow we found ourselves floating placidly on the long oily swell that rose and fell slowly as it rolled over the wide ocean  penguin island lay on the other side of our own island at about a mile beyond the outer reef and we calculated that it must be at least twenty miles distant by the way we should have to go  we might indeed have shortened the way by coasting round our island inside of the lagoon and going out at the passage in the reef nearly opposite to penguin island but we preferred to go by the open seafirst because it was more adventurous and secondly because we should have the pleasure of again feeling the motion of the deep which we all loved very much not being liable to seasickness  i wish we had a breeze said jack  so do i cried peterkin resting on his oar and wiping his heated brow pulling is hard work  oh dear if we could only catch a hundred or two of these gulls tie them to the boat with long strings and make them fly as we want them how capital it would be  or bore a hole through a sharks tail and reeve a rope through it eh remarked jack  but i say it seems that my wish is going to be granted for here comes a breeze  ship your oar peterkinup with the mast ralph ill see to the sail  mind your helm look out for squalls  this last speech was caused by the sudden appearance of a darkblue line on the horizon which in an incredibly short space of time swept down on us lashing up the sea in white foam as it went  we presented the stern of the boat to its first violence and in a few seconds it moderated into a steady breeze to which we spread our sail and flew merrily over the waves  although the breeze died away soon afterwards it had been so stiff while it lasted that we were carried over the greater part of our way before it fell calm again so that when the flapping of the sail against the mast told us that it was time to resume the oars we were not much more than a mile from penguin island  there go the soldiers cried peterkin as we came in sight of it  how spruce their white trousers look this morning  i wonder if they will receive us kindlydyou think they are hospitable jack  dont talk peterkin but pull away and you shall see shortly  as we drew near to the island we were much amused by the manoeuvres and appearance of these strange birds  they seemed to be of different species for some had crests on their heads while others had none and while some were about the size of a goose others appeared nearly as large as a swan  we also saw a huge albatross soaring above the heads of the penguins  it was followed and surrounded by numerous flocks of seagulls  having approached to within a few yards of the island which was a low rock with no other vegetation on it than a few bushes we lay on our oars and gazed at the birds with surprise and pleasure they returning our gaze with interest  we now saw that their soldierlike appearance was owing to the stiff erect manner in which they sat on their short legsboltupright as peterkin expressed it  they had black heads long sharp beaks white breasts and bluish backs  their wings were so short that they looked more like the fins of a fish and indeed we soon saw that they used them for the purpose of swimming under water  there were no quills on these wings but a sort of scaly feathers which also thickly covered their bodies  their legs were short and placed so far back that the birds while on land were obliged to stand quite upright in order to keep their balance but in the water they floated like other waterfowl  at first we were so stunned with the clamour which they and other seabirds kept up around us that we knew not which way to look for they covered the rocks in thousands but as we continued to gaze we observed several quadrupeds as we thought walking in the midst of the penguins  pull in a bit cried peterkin and lets see what these are  they must be fond of noisy company to consort with such creatures  to our surprise we found that these were no other than penguins which had gone down on all fours and were crawling among the bushes on their feet and wings just like quadrupeds  suddenly one big old bird that had been sitting on a point very near to us gazing in mute astonishment became alarmed and scuttling down the rocks plumped or fell rather than ran into the sea  it dived in a moment and a few seconds afterwards came out of the water far ahead with such a spring and such a dive back into the sea again that we could scarcely believe it was not a fish that had leaped in sport  that beats everything said peterkin rubbing his nose and screwing up his face with an expression of exasperated amazement  ive heard of a thing being neither fish flesh nor fowl but i never did expect to live to see a brute that was all three togetherat oncein one  but look there he continued pointing with a look of resignation to the shorelook there theres no end to it  what has that brute got under its tail  we turned to look in the direction pointed out and there saw a penguin walking slowly and very sedately along the shore with an egg under its tail  there were several others we observed burdened in the same way and we found afterwards that these were a species of penguin that always carried their eggs so  indeed they had a most convenient cavity for the purpose just between the tail and the legs  we were very much impressed with the regularity and order of this colony  the island seemed to be apportioned out into squares of which each penguin possessed one and sat in stiff solemnity in the middle of it or took a slow march up and down the spaces between  some were hatching their eggs but others were feeding their young ones in a manner that caused us to laugh not a little  the mother stood on a mound or raised rock while the young one stood patiently below her on the ground  suddenly the mother raised her head and uttered a series of the most discordant cackling sounds  shes going to choke cried peterkin  but this was not the case although i confess she looked like it  in a few seconds she put down her head and opened her mouth into which the young one thrust its beak and seemed to suck something from her throat then the cackling was renewed the sucking continued and so the operation of feeding was carried on till the young one was satisfied but what she fed her little one with we could not tell  now just look yonder said peterkin in an excited tone  if that isnt the most abominable piece of maternal deception i ever saw  that rascally old lady penguin has just pitched her young one into the sea and theres another about to follow her example  this indeed seemed to be the case for on the top of a steep rock close to the edge of the sea we observed an old penguin endeavouring to entice her young one into the water but the young one seemed very unwilling to go and notwithstanding the enticements of its mother moved very slowly towards her  at last she went gently behind the young bird and pushed it a little towards the water but with great tenderness as much as to say dont be afraid darling i wont hurt you my pet  but no sooner did she get it to the edge of the rock where it stood looking pensively down at the sea than she gave it a sudden and violent push sending it headlong down the slope into the water where its mother left it to scramble ashore as it best could  we observed many of them employed in doing this and we came to the conclusion that this is the way in which old penguins teach their children to swim  scarcely had we finished making our remarks on this when we were startled by about a dozen of the old birds hopping in the most clumsy and ludicrous manner towards the sea  the beach here was a sloping rock and when they came to it some of them succeeded in hopping down in safety but others lost their balance and rolled and scrambled down the slope in the most helpless manner  the instant they reached the water however they seemed to be in their proper element  they dived and bounded out of it and into it again with the utmost agility and so diving and bounding and sputteringfor they could not flythey went rapidly out to sea  on seeing this peterkin turned with a grave face to us and said its my opinion that these birds are all stark staring mad and that this is an enchanted island  i therefore propose that we should either put about ship and fly in terror from the spot or land valorously on the island and sell our lives as dearly as we can  i vote for landing so pull in lads said jack giving a stroke with his oar that made the boat spin  in a few seconds we ran the boat into a little creek where we made her fast to a projecting piece of coral and running up the beach entered the ranks of the penguins armed with our cudgels and our spear  we were greatly surprised to find that instead of attacking us or showing signs of fear at our approach these curious birds did not move from their places until we laid hands on them and merely turned their eyes on us in solemn stupid wonder as we passed  there was one old penguin however that began to walk slowly towards the sea and peterkin took it into his head that he would try to interrupt its progress so he ran between it and the sea and brandished his cudgel in its face  but this proved to be a resolute old bird  it would not retreat nay more it would not cease to advance but battled with peterkin bravely and drove him before it until it reached the sea had peterkin used his club he could easily have felled it no doubt but as he had no wish to do so cruel an act merely out of sport he let the bird escape  we spent fully three hours on this island in watching the habit of these curious birds but when we finally left them we all three concluded after much consultation that they were the most wonderful creatures we had ever seen and further we thought it probable that they were the most wonderful creatures in the world    chapter eighteen  an awful storm and its consequencesnarrow escapea rock proves a sure foundationa fearful night and a bright morningdeliverance from danger  it was evening before we left the island of the penguins  as we had made up our minds to encamp for the night on a small island whereon grew a few cocoanut trees which was about two miles off we layto our oars with some energy  but a danger was in store for us which we had not anticipated  the wind which had carried us so quickly to penguin island freshened as evening drew on to a stiff breeze and before we had made half the distance to the small island it became a regular gale  although it was not so directly against us as to prevent our rowing in the course we wished to go yet it checked us very much and although the force of the sea was somewhat broken by the island the waves soon began to rise and to roll their broken crests against our small craft so that she began to take in water and we had much ado to keep ourselves afloat  at last the wind and sea together became so violent that we found it impossible to make the island so jack suddenly put the head of the boat round and ordered peterkin and me to hoist a corner of the sail intending to run back to penguin island  we shall at least have the shelter of the bushes he said as the boat flew before the wind and the penguins will keep us company  as jack spoke the wind suddenly shifted and blew so much against us that we were forced to hoist more of the sail in order to beat up for the island being by this change thrown much to leeward of it  what made matters worse was that the gale came in squalls so that we were more than once nearly upset  stand by both of you cried jack in a quick earnest tone  be ready to deuce the sail  i very much fear we wont make the island after all  peterkin and i were so much in the habit of trusting everything to jack that we had fallen into the way of not considering things especially such things as were under jacks care  we had therefore never doubted for a moment that all was going well so that it was with no little anxiety that we heard him make the above remark  however we had no time for question or surmise for at the moment he spoke a heavy squall was bearing down upon us and as we were then flying with our lee gunwale dipping occasionally under the waves it was evident that we should have to lower our sail altogether  in a few seconds the squall struck the boat but peterkin and i had the sail down in a moment so that it did not upset us  but when it was past we were more than halffull of water  this i soon bailed out while peterkin again hoisted a corner of the sail  but the evil which jack had feared came upon us  we found it quite impossible to make penguin island  the gale carried us quickly past it towards the open sea and the terrible truth flashed upon us that we should be swept out and left to perish miserably in a small boat in the midst of the wide ocean  this idea was forced very strongly upon us because we saw nothing in the direction whither the wind was blowing us save the raging billows of the sea and indeed we trembled as we gazed around us for we were now beyond the shelter of the islands and it seemed as though any of the huge billows which curled over in masses of foam might swallow us up in a moment  the water also began to wash in over our sides and i had to keep constantly bailing for jack could not quit the helm nor peterkin the sail for an instant without endangering our lives  in the midst of this distress jack uttered an exclamation of hope and pointed towards a low island or rock which lay directly ahead  it had been hitherto unobserved owing to the dark clouds that obscured the sky and the blinding spray that seemed to fill the whole atmosphere  as we neared this rock we observed that it was quite destitute of trees and verdure and so low that the sea broke completely over it  in fact it was nothing more than the summit of one of the coral formations which rose only a few feet above the level of the water and was in stormy weather all but invisible  over this island the waves were breaking in the utmost fury and our hearts sank within us as we saw that there was not a spot where we could thrust our little boat without its being dashed to pieces  show a little bit more sail cried jack as we swept past the weather side of the rock with fearful speed  ay ay answered peterkin hoisting about a foot more of our sail  little though the addition was it caused the boat to lie over and creak so loudly as we cleft the foaming waves that i expected to be upset every instant and i blamed jack in my heart for his rashness  but i did him injustice for although during two seconds the water rushed inboard in a torrent he succeeded in steering us sharply round to the leeward side of the rock where the water was comparatively calm and the force of the breeze broken  out your oars now lads  thats well done  give way  we obeyed instantly  the oars splashed into the waves together  one good hearty pull and we were floating in a comparatively calm creek that was so narrow as to be barely able to admit our boat  here we were in perfect safety and as we leaped on shore and fastened our cable to the rocks i thanked god in my heart for our deliverance from so great danger  but although i have said we were now in safety i suspect that few of my readers would have envied our position  it is true we had no lack of food but we were drenched to the skin the sea was foaming round us and the spray flying over our heads so that we were completely enveloped as it were in water the spot on which we had landed was not more than twelve yards in diameter and from this spot we could not move without the risk of being swept away by the storm  at the upper end of the creek was a small hollow or cave in the rock which sheltered us from the fury of the winds and waves and as the rock extended in a sort of ledge over our heads it prevented the spray from falling upon us  why said peterkin beginning to feel cheery again it seems to me that we have got into a mermaids cave for there is nothing but water all round us and as for earth and sky they are things of the past  peterkins idea was not inappropriate for what with the sea roaring in white foam up to our very feet and the spray flying in white sheets continually over our heads and the water dripping heavily from the ledge above like a curtain in front of our cave it did seem to us very much more like being below than above water  now boys cried jack bestir yourselves and lets make ourselves comfortabletoss out our provisions peterkin and here ralph lend a hand to haul up the boat  look sharp  ay ay captain we cried as we hastened to obey much cheered by the hearty manner of our comrade  fortunately the cave although not very deep was quite dry so that we succeeded in making ourselves much more comfortable than could have been expected  we landed our provisions wrung the water out of our garments spread our sail below us for a carpet and after having eaten a hearty meal began to feel quite cheerful  but as night drew on our spirits sank again for with the daylight all evidence of our security vanished away  we could no longer see the firm rock on which we lay while we were stunned with the violence of the tempest that raged around us  the night grew pitchy dark as it advanced so that we could not see our hands when we held them up before our eyes and were obliged to feel each other occasionally to make sure that we were safe for the storm at last became so terrible that it was difficult to make our voices audible  a slight variation of the wind as we supposed caused a few drops of spray ever and anon to blow into our faces and the eddy of the sea in its mad boiling washed up into our little creek until it reached our feet and threatened to tear away our boat  in order to prevent this latter calamity we hauled the boat farther up and held the cable in our hands  occasional flashes of lightning shone with a ghastly glare through the watery curtains around us and lent additional horror to the scene  yet we longed for those dismal flashes for they were less appalling than the thick blackness that succeeded them crashing peals of thunder seemed to tear the skies in twain and fell upon our ears through the wild yelling of the hurricane as if it had been but a gentle summer breeze while the billows burst upon the weather side of the island until we fancied that the solid rock was giving way and in our agony we clung to the bare ground expecting every moment to be whirled away and whelmed in the black howling sea oh it was a night of terrible anxiety and no one can conceive the feelings of intense gratitude and relief with which we at last saw the dawn of day break through the vapoury mists around us  for three days and three nights we remained on this rock while the storm continued to rage with unabated fury  on the morning of the fourth day it suddenly ceased and the wind fell altogether but the waves still ran so high that we did not dare to put off in our boat during the greater part of this period we scarcely slept above a few minutes at a time but on the third night we slept soundly and awoke early on the fourth morning to find the sea very much down and the sun shining brightly again in the clear blue sky  it was with light hearts that we launched forth once more in our little boat and steered away for our island home which we were overjoyed to find was quite visible on the horizon for we had feared that we had been blown out of sight of it altogether  as it was a dead calm we had to row during the greater part of the day but towards the afternoon a fair breeze sprang up which enabled us to hoist our sail  we soon passed penguin island and the other island which we had failed to reach on the day the storm commenced but as we had still enough of provisions and were anxious to get home we did not landto the great disappointment of peterkin who seemed to entertain quite an affection for the penguins  although the breeze was pretty fresh for several hours we did not reach the outer reef of our island till nightfall and before we had sailed more than a hundred yards into the lagoon the wind died away altogether so that we had to take to our oars again  it was late and the moon and stars were shining brightly when we arrived opposite the bower and leaped upon the strand  so glad were we to be safe back again on our beloved island that we scarcely took time to drag the boat a short way up the beach and then ran up to see that all was right at the bower  i must confess however that my joy was mingled with a vague sort of fear lest our home had been visited and destroyed during our absence but on reaching it we found everything just as it had been left and the poor black cat curled up sound asleep on the coral table in front of our humble dwelling    chapter nineteen  shoemakingthe even tenor of our way suddenly interruptedan unexpected visit and an appalling battlewe all become warriors and jack proves himself to be a hero  for many months after this we continued to live on our island in uninterrupted harmony and happiness  sometimes we went out afishing in the lagoon and sometimes went ahunting in the woods or ascended to the mountaintop by way of variety although peterkin always asserted that we went for the purpose of hailing any ship that might chance to heave in sight  but i am certain that none of us wished to be delivered from our captivity for we were extremely happy and peterkin used to say that as we were very young we should not feel the loss of a year or two  peterkin as i have said before was thirteen years of age jack eighteen and i fifteen  but jack was very tall strong and manly for his age and might easily have been mistaken for twenty  the climate was so beautiful that it seemed to be a perpetual summer and as many of the fruittrees continued to bear fruit and blossom all the year round we never wanted for a plentiful supply of food  the hogs too seemed rather to increase than diminish although peterkin was very frequent in his attacks on them with his spear  if at any time we failed in finding a drove we had only to pay a visit to the plumtree before mentioned where we always found a large family of them asleep under its branches  we employed ourselves very busily during this time in making various garments of cocoanut cloth as those with which we had landed were beginning to be very ragged  peterkin also succeeded in making excellent shoes out of the skin of the old hog in the following manner he first cut a piece of the hide of an oblong form a few inches longer than his foot  this he soaked in water and while it was wet he sewed up one end of it so as to form a rough imitation of that part of the heel of a shoe where the seam is  this done he bored a row of holes all round the edge of the piece of skin through which a tough line was passed  into the sewedup part of this shoe he thrust his heel then drawing the string tight the edges rose up and overlapped his foot all round  it is true there were a great many illlooking puckers in these shoes but we found them very serviceable notwithstanding and jack came at last to prefer them to his long boots  we also made various other useful articles which added to our comfort and once or twice spoke of building us a house but we had so great an affection for the bower and withal found it so serviceable that we determined not to leave it nor to attempt the building of a house which in such a climate might turn out to be rather disagreeable than useful  we often examined the pistol that we had found in the house on the other side of the island and peterkin wished much that we had powder and shot as it would render pigkilling much easier but after all we had become so expert in the use of our sling and bow and spear that we were independent of more deadly weapons  diving in the water garden also continued to afford us as much pleasure as ever and peterkin began to be a little more expert in the water from constant practice  as for jack and me we began to feel as if water were our native element and revelled in it with so much confidence and comfort that peterkin said he feared we would turn into fish some day and swim off and leave him adding that he had been for a long time observing that jack was becoming more and more like a shark every day whereupon jack remarked that if he peterkin were changed into a fish he would certainly turn into nothing better or bigger than a shrimp poor peterkin did not envy us our delightful excursions under water except indeed when jack would dive down to the bottom of the water garden sit down on a rock and look up and make faces at him  peterkin did feel envious then and often said he would give anything to be able to do that  i was much amused when peterkin said this for if he could only have seen his own face when he happened to take a short dive he would have seen that jacks was far surpassed by itthe great difference being however that jack made faces on purpose peterkin couldnt help it  now while we were engaged with these occupations and amusements an event occurred one day which was as unexpected as it was exceedingly alarming and very horrible  jack and i were sitting as we were often wont to do on the rocks at spouting cliff and peterkin was wringing the water from his garments having recently fallen by accident into the seaa thing he was constantly doingwhen our attention was suddenly arrested by two objects which appeared on the horizon  what are yon think you  i said addressing jack  i cant imagine answered he  ive noticed them for some time and fancied they were black seagulls but the more i look at them the more i feel convinced they are much larger than gulls  they seem to be coming towards us said i  hallo whats wrong inquired peterkin coming up  look there said jack  whales cried peterkin shading his eyes with his hand  noehcan they be boats jack  our hearts beat with excitement at the very thought of seeing human faces again  i think you are about right peterkin  but they seem to me to move strangely for boats said jack in a low tone as if he were talking to himself  i noticed that a shade of anxiety crossed jacks countenance as he gazed long and intently at the two objects which were now nearing us fast at last he sprang to his feet  they are canoes ralph whether warcanoes or not i cannot tell but this i knowthat all the natives of the south sea islands are fierce cannibals and they have little respect for strangers  we must hide if they land here which i earnestly hope they will not do  i was greatly alarmed at jacks speech but i confess i thought less of what he said than of the earnest anxious manner in which he said it and it was with very uncomfortable feelings that peterkin and i followed him quickly into the woods  how unfortunate said i as we gained the shelter of the bushes that we have forgotten our arms  it matters not said jack here are clubs enough and to spare  as he spoke he laid his hand on a bundle of stout poles of various sizes which peterkins everbusy hands had formed during our frequent visits to the cliff for no other purpose apparently than that of having something to do  we each selected a stout club according to our several tastes and lay down behind a rock whence we could see the canoes approach without ourselves being seen  at first we made an occasional remark on their appearance but after they entered the lagoon and drew near the beach we ceased to speak and gazed with intense interest at the scene before us  we now observed that the foremost canoe was being chased by the other and that it contained a few women and children as well as menperhaps forty souls altogetherwhile the canoe which pursued it contained only men  they seemed to be about the same in number but were better armed and had the appearance of being a warparty  both crews were paddling with all their might and it seemed as if the pursuers exerted themselves to overtake the fugitives ere they could land  in this however they failed  the foremost canoe made for the beach close beneath the rocks behind which we were concealed  their short paddles flashed like meteors in the water and sent up a constant shower of spray  the foam curled from the prow and the eyes of the rowers glistened in their black faces as they strained every muscle of their naked bodies  nor did they relax their efforts till the canoe struck the beach with a violent shock then with a shout of defiance the whole party sprang as if by magic from the canoe to the shore  three women two of whom carried infants in their arms rushed into the woods and the men crowded to the waters edge with stones in their hands spears levelled and clubs brandished to resist the landing of their enemies  the distance between the two canoes had been about halfamile and at the great speed they were going this was soon passed  as the pursuers neared the shore no sign of fear or hesitation was noticeable  on they came like a wild chargerreceived but recked not of a shower of stones  the canoe struck and with a yell that seemed to issue from the throats of incarnate fiends they leaped into the water and drove their enemies up the beach  the battle that immediately ensued was frightful to behold  most of the men wielded clubs of enormous size and curious shapes with which they dashed out each others brains  as they were almost entirely naked and had to bound stoop leap and run in their terrible handtohand encounters they looked more like demons than human beings  i felt my heart grow sick at the sight of this bloody battle and would fain have turned away but a species of fascination seemed to hold me down and glue my eyes upon the combatants  i observed that the attacking party was led by a most extraordinary being who from his size and peculiarity i concluded was a chief  his hair was frizzed out to an enormous extent so that it resembled a large turban  it was of a lightyellow hue which surprised me much for the mans body was as black as coal and i felt convinced that the hair must have been dyed he was tattooed from head to foot and his face besides being tattooed was besmeared with red paint and streaked with white  altogether with his yellow turbanlike hair his herculean black frame his glittering eyes and white teeth he seemed the most terrible monster i ever beheld  he was very active in the fight and had already killed four men  suddenly the yellowhaired chief was attacked by a man quite as strong and large as himself  he flourished a heavy club something like an eagles beak at the point  for a second or two these giants eyed each other warily moving round and round as if to catch each other at a disadvantage but seeing that nothing was to be gained by this caution and that the loss of time might effectually turn the tide of battle either way they apparently made up their minds to attack at the same instant for with a wild shout and simultaneous spring they swung their heavy clubs which met with a loud report  suddenly the yellowhaired savage tripped his enemy sprang forward the ponderous club was swung but it did not descend for at that moment the savage was felled to the ground by a stone from the hand of one who had witnessed his chiefs danger  this was the turningpoint in the battle the savages who landed first turned and fled towards the bush on seeing the fall of their chief  but not one escaped they were all overtaken and felled to the earth  i saw however that they were not all killed indeed their enemies now that they were conquered seemed anxious to take them alive and they succeeded in securing fifteen whom they bound hand and foot with cords and carrying them up into the woods laid them down among the bushes  here they left them for what purpose i knew not and returned to the scene of the late battle where the remnant of the party were bathing their wounds  out of the forty blacks that composed the attacking party only twentyeight remained alive two of whom were sent into the bush to hunt for the women and children  of the other party as i have said only fifteen survived and these were lying bound and helpless on the grass  jack and peterkin and i now looked at each other and whispered our fears that the savages might clamber up the rocks to search for fresh water and so discover our place of concealment but we were so much interested in watching their movements that we agreed to remain where we wereand indeed we could not easily have risen without exposing ourselves to detection  one of the savages now went up to the woods and soon returned with a bundle of firewood and we were not a little surprised to see him set fire to it by the very same means used by jack the time we made our first firenamely with the bow and drill  when the fire was kindled two of the party went again to the woods and returned with one of the bound men  a dreadful feeling of horror crept over my heart as the thought flashed upon me that they were going to burn their enemies  as they bore him to the fire my feelings almost overpowered me  i gasped for breath and seizing my club endeavoured to spring to my feet but jacks powerful arm pinned me to the earth next moment one of the savages raised his club and fractured the wretched creatures skull  he must have died instantly and strange though it may seem i confess to a feeling of relief when the deed was done because i now knew that the poor savage could not be burned alive scarcely had his limbs ceased to quiver when the monsters cut slices of flesh from his body and after roasting them slightly over the fire devoured them  suddenly there arose a cry from the woods and in a few seconds the two savages hastened towards the fire dragging the three women and their two infants along with them  one of these women was much younger than her companions and we were struck with the modesty of her demeanour and the gentle expression of her face which although she had the flattish nose and thick lips of the others was of a lightbrown colour and we conjectured that she must be of a different race  she and her companions wore short petticoats and a kind of tippet on their shoulders  their hair was jet black but instead of being long was short and curlythough not woollysomewhat like the hair of a young boy  while we gazed with interest and some anxiety at these poor creatures the big chief advanced to one of the elder females and laid his hand upon the child  but the mother shrank from him and clasping the little one to her bosom uttered a wail of fear  with a savage laugh the chief tore the child from her arms and tossed it into the sea  a low groan burst from jacks lips as he witnessed this atrocious act and heard the mothers shriek as she fell insensible on the sand the rippling waves rolled the child on the beach as if they refused to be a party in such a foul murder and we could observe that the little one still lived  the young girl was now brought forward and the chief addressed her but although we heard his voice and even the words distinctly of course we could not understand what he said  the girl made no answer to his fierce questions and we saw by the way in which he pointed to the fire that he threatened her life  peterkin said jack in a hoarse whisper have you got your knife  yes replied peterkin whose face was pale as death  that will do  listen to me and do my bidding quickhere is the small knife ralph  fly both of you through the bush cut the cords that bind the prisoners and set them free  there quick ere it be too late  jack sprang up and seized a heavy but short bludgeon while his strong frame trembled with emotion and large drops rolled down his forehead  at this moment the man who had butchered the savage a few minutes before advanced towards the girl with his heavy club  jack uttered a yell that rang like a deathshriek among the rocks  with one bound he leaped over a precipice full fifteen feet high and before the savages had recovered from their surprise was in the midst of them while peterkin and i dashed through the bushes towards the prisoners  with one blow of his staff jack felled the man with the club then turning round with a look of fury he rushed upon the big chief with the yellow hair  had the blow which jack aimed at his head taken effect the huge savage would have needed no second stroke but he was agile as a cat and avoided it by springing to one side while at the same time he swung his ponderous club at the head of his foe  it was now jacks turn to leap aside and well was it for him that the first outburst of his blind fury was over else he had become an easy prey to his gigantic antagonist  but jack was cool now  he darted his blows rapidly and well and the superiority of his light weapon was strikingly proved in this combat for while he could easily evade the blows of the chiefs heavy club the chief could not so easily evade those of his light one  nevertheless so quick was he and so frightfully did he fling about the mighty weapon that although jack struck him almost every blow the strokes had to be delivered so quickly that they wanted force to be very effectual  it was lucky for jack that the other savages considered the success of their chief in this encounter to be so certain that they refrained from interfering  had they doubted it they would have probably ended the matter at once by felling him  but they contented themselves with awaiting the issue  the force which the chief expended in wielding his club now began to be apparent  his movements became slower his breath hissed through his clenched teeth and the surprised savages drew nearer in order to render assistance  jack observed this movement  he felt that his fate was sealed and resolved to cast his life upon the next blow  the chiefs club was again about to descend on his head  he might have evaded it easily but instead of doing so he suddenly shortened his grasp of his own club rushed in under the blow struck his adversary right between the eyes with all his force and fell to the earth crushed beneath the senseless body of the chief  a dozen clubs flew high in air ready to descend on the head of jack but they hesitated a moment for the massive body of the chief completely covered him  that moment saved his life  ere the savages could tear the chiefs body away seven of their number fell prostrate beneath the clubs of the prisoners whom peterkin and i had set free and two others fell under our own hand  we could never have accomplished this had not our enemies been so engrossed with the fight between jack and their chief that they had failed to observe us until we were upon them  they still outnumbered our party by three but we were flushed with victory while they were taken by surprise and dispirited by the fall of their chief  moreover they were awestruck by the sweeping fury of jack who seemed to have lost his senses altogether and had no sooner shaken himself free of the chiefs body than he rushed into the midst of them and in three blows equalised our numbers  peterkin and i flew to the rescue the savages followed us and in less than ten minutes the whole of our opponents were knocked down or made prisoners bound hand and foot and extended side by side upon the seashore    chapter twenty  intercourse with the savagescannibalism preventedthe slain are buried and the survivors depart leaving us again alone on our coral island  after the battle was over the savages crowded round us and gazed at us in surprise while they continued to pour upon us a flood of questions which being wholly unintelligible of course we could not answer however by way of putting an end to it jack took the chief who had recovered from the effects of his wound by the hand and shook it warmly  no sooner did the blacks see that this was meant to express goodwill than they shook hands with us all round  after this ceremony was gone through jack went up to the girl who had never once moved from the rock where she had been left but had continued an eager spectator of all that had passed  he made signs to her to follow him and then taking the chief by the hand was about to conduct him to the bower when his eye fell on the poor infant which had been thrown into the sea and was still lying on the shore  dropping the chiefs hand he hastened towards it and to his great joy found it to be still alive  we also found that the mother was beginning to recover slowly  here get out o the way said jack pushing us aside as we stooped over the poor woman and endeavoured to restore her ill soon bring her round  so saying he placed the infant on her bosom and laid its warm cheek on hers  the effect was wonderful  the woman opened her eyes felt the child looked at it and with a cry of joy clasped it in her arms at the same time endeavouring to risefor the purpose apparently of rushing into the woods  there thats all right said jack once more taking the chief by the handnow ralph and peterkin make the women and these fellows follow me to the bower  well entertain them as hospitably as we can  in a few minutes the savages were all seated on the ground in front of the bower making a hearty meal off a cold roast pig several ducks and a variety of cold fish together with an unlimited supply of cocoanuts breadfruits yams taro and plumswith all of which they seemed to be quite familiar and perfectly satisfied  meanwhile we three being thoroughly knocked up with our days work took a good draught of cocoanut lemonade and throwing ourselves on our beds fell fast asleep  the savages it seems followed our example and in halfanhour the whole camp was buried in repose  how long we slept i cannot tell but this i knowthat when we lay down the sun was setting and when we awoke it was high in the heavens  i awoke jack who started up in surprise being unable at first to comprehend our situation  now then said he springing up lets see after breakfasthallo peterkin lazy fellow how long do you mean to lie there  peterkin yawned heavily  well said he opening his eyes and looking up after some trouble if it isnt tomorrow morning and me thinking it was today all this timehallo venus where did you come from  you seem tolerably at home anyhow  bah might as well speak to the cat as to youbetter in fact for it understands me and you dont  this remark was called forth by the sight of one of the elderly females who had seated herself on the rock in front of the bower and having placed her child at her feet was busily engaged in devouring the remains of a roast pig  by this time the natives outside were all astir and breakfast in an advanced state of preparation  during the course of it we made sundry attempts to converse with the natives by signs but without effect  at last we hit upon a plan of discovering their names  jack pointed to his breast and said jack very distinctly then he pointed to peterkin and to me repeating our names at the same time  then he pointed to himself again and said jack and laying his finger on the breast of the chief looked inquiringly into his face  the chief instantly understood him and said tararo twice distinctly  jack repeated it after him and the chief nodding his head approvingly said chuck on hearing which peterkin exploded with laughter  but jack turned and with a frown rebuked him saying i must look even more indignantly at you than i feel peterkin you rascal for these fellows dont like to be laughed at  then turning towards the youngest of the women who was seated at the door of the bower he pointed to her whereupon the chief said avatea and pointing towards the sun raised his finger slowly towards the zenith where it remained steadily for a minute or two  what can that mean i wonder said jack looking puzzled  perhaps said peterkin the chief means she is an angel come down to stay here for a while  if so shes an uncommonly black one  we did not feel quite satisfied with this explanation so jack went up to her and said avatea  the woman smiled sadly and nodded her head at the same time pointing to her breast and then to the sun in the same manner as the chief had done  we were much puzzled to know what this could signify but as there was no way of solving our difficulty we were obliged to rest content  jack now made signs to the natives to follow him and taking up his axe he led them to the place where the battle had been fought  here we found the prisoners who had passed the night on the beach having been totally forgotten by us as our minds had been full of our guests and were ultimately overcome by sleep  they did not seem the worse for their exposure however as we judged by the hearty appetite with which they devoured the breakfast that was soon after given to them  jack then began to dig a hole in the sand and after working a few seconds he pointed to it and to the dead bodies that lay exposed on the beach the natives immediately perceived what he wanted and running for their paddles dug a hole in the course of halfanhour that was quite large enough to contain all the bodies of the slain  when it was finished they tossed their dead enemies into it with so much indifference that we felt assured they would not have put themselves to this trouble had we not asked them to do so  the body of the yellowhaired chief was the last thrown in  this wretched man would have recovered from the blow with which jack felled him and indeed he did endeavour to rise during the melee that followed his fall but one of his enemies happening to notice the action dealt him a blow with his club that killed him on the spot  while they were about to throw the sand over this chief one of the savages stooped over him and with a knife made apparently of stone cut a large slice of flesh from his thigh  we knew at once that he intended to make use of this for food and could not repress a cry of horror and disgust  come come you blackguard cried jack starting up and seizing the man by the arm pitch that into the hole  do you hear  the savage of course did not understand the command but he perfectly understood the look of disgust with which jack regarded the flesh and his fierce gaze as he pointed towards the hole  nevertheless he did not obey  jack instantly turned to tararo and made signs to him to enforce obedience  the chief seemed to understand the appeal for he stepped forward raised his club and was on the point of dashing out the brains of his offending subject when jack sprang forward and caught his uplifted arm  stop you blockhead he shouted  i dont want you to kill the man he then pointed again to the flesh and to the hole  the chief uttered a few words which had the desired effect for the man threw the flesh into the hole which was immediately filled up  this man was of a morose sulky disposition and during all the time he remained on the island regarded usespecially jackwith a scowling visage  his name we found was mahine  the next three or four days were spent by the savages in mending their canoe which had been damaged by the violent shock it had sustained on striking the shore  this canoe was a very curious structure  it was about thirty feet long and had a high towering stern  the timbers of which it was partly composed were fastened much in the same way as those of our little boat were put together but the part that seemed most curious to us was a sort of outrigger or long plank which was attached to the body of the canoe by means of two stout crossbeams  these beams kept the plank parallel with the canoe but not in contact with it for it floated in the water with an open space betweenthus forming a sort of double canoe  this we found was intended to prevent the upsetting of the canoe which was so narrow that it could not have maintained an upright position without the outrigger  we could not help wondering both at the ingenuity and the clumsiness of this contrivance  when the canoe was ready we assisted the natives to carry the prisoners into it and helped them to load it with provisions and fruit  peterkin also went to the plumtree for the purpose of making a special onslaught upon the hogs and killed no less than six of them  these we baked and presented to our friends on the day of their departure  on that day tararo made a great many energetic signs to us which after much consideration we came to understand were proposals that we should go away with him to his island but having no desire to do so we shook our heads very decidedly  however we consoled him by presenting him with our rusty axe which we thought we could spare having the excellent one which had been so providentially washed ashore to us the day we were wrecked  we also gave him a piece of wood with our names carved on it and a piece of string to hang it round his neck as an ornament  in a few minutes more we were all assembled on the beach  being unable to speak to the savages we went through the ceremony of shaking hands and expected they would depart but before doing so tararo went up to jack and rubbed noses with him after which he did the same with peterkin and me  seeing that this was their mode of salutation we determined to conform to their custom so we rubbed noses heartily with the whole party women and all  the only disagreeable part of the process was when we came to rub noses with mahine and peterkin afterwards said that when he saw his wolfish eyes glaring so close to his face he felt much more inclined to bang than to rub his nose avatea was the last to take leave of us and we experienced a feeling of real sorrow when she approached to bid us farewell  besides her modest air and gentle manners she was the only one of the party who exhibited the smallest sign of regret at parting from us  going up to jack she put out her flat little nose to be rubbed and thereafter paid the same compliment to peterkin and me  an hour later the canoe was out of sight and we with an indefinable feeling of sadness creeping round our hearts were seated in silence beneath the shadow of our bower meditating on the wonderful events of the last few days    chapter twenty one  sagacious and moral remarks in regard to lifea sailan unexpected salutethe end of the black cata terrible divean incautious proceeding and a frightful catastrophe  life is a strange compound  peterkin used to say of it that it beat a druggists shop all to sticks for whereas the first is a compound of good and bad the other is a horrible compound of all that is utterly detestable  and indeed the more i consider it the more i am struck with the strange mixture of good and evil that exists not only in the material earth but in our own natures  in our own coral island we had experienced every variety of good that a bountiful creator could heap on us  yet on the night of the storm we had seen how almost in our case and altogether no doubt in the case of others less fortunateall this good might be swept away for ever  we had seen the rich fruittrees waving in the soft air the tender herbs shooting upwards under the benign influence of the bright sun and the next day we had seen these good and beautiful trees and plants uprooted by the hurricane crushed and hurled to the ground in destructive devastation  we had lived for many months in a clime for the most part so beautiful that we had often wondered whether adam and eve had found eden more sweet and we had seen the quiet solitudes of our paradise suddenly broken in upon by ferocious savages and the white sands stained with blood and strewed with lifeless forms yet among these cannibals we had seen many symptoms of a kindly nature  i pondered these things much and while i considered them there recurred to my memory those words which i had read in my bible the works of god are wonderful and his ways past finding out  after these poor savages had left us we used to hold long and frequent conversations about them and i noticed that peterkins manner was now much altered  he did not indeed jest less heartily than before but he did so less frequently and often there was a tone of deep seriousness in his manner if not in his words which made him seem to jack and me as if he had grown two years older within a few days  but indeed i was not surprised at this when i reflected on the awful realities which we had witnessed so lately  we could by no means shake off a tendency to gloom for several weeks afterwards but as time wore away our usual good spirits returned somewhat and we began to think of the visit of the savages with feelings akin to those with which we recall a terrible dream  one day we were all enjoying ourselves in the water garden preparatory to going on a fishing excursion for peterkin had kept us in such constant supply of hogs that we had become quite tired of pork and desired a change  peterkin was sunning himself on the ledge of rock while we were creeping among the rocks below  happening to look up i observed peterkin cutting the most extraordinary capers and making violent gesticulations for us to come up so i gave jack a push and rose immediately  a sail a sailralph lookjack away on the horizon there just over the entrance to the lagoon cried peterkin as we scrambled up the rocks  so it isand a schooner too said jack as he proceeded hastily to dress  our hearts were thrown into a terrible flutter by this discovery for if it should touch at our island we had no doubt the captain would be happy to give us a passage to some of the civilised islands where we could find a ship sailing for england or some other part of europe home with all its associations rushed in upon my heart like a flood and much though i loved the coral island and the bower which had now been our home so long i felt that i could have quitted all at that moment without a sigh  with joyful anticipations we hastened to the highest point of rock near our dwelling and awaited the arrival of the vessel for we now perceived that she was making straight for the island under a steady breeze  in less than an hour she was close to the reef where she roundedto and backed her topsails in order to survey the coast  seeing this and fearing that they might not perceive us we all three waved pieces of cocoanut cloth in the air and soon had the satisfaction of seeing them beginning to lower a boat and bustle about the decks as if they meant to land  suddenly a flag was run up to the peak a little cloud of white smoke rose from the schooners side and before we could guess their intentions a cannonshot came crashing through the bushes carried away several cocoanut trees in its passage and burst in atoms against the cliff a few yards below the spot on which we stood  with feelings of terror we now observed that the flag at the schooners peak was black with a deathshead and crossbones upon it  as we gazed at each other in blank amazement the word pirate escaped our lips simultaneously  what is to be done cried peterkin as we observed a boat shoot from the vessels side and make for the entrance of the reef  if they take us off the island it will either be to throw us overboard for sport or to make pirates of us  i did not reply but looked at jack as being our only resource in this emergency  he stood with folded arms and his eyes fixed with a grave anxious expression on the ground  there is but one hope said he turning with a sad expression of countenance to peterkin  perhaps after all we may not have to resort to it  if these villains are anxious to take us they will soon overrun the whole island  but come follow me  stopping abruptly in his speech jack bounded into the woods and led us by a circuitous route to spouting cliff  here he halted and advancing cautiously to the rocks glanced over their edge  we were soon by his side and saw the boat which was crowded with armed men just touching the shore  in an instant the crew landed formed line and rushed up to our bower  in a few seconds we saw them hurrying back to the boat one of them swinging the poor cat round his head by the tail  on reaching the waters edge he tossed it far into the sea and joined his companions who appeared to be holding a hasty council  you see what we may expect said jack bitterly  the man who will wantonly kill a poor brute for sport will think little of murdering a fellowcreature  now boys we have but one chance leftthe diamond cave  the diamond cave cried peterkin  then my chance is a poor one for i could not dive into it if all the pirates on the pacific were at my heels  nay but said i we will take you down peterkin if you will only trust us  as i spoke we observed the pirates scatter over the beach and radiate as if from a centre towards the woods and along shore  now peterkin said jack in a solemn tone you must make up your mind to do it or we must make up our minds to die in your company  oh jack my dear friend cried peterkin turning pale leave me i dont believe theyll think it worth while to kill me  go you and ralph and dive into the cave  that will not i answered jack quietly while he picked up a stout cudgel from the groundso now ralph we must prepare to meet these fellows  their motto is no quarter  if we can manage to floor those coming in this direction we may escape into the woods for a while  there are five of them said i we have no chance  come then cried peterkin starting up and grasping jack convulsively by the arm let us dive  i will go  those who are not naturally expert in the water know well the feelings of horror that overwhelm them when in it at the bare idea of being held down even for a few secondsthat spasmodic involuntary recoil from compulsory immersion which has no connection whatever with cowardice and they will understand the amount of resolution that it required in peterkin to allow himself to be dragged down to a depth of ten feet and then through a narrow tunnel into an almost pitchdark cavern  but there was no alternative  the pirates had already caught sight of us and were now within a short distance of the rocks  jack and i seized peterkin by the arms  now keep quite stillno struggling said jack or we are lost  peterkin made no reply but the stern gravity of his marble features and the tension of his muscles satisfied us that he had fully made up his mind to go through with it  just as the pirates gained the foot of the rocks which hid us for a moment from their view we bent over the sea and plunged down together head foremost  peterkin behaved like a hero  he floated passively between us like a log of wood and we passed the tunnel and rose into the cave in a shorter space of time than i had ever done it before  peterkin drew a long deep breath on reaching the surface and in a few seconds we were all standing on the ledge of rock in safety  jack now searched for the tinder and torch which always lay in the cave  he soon found them and lighting the torch revealed to peterkins wondering gaze the marvels of the place  but we were too wet to waste much time in looking about us  our first care was to take off our clothes and wring them as dry as we could  this done we proceeded to examine into the state of our larder for as jack truly remarked there was no knowing how long the pirates might remain on the island  perhaps said peterkin they may take it into their heads to stop here altogether and so we shall be buried alive in this place  dont you think peterkin that its the nearest thing to being drowned alive that you ever felt said jack with a smile  but i have no fear of that  these villains never stay long on shore  the sea is their home so you may depend upon it that they wont stay more than a day or two at the furthest  we now began to make arrangements for spending the night in the cavern at various periods jack and i had conveyed cocoanuts and other fruits besides rolls of cocoanut cloth to this submarine cave partly for amusement and partly from a feeling that we might possibly be driven one day to take shelter here from the savages  little did we imagine that the first savages who would drive us into it would be white savagesperhaps our own countrymen  we found the cocoanuts in good condition and the cooked yams but the breadfruits were spoiled  we also found the cloth where we had left it and on opening it out there proved to be sufficient to make a bedwhich was important as the rock was damp  having collected it all together we spread out our bed placed our torch in the midst of us and ate our supper  it was indeed a strange chamber to feast in and we could not help remarking on the cold ghastly appearance of the walls and the black water at our side with the thick darkness beyond and the sullen sound of the drops that fell at long intervals from the roof of the cavern into the still water and the strong contrast between all this and our bed and supper which with our faces were lit up with the deepred flame of the torch  we sat long over our meal talking together in subdued voices for we did not like the dismal echoes that rang through the vault above when we happened to raise them  at last the faint light that came through the opening died away warning us that it was night and time for rest  we therefore put out our torch and lay down to sleep  on awaking it was some time ere we could collect our faculties so as to remember where we were and we were in much uncertainty as to whether it was early or late  we saw by the faint light that it was day but could not guess at the hour so jack proposed that he should dive out and reconnoitre  no jack said i do you rest here  youve had enough to do during the last few days  rest yourself now and take care of peterkin while i go out to see what the pirates are about  ill be very careful not to expose myself and ill bring you word again in a short time  very well ralph answered jack please yourself  but dont be long and if youll take my advice youll go in your clothes for i would like to have some fresh cocoanuts and climbing trees without clothes is uncomfortableto say the least of it  the pirates will be sure to keep a sharp lookout said peterkin so pray be careful  no fear said i  goodbye  goodbye answered my comrades  and while the words were yet sounding in my ears i plunged into the water and in a few seconds found myself in the open air  on rising i was careful to come up gently and to breathe softly while i kept close in beside the rocks but as i observed no one near me i crept slowly out and ascended the cliff a step at a time till i obtained a full view of the shore  no pirates were to be seeneven their boat was gone but as it was possible they might have hidden themselves i did not venture too boldly forward  then it occurred to me to look out to sea when to my surprise i saw the pirate schooner sailing away almost hull down on the horizon  on seeing this i uttered a shout of joy then my first impulse was to dive back to tell my companions the good news but i checked myself and ran to the top of the cliff in order to make sure that the vessel i saw was indeed the pirate schooner  i looked long and anxiously at her and giving vent to a deep sigh of relief said aloud yes there she goes the villains have been balked of their prey this time at least  not so sure of that said a deep voice at my side while at the same moment a heavy hand grasped my shoulder and held it as if in a vice    chapter twenty two  i fall into the hands of pirateshow they treated me and what i said to themthe result of the whole ending in a melancholy separation and in a most unexpected gift  my heart seemed to leap into my throat at the words and turning round i beheld a man of immense stature and fierce aspect regarding me with a smile of contempt  he was a white manthat is to say he was a man of european blood though his face from long exposure to the weather was deeply bronzed  his dress was that of a common seaman except that he had on a greek skullcap and wore a broad shawl of the richest silk round his waist  in this shawl were placed two pairs of pistols and a heavy cutlass  he wore a beard and moustache which like the locks on his head were short curly and sprinkled with grey hairs  so youngster he said with a sardonic smile while i felt his grasp tighten on my shoulder the villains have been balked of their prey have they  we shall seewe shall see  now you whelp look yonder as he spoke the pirate uttered a shrill whistle  in a second or two it was answered and the pirate boat rowed round the point at the water garden and came rapidly towards us  now go make a fire on that point and harkee youngster if you try to run away ill send a quick and sure messenger after you and he pointed significantly at his pistols  i obeyed in silence and as i happened to have the burningglass in my pocket a fire was speedily kindled and a thick smoke ascended into the air  it had scarcely appeared for two minutes when the boom of a gun rolled over the sea and looking up i saw that the schooner was making for the island again  it now flashed across me that this was a ruse on the part of the pirates and that they had sent their vessel away knowing that it would lead us to suppose that they had left altogether but there was no use of regret now  i was completely in their power so i stood helplessly beside the pirate watching the crew of the boat as they landed on the beach  for an instant i contemplated rushing over the cliff into the sea but this i saw i could not now accomplish as some of the men were already between me and the water  there was a good deal of jesting at the success of their scheme as the crew ascended the rocks and addressed the man who had captured me by the title of captain  they were a ferocious set of men with shaggy beards and scowling brows  all of them were armed with cutlasses and pistols and their costumes were with trifling variations similar to that of the captain  as i looked from one to the other and observed the low scowling brows that never unbent even when the men laughed and the mean rascally expression that sat on each face i felt that my life hung by a hair  but where are the other cubs cried one of the men with an oath that made me shudder  ill swear to it there were three at least if not more  you hear what he says whelp where are the other dogs said the captain  if you mean my companions said i in a low voice i wont tell you  a loud laugh burst from the crew at this answer  the pirate captain looked at me in surprise  then drawing a pistol from his belt he cocked it and said now youngster listen to me  ive no time to waste here  if you dont tell me all you know ill blow your brains out  where are your comrades  for an instant i hesitated not knowing what to do in this extremity suddenly a thought occurred to me  villain said i shaking my clenched fist in his face to blow my brains out would make short work of me and be soon over death by drowning is as sure and the agony prolonged  yet i tell you to your face if you were to toss me over yonder cliff into the sea i would not tell you where my companions are and i dare you to try me  the pirate captain grew white with rage as i spoke  say you so cried he uttering a fierce oathhere lads take him by the legs and heave him inquick  the men who were utterly silenced with surprise at my audacity advanced and seized me and as they carried me towards the cliff i congratulated myself not a little on the success of my scheme for i knew that once in the water i should be safe and could rejoin jack and peterkin in the cave  but my hopes were suddenly blasted by the captain crying out hold on lads hold on  well give him a taste of the thumbscrews before throwing him to the sharks  away with him into the boat  look alive the breeze is freshening  the men instantly raised me shoulderhigh and hurrying down the rocks tossed me into the bottom of the boat where i lay for some time stunned with the violence of my fall  on recovering sufficiently to raise myself on my elbow i perceived that we were already outside the coral reef and close alongside the schooner which was of small size and clipperbuilt  i had only time to observe this much when i received a severe kick on the side from one of the men who ordered me in a rough voice to jump aboard  rising hastily i clambered up the side  in a few minutes the boat was hoisted on deck the vessels head put close to the wind and the coral island dropped slowly astern as we beat up against a head sea  immediately after coming aboard the crew were too busily engaged in working the ship and getting in the boat to attend to me so i remained leaning against the bulwarks close to the gangway watching their operations  i was surprised to find that there were no guns or carronades of any kind in the vessel which had more the appearance of a fastsailing trader than a pirate  but i was struck with the neatness of everything  the brasswork of the binnacle and about the tiller as well as the copper belayingpins were as brightly polished as if they had just come from the foundry  the decks were pure white and smooth the masts were cleanscraped and varnished except at the crosstrees and truck which were painted black  the standing and running rigging was in the most perfect order and the sails white as snow  in short everything from the single narrow red stripe on her low black hull to the trucks on her tapering masts evinced an amount of care and strict discipline that would have done credit to a ship of the royal navy there was nothing lumbering or unseemly about the vessel excepting perhaps a boat which lay on the deck with its keel up between the fore and main masts  it seemed disproportionately large for the schooner but when i saw that the crew amounted to between thirty and forty men i concluded that this boat was held in reserve in case of any accident compelling the crew to desert the vessel  as i have before said the costumes of the men were similar to that of the captain  but in headgear they differed not only from him but from each othersome wearing the ordinary straw hat of the merchant service while others wore cloth caps and red worsted nightcaps  i observed that all their arms were sent below the captain only retaining his cutlass and a single pistol in the folds of his shawl  although the captain was the tallest and most powerful man in the ship he did not strikingly excel many of his men in this respect and the only difference that an ordinary observer would have noticed was a certain degree of open candour straightforward daring in the bold ferocious expression of his face which rendered him less repulsive than his lowbrowed associates but did not by any means induce the belief that he was a hero  this look was however the indication of that spirit which gave him the preeminence among the crew of desperadoes who called him captain  he was a lionlike villain totally devoid of personal fear and utterly reckless of consequences and therefore a terror to his men who individually hated him but unitedly felt it to be to their advantage to have him at their head  but my thoughts soon reverted to the dear companions whom i had left on shore and as i turned towards the coral island which was now far away to leeward i sighed deeply and the tears rolled slowly down my cheeks as i thought that i might never see them more  so youre blubbering are you you obstinate whelp said the deep voice of the captain as he came up and gave me a box on the ear that nearly felled me to the deck  i dont allow any such weakness aboard o this ship  so clap a stopper on your eyes or ill give you something to cry for  i flushed with indignation at this rough and cruel treatment but felt that giving way to anger would only make matters worse so i made no reply but took out my handkerchief and dried my eyes  i thought you were made of better stuff continued the captain angrily  id rather have a mad bulldog aboard than a watereyed puppy but ill cure you lad or introduce you to the sharks before long now go below and stay there till i call you  as i walked forward to obey my eye fell on a small keg standing by the side of the mainmast on which the word gunpowder was written in pencil  it immediately flashed across me that as we were beating up against the wind anything floating in the sea would be driven on the reef encircling the coral island  i also recollectedfor thought is more rapid than the lightningthat my old companions had a pistol without a moments hesitation therefore i lifted the keg from the deck and tossed it into the sea  an exclamation of surprise burst from the captain and some of the men who witnessed this act of mine  striding up to me and uttering fearful imprecations the captain raised his hand to strike me while he shouted boy whelp what mean you by that  if you lower your hand said i in a loud voice while i felt the blood rush to my temples ill tell you  until you do so im dumb  the captain stepped back and regarded me with a look of amazement  now continued i i threw that keg into the sea because the wind and waves will carry it to my friends on the coral island who happen to have a pistol but no powder  i hope that it will reach them soon and my only regret is that the keg was not a bigger one  moreover pirate you said just now that you thought i was made of better stuff  i dont know what stuff i am made ofi never thought much about that subject but im quite certain of thisthat i am made of such stuff as the like of you shall never tame though you should do your worst  to my surprise the captain instead of flying into a rage smiled and thrusting his hand into the voluminous shawl that encircled his waist turned on his heel and walked aft while i went below  here instead of being rudely handled as i had expected the men received me with a shout of laughter and one of them patting me on the back said well done lad  youre a brick and i have no doubt will turn out a rare cove  bloody bill there was just such a fellow as you are and hes now the biggest cutthroat of us all  take a can of beer lad cried another and wet your whistle after that speech o yourn to the captain  if any one o us had made it youngster he would have had no whistle to wet by this time  stop your clapper jack vociferated a third  give the boy a junk o meat  dont you see hes amost goin to kick the bucket  and no wonder said the first speaker with an oath after the tumble you gave him into the boat  i guess it would have broke your neck if you had got it  i did indeed feel somewhat faint which was owing doubtless to the combined effects of illusage and hunger for it will be recollected that i had dived out of the cave that morning before breakfast and it was now near midday  i therefore gladly accepted a plate of boiled pork and a yam which were handed to me by one of the men from the locker on which some of the crew were seated eating their dinner  but i must add that the zest with which i ate my meal was much abated in consequence of the frightful oaths and the terrible language that flowed from the lips of these godless men even in the midst of their hilarity and goodhumour  the man who had been alluded to as bloody bill was seated near me and i could not help wondering at the moody silence he maintained among his comrades  he did indeed reply to their questions in a careless offhand tone but he never volunteered a remark  the only difference between him and the others was his taciturnity and his size for he was nearly if not quite as large a man as the captain  during the remainder of the afternoon i was left to my own reflections which were anything but agreeable for i could not banish from my mind the threat about the thumbscrews of the nature and use of which i had a vague but terrible conception  i was still meditating on my unhappy fate when just after nightfall one of the watch on deck called down the hatchway  hallo there  one o you tumble up and light the cabin lamp and send that boy aft to the captainsharp  now then do you hear youngster the captain wants you  look alive said bloody bill raising his huge frame from the locker on which he had been asleep for the last two hours  he sprang up the ladder and i instantly followed him and going aft was shown into the cabin by one of the men who closed the door after me  a small silver lamp which hung from a beam threw a dim soft light over the cabin which was a small apartment and comfortably but plainly furnished  seated on a campstool at the table and busily engaged in examining a chart of the pacific was the captain who looked up as i entered and in a quiet voice bade me be seated while he threw down his pencil and rising from the table stretched himself on a sofa at the upper end of the cabin  boy said he looking me full in the face what is your name  ralph rover i replied  where did you come from and how came you to be on that island  how many companions had you on it  answer me now and mind you tell no lies  i never tell lies said i firmly  the captain received this reply with a cold sarcastic smile and bade me answer his questions  i then told him the history of myself and my companions from the time we sailed till the day of his visit to the islandtaking care however to make no mention of the diamond cave  after i had concluded he was silent for a few minutes then looking up he said boy i believe you  i was surprised at this remark for i could not imagine why he should not believe me  however i made no reply  and what continued the captain makes you think that this schooner is a pirate  the black flag said i showed me what you are and if any further proof were wanting i have had it in the brutal treatment i have received at your hands  the captain frowned as i spoke but subduing his anger he continued boy you are too bold  i admit that we treated you roughly but that was because you made us lose time and gave us a good deal of trouble as to the black flag that is merely a joke that my fellows play off upon people sometimes in order to frighten them  it is their humour and does no harm  i am no pirate boy but a lawful tradera rough one i grant you but one cant help that in these seas where there are so many pirates on the water and such murderous blackguards on the land i carry on a trade in sandalwood with the feejee islands and if you choose ralph to behave yourself and be a good boy ill take you along with me and give you a good share of the profits  you see im in want of an honest boy like you to look after the cabin and keep the log and superintend the traffic on shore sometimes  what say you ralph would you like to become a sandalwood trader  i was much surprised by this explanation and a good deal relieved to find that the vessel after all was not a pirate but instead of replying i said if it be as you state then why did you take me from my island and why do you not now take me back  the captain smiled as he replied i took you off in anger boy and im sorry for it  i would even now take you back but we are too far away from it  see there it is he added laying his finger on the chart and we are now herefifty miles at least  it would not be fair to my men to put about now for they have all an interest in the trade  i could make no reply to this so after a little more conversation i agreed to become one of the crewat least until we could reach some civilised island where i might be put ashore  the captain assented to this proposition and after thanking him for the promise i left the cabin and went on deck with feelings that ought to have been lighter but which were i could not tell why marvellously heavy and uncomfortable still    chapter twenty three  bloody billdark surmisesa strange sail and a strange crew and a still stranger cargonew reasons for favouring missionariesa murderous massacre and thoughts thereon  three weeks after the conversation narrated in the last chapter i was standing on the quarterdeck of the schooner watching the gambols of a shoal of porpoises that swam round us  it was a dead calmone of those still hot sweltering days so common in the pacific when nature seems to have gone to sleep and the only thing in water or in air that proves her still alive is her long deep breathing in the swell of the mighty sea  no cloud floated in the deep blue above no ripple broke the reflected blue below  the sun shone fiercely in the sky and a ball of fire blazed with almost equal power from out the bosom of the water  so intensely still was it and so perfectly transparent was the surface of the deep that had it not been for the long swell already alluded to we might have believed the surrounding universe to be a huge blue liquid ball and our little ship the one solitary material speck in all creation floating in the midst of it  no sound broke on our ears save the soft puff now and then of a porpoise the slow creak of the masts as we swayed gently on the swell the patter of the reefpoints and the occasional flap of the hanging sails  an awning covered the fore and after parts of the schooner under which the men composing the watch on deck lolled in sleepy indolence overcome with excessive heat  bloody bill as the men invariably called him was standing at the tiller but his post for the present was a sinecure and he whiled away the time by alternately gazing in dreamy abstraction at the compass in the binnacle and by walking to the taffrail in order to spit into the sea  in one of these turns he came near to where i was standing and leaning over the side looked long and earnestly down into the blue wave  this man although he was always taciturn and often surly was the only human being on board with whom i had the slightest desire to become better acquainted  the other men seeing that i did not relish their company and knowing that i was a protege of the captain treated me with total indifference  bloody bill it is true did the same but as this was his conduct to every one else it was not peculiar in reference to me  once or twice i tried to draw him into conversation but he always turned away after a few cold monosyllables  as he now leaned over the taffrail close beside me i said to him  bill why is it that you are so gloomy  why do you never speak to any one  bill smiled slightly as he replied why i spose its because i haint got nothin to say  thats strange said i musingly  you look like a man that could think and such men can usually speak  so they can youngster rejoined bill somewhat sternly and i could speak too if i had a mind to but whats the use o speakin here  the men only open their mouths to curse and swear and they seem to find it entertainin but i dont so i hold my tongue  well bill thats true and i would rather not hear you speak at all than hear you speak like the other men  but i dont swear bill so you might talk to me sometimes i think  besides im weary of spending day after day in this way without a single soul to say a pleasant word to ive been used to friendly conversation bill and i really would take it kind if you would talk with me a little now and then  bill looked at me in surprise and i thought i observed a sad expression pass across his sunburned face  an where have you been used to friendly conversation said bill looking down again into the sea  not on that coral island i take it  yes indeed said i energetically  i have spent many of the happiest months in my life on that coral island and without waiting to be further questioned i launched out into a glowing account of the happy life that jack and peterkin and i had spent together and related minutely every circumstance that befell us while on the island  boy boy said bill in a voice so deep that it startled me this is no place for you  thats true said i  i am of little use on board and i dont like my comrades but i cant help it and at any rate i hope to be free again soon  free said bill looking at me in surprise  yes free returned i  the captain said he would put me ashore after this trip was over  this trip  harkee boy said bill lowering his voice what said the captain to you the day you came aboard  he said that he was a trader in sandalwood and no pirate and told me that if i would join him for this trip he would give me a good share of the profits or put me on shore in some civilised island if i chose  bills brows lowered savagely as he muttered ay he said truth when he told you he was a sandalwood trader but he lied when  sail ho shouted the lookout at the masthead  where away cried bill springing to the tiller while the men startled by the sudden cry jumped up and gazed round the horizon  on the starboard quarter hull down sir answered the lookout  at this moment the captain came on deck and mounting into the rigging surveyed the sail through the glass  then sweeping his eye round the horizon he gazed steadily at the particular point  take in topsails shouted the captain swinging himself down on the deck by the mainback stay  take in topsails roared the first mate  ay ay sirrr answered the men as they sprang into the rigging and went aloft like cats  instantly all was bustle on board the hitherto quiet schooner  the topsails were taken in and stowed the men stood by the sheets and halyards and the captain gazed anxiously at the breeze which was now rushing towards us like a sheet of dark blue  in a few seconds it struck us  the schooner trembled as if in surprise at the sudden onset while she fell away then bending gracefully to the wind as though in acknowledgment of her subjection she cut through the waves with her sharp prow like a dolphin while bill directed her course towards the strange sail  in halfanhour we neared her sufficiently to make out that she was a schooner and from the clumsy appearance of her masts and sails we judged her to be a trader  she evidently did not like our appearance for the instant the breeze reached her she crowded all sail and showed us her stern  as the breeze had moderated a little our topsails were again shaken out and it soon became evidentdespite the proverb a stern chase is a long onethat we doubled her speed and would overhaul her speedily  when within a mile we hoisted british colours but receiving no acknowledgment the captain ordered a shot to be fired across her bows  in a moment to my surprise a large portion of the bottom of the boat amidships was removed and in the hole thus exposed appeared an immense brass gun  it worked on a swivel and was elevated by means of machinery  it was quickly loaded and fired  the heavy ball struck the water a few yards ahead of the chase and ricochetting into the air plunged into the sea a mile beyond it  this produced the desired effect  the strange vessel backed her topsails and hoveto while we ranged up and layto about a hundred yards off  lower the boat cried the captain  in a second the boat was lowered and manned by a part of the crew who were all armed with cutlasses and pistols  as the captain passed me to get into it he said jump into the sternsheets ralph i may want you  i obeyed and in ten minutes more we were standing on the strangers deck  we were all much surprised at the sight that met our eyes  instead of a crew of such sailors as we were accustomed to see there were only fifteen blacks standing on the quarterdeck and regarding us with looks of undisguised alarm  they were totally unarmed and most of them unclothed  one or two however wore portions of european attire  one had on a pair of duck trousers which were much too large for him and stuck out in a most ungainly manner another wore nothing but the common scanty native garment round the loins and a black beaver hat but the most ludicrous personage of all and one who seemed to be chief was a tall middleaged man of a mild simple expression of countenance who wore a white cotton shirt a swallowtailed coat and a straw hat while his black brawny legs were totally uncovered below the knees  wheres the commander of this ship inquired our captain stepping up to this individual  i is capin he answered taking off his straw hat and making a low bow  you said our captain in surprise  where do you come from and where are you bound  what cargo have you aboard  we is come answered the man with the swallowtail from aitutaki we was go for rarotonga  we is native missnary ship our name is de olive branch an our cargo is two tons cocoanuts seventy pigs twenty cats and de gospl  this announcement was received by the crew of our vessel with a shout of laughter which however was peremptorily checked by the captain whose expression instantly changed from one of severity to that of frank urbanity as he advanced towards the missionary and shook him warmly by the hand  i am very glad to have fallen in with you said he and i wish you much success in your missionary labours  pray take me to your cabin as i wish to converse with you privately  the missionary immediately took him by the hand and as he led him away i heard him saying me most glad to find you trader we tought you be pirate  you very like one bout the masts  what conversation the captain had with this man i never heard but he came on deck again in a quarter of an hour and shaking hands cordially with the missionary ordered us into our boat and returned to the schooner which was immediately put before the wind  in a few minutes the olive branch was left far behind us  that afternoon as i was down below at dinner i heard the men talking about this curious ship  i wonder said one why our captain looked so sweet on yon swallowtailed supercargo o pigs and gospels  if it had been an ordinary trader now he would have taken as many o the pigs as he required and sent the ship with all on board to the bottom  why dick you must be new to these seas if you dont know that cried another  the captain cares as much for the gospel as you do an thats precious little but he knows and everybody knows that the only place among the southern islands where a ship can put in and get what she wants in comfort is where the gospel has been sent to  there are hundreds o islands at this blessed moment where you might as well jump straight into a sharks maw as land without a band o thirty comrades armed to the teeth to back you  ay said a man with a deep scar over his right eye  dicks new to the work  but if the captain takes us for a cargo o sandalwood to the feejees hell get a taste o these black gentry in their native condition  for my part i dont know and i dont care what the gospel does to them but i know that when any o the islands chance to get it trade goes all smooth and easy  but where they hant got it beelzebub himself could hardly desire better company  well you ought to be a good judge cried another laughing for youve never kept any company but the worst all your life  ralph rover shouted a voice down the hatchway captain wants you aft  springing up the ladder i hastened to the cabin pondering as i went the strange testimony borne by these men to the effect of the gospel on savage naturestestimony which as it was perfectly disinterested i had no doubt whatever was strictly true  on coming again on deck i found bloody bill at the helm and as we were alone together i tried to draw him into conversation  after repeating to him the conversation in the forecastle about the missionaries i said  tell me bill is this schooner really a trader in sandalwood  yes ralph she is but shes just as really a pirate  the black flag you saw flying at the peak was no deception  then how can you say shes a trader asked i  why as to that she trades when she cant take by force but she takes by force when she can in preference  ralph he added lowering his voice if you had seen the bloody deeds that i have witnessed done on these decks you would not need to ask if we were pirates  but youll find it out soon enough  as for the missionaries the captain favours them because they are useful to him  the south sea islanders are such incarnate fiends that they are the better of being tamed and the missionaries are the only men who can do it  our track after this lay through several clusters of small islets among which we were becalmed more than once  during this part of our voyage the watch on deck and the lookout at the masthead were more than usually vigilant as we were not only in danger of being attacked by the natives who i learned from the captains remarks were a bloody and deceitful tribe at this group but we were also exposed to much risk from the multitudes of coral reefs that rose up in the channels between the islandssome of them just above the surface others a few feet below it  our precautions against the savages i found were indeed necessary  one day we were becalmed among a group of small islands most of which appeared to be uninhabited  as we were in want of fresh water the captain sent the boat ashore to bring off a cask or two  but we were mistaken in thinking there were no natives for scarcely had we drawn near to the shore when a band of naked blacks rushed out of the bush and assembled on the beach brandishing their clubs and spears in a threatening manner  our men were well armed but refrained from showing any signs of hostility and rowed nearer in order to converse with the natives and i now found that more than one of the crew could imperfectly speak dialects of the language peculiar to the south sea islanders  when within forty yards of the shore we ceased rowing and the first mate stood up to address the multitude but instead of answering us they replied with a shower of stones some of which cut the men severely  instantly our muskets were levelled and a volley was about to be fired when the captain hailed us in a loud voice from the schooner which lay not more than five or six hundred yards off the shore  dont fire he shouted angrily  pull off to the point ahead of you  the men looked surprised at this order and uttered deep curses as they prepared to obey for their wrath was roused and they burned for revenge  three or four of them hesitated and seemed disposed to mutiny  dont distress yourselves lads said the mate while a bitter smile curled his lip  obey orders  the captains not the man to take an insult tamely  if long tom does not speak presently ill give myself to the sharks  the men smiled significantly as they pulled from the shore which was now crowded with a dense mass of savages amounting probably to five or six hundred  we had not rowed off above a couple of hundred yards when a loud roar thundered over the sea and the big brass gun sent a withering shower of grape pointblank into the midst of the living mass through which a wide lane was cut while a yell the like of which i could not have imagined burst from the miserable survivors as they fled to the woods  amongst the heaps of dead that lay on the sand just where they had fallen i could distinguish mutilated forms writhing in agony while ever and anon one and another rose convulsively from out the mass endeavoured to stagger towards the wood and ere they had taken a few steps fell and wallowed on the bloody sand  my blood curdled within me as i witnessed this frightful and wanton slaughter but i had little time to think for the captains deep voice came again over the water towards us pull ashore lads and fill your watercasks  the men obeyed in silence and it seemed to me as if even their hard hearts were shocked by the ruthless deed  on gaining the mouth of the rivulet at which we intended to take in water we found it flowing with blood for the greater part of those who were slain had been standing on the banks of the stream a short way above its mouth  many of the wretched creatures had fallen into it and we found one body which had been carried down jammed between two rocks with the staring eyeballs turned towards us and his black hair waving in the ripples of the bloodred stream  no one dared to oppose our landing now so we carried our casks to a pool above the murdered group and having filled them returned on board  fortunately a breeze sprang up soon afterwards and carried us away from the dreadful spot but it could not waft me away from the memory of what i had seen  and this thought i gazing in horror at the captain who with a quiet look of indifference leaned upon the taffrail smoking a cigar and contemplating the fertile green islets as they passed like a lovely picture before our eyesthis is the man who favours the missionaries because they are useful to him and can tame the savages better than any one else can do it  then i wondered in my mind whether it were possible for any missionary to tame him    chapter twenty four  bloody bill is communicative and sagaciousunpleasant prospects retrospective meditations interrupted by volcanic agencythe pirates negotiate with a feejee chiefvarious etceteras that are calculated to surprise and horrify  it was many days after the events just narrated ere i recovered a little of my wonted spirits  i could not shake off the feeling for a long time that i was in a frightful dream and the sight of our captain filled me with so much horror that i kept out of his way as much as my duties about the cabin would permit  fortunately he took so little notice of me that he did not observe my changed feelings towards him otherwise it might have been worse for me  but i was now resolved that i would run away the very first island we should land at and commit myself to the hospitality of the natives rather than remain an hour longer than i could help in the pirate schooner  i pondered this subject a good deal and at last made up my mind to communicate my intention to bloody bill for during several talks i had had with him of late i felt assured that he too would willingly escape if possible  when i told him of my design he shook his head  no no ralph said he you must not think of running away here  among some of the groups of islands you might do so with safety but if you tried it here you would find that you had jumped out of the fryinpan into the fire  how so bill said i  would the natives not receive me  that they would lad but they would eat you too  eat me said i in surprise  i thought the south sea islanders never ate anybody except their enemies  humph ejaculated bill  i spose twas yer tenderhearted friends in england that put that notion into your head  theres a set o softhearted folk at home that i knows on who dont like to have their feelins ruffled and when you tell them anything they dont likethat shocks them as they call itno matter how true it be they stop their ears and cry out oh that is too horrible  we cant believe that an they say truth  they cant believe it cause they wont believe it  now i believe theres thousands o the people in england who are sich born drivellin wont believers that they think the black fellows hereaways at the worst eat an enemy only now an then out o spite whereas i know for certain and many captains of the british and american navies know as well as me that the feejee islanders eat not only their enemies but one anotherand they do it not for spite but for pleasure  its a fact that they prefer human flesh to any other but they dont like white mens flesh so well as black they say it makes them sick  why bill said i you told me just now that they would eat me if they caught me  so i did and so i think they would  ive only heard some o them say they dont like white men so well as black but if they was hungry they wouldnt be particular  anyhow im sure they would kill you  you see ralph ive been a good while in them parts and ive visited the different groups of islands oftentimes as a trader  and thoroughgoin blackguards some o them traders areno better than pirates i can tell you  one captain that i sailed with was not a chip better than the one were with now  he was trading with a friendly chief one day aboard his vessel  the chief had swam off to us with the things for trade tied atop of his head for them chaps are like otters in the water  well the chief was hard on the captain and would not part with some o his things  when their bargainin was over they shook hands and the chief jumped overboard to swim ashore but before he got forty yards from the ship the captain seized a musket and shot him dead  he then hove up anchor and put to sea and as we sailed along the shore he dropped six black fellows with his rifle remarkin that that would spoil the trade for the nextcomers  but as i was sayin im up to the ways o these fellows  one o the laws o the country is that every shipwrecked person who happens to be cast ashore be he dead or alive is doomed to be roasted and eaten  there was a small tradin schooner wrecked off one of these islands when we were lyin there in harbour during a storm the crew was lostall but three men who swam ashore  the moment they landed they were seized by the natives and carried up into the woods we knew pretty well what their fate would be but we could not help them for our crew was small and if we had gone ashore they would likely have killed us all  we never saw the three men again  but we heard frightful yelling and dancing and merrymaking that night and one of the natives who came aboard to trade with us next day told us that the long pigs as he called the men had been roasted and eaten and their bones were to be converted into sailneedles  he also said that white men were bad to eat and that most o the people on shore were sick  i was very much shocked and cast down in my mind at this terrible account of the natives and asked bill what he would advise me to do looking round the deck to make sure that we were not overheard he lowered his voice and said there are two or three ways that we might escape ralph but none o thems easy  if the captain would only sail for some o the islands near tahiti we might run away there well enough because the natives are all christians an we find that wherever the savages take up with christianity they always give over their bloody ways and are safe to be trusted  i never cared for christianity myself he continued in a soliloquising voice and i dont well know what it means but a man with halfaneye can see what it does for these black critters  however the captain always keeps a sharp lookout after us when we get to these islands for he halfsuspects that one or two o us are tired of his company  then we might manage to cut the boat adrift some fine night when its our watch on deck and clear off before they discovered that we were gone  but we would run the risk o bein caught by the blacks  i wouldnt like to try that plan  but you and i will think over it ralph and see whats to be done  in the meantime its our watch below so ill go and turn in  bill then bade me goodnight and went below while a comrade took his place at the helm but feeling no desire to enter into conversation with him i walked aft and leaning over the stern looked down into the phosphorescent waves that gurgled around the rudder and streamed out like a flame of blue light in the vessels wake  my thoughts were very sad and i could scarce refrain from tears as i contrasted my present wretched position with the happy peaceful time i had spent on the coral island with my dear companions  as i thought upon jack and peterkin anxious forebodings crossed my mind and i pictured to myself the grief and dismay with which they would search every nook and corner of the island in a vain attempt to discover my dead body for i felt assured that if they did not see any sign of the pirate schooner or boat when they came out of the cave to look for me they would never imagine that i had been carried away  i wondered too how jack would succeed in getting peterkin out of the cave without my assistance and i trembled when i thought that he might lose presence of mind and begin to kick when he was in the tunnel  these thoughts were suddenly interrupted and put to flight by a brightred blaze which lighted up the horizon to the southward and cast a crimson glow far over the sea  this appearance was accompanied by a low growling sound as of distant thunder and at the same time the sky above us became black while a hot stifling wind blew around us in fitful gusts  the crew assembled hastily on deck and most of them were under the belief that a frightful hurricane was pending but the captain coming on deck soon explained the phenomena  its only a volcano said he  i knew there was one hereabouts but thought it was extinctup there and furl topgallant sails  well likely have a breeze and its well to be ready  as he spoke a shower began to fall which we quickly observed was not rain but fine ashes  as we were many miles distant from the volcano these must have been carried to us from it by the wind  as the captain had predicted a stiff breeze soon afterwards sprang up under the influence of which we speedily left the volcano far behind us but during the greater part of the night we could see its lurid glare and hear its distant thunder  the shower did not cease to fall for several hours and we must have sailed under it for nearly forty milesperhaps farther  when we emerged from the cloud our decks and every part of the rigging were completely covered with a thick coat of ashes  i was much interested in this and recollected that jack had often spoken of many of the islands of the pacific as being volcanoes either active or extinct and had said that the whole region was more or less volcanic and that some scientific men were of opinion that the islands of the pacific were nothing more or less than the mountaintops of a huge continent which had sunk under the influence of volcanic agency  three days after passing the volcano we found ourselves a few miles to windward of an island of considerable size and luxuriant aspect  it consisted of two mountains which seemed to be nearly four thousand feet high  they were separated from each other by a broad valley whose thickgrowing trees ascended a considerable distance up the mountainsides and rich level plains or meadowland spread round the base of the mountains except at the point immediately opposite the large valley where a river seemed to carry the trees as it were along with it down to the white sandy shore  the mountaintops unlike those of our coral island were sharp needleshaped and bare while their sides were more rugged and grand in outline than anything i had yet seen in those seas  bloody bill was beside me when the island first hove in sight  ah he exclaimed i know that island well  they call it emo  have you been there before then  i inquired  ay that i have often and so has this schooner  tis a famous island for sandalwood  we have taken many cargoes of it alreadyand have paid for them too for the savages are so numerous that we dared not try to take it by force  but our captain has tried to cheat them so often that theyre beginnin not to like us overmuch now  besides the men behaved ill the last time we were here and i wonder the captain is not afraid to venture  but hes afraid o nothin earthly i believe  we soon ran inside the barrier coral reef and let go our anchor in six fathoms water just opposite the mouth of a small creek whose shores were densely covered with mangroves and tall umbrageous trees  the principal village of the natives lay about halfamile from this point ordering the boat out the captain jumped into it and ordered me to follow him  the men fifteen in number were well armed and the mate was directed to have long tom ready for emergencies  give way lads cried the captain  the oars fell into the water at the word the boat shot from the schooners side and in a few minutes reached the shore  here contrary to our expectation we were met with the utmost cordiality by romata the principal chief of the island who conducted us to his house and gave us mats to sit upon  i observed in passing that the natives of whom there were two or three thousand were totally unarmed  after a short preliminary palaver a feast of baked pigs and various roots was spread before us of which we partook sparingly and then proceeded to business  the captain stated his object in visiting the island regretted that there had been a slight misunderstanding during the last visit and hoped that no illwill was borne by either party and that a satisfactory trade would be accomplished  romata answered that he had forgotten there had been any differences between them protested that he was delighted to see his friends again and assured them they should have every assistance in cutting and embarking the wood  the terms were afterwards agreed on and we rose to depart  all this conversation was afterwards explained to me by bill who understood the language pretty well  romata accompanied us on board and explained that a great chief from another island was then on a visit to him and that he was to be ceremoniously entertained on the following day  after begging to be allowed to introduce him to us and receiving permission he sent his canoe ashore to bring him off  at the same time he gave orders to bring on board his two favourites a cock and a paroquet  while the canoe was gone on this errand i had time to regard the savage chief attentively he was a man of immense size with massive but beautifully moulded limbs and figure only parts of whichthe broad chest and muscular armswere uncovered for although the lower orders generally wore no other clothing than a strip of cloth called maro round their loins the chief on particular occasions wrapped his person in voluminous folds of a species of native cloth made from the bark of the chinese papermulberry  romata wore a magnificent black beard and moustache and his hair was frizzed out to such an extent that it resembled a large turban in which was stuck a long wooden pin  i afterwards found that this pin served for scratching the head for which purpose the fingers were too short without disarranging the hair  but romata put himself to much greater inconvenience on account of his hair for we found that he slept with his head resting on a wooden pillow in which was cut a hollow for the neck so that the hair of the sleeper might not be disarranged  in ten minutes the canoe returned bringing the other chief who certainly presented a most extraordinary appearance having painted one half of his face red and the other half yellow besides ornamenting it with various designs in black  otherwise he was much the same in appearance as romata though not so powerfully built  as this chief had never seen a ship beforeexcept perchance some of the petty traders that at long intervals visit these remote islandshe was much taken up with the neatness and beauty of all the fittings of the schooner  he was particularly struck with a musket which was shown to him and asked where the white men got hatchets hard enough to cut the tree of which the barrel was made  while he was thus engaged his brotherchief stood aloof talking with the captain and fondling a superb cock and a little blueheaded paroquetthe favourites of which i have before spoken  i observed that all the other natives walked in a crouching posture while in the presence of romata  before our guests left us the captain ordered the brass gun to be uncovered and fired for their gratification and i have every reason to believe he did so for the purpose of showing our superior power in case the natives should harbour any evil designs against us  romata had never seen this gun before as it had not been uncovered on previous visits and the astonishment with which he viewed it was very amusing  being desirous of knowing its power he begged that the captain would fire it so a shot was put into it  the chiefs were then directed to look at a rock about two miles out at sea and the gun was fired  in a second the top of the rock was seen to burst asunder and to fall in fragments into the sea  romata was so delighted with the success of this shot that he pointed to a man who was walking on the shore and begged the captain to fire at him evidently supposing that his permission was quite sufficient to justify the captain in such an act  he was therefore surprised and not a little annoyed when the captain refused to fire at the native and ordered the gun to be housed  of all the things however that afforded matter of amusement to these savages that which pleased romatas visitor most was the ships pump he never tired of examining it and pumping up the water  indeed so much was he taken up with this pump that he could not be prevailed on to return on shore but sent a canoe to fetch his favourite stool on which he seated himself and spent the remainder of the day in pumping the bilgewater out of the ship  next day the crew went ashore to cut sandalwood while the captain with one or two men remained on board in order to be ready if need be with the brass gun which was unhoused and conspicuously elevated with its capacious muzzle directed pointblank at the chiefs house the men were fully armed as usual and the captain ordered me to go with them to assist in the work  i was much pleased with this order for it freed me from the captains company which i could not now endure and it gave me an opportunity of seeing the natives  as we wound along in single file through the rich fragrant groves of banana cocoanut breadfruit and other trees i observed that there were many of the plum and banyan trees with which i had become familiar on the coral island  i noticed also large quantities of taroroots yams and sweet potatoes growing in enclosures  on turning into an open glade of the woods we came abruptly upon a cluster of native houses they were built chiefly of bamboos and were thatched with the large thick leaves of the pandanus but many of them had little more than a sloping roof and three sides with an open front being the most simple shelter from the weather that could well be imagined  within these and around them were groups of nativesmen women and childrenwho all stood up to gaze at us as we marched along followed by the party of men whom the chief had sent to escort us  about halfamile inland we arrived at the spot where the sandalwood grew and while the men set to work i clambered up an adjoining hill to observe the country  about midday the chief arrived with several followers one of whom carried a baked pig on a wooden platter with yams and potatoes on several plantain leaves which he presented to the men who sat down under the shade of a tree to dine  the chief sat down to dine also but to my surprise instead of feeding himself one of his wives performed that office for him  i was seated beside bill and asked him the reason of this  it is beneath his dignity i believe to feed himself answered bill but i dare say hes not particular except on great occasions  theyve a strange custom among them ralph which is called tabu and they carry it to great lengths  if a man chooses a particular tree for his god the fruit o that tree is tabued to him and if he eats it he is sure to be killed by his peopleand eaten of course for killing means eating hereaway  then you see that great mop o hair on the chiefs head  well he has a lot o barbers to keep it in order and its a law that whoever touches the head of a living chief or the body of a dead one his hands are tabued  so in that way the barbers hands are always tabued and they darent use them for their lives but have to be fed like big babiesas they are sure enough  thats odd bill  but look there said i pointing to a man whose skin was of a much lighter colour than the generality of the natives ive seen a few of these lightskinned fellows among the feejeeans they seem to me to be of quite a different race  so they are answered bill  these fellows come from the tongan islands which lie a long way to the eastward  they come here to build their big warcanoes and as these take two and sometimes four years to build theres always some o the brownskins among the black sarpents o these islands  by the way bill said i your mentioning serpents reminds me that i have not seen a reptile of any kind since i came to this part of the world  no more there are any said bill if ye except the niggers themselves  theres none on the islands but a lizard or two and some sich harmless things but i never seed any myself  if theres none on the land however theres more than enough in the water and that reminds me of a wonderful brute they have here  but come ill show it to you  so saying bill arose and leaving the men still busy with the baked pig led me into the forest  after proceeding a short distance we came upon a small pond of stagnant water  a native lad had followed us to whom we called and beckoned him to come to us  on bill saying a few words to him which i did not understand the boy advanced to the edge of the pond and gave a low peculiar whistle  immediately the water became agitated and an enormous eel thrust its head above the surface and allowed the youth to touch it  it was about twelve feet long and as thick round the body as a mans thigh  there said bill his lip curling with contempt what do you think of that for a god ralph  this is one o their gods and it has been fed with dozens o livin babies already  how many more itll get afore it dies is hard to say  babies said i with an incredulous look  ay babies returned bill  your softhearted folk at home would say oh horrible  impossible to that and then go away as comfortable and unconcerned as if their sayin horrible impossible had made it a lie  but i tell you ralph its a fact  ive seed it with my own eyes the last time i was here an mayhap if you stop awhile at this accursed place and keep a sharp lookout youll see it too  they dont feed it regularly with livin babies but they give it one now and then as a treatbah you brute cried bill in disgust giving the reptile a kick on the snout with his heavy boot that sent it sweltering back in agony into its loathsome pool  i thought it lucky for billindeed for all of usthat the native youths back happened to be turned at the time for i am certain that if the poor savages had come to know that we had so rudely handled their god we should have had to fight our way back to the ship  as we retraced our steps i questioned my companion further on this subject  how comes it bill that the mothers allow such a dreadful thing to be done  allow it the mothers do it  it seems to me that theres nothing too fiendish or diabolical for these people to do  why in some of the islands they have an institution called the areoi and the persons connected with that body are ready for any wickedness that mortal man can devise  in fact they stick at nothing and one o their customs is to murder their infants the moment they are born  the mothers agree to it and the fathers do it  and the mildest ways they have of murdering them is by sticking them through the body with sharp splinters of bamboo strangling them with their thumbs or burying them alive and stamping them to death while under the sod  i felt sick at heart while my companion recited these horrors  but its a curious fact he continued after a pause during which we walked in silence towards the spot where we had left our comradesits a curious fact that wherever the missionaries get a footin all these things come to an end at once an the savages take to doin each other good and singin psalms just like methodists  god bless the missionaries said i while a feeling of enthusiasm filled my heart so that i could speak with difficulty  god bless and prosper the missionaries till they get a footing in every island of the sea  i would say amen to that prayer ralph if i could said bill in a deep sad voice but it would be a mere mockery for a man to ask a blessing for others who dare not ask one for himself  but ralph he continued ive not told you half o the abominations i have seen durin my life in these seas  if we pull long together lad ill tell you more and if times have not changed very much since i was here last its like that youll have a chance o seeing a little for yourself before long    chapter twenty five  the sandalwood partynative childrens games somewhat surprising desperate amusements suddenly and fatally brought to a closean old friend recognisednewsromatas mad conduct  next day the woodcutting party went ashore again and i accompanied them as before  during the dinnerhour i wandered into the woods alone being disinclined for food that day  i had not rambled far when i found myself unexpectedly on the seashore having crossed a narrow neck of land which separated the native village from a large bay  here i found a party of the islanders busy with one of their warcanoes which was almost ready for launching  i stood for a long time watching this party with great interest and observed that they fastened the timbers and planks to each other very much in the same way in which i had seen jack fasten those of our little boat  but what surprised me most was its immense length which i measured carefully and found to be a hundred feet long and it was so capacious that it could have held three hundred men  it had the unwieldy outrigger and enormously high sternposts which i had remarked on the canoe that came to us while i was on the coral island  observing some boys playing at games a short way along the beach i resolved to go and watch them but as i turned from the natives who were engaged so busily and cheerfully at their work i little thought of the terrible event that hung on the completion of that warcanoe  advancing towards the children who were so numerous that i began to think this must be the general playground of the village i sat down on a grassy bank under the shade of a plantaintree to watch them  and a happier or more noisy crew i have never seen  there were at least two hundred of them both boys and girls all of whom were clad in no other garments than their own glossy little black skins except the maro or strip of cloth round the loins of the boys and a very short petticoat or kilt on the girls  they did not all play at the same game but amused themselves in different groups  one band was busily engaged in a game exactly similar to our blind mans buff  another set were walking on stilts which raised the children three feet from the ground  they were very expert at this amusement and seldom tumbled  in another place i observed a group of girls standing together and apparently enjoying themselves very much so i went up to see what they were doing and found that they were opening their eyelids with their fingers till their eyes appeared of an enormous size and then thrusting pieces of straw between the upper and lower lids across the eyeball to keep them in that position  this seemed to me i must confess a very foolish as well as dangerous amusement nevertheless the children seemed to be greatly delighted with the hideous faces they made  i pondered this subject a good deal and thought that if little children knew how silly they seemed to grownup people when they make faces they would not be so fond of doing it  in another place were a number of boys engaged in flying kites and i could not help wondering that some of the games of those little savages should be so like to our own although they had never seen us at play  but the kites were different from ours in many respects being of every variety of shape  they were made of very thin cloth and the boys raised them to a wonderful height in the air by means of twine made from the cocoanut husk  other games there were some of which showed the natural depravity of the hearts of these poor savages and made me wish fervently that missionaries might be sent out to them  but the amusement which the greatest number of the children of both sexes seemed to take chief delight in was swimming and diving in the sea and the expertness which they exhibited was truly amazing  they seemed to have two principal games in the water one of which was to dive off a sort of stage which had been erected near a deep part of the sea and chase each other in the water  some of them went down to an extraordinary depth others skimmed along the surface or rolled over and over like porpoises or diving under each other came up unexpectedly and pulled each other down by a leg or an arm  they never seemed to tire of this sport and from the great heat of the water in the south seas they could remain in it nearly all day without feeling chilled  many of these children were almost infants scarce able to walk yet they staggered down the beach flung their round fat little black bodies fearlessly into deep water and struck out to sea with as much confidence as ducklings  the other game to which i have referred was swimming in the surf  but as this is an amusement in which all engage from children of ten to greyheaded men of sixty and as i had an opportunity of witnessing it in perfection the day following i shall describe it more minutely  i suppose it was in honour of their guest that this grand swimmingmatch was got up for romata came and told the captain that they were going to engage in it and begged him to come and see  what sort of amusement is this surfswimming  i inquired of bill as we walked together to a part of the shore on which several thousands of the natives were assembled  its a very favourite lark with these xtrornary critters replied bill giving a turn to the quid of tobacco that invariably bulged out of his left cheek  ye see ralph them fellows take to the water as soon amost as they can walk an long before they can do that anything respectably so that they are as much at home in the sea as on the land well ye see i spose they found swimmin for miles out to sea and divin fathoms deep wasnt excitin enough so they invented this game o swimmin on the surf  each man and boy as you see has got a short board or plank with which he swims out for a mile or more to sea and then gettin on the top o yon thunderin breaker they come to shore on the top of it yellin and screechin like fiends  its a marvel to me that theyre not dashed to shivers on the coral reef for sure an sartin am i that if any o us tried it we wouldnt be worth the fluke of a broken anchor after the wave fell  but there they go  as he spoke several hundreds of the natives amongst whom we were now standing uttered a loud yell rushed down the beach plunged into the surf and were carried off by the seething foam of the retreating wave  at the point where we stood the encircling coral reef joined the shore so that the magnificent breakers which a recent stiff breeze had rendered larger than usual fell in thunder at the feet of the multitudes who lined the beach  for some time the swimmers continued to strike out to sea breasting over the swell like hundreds of black seals  then they all turned and watching an approaching billow mounted its white crest and each laying his breast on the short flat board came rolling towards the shore careering on the summit of the mighty wave while they and the onlookers shouted and yelled with excitement  just as the monster wave curled in solemn majesty to fling its bulky length upon the beach most of the swimmers slid back into the trough behind others slipping off their boards seized them in their hands and plunging through the watery waste swam out to repeat the amusement but a few who seemed to me the most reckless continued their career until they were launched upon the beach and enveloped in the churning foam and spray  one of these last came in on the crest of the wave most manfully and landed with a violent bound almost on the spot where bill and i stood  i saw by his peculiar headdress that he was the chief whom the tribe entertained as their guest  the seawater had removed nearly all the paint with which his face had been covered and as he rose panting to his feet i recognised to my surprise the features of tararo my old friend of the coral island  tararo at the same moment recognised me and advancing quickly took me round the neck and rubbed noses which had the effect of transferring a good deal of the moist paint from his nose to mine  then recollecting that this was not the white mans mode of salutation he grasped me by the hand and shook it violently  hallo ralph cried bill in surprise that chap seems to have taken a sudden fancy to you or he must be an old acquaintance  right bill i replied he is indeed an old acquaintance  and i explained in a few words that he was the chief whose party jack and peterkin and i had helped to save  tararo having thrown away his surfboard entered into an animated conversation with bill pointing frequently during the course of it to me whereby i concluded he must be telling him about the memorable battle and the part we had taken in it  when he paused i begged of bill to ask him about the woman avatea for i had some hope that she might have come with tararo on this visit  and ask him said i who she is for i am persuaded she is of a different race from the feejeeans on the mention of her name the chief frowned darkly and seemed to speak with much anger  youre right ralph said bill when the chief had ceased to talk shes not a feejee girl but a samoan  how she ever came to this place the chief does not very clearly explain but he says she was taken in war and that he got her three years ago an kept her as his daughter ever since  lucky for her poor girl else shed have been roasted and eaten like the rest  but why does tararo frown and look so angry said i  because the girls somewhat obstinate like most o the sex an wont marry the man he wants her to  it seems that a chief of some other island came on a visit to tararo and took a fancy to her but she wouldnt have him on no account bein already in love and engaged to a young chief whom tararo hates and she kicked up a desperate shindy so as he was goin on a warexpedition in his canoe he left her to think about it sayin hed be back in six months or so when he hoped she wouldnt be so obstropolous  this happened just a week ago an tararo says that if shes not ready to go when the chief returns as his bride shell be sent to him as a long pig  as a long pig  i exclaimed in surprise  why what does he mean by that  he means somethin very unpleasant answered bill with a frown  you see these blackguards eat men an women just as readily as they eat pigs and as baked pigs and baked men are very like each other in appearance they call men long pigs  if avatea goes to this fellow as a long pig its all up with her poor thing  is she on the island now  i asked eagerly  no shes at tararos island  and where does it lie  about fifty or sixty miles to the southard o this returned bill but i  at this moment we were startled by the cry of mao maoa shark a shark which was immediately followed by a shriek that rang clear and fearfully loud above the tumult of cries that arose from the savages in the water and on the land  we turned hastily towards the direction whence the cry came and had just time to observe the glaring eyeballs of one of the swimmers as he tossed his arms in the air  next instant he was pulled under the waves  a canoe was instantly launched and the hand of the drowning man was caught but only half of his body was dragged from the maw of the monster which followed the canoe until the water became so shallow that it could scarcely swim  the crest of the next billow was tinged with red as it rolled towards the shore  in most countries of the world this would have made a deep impression on the spectators but the only effect it had upon these islanders was to make them hurry with all speed out of the sea lest a similar fate should befall some of the others  but so utterly reckless were they of human life that it did not for a moment suspend the progress of their amusements  it is true the surfswimming ended for that time somewhat abruptly but they immediately proceeded with other games  bill told me that sharks do not often attack the surfswimmers being frightened away by the immense numbers of men and boys in the water and by the shouting and splashing that they make  but said he such a thing as you have seen just now dont frighten them much  theyll be at it again tomorrow or next day just as if there wasnt a single shark between feejee and nova zembla  after this the natives had a series of wrestling and boxing matches and being men of immense size and muscle they did a good deal of injury to each other especially in boxing in which not only the lower orders but several of the chiefs and priests engaged  each bout was very quickly terminated for they did not pretend to a scientific knowledge of the art and wasted no time in sparring but hit straight out at each others heads and their blows were delivered with great force frequently one of the combatants was knocked down with a single blow and one gigantic fellow hit his adversary so severely that he drove the skin entirely off his forehead  this feat was hailed with immense applause by the spectators  during these exhibitions which were very painful to me though i confess i could not refrain from beholding them i was struck with the beauty of many of the figures and designs that were tattooed on the persons of the chiefs and principal men  one figure that seemed to me very elegant was that of a palmtree tattooed on the back of a mans leg the roots rising as it were from under his heel the stem ascending the tendon of the ankle and the graceful head branching out upon the calf  i afterwards learned that this process of tattooing is very painful and takes long to do commencing at the age of ten and being continued at intervals up to the age of thirty  it is done by means of an instrument made of bone with a number of sharp teeth with which the skin is punctured  into these punctures a preparation made from the kernel of the candlenut mixed with cocoanut oil is rubbed and the mark thus made is indelible  the operation is performed by a class of men whose profession it is and they tattoo as much at a time as the person on whom they are operating can bear which is not much the pain and inflammation caused by tattooing being very great sometimes causing death  some of the chiefs were tattooed with an ornamental stripe down the legs which gave them the appearance of being clad in tights others had marks round the ankles and insteps which looked like tightfitting and elegant boots  their faces were also tattooed and their breasts were very profusely marked with every imaginable species of devicemuskets dogs birds pigs clubs and canoes intermingled with lozenges squares circles and other arbitrary figures  the women were not tattooed so much as the men having only a few marks on their feet and arms  but i must say however objectionable this strange practice may be it nevertheless had this good effectthat it took away very much from their appearance of nakedness  next day while we were returning from the woods to our schooner we observed romata rushing about in the neighbourhood of his house apparently mad with passion  ah said bill to me there hes at his old tricks again  thats his way when he gets drink  the natives make a sort of drink o their own and it makes him bad enough but when he gets brandy hes like a wild tiger  the captain i suppose has given him a bottle as usual to keep him in goodhumour  after drinkin he usually goes to sleep and the people know it well and keep out of his way for fear they should waken him  even the babies are taken out of earshot for when hes waked up he rushes out just as you see him now and spears or clubs the first person he meets  it seemed at the present time however that no deadly weapon had been in his way for the infuriated chief was raging about without one suddenly he caught sight of an unfortunate man who was trying to conceal himself behind a tree  rushing towards him romata struck him a terrible blow on the head which knocked out the poor mans eye and also dislocated the chiefs finger  the wretched creature offered no resistance he did not even attempt to parry the blow  indeed from what bill said i found that he might consider himself lucky in having escaped with his life which would certainly have been forfeited had the chief been possessed of a club at the time  have these wretched creatures no law among themselves said i which can restrain such wickedness  none replied bill  the chiefs word is law  he might kill and eat a dozen of his own subjects any day for nothing more than his own pleasure and nobody would take the least notice of it  this ferocious deed took place within sight of our party as we wended our way to the beach but i could not observe any other expression on the faces of the men than that of total indifference or contempt  it seemed to me a very awful thing that it should be possible for men to come to such hardness of heart and callousness to the sight of bloodshed and violence but indeed i began to find that such constant exposure to scenes of blood was having a slight effect upon myself and i shuddered when i came to think that i too was becoming callous  i thought upon this subject much that night while i walked up and down the deck during my hours of watch and i came to the conclusion that if i who hated abhorred and detested such bloody deeds as i had witnessed within the last few weeks could so soon come to be less sensitive about them how little wonder that these poor ignorant savages who were born and bred in familiarity therewith should think nothing of them at all and should hold human life in so very slight esteem    chapter twenty six  mischief brewingmy blood is made to run coldevil consultations and wicked resolvesbloody bill attempts to do good and failsthe attackwholesale murderthe flightthe escape  next morning i awoke with a feverish brow and a feeling of deep depression at my heart and the more i thought on my unhappy fate the more wretched and miserable did i feel  i was surrounded on all sides by human beings of the most dreadful character to whom the shedding of blood was mere pastime  on shore were the natives whose practices were so horrible that i could not think of them without shuddering  on board were none but pirates of the blackest dye who although not cannibals were foul murderers and more blameworthy even than the savages inasmuch as they knew better  even bill with whom i had under the strange circumstances of my lot formed a kind of intimacy was so fierce in his nature as to have acquired the title of bloody from his vile companions  i felt very much cast down the more i considered the subject and the impossibility of delivery as it seemed to meat least for a long time to come  at last in my feeling of utter helplessness i prayed fervently to the almighty that he would deliver me out of my miserable condition and when i had done so i felt some degree of comfort  when the captain came on deck before the hour at which the men usually started for the woods i begged of him to permit me to remain aboard that day as i did not feel well but he looked at me angrily and ordered me in a surly tone to get ready to go on shore as usual  the fact was that the captain had been out of humour for some time past romata and he had had some differences and high words had passed between them during which the chief had threatened to send a fleet of his warcanoes with a thousand men to break up and burn the schooner whereupon the captain smiled sarcastically and going up to the chief gazed sternly in his face while he said i have only to raise my little finger just now and my big gun will blow your whole village to atoms in five minutes  although the chief was a bold man he quailed before the pirates glance and threat and made no reply but a bad feeling had been raised and old sores had been opened  i had therefore to go with the woodcutters that day  before starting however the captain called me into the cabin and said  here ralph ive got a mission for you lad  that blackguard romata is in the dumps and nothing will mollify him but a gift so do you go up to his house and give him these whales teeth with my compliments take with you one of the men who can speak the language  i looked at the gift in some surprise for it consisted of six white whales teeth and two of the same dyed bright red which seemed to me very paltry things  however i did not dare to hesitate or to ask any questions so gathering them up i left the cabin and was soon on my way to the chiefs house accompanied by bill  on expressing my surprise at the gift he said  theyre paltry enough to you or me ralph but theyre considered of great value by them chaps  theyre a sort o cash among them  the red ones are the most prized one of them bein equal to twenty o the white ones  i suppose the only reason for their bein valuable is that there aint many of them and theyre hard to be got  on arriving at the house we found romata sitting on a mat in the midst of a number of large bales of native cloth and other articles which had been brought to him as presents from time to time by inferior chiefs he received us rather haughtily but on bill explaining the nature of our errand he became very condescending and his eyes glistened with satisfaction when he received the whales teeth although he laid them aside with an assumption of kingly indifference  go said he with a wave of the handgo tell your captain that he may cut wood today but not tomorrow  he must come ashore i want to have a palaver with him  as we left the house to return to the woods bill shook his head  theres mischief brewin in that black rascals head  i know him of old  but what comes here  as he spoke we heard the sound of laughter and shouting in the wood and presently there issued from it a band of savages in the midst of whom were a number of men bearing burdens on their shoulders  at first i thought that these burdens were poles with something rolled round them the end of each pole resting on a mans shoulder but on a nearer approach i saw that they were human beings tied hand and foot and so lashed to the poles that they could not move  i counted twenty of them as they passed  more murder said bill in a voice that sounded between a hoarse laugh and a groan  surely they are not going to murder them said i looking anxiously into bills face  i dont know ralph replied bill what theyre goin to do with them but i fear they mean no good when they tie fellows up in that way  as we continued our way towards the woodcutters i observed that bill looked anxiously over his shoulder in the direction where the procession had disappeared  at last he stopped and turning abruptly on his heel said  i tell ye what it is ralph i must be at the bottom o that affair let us follow these black scoundrels and see what theyre goin to do  i must say i had no wish to pry further into their bloody practices but bill seemed bent on it so i turned and went  we passed rapidly through the bush being guided in the right direction by the shouts of the savages  suddenly there was a dead silence which continued for some time while bill and i involuntarily quickened our pace until we were running at the top of our speed across the narrow neck of land previously mentioned  as we reached the verge of the wood we discovered the savages surrounding the large warcanoe which they were apparently on the point of launching  suddenly the multitude put their united strength to the canoe but scarcely had the huge machine begun to move when a yell the most appalling that ever fell upon my ear rose high above the shouting of the savages  it had not died away when another and another smote upon my throbbing ear and then i saw that these inhuman monsters were actually launching their canoe over the living bodies of their victims  but there was no pity in the breasts of these men  forward they went in ruthless indifference shouting as they went while high above their voices rang the dying shrieks of those wretched creatures as one after another the ponderous canoe passed over them burst the eyeballs from their sockets and sent the lifeblood gushing from their mouths  oh reader this is no fiction  i would not for the sake of thrilling you with horror invent so terrible a scene  it was witnessed  it is truetrue as that accursed sin which has rendered the human heart capable of such diabolical enormities  when it was over i turned round and fell upon the grass with a deep groan but bill seized me by the arm and lifting me up as if i had been a child cried  come along lad lets away  and so staggering and stumbling over the tangled underwood we fled from the fatal spot  during the remainder of that day i felt as if i were in a horrible dream  i scarce knew what was said to me and was more than once blamed by the men for idling my time  at last the hour to return aboard came we marched down to the beach and i felt relief for the first time when my feet rested on the schooners deck  in the course of the evening i overheard part of a conversation between the captain and the first mate which startled me not a little  they were down in the cabin and conversed in an undertone but the skylight being off i overhead every word that was said  i dont halflike it said the mate  it seems to me that well only have hard fightin and no pay  no pay repeated the captain in a voice of suppressed anger  do you call a good cargo all for nothing no pay  very true returned the mate but weve got the cargo aboard  why not cut your cable and take french leave o them  whats the use o tryin to kill the blackguards when itll do us no manner o good  mate said the captain in a low voice you talk like a freshwater sailor  i can only attribute this shyness to some strange delusion for surelyhis voice assumed a slightly sneering tone as he said thissurely i am not to suppose that you have become softhearted besides you are wrong in regard to the cargo being aboard theres a good quarter of it lying in the woods and that blackguard chief knows it and wont let me take it off  he defied us to do our worst yesterday  defied us did he cried the mate with a bitter laugh  poor contemptible thing  and yet he seems not so contemptible but that you are afraid to attack him  who said i was afraid growled the mate sulkily  im as ready as any man in the ship  but captain what is it that you intend to do  i intend to muffle the sweeps and row the schooner up to the head of the creek there from which point we can command the pile of sandalwood with our gun  then i shall land with all the men except two who shall take care of the schooner and be ready with the boat to take us off  we can creep through the woods to the head of the village where these cannibals are always dancing round their suppers of human flesh and if the carbines of the men are loaded with a heavy charge of buckshot we can drop forty or fifty at the first volley  after that the thing will be easy enough  the savages will take to the mountains in a body and we shall take what we require up anchor and away  to this plan the mate at length agreed  as he left the cabin i heard the captain say  give the men an extra glass of grog and dont forget the buckshot  the reader may conceive the horror with which i heard this murderous conversation  i immediately repeated it to bill who seemed much perplexed about it  at length he said  ill tell you what ill do ralph  ill swim ashore after dark and fix a musket to a tree not far from the place where well have to land and ill tie a long string to the trigger so that when our fellows cross it theyll let it off and so alarm the village in time to prevent an attack but not in time to prevent us gettin back to the boatso master captain added bill with a smile that for the first time seemed to me to be mingled with goodnatured cheerfulness youll be balked at least for once in your life by bloody bill  after it grew dark bill put this resolve in practice  he slipped over the side with a musket in his left hand while with his right he swam ashore and entered the woods  he soon returned having accomplished his purpose and got on board without being seen i being the only one on deck  when the hour of midnight approached the men were mustered on deck the cable was cut and the muffled sweeps got out  these sweeps were immensely large oars each requiring a couple of men to work it  in a few minutes we entered the mouth of the creek which was indeed the mouth of a small river and took about halfanhour to ascend it although the spot where we intended to land was not more than six hundred yards from the mouth because there was a slight current against us and the mangroves which narrowed the creek impeded the rowers in some places  having reached the spot which was so darkened by overhanging trees that we could see with difficulty a small kedgeanchor attached to a thin line was let softly down over the stern  now lads whispered the captain as he walked along the line of men who were all armed to the teeth dont be in a hurry aim low and dont waste your first shots  he then pointed to the boat into which the men crowded in silence there was no room to row but oars were not needed as a slight push against the side of the schooner sent the boat gliding to the shore  theres no need of leaving two in the boat whispered the mate as the men stepped out we shall want all our hands  let ralph stay  the captain assented and ordered me to stand in readiness with the boathook to shove ashore at a moments notice if they should return or to shove off if any of the savages should happen to approach  he then threw his carbine into the hollow of his arm and glided through the bushes followed by his men  with a throbbing heart i awaited the result of our plan  i knew the exact locality where the musket was placed for bill had described it to me and i kept my straining eyes fixed upon the spot  but no sound came and i began to fear that either they had gone in another direction or that bill had not fixed the string properly  suddenly i heard a faint click and observed one or two bright sparks among the bushes  my heart immediately sank within me for i knew at once that the trigger had indeed been pulled but that the priming had not caught  the plan therefore had utterly failed  a feeling of dread now began to creep over me as i stood in the boat in that dark silent spot awaiting the issue of this murderous expedition i shuddered as i glanced at the water that glided past like a dark reptile  i looked back at the schooner but her hull was just barely visible while her tapering masts were lost among the trees which overshadowed her  her lower sails were set but so thick was the gloom that they were quite invisible  suddenly i heard a shot  in a moment a thousand voices raised a yell in the village again the cry rose on the night air and was followed by broken shouts as of scattered parties of men bounding into the woods then i heard another shout loud and close at hand it was the voice of the captain cursing the man who had fired the premature shot  then came the order forward followed by a wild hurrah of our men as they charged the savages  shots now rang in quick succession and at last a loud volley startled the echoes of the woods  it was followed by a multitude of wild shrieks which were immediately drowned in another hurrah from the men the distance of the sound proving that they were driving their enemies before them towards the sea  while i was listening intently to these sounds which were now mingled in confusion i was startled by the rustling of the leaves not far from me  at first i thought it was a party of savages who had observed the schooner but i was speedily undeceived by observing a body of natives apparently several hundreds as far as i could guess in the uncertain lightbounding through the woods towards the scene of battle  i saw at once that this was a party who had outflanked our men and would speedily attack them in the rear  and so it turned out for in a short time the shouts increased tenfold and among them i thought i heard a deathcry uttered by voices familiar to my ear  at length the tumult of battle ceased and from the cries of exultation that now arose from the savages i felt assured that our men had been conquered  i was immediately thrown into dreadful consternation  what was i now to do  to be taken by the savages was too horrible to be thought of to flee to the mountains was hopeless as i should soon be discovered and to take the schooner out of the creek without assistance was impossible  i resolved however to make the attempt as being my only hope and was on the point of pushing off when my hand was stayed and my blood chilled by an appalling shriek in which i recognised the voice of one of the crew  it was succeeded by a shout from the savages then came another and another shriek of agony making my ears to tingle as i felt convinced they were murdering the pirate crew in cold blood  with a bursting heart and my brain whirling as if on fire i seized the boathook to push from shore when a man sprang from the bushes  stop  ralph stop  there now push off he cried and bounded into the boat so violently as nearly to upset her  it was bills voice  in another moment we were on boardthe boat made fast the line of the anchor cut and the sweeps run out  at the first stroke of bills giant arm the schooner was nearly pulled ashore for in his haste he forgot that i could scarcely move the unwieldy oar  springing to the stern he lashed the rudder in such a position as that while it aided me it acted against him and so rendered the force of our strokes nearly equal  the schooner now began to glide quickly down the creek but before we reached its mouth a yell from a thousand voices on the bank told that we were discovered  instantly a number of the savages plunged into the water and swam towards us but we were making so much way that they could not overtake us  one however an immensely powerful man succeeded in laying hold of the cut rope that hung from the stern and clambered quickly upon deck  bill caught sight of him the instant his head appeared above the taffrail  but he did not cease to row and did not appear even to notice the savage until he was within a yard of him then dropping the sweep he struck him a blow on the forehead with his clenched fist that felled him to the deck  lifting him up he hurled him overboard and resumed the oar  but now a greater danger awaited us for the savages had outrun us on the bank and were about to plunge into the water ahead of the schooner  if they succeeded in doing so our fate was sealed  for one moment bill stood irresolute  then drawing a pistol from his belt he sprang to the brass gun held the pan of his pistol over the touchhole and fired  the shot was succeeded by the hiss of the cannons priming then the blaze and the crashing thunder of the monstrous gun burst upon the savages with such deafening roar that it seemed as if their very mountains had been rent asunder  this was enough  the moment of surprise and hesitation caused by the unwonted sound gave us time to pass the point a gentle breeze which the dense foliage had hitherto prevented us from feeling bulged out our sails the schooner bent before it and the shouts of the disappointed savages grew fainter and fainter in the distance as we were slowly wafted out to sea    chapter twenty seven  reflectionsthe wounded manthe squalltrue consolationdeath  there is a power of endurance in human beings both in their bodies and in their minds which i have often thought seems to be wonderfully adapted and exactly proportioned to the circumstances in which individuals may happen to be placeda power which in most cases is sufficient to carry a man through and over every obstacle that may happen to be thrown in his path through life no matter how high or how steep the mountain may be but which often forsakes him the moment the summit is gained the point of difficulty passed and leaves him prostrated with energies gone nerves unstrung and a feeling of incapacity pervading the entire frame that renders the most trifling effort almost impossible  during the greater part of that day i had been subjected to severe mental and much physical excitement which had almost crushed me down by the time i was relieved from duty in the course of the evening  but when the expedition whose failure has just been narrated was planned my anxieties and energies had been so powerfully aroused that i went through the protracted scenes of that terrible night without a feeling of the slightest fatigue  my mind and body were alike active and full of energy  no sooner was the last thrilling fear of danger past however than my faculties were utterly relaxed and when i felt the cool breezes of the pacific playing around my fevered brow and heard the free waves rippling at the schooners prow as we left the hated island behind us my senses forsook me and i fell in a swoon upon the deck  from this state i was quickly aroused by bill who shook me by the arm saying  hallo ralph boy  rouse up lad were safe now  poor thing  i believe hes fainted  and raising me in his arms he laid me on the folds of the gafftopsail which lay upon the deck near the tiller here take a drop o this itll do you good my boy he added in a voice of tenderness which i had never heard him use before while he held a brandyflask to my lips  i raised my eyes gratefully as i swallowed a mouthful next moment my head sank heavily upon my arm and i fell fast asleep  i slept long for when i awoke the sun was a good way above the horizon  i did not move on first opening my eyes as i felt a delightful sensation of rest pervading me and my eyes were riveted on and charmed with the gorgeous splendour of the mighty ocean that burst upon my sight  it was a dead calm the sea seemed a sheet of undulating crystal tipped and streaked with the saffron hues of sunrise which had not yet merged into the glowing heat of noon and there was a deep calm in the blue dome above that was not broken even by the usual flutter of the seafowl  how long i would have lain in contemplation of this peaceful scene i know not but my mind was recalled suddenly and painfully to the past and the present by the sight of bill who was seated on the deck at my feet with his head reclining as if in sleep on his right arm which rested on the tiller  as he seemed to rest peacefully i did not mean to disturb him but the slight noise i made in raising myself on my elbow caused him to start and look round  well ralph awake at last my boy  you have slept long and soundly he said turning towards me  on beholding his countenance i sprang up in anxiety  he was deadly pale and his hair which hung in dishevelled locks over his face was clotted with blood  blood also stained his hollow cheeks and covered the front of his shirt which with the greater part of his dress was torn and soiled with mud  oh bill said i with deep anxiety what is the matter with you  you are ill  you must have been wounded  even so lad said bill in a deep soft voice while he extended his huge frame on the couch from which i had just risen  ive got an ugly wound i fear and ive been waiting for you to waken to ask you to get me a drop o brandy and a mouthful o bread from the cabin lockers  you seemed to sleep so sweetly ralph that i didnt like to disturb you but i dont feel up to much just now  i did not wait till he had done talking but ran below immediately and returned in a few seconds with a bottle of brandy and some broken biscuit  he seemed much refreshed after eating a few morsels and drinking a long draught of water mingled with a little of the spirits immediately afterwards he fell asleep and i watched him anxiously until he awoke being desirous of knowing the nature and extent of his wound  ha he exclaimed on awaking suddenly after a slumber of an hour im the better of that nap ralph  i feel twice the man i was and he attempted to rise but sank back again immediately with a deep groan  nay bill you must not move but lie still while i look at your wound ill make a comfortable bed for you here on deck and get you some breakfast  after that you shall tell me how you got it  cheer up bill  i added seeing that he turned his head away youll be all right in a little and ill be a capital nurse to you though im no doctor  i then left him and lighted a fire in the caboose  while it was kindling i went to the stewards pantry and procured the materials for a good breakfast with which in little more than halfanhour i returned to my companion  he seemed much better and smiled kindly on me as i set before him a cup of coffee and a tray with several eggs and some bread on it  now then bill said i cheerfully sitting down beside him on the deck lets fall to  im very hungry myself i can tell you  buti forgotyour wound i added rising let me look at it  i found that the wound was caused by a pistolshot in the chest  it did not bleed much and as it was on the right side i was in hopes that it might not be very serious  but bill shook his head  however said he sit down ralph and ill tell you all about it  you see after we left the boat an began to push through the bushes we went straight for the line of my musket as i had expected  but by some unlucky chance it didnt explode for i saw the line torn away by the mens legs and heard the click o the lock so i fancy the priming had got damp and didnt catch  i was in a great quandary now what to do for i couldnt concoct in my mind in the hurry any good reason for firin off my piece  but they say necessitys the mother of invention so just as i was giving it up and clinchin my teeth to bide the worst ot and take what should come a sudden thought came into my head  i stepped out before the rest seemin to be awful anxious to be at the savages tripped my foot on a fallen tree plunged head foremost into a bush an ov coorse my carbine exploded  then came such a screechin from the camp as i never heard in all my life  i rose at once and was rushin on with the rest when the captain called a halt  you did that a purpose you villain he said with a tremendous oath and drawin a pistol from his belt let fly right into my breast  i fell at once and remembered no more till i was startled and brought round by the most awful yell i ever heard in my lifeexcept maybe the shrieks o them poor critters that were crushed to death under yon big canoe  jumpin up i looked round and through the trees saw a fire gleamin not far off the light of which showed me the captain and men tied hand and foot each to a post and the savages dancin round them like demons  i had scarce looked for a second when i saw one o them go up to the captain flourishing a knife and before i could wink he plunged it into his breast while another yell like the one that roused me rang upon my ear  i didnt wait for more but bounding up went crashing through the bushes into the woods  the black fellows caught sight of me however but not in time to prevent me jumpin into the boat as you know  bill seemed to be much exhausted after this recital and shuddered frequently during the narrative so i refrained from continuing the subject at that time and endeavoured to draw his mind to other things  but now bill said i it behoves us to think about the future and what course of action we shall pursue  here we are on the wide pacific in a wellappointed schooner which is our ownat least no one has a better claim to it than we haveand the world lies before us moreover here comes a breeze so we must make up our minds which way to steer  ralph boy said my companion it matters not to me which way we go i fear that my time is short now  go where you will im content  well then bill i think we had better steer to the coral island and see what has become of my dear old comrades jack and peterkin  i believe the island has no name but the captain once pointed it out to me on the chart and i marked it afterwards so as we know pretty well our position just now i think i can steer to it  then as to working the vessel it is true i cannot hoist the sails singlehanded but luckily we have enough of sail set already and if it should come on to blow a squall i could at least drop the peaks of the main and fore sails and clew them up partially without help and throw her head close into the wind so as to keep her all shaking till the violence of the squall is past  and if we have continued light breezes ill rig up a complication of blocks and fix them to the topsail halyards so that i shall be able to hoist the sails without help  tis true ill require halfaday to hoist them but we dont need to mind that  then ill make a sort of erection on deck to screen you from the sun bill and if you can only manage to sit beside the tiller and steer for two hours every day so as to let me get a nap ill engage to let you off duty all the rest of the twentyfour hours  and if you dont feel able for steering ill lash the helm and heaveto while i get you your breakfasts and dinners and so well manage famously and soon reach the coral island  bill smiled faintly as i ran on in this strain  and what will you do said he if it comes on to blow a storm  this question silenced me while i considered what i should do in such a case  at length i laid my hand on his arm and said bill when a man has done all that he can do he ought to leave the rest to god  oh ralph said my companion in a faint voice looking anxiously into my face i wish that i had the feelins about god that you seem to have at this hour  im dyin ralph yet i who have braved death a hundred times am afraid to die  im afraid to enter the next world something within tells me there will be a reckoning when i go there but its all over with me ralph  i feel that theres no chance o my bein saved  dont say that bill said i in deep compassion dont say that  im quite sure theres hope even for you but i cant remember the words of the bible that make me think so  is there not a bible on board bill  no the last that was in the ship belonged to a poor boy that was taken aboard against his will  he died poor ladi think through illtreatment and fear  after he was gone the captain found his bible and flung it overboard  i now reflected with great sadness and selfreproach on the way in which i had neglected my bible and it flashed across me that i was actually in the sight of god a greater sinner than this bloodstained pirate for thought i he tells me that he never read the bible and was never brought up to care for it whereas i was carefully taught to read it by my own mother and had read it daily as long as i possessed one yet to so little purpose that i could not now call to mind a single text that would meet this poor mans case and afford him the consolation he so much required  i was much distressed and taxed my memory for a long time  at last a text did flash into my mind and i wondered much that i had not thought of it before  bill said i in a low voice believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved  ay ralph ive heard the missionaries say that before now but what good can it do me  its not for me that its not for the likes o me  i knew not now what to say for although i felt sure that that word was for him as well as for me i could not remember any other word whereby i could prove it  after a short pause bill raised his eyes to mine and said ralph ive led a terrible life  ive been a sailor since i was a boy and ive gone from bad to worse ever since i left my fathers roof  ive been a pirate three years now  it is true i did not choose the trade but i was inveigled aboard this schooner and kept here by force till i became reckless and at last joined them  since that time my hand has been steeped in human blood again and again  your young heart would grow cold if ibut why should i go on  tis of no use ralph my doom is fixed  bill said i though your sins be red like crimson they shall be white as snow  only believe  only believe cried bill starting up on his elbow  ive heard men talk o believing as if it was easy  ha tis easy enough for a man to point to a rope and say i believe that would bear my weight but tis another thing for a man to catch hold o that rope and swing himself by it over the edge of a precipice  the energy with which he said this and the action with which it was accompanied were too much for bill  he sank back with a deep groan as if the very elements sympathised with this mans sufferings a low moan came sweeping over the sea  hist ralph said bill opening his eyes theres a squall coming lad  look alive boy  clew up the foresail  drop the mainsail peak them squalls come quick sometimes  i had already started to my feet and saw that a heavy squall was indeed bearing down on us  it had hitherto escaped my notice owing to my being so much engrossed by our conversation  i instantly did as bill desired for the schooner was lying motionless on the glassy sea  i observed with some satisfaction that the squall was bearing down on the larboard bow so that it would strike the vessel in the position in which she would be best able to stand the shock  having done my best to shorten sail i returned aft and took my stand at the helm  now boy said bill in a faint voice keep her close to the wind  a few seconds afterwards he said ralph let me hear those two texts again  i repeated them  are ye sure lad ye saw them in the bible  quite sure i replied  almost before the words had left my lips the wind burst upon us and the spray dashed over our decks  for a time the schooner stood it bravely and sprang forward against the rising sea like a warhorse  meanwhile clouds darkened the sky and the sea began to rise in huge billows there was still too much sail on the schooner and as the gale increased i feared that the masts would be torn out of her or carried away while the wind whistled and shrieked through the strained rigging suddenly the wind shifted a point a heavy sea struck us on the bow and the schooner was almost laid on her beamends so that i could scarcely keep my legs  at the same moment bill lost his hold of the belayingpin which had served to steady him and he slid with stunning violence against the skylight  as he lay on the deck close beside me i could see that the shock had rendered him insensible but i did not dare to quit the tiller for an instant as it required all my faculties bodily and mental to manage the schooner  for an hour the blast drove us along while owing to the sharpness of the vessels bow and the press of canvas she dashed through the waves instead of breasting over them thereby drenching the decks with water fore and aft  at the end of that time the squall passed away and left us rocking on the bosom of the agitated sea  my first care the instant i could quit the helm was to raise bill from the deck and place him on the couch  i then ran below for the brandybottle and rubbed his face and hands with it and endeavoured to pour a little down his throat  but my efforts although i continued them long and assiduously were of no avail as i let go the hand which i had been chafing it fell heavily on the deck  i laid my hand over his heart and sat for some time quite motionless but there was no flutter therethe pirate was dead    chapter twenty eight  alone on the deepnecessity the mother of inventiona valuable book discoverednatural phenomenona bright day in my history  it was with feelings of awe not unmingled with fear that i now seated myself on the cabin skylight and gazed upon the rigid features of my late comrade while my mind wandered over his past history and contemplated with anxiety my present position  alone in the midst of the wide pacific having a most imperfect knowledge of navigation and in a schooner requiring at least eight men as her proper crew  but i will not tax the readers patience with a minute detail of my feelings and doings during the first few days that followed the death of my companion  i will merely mention that i tied a cannonball to his feet and with feelings of the deepest sorrow consigned him to the deep  for fully a week after that a steady breeze blew from the east and as my course lay west and by north i made rapid progress towards my destination  i could not take an observation which i very much regretted as the captains quadrant was in the cabin but from the day of setting sail from the island of the savages i had kept a dead reckoning and as i knew pretty well now how much leeway the schooner made i hoped to hit the coral island without much difficulty  in this i was the more confident that i knew its position on the chartwhich i understood was a very good oneand so had its correct bearings by compass  as the weather seemed now quite settled and fine and as i had got into the tradewinds i set about preparations for hoisting the topsails this was a most arduous task and my first attempts were complete failures owing in a great degree to my reprehensible ignorance of mechanical forces  the first error i made was in applying my apparatus of blocks and pulleys to a rope which was too weak so that the very first heave i made broke it in two and sent me staggering against the afterhatch over which i tripped and striking against the mainboom tumbled down the companionladder into the cabin  i was much bruised and somewhat stunned by this untoward accident  however i considered it fortunate that i was not killed  in my next attempt i made sure of not coming by a similar accident so i unreeved the tackling and fitted up larger blocks and ropes  but although the principle on which i acted was quiet correct the machinery was now so massive and heavy that the mere friction and stiffness of the thick cordage prevented me from moving it at all  afterwards however i came to proportion things more correctly but i could not avoid reflecting at the time how much better it would have been had i learned all this from observation and study instead of waiting till i was forced to acquire it through the painful and tedious lessons of experience  after the tackling was prepared and in good working order it took me the greater part of a day to hoist the main topsail  as i could not steer and work at this at the same time i lashed the helm in such a position that with a little watching now and then it kept the schooner in her proper course  by this means i was enabled also to go about the deck and down below for things that i wanted as occasion required also to cook and eat my victuals  but i did not dare to trust to this plan during the three hours of rest that i allowed myself at night as the wind might have shifted in which case i should have been blown far out of my course ere i awoke  i was therefore in the habit of heavingto during those three hoursthat is fixing the rudder and the sails in such a position as that by acting against each other they would keep the ship stationary  after my nights rest therefore i had only to make allowance for the leeway she had made and so resume my course  of course i was to some extent anxious lest another squall should come but i made the best provision i could in the circumstances and concluded that by letting go the weatherbraces of the topsails and the topsail halyards at the same time i should thereby render these sails almost powerless  besides this i proposed to myself to keep a sharp lookout on the barometer in the cabin and if i observed at any time a sudden fall in it i resolved that i would instantly set about my multiform appliances for reducing sail so as to avoid being taken unawares  thus i sailed prosperously for two weeks with a fair wind so that i calculated i must be drawing near to the coral island at the thought of which my heart bounded with joyful expectation  the only book i found on board after a careful search was a volume of captain cooks voyages  this i suppose the pirate captain had brought with him in order to guide him and to furnish him with information regarding the islands of these seas  i found this a most delightful book indeed and i not only obtained much interesting knowledge about the sea in which i was sailing but i had many of my own opinions derived from experience corroborated and not a few of them corrected besides the reading of this charming book and the daily routine of occupations nothing of particular note happened to me during this voyageexcept once when on rising one night after my three hours nap while it was yet dark i was amazed and a little alarmed to find myself floating in what appeared to be a sea of blue fire  i had often noticed the beautiful appearance of phosphorescent light but this far exceeded anything of the sort i ever saw before  the whole sea appeared somewhat like milk and was remarkably luminous  i rose in haste and letting down a bucket into the sea brought some of the water on board and took it down to the cabin to examine it but no sooner did i approach the light than the strange appearance disappeared and when i removed the cabin lamp the luminous light appeared again  i was much puzzled with this and took up a little of the water in the hollow of my hand and then let it run off when i found that the luminous substance was left behind on my palm  i ran with it to the lamp but when i got there it was gone  i found however that when i went into the dark my hand shone again so i took the large glass of the ships telescope and examined my hand minutely when i found that there were on it one or two small patches of a clear transparent substance like jelly which were so thin as to be almost invisible to the naked eye  thus i came to know that the beautiful phosphoric light which i had so often admired before was caused by animals for i had no doubt that these were of the same kind as the medusa or jellyfish which are seen in all parts of the world  on the evening of my fourteenth day i was awakened out of a nap into which i had fallen by a loud cry and starting up i gazed around me  i was surprised and delighted to see a large albatross soaring majestically over the ship  i immediately took it into my head that this was the albatross i had seen at penguin island  i had of course no good reason for supposing this but the idea occurred to me i know not why and i cherished it and regarded the bird with as much affection as if he had been an old friend  he kept me company all that day and left me as night fell  next morning as i stood motionless and with heavy eyes at the helmfor i had not slept welli began to weary anxiously for daylight and peered towards the horizon where i thought i observed something like a black cloud against the dark sky  being always on the alert for squalls i ran to the bow  there could be no doubt it was a squall and as i listened i thought i heard the murmur of the coming gale instantly i began to work might and main at my cumbrous tackle for shortening sail and in the course of an hour and a half had the most of it reducedthe topsail yards down on the caps the topsails clewed up the sheets hauled in the main and fore peaks lowered and the flyingjib down  while thus engaged the dawn advanced and i cast an occasional furtive glance ahead in the midst of my labour  but now that things were prepared for the worst i ran forward again and looked anxiously over the bow  i now heard the roar of the waves distinctly and as a single ray of the rising sun gleamed over the ocean i saw what could it be that i was dreamingthat magnificent breaker with its ceaseless roarthat mountaintop  yes once more i beheld the coral island    chapter twenty nine  the effect of a cannonshota happy reunion of a somewhat moist natureretrospect and explanationsan awful divenew plansthe last of the coral island  i almost fell upon the deck with the tumult of mingled emotions that filled my heart as i gazed ardently towards my beautiful island  it was still many miles away but sufficiently near to enable me to trace distinctly the wellremembered outlines of the two mountains  my first impulse was to utter an exclamation of gratitude for being carried to my former happy home in safety my second to jump up clap my hands shout and run up and down the deck with no other object in view than that of giving vent to my excited feelings  then i went below for the telescope and spent nearly ten minutes of the utmost impatience in vainly trying to get a focus and in rubbing the skin nearly off my eyes before i discovered that having taken off the large glass to examine the phosphoric water with i had omitted to put it on again  after that i looked up impatiently at the sails which i now regretted having lowered so hastily and for a moment thought of hoisting the main topsail again but recollecting that it would take me full halfaday to accomplish and that at the present rate of sailing two hours would bring me to the island i immediately dismissed the idea  the remainder of the time i spent in making feverish preparations for arriving and seeing my dear comrades  i remembered that they were not in the habit of rising before six and as it was now only three i hoped to arrive before they were awake  moreover i set about making ready to let go the anchor resolving in my own mind that as i knew the depth of water in the passage of the reef and within the lagoon i would run the schooner in and bring up opposite the bower  fortunately the anchor was hanging at the cathead otherwise i should never have been able to use it  now i had only to cut the tackling and it would drop of its own weight  after searching among the flags i found the terrible black one which i ran up to the peak  while i was doing this a thought struck me  i went to the powdermagazine brought up a blank cartridge and loaded the big brass gun which it will be remembered was unhoused when we set sail and as i had no means of housing it there it had stood bristling alike at fair weather and foul all the voyage  i took care to grease its mouth well and before leaving the fore part of the ship thrust the poker into the fire  all was now ready  a steady fiveknot breeze was blowing so that i was now not more than quarter of a mile from the reef  i was soon at the entrance and as the schooner glided quickly through i glanced affectionately at the huge breaker as if it had been the same one i had seen there when i bade adieu as i feared for ever to the island  on coming opposite the water garden i put the helm hard down  the schooner came round with a rapid graceful bend and lost way just opposite the bower  running forward i let go the anchor caught up the redhot poker applied it to the brass gun and saluted the mountains with a bang such as had only once before broke their slumbering echoes  effective although it was however it was scarcely equal to the bang with which instantly after peterkin bounded from the bower in scanty costume his eyeballs starting from his head with surprise and terror one gaze he gave one yell and then fled into the bushes like a wild cat  the next moment jack went through exactly the same performance the only difference being that his movements were less like those of jackinthebox though not less vigorous and rapid than those of peterkin  hallo  i shouted almost mad with joy  what ho  peterkin  jack hallo its me  my shout was just in time to arrest them  they halted and turned round and the instant i repeated the cry i saw that they recognised my voice by both of them running at full speed towards the beach  i could no longer contain myself  throwing off my jacket i jumped overboard at the same moment that jack bounded into the sea  in other moment we met in deep water clasped each other round the neck and sank as a matter of course to the bottom  we were wellnigh choked and instantly struggled to the surface where peterkin was spluttering about like a wounded duck laughing and crying by turns and choking himself with salt water  it would be impossible to convey to my reader by description an adequate conception of the scene that followed my landing on the beach as we stood embracing each other indiscriminately in our dripping garments and giving utterance to incoherent rhapsodies mingled with wild shouts  it can be more easily imagined than described so i will draw a curtain over this part of my history and carry the reader forward over an interval of three days  during the greater part of that period peterkin did nothing but roast pigs taro and breadfruit and ply me with plantains plums potatoes and cocoanuts while i related to him and jack the terrible and wonderful adventures i had gone through since we last met  after i had finished the account they made me go all over it again and when i had concluded the second recital i had to go over it again while they commented upon it piecemeal  they were much affected by what i told them of the probable fate of avatea and peterkin could by no means brook the idea of the poor girl being converted into a long pig  as for jack he clenched his teeth and shook his fist towards the sea saying at the same time that he was sorry he had not broken tararos head and he only hoped that one day he should be able to plant his knuckles on the bridge of that chiefs nose  after they had pumped me dry as peterkin said i begged to be informed of what had happened to them during my long absence and particularly as to how they got out of the diamond cave  well you must know began jack after you had dived out of the cave on the day you were taken away from us we waited very patiently for halfanhour not expecting you to return before the end of that time then we began to upbraid you for staying so long when you knew we would be anxious but when an hour passed we became alarmed and i resolved at all hazards to dive out and see what had become of you although i felt for poor peterkin because as he truly said if you never come back im shut up here for life  however i promised not to run any risk and he let me gowhich to say truth i thought very courageous of him  i should just think it was interrupted peterkin looking at jack over the edge of a monstrous potato which he happened to be devouring at the time  well continued jack you may guess my consternation when you did not answer to my halloo  at first i imagined that the pirates must have killed you and left you in the bush or thrown you into the sea then it occurred to me that this would have served no end of theirs so i came to the conclusion that they must have carried you away with them  as this thought struck me i observed the pirate schooner standing away to the norard almost hull down on the horizon and i sat down on the rocks to watch her as she slowly sank from my sight  and i tell you ralph my boy that i shed more tears that time at losing you than i have done i verily believe all my life before  pardon me jack for interrupting said peterkin surely you must be mistaken in that  youve often told me that when you were a baby you used to howl and roar from morning to  hold your tongue peterkin cried jackwell after the schooner had disappeared i dived back into the cave much to peterkins relief and told him what i had seen  we sat down and had a long talk over this matter and then we agreed to make a regular systematic search through the woods so as to make sure at least that you had not been killed but now we thought of the difficulty of getting out of the cave without your help  peterkin became dreadfully nervous when he thought of this and i must confess i felt some alarm for of course i could not hope alone to take him out so quickly as we two together had brought him in and he himself vowed that if we had been a moment longer with him that time he would have had to take a breath of salt water  however there was no help for it and i endeavoured to calm his fears as well as i could for said i you cant live here peterkin to which he replied of course not jack i can only die here and as thats not at all desirable you had better propose something  so i suggested that he should take a good long breath and trust himself to me  might we not make a large bag of cocoanut cloth into which i could shove my head and tie it tight round my neck he asked with a haggard smile  it might let me get one breath under water  no use said i it would fill in a moment and suffocate you  i see nothing for it peterkin if you really cant keep your breath so long but to let me knock you down and carry you out while in a state of insensibility  but peterkin didnt relish this idea  he seemed to fear that i would not be able to measure the exact force of the blow and might on the one hand hit him so softly as to render a second or third blow necessary which would be very uncomfortable or on the other hand give him such a smash as would entirely spoil his figurehead or mayhap knock the life out of him altogether  at last i got him persuaded to try to hold his breath and commit himself to me so he agreed and down we went  but i had not got halfway through when he began to struggle and kick like a wild bull burst from my grasp and hit against the roof of the tunnel  i was therefore obliged to force him violently back into the cave again where he rose panting to the surface  in short he had lost his presence of mind and  nothing of the sort cried peterkin indignantly i only lost my wind and if i had not had presence of mind enough to kick as i did i should have bust in your arms  well well so be it resumed jack with a smilebut the upshot of it was that we had to hold another consultation on the point and i really believe that had it not been for a happy thought of mine we should have been consulting there yet  i wish we had again interrupted peterkin with a sighim sure ralph if i had thought that you were coming back again i would willingly have awaited your return for months rather than have endured the mental agony which i went throughbut proceed  the thought was this continued jackthat i should tie peterkins hands and feet with cords and then lash him firmly to a stout pole about five feet long in order to render him quite powerless and keep him straight and stiff  you should have seen his face of horror ralph when i suggested this  but he came to see that it was his only chance and told me to set about it as fast as i could for said he this is no jokin jack i can tell you and the sooner its done the better i soon procured the cordage and a suitable pole with which i returned to the cave and lashed him as stiff and straight as an egyptian mummy and to say truth he was no bad representation of what an english mummy would be if there were such things for he was as white as a dead man  now said peterkin in a tremulous voice swim with me as near to the edge of the hole as you can before you dive then let me take a long breath and as i shant be able to speak after ive taken it youll watch my face and the moment you see me winkdive  and oh he added earnestly pray dont be long  i promised to pay the strictest attention to his wishes and swam with him to the outlet of the cave  here i paused  now then said i pull away at the wind lad  peterkin drew in a breath so long that i could not help thinking of the frog in the fable that wanted to swell itself as big as the ox  then i looked into his face earnestly  slap went the lid of his right eye down went my head and up went my heels  we shot through the passage like an arrow and rose to the surface of the open sea before you could count twenty  peterkin had taken in such an awful load of wind that on reaching the free air he let it out with a yell loud enough to have been heard a mile off and then the change in his feelings was so sudden and great that he did not wait till we landed but began tied up as he was to shout and sing for joy as i supported him with my left arm to the shore however in the middle of a laugh that a hyena might have envied i let him accidentally slip which extinguished him in a moment  after this happy deliverance we immediately began our search for your dead body ralph and you have no idea how low our hearts sank as we set off day after day to examine the valleys and mountainsides with the utmost care  in about three weeks we completed the survey of the whole island and had at least the satisfaction of knowing that you had not been killed  but it occurred to us that you might have been thrown into the sea so we examined the sands and the lagoon carefully and afterwards went all round the outer reef  one day while we were upon the reef peterkin espied a small dark object lying among the rocks which seemed to be quite different from the surrounding stones  we hastened towards the spot and found it to be a small keg  on knocking out the head we discovered that it was gunpowder  it was i who sent you that jack said i with a smile  fork out cried peterkin energetically starting to his feet and extending his open hand to jack  down with the money sir else ill have you shut up for life in a debtors prison the moment we return to england  ill give you an iou in the meantime returned jack laughing so sit down and be quietthe fact is ralph when we discovered this keg of powder peterkin immediately took me a bet of a thousand pounds that you had something to do with it and i took him a bet of ten thousand that you had not  peterkin was right then said i explaining how the thing had occurred  well we found it very useful continued jack although some of it had got a little damp and we furbished up the old pistol with which peterkin is a crack shot now  but to continue  we did not find any other vestige of you on the reef and finally gave up all hope of ever seeing you again  after this the island became a dreary place to us and we began to long for a ship to heave in sight and take us off  but now that youre back again my dear fellow it looks as bright and cheerful as it used to do and i love it as much as ever  and now continued jack i have a great desire to visit some of the other islands of the south seas  here we have a firstrate schooner at our disposal so i dont see what should hinder us  just the very thing i was going to propose cried peterkin  i vote for starting at once  well then said jack it seems to me that we could not do better than shape our course for the island on which avatea lives and endeavour to persuade tararo to let her marry the black fellow to whom she is engaged instead of making a long pig of her  if he has a spark of gratitude in him hell do it  besides having become champions for this girl once before it behoves us as true knights not to rest until we set her free at least all the heroes in all the storybooks i have ever read would count it foul disgrace to leave such a work unfinished  im sure i dont know or care what your knights in storybooks would do said peterkin but im certain that it would be capital fun so im your man whenever you want me  this plan of jacks was quite in accordance with his romantic impulsive nature and having made up his mind to save this black girl he could not rest until the thing was commenced  but there may be great danger in this attempt he said at the end of a long consultation on the subject  will you lads go with me in spite of this  go with you we repeated in the same breath  can you doubt it said i  for a moment added peterkin  i need scarcely say that having made up our minds to go on this enterprise we lost no time in making preparations to quit the island and as the schooner was well laden with stores of every kind for a long cruise we had little to do except to add to our abundant supply a quantity of cocoanuts breadfruit taro yams plums and potatoes chiefly with the view of carrying the fragrance of our dear island along with us as long as we could  when all was ready we paid a farewell visit to the different familiar spots where most of our time had been spent  we ascended the mountaintop and gazed for the last time at the rich green foliage in the valleys the white sandy beach the placid lagoon and the barrier coral reef with its crested breakers  then we descended to spouting cliff and looked down at the palegreen monster which we had made such fruitless efforts to spear in days gone by  from this we hurried to the water garden and took a last dive into its clear waters and a last gambol amongst its coral groves  i hurried out before my companions and dressed in haste in order to have a long examination of my tank which peterkin in the fulness of his heart had tended with the utmost care as being a vivid remembrancer of me rather than out of love for natural history  it was in superb condition the water as clear and pellucid as crystal the red and green seaweed of the most brilliant hues the red purple yellow green and striped anemones fully expanded and stretching out their arms as if to welcome and embrace their former master the starfish zoophytes seapens and other innumerable marine insects looking fresh and beautiful and the crabs as peterkin said looking as wideawake impertinent rampant and pugnacious as ever  it was indeed so lovely and so interesting that i would scarcely allow myself to be torn away from it  last of all we returned to the bower and collected the few articles we possessedsuch as the axe the pencilcase the broken telescope the penknife the hook made from the brass ring and the sailneedle with which we had landed on the island also the long boots and the pistol besides several curious articles of costume which we had manufactured from time to time  these we conveyed on board in our little boat after having carved our names on a chip of ironwood thus                                jack martin                               ralph rover                              peterkin gay  this we fixed up inside of the bower  the boat was then hoisted on board and the anchor weighed which latter operation cost us great labour and much time as the anchor was so heavy that we could not move it without the aid of my complex machinery of blocks and pulleys  a steady breeze was blowing offshore when we set sail at a little before sunset  it swept us quickly past the reef and out to sea  the shore grew rapidly more indistinct as the shades of evening fell while our clipper bark bounded lightly over the waves  slowly the mountaintop sank on the horizon until it became a mere speck  in another moment the sun and the coral island sank together into the broad bosom of the pacific    chapter thirty  the voyagethe island and a consultation in which danger is scouted as a thing unworthy of considerationrats and catsthe native teacher awful revelationswonderful effects of christianity  our voyage during the next two weeks was most interesting and prosperous  the breeze continued generally fair and at all times enabled us to lie our course for being as i have said before clipperbuilt the pirate schooner could lie very close to the wind and make little leeway  we had no difficulty now in managing our sails for jack was heavy and powerful while peterkin was active as a kitten still however we were a very insufficient crew for such a vessel and if any one had proposed to us to make such a voyage in it before we had been forced to go through so many hardships from necessity we would have turned away with pity from the individual making such proposal as from a madman  i pondered this a good deal and at last concluded that men do not know how much they are capable of doing till they try and that we should never give way to despair in any undertaking however difficult it may seemalways supposing however that our cause is a good one and that we can ask the divine blessing on it  although therefore we could now manage our sails easily we nevertheless found that my pulleys were of much service to us in some things though jack did laugh heartily at the uncouth arrangement of ropes and blocks which had to a sailors eye a very lumbering and clumsy appearance  but i will not drag my reader through the details of this voyage  suffice it to say that after an agreeable sail of about three weeks we arrived off the island of mango which i recognised at once from the description that the pirate bill had given me of it during one of our conversations  as soon as we came within sight of it we hove the ship to and held a council of war  now boys said jack as we seated ourselves beside him on the cabin skylight before we go further in this business we must go over the pros and cons of it for although you have so generously consented to stick by me through thick and thin it would be unfair did i not see that you thoroughly understand the danger of what we are about to attempt  oh bother the danger cried peterkin  i wonder to hear you jack talk of danger  when a fellow begins to talk about it hell soon come to magnify it to such a degree that hell not be fit to face it when it comesno more than a suckin baby  nay peterkin replied jack gravely i wont be jested out of it  i grant you that when weve once resolved to act and have made up our minds what to do we should think no more of danger  but before we have so resolved it behoves us to look it straight in the face and examine into it and walk round it for if we flinch at a distant view were sure to run away when the danger is nearnow i understand from you ralph that the island is inhabited by thoroughgoing outandout cannibals whose principal law is might is right and the weakest goes to the wall  yes said i so bill gave me to understand  he told me however that at the southern side of it the missionaries had obtained a footing amongst an insignificant tribe  a native teacher had been sent there by the wesleyans who had succeeded in persuading the chief at that part to embrace christianity  but instead of that being of any advantage to our enterprise it seems the very reverse for the chief tararo is a determined heathen and persecutes the christianswho are far too weak in numbers to offer any resistanceand looks with dislike upon all white men whom he regards as propagators of the new faith  tis a pity said jack that the christian tribe is so small for we shall scarcely be safe under their protection i fear  if tararo takes it into his head to wish for our vessel or to kill ourselves he could take us from them by force  you say that the native missionary talks english  so i believe  then what i propose is this said jack  we will run round to the south side of the island and cast anchor off the christian village  we are too far away just now to have been descried by any of the savages so we shall get there unobserved and have time to arrange our plans before the heathen tribes know of our presence  but in doing this we run the risk of being captured by the illdisposed tribes and being very illused if nota  roasted alive and eaten cried peterkin  come out with it jack according to your own showing its well to look the danger straight in the face  well that is the worst of it certainly  are you prepared then to take your chance of that  ive been prepared and had my mind made up long ago cried peterkin swaggering about the deck with his hands thrust into his breeches pockets  the fact is jack i dont believe that tararo will be so ungrateful as to eat us and im quite sure that hell be too happy to grant us whatever we ask so the sooner we go in and win the better  peterkin was wrong however in his estimate of savage gratitude as the sequel will show  the schooner was now put before the wind and after making a long run to the southward we put about and beat up for the south side of mango where we arrived before sunset and hoveto off the coral reef  here we awaited the arrival of a canoe which immediately put off on our roundingto  when it arrived a mildlooking native of apparently forty years of age came on board and taking off his straw hat made us a low bow  he was clad in a respectable suit of european clothes and the first words he uttered as he stepped up to jack and shook hands with him were  goodday gentlemen  we are happy to see you at mango  you are heartily welcome  after returning his salutation jack exclaimed you must be the native missionary teacher of whom i have heardare you not  i am  i have the joy to be a servant of the lord jesus at this station  youre the very man i want to see then replied jack thats lucky come down to the cabin friend and have a glass of wine  i wish particularly to speak with you  my men therepointing to peterkin and mewill look after your people  thank you said the teacher as he followed jack to the cabin i do not drink wine or any strong drink  oh then theres lots of water and you can have biscuit  now pon my word thats cool said peterkin his men forsooth well since we are to be men we may as well come it as strong over these black chaps as we canhallo there he cried to the halfdozen of natives who stood upon the deck gazing in wonder at all they saw heres for you and he handed them a tray of broken biscuit and a can of water  then thrusting his hands into his pockets he walked up and down the deck with an enormous swagger whistling vociferously  in about halfanhour jack and the teacher came on deck and the latter bidding us a cheerful goodevening entered his canoe and paddled to the shore  when he was gone peterkin stepped up to jack and touching his cap said  well captain have you any communications to make to your men  yes cried jack ready about mind the helm and clew up your tongue while i con the schooner through the passage in the reef  the teacher who seems a firstrate fellow says its quite deep and good anchorage within the lagoon close to the shore  while the vessel was slowly advancing to her anchorage under a light breeze jack explained to us that avatea was still on the island living amongst the heathens that she had expressed a strong desire to join the christians but tararo would not let her and kept her constantly in close confinement  moreover continued jack i find that she belongs to one of the samoan islands where christianity had been introduced long before her capture by the heathens of a neighbouring island and the very day after she was taken she was to have joined the church which had been planted there by that excellent body the london missionary society  the teacher tells me too that the poor girl has fallen in love with a christian chief who lives on an island some fifty miles or so to the south of this one and that she is meditating a desperate attempt at escape  so you see we have come in the nick of timei fancy that this chief is the fellow whom you heard of ralph at the island of emobesides all this the heathen savages are at war among themselves and theres to be a battle fought the day after tomorrow in which the principal leader is tararo so that well not be able to commence our negotiations with the rascally chief till the day after  the village off which we anchored was beautifully situated at the head of a small bay from the margin of which trees of every description peculiar to the tropics rose in the richest luxuriance to the summit of a hilly ridge which was the line of demarcation between the possessions of the christians and those of the neighbouring heathen chief  the site of the settlement was an extensive plot of flat land stretching in a gentle slope from the sea to the mountain  the cottages stood several hundred yards from the beach and were protected from the glare of the sea by the rich foliage of rows of large barringtonia and other trees which girt the shore  the village was about a mile in length and perfectly straight with a wide road down the middle on either side of which were rows of the tuftedtopped titree whose delicate and beautiful blossoms hanging beneath their plumecrested tops added richness to the scene  the cottages of the natives were built beneath these trees and were kept in the most excellent order each having a little garden in front tastefully laid out and planted while the walks were covered with black and white pebbles  every house had doors and venetian windows painted partly with lampblack made from the candlenut and partly with red ochre which contrasted powerfully with the dazzling coral lime that covered the walls  on a prominent position stood a handsome church which was quite a curiosity in its way  it was a hundred feet long by fifty broad and was seated throughout to accommodate upwards of two thousand persons it had six large foldingdoors and twelve windows with venetian blinds and although a large and substantial edifice it had been built we were told by the teacher in the space of two months  there was not a single iron nail in the fabric and the natives had constructed it chiefly with their stone and bone axes and other tools having only one or two axes or tools of european manufacture  everything around this beautiful spot wore an aspect of peace and plenty and as we dropped our anchor within a stonescast of the substantial coral wharf i could not avoid contrasting it with the wretched village of emo where i had witnessed so many frightful scenes  when the teacher afterwards told me that the people of this tribe had become converts only a year previous to our arrival and that they had been living before that in the practice of the most bloody system of idolatry i could not refrain from exclaiming what a convincing proof that christianity is of god  on landing from our little boat we were received with a warm welcome by the teacher and his wife the latter being also a native clothed in a simple european gown and a straw bonnet  the shore was lined with hundreds of natives whose persons were all more or less clothed with native cloth  some of the men had on a kind of poncho formed of this cloth their legs being uncovered others wore clumsily fashioned trousers and no upper garment except hats made of straw and cloth many of the dresses both of women and men were grotesque enough being very bad imitations of the european garb but all wore a dress of some sort or other  they seemed very glad to see us and crowded round us as the teacher led the way to his dwelling where we were entertained in the most sumptuous manner on baked pig and all the varieties of fruits and vegetables that the island produced  we were much annoyed however by the rats they seemed to run about the house like domestic animals as we sat at table one of them peeped up at us over the edge of the cloth close to peterkins elbow who floored it with a blow on the snout from his knife exclaiming as he did so  i say mister teacher why dont you set traps for these brutes surely you are not fond of them  no replied the teacher with a smile  we would be glad to get rid of them if we could but if we were to trap all the rats on the island it would occupy our whole time  are they then so numerous inquired jack  they swarm everywhere  the poor heathens on the north side eat them and think them very sweet  so did my people formerly but they do not eat so many now because the missionary who was last here expressed disgust at it  the poor people asked if it was wrong to eat rats and he told them that it was certainly not wrong but that the people of england would be much disgusted were they asked to eat rats  we had not been an hour in the house of this kindhearted man when we were convinced of the truth of his statement as to their numbers for the rats ran about the floors in dozens and during our meal two men were stationed at the table to keep them off  what a pity you have no cats said peterkin and he aimed a blow at another reckless intruder and missed it  we would indeed be glad to have a few rejoined the teacher but they are difficult to be got  the hogs we find are very good ratkillers but they do not seem to be able to keep the numbers down  i have heard that they are better than cats  as the teacher said this his goodnatured black face was wrinkled with a smile of merriment  observing that i had noticed it he said  i smiled just now when i remembered the fate of the first cat that was taken to rarotonga  this is one of the stations of the london missionary society  it like our own is infested with rats and a cat was brought at last to the island  it was a large black one  on being turned loose instead of being content to stay among men the cat took to the mountains and lived in a wild state sometimes paying visits during the night to the houses of the natives some of whom living at a distance from the settlement had not heard of the cats arrival and were dreadfully frightened in consequence calling it a monster of the deep and flying in terror away from it  one night the catfeeling a desire for company i supposetook its way to the house of a chief who had recently been converted to christianity and had begun to learn to read and pray  the chiefs wife who was sitting awake at his side while he slept beheld with horror two fires glistening in the doorway and heard with surprise a mysterious voice  almost petrified with fear she awoke her husband and began to upbraid him for forsaking his old religion and burning his god who she declared was now come to be avenged of them  get up and pray get up and pray she cried  the chief arose and on opening his eyes beheld the same glaring lights and heard the same ominous sound  impelled by the extreme urgency of the case he commenced with all possible vehemence to vociferate the alphabet as a prayer to god to deliver them from the vengeance of satan  on hearing this the cat as much alarmed as themselves fled precipitately away leaving the chief and his wife congratulating themselves on the efficacy of their prayer  we were much diverted with this anecdote which the teacher related in english so good that we certainly could not have supposed him a native but for the colour of his face and the foreign accent in his tone  next day we walked out with this interesting man and were much entertained and instructed by his conversation as we rambled through the cool shady groves of bananas citrons limes and other trees or sauntered among the cottages of the natives and watched them while they laboured diligently in the tarobeds or manufactured the tapa or native cloth to some of these jack put questions through the medium of the missionary and the replies were such as to surprise us at the extent of their knowledge  indeed peterkin very truly remarked that they seemed to know a considerable deal more than jack himself  among other pieces of interesting information that we obtained was the following in regard to coral formations  the islands of the pacific said our friend are of three different kinds or classes  those of the first class are volcanic mountainous and wildsome shooting their jagged peaks into the clouds at an elevation of ten and fifteen thousand feet  those of the second class are of crystallised limestone and vary in height from one hundred to five hundred feet  the hills on these are not so wild or broken as those of the first class but are richly clothed with vegetation and very beautiful  i have no doubt that the coral island on which you were wrecked was one of this class  they are supposed to have been upheaved from the bottom of the sea by volcanic agency but they are not themselves volcanic in their nature neither are they of coral formation  those of the third class are the low coralline islands usually having lagoons of water in their midst  they are very numerous  as to the manner in which coral islands and reefs are formed there are various opinions on this point  i will give you what seems to me the most probable theorya theory i may add which is held by some of the good and scientific missionaries  it is well known that there is much lime in salt water it is also known that coral is composed of lime  it is supposed that the polypes or coral insects have the power of attracting this lime to their bodies and with this material they build their little cells or habitations  they choose the summit of a volcano or the top of a submarine mountain as a foundation on which to build for it is found that they never work at any great depth below the surface  on this they work  the polypes on the mountaintop of course reach the surface first then those at the outer edges reach the top sooner than the others between them and the centre thus forming the coral reef surrounding the lagoon of water and the central island after that the insects within the lagoon cease working  when the surface of the water is reached these myriads of wonderful creatures die  then birds visit the spot and seeds are thus conveyed thither which take root and spring up and flourish  thus are commenced those coralline islets of which you have seen so many in these seas  the reefs round the large islands are formed in a similar manner  when we consider added the missionary the smallness of the architects used by our heavenly father in order to form those lovely and innumerable islands we are filled with much of that feeling which induced the ancient king to exclaim how manifold o lord are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all  we all heartily agreed with the missionary in this sentiment and felt not a little gratified to find that the opinions which jack and i had been led to form from personal observation on our coral island were thus to a great extent corroborated  the missionary also gave us an account of the manner in which christianity had been introduced among them  he said when missionaries were first sent here three years ago a small vessel brought them and the chief who is now dead promised to treat well the two native teachers who were left with their wives on the island  but scarcely had the boat which landed them returned to the ship than the natives began to maltreat their guests taking away all they possessed and offering them further violence so that when the boat was sent in haste to fetch them away the clothes of both men and women were torn nearly off their backs  two years after this the vessel visited them again and i being in her volunteered to land alone without any goods whatever begging that my wife might be brought to me the following yearthat is this year and as you see she is with me  but the surf was so high that the boat could not land me so with nothing on but my trousers and shirt and with a few catechisms and a bible besides some portions of the scripture translated into the mango tongue i sprang into the sea and swam ashore on the crest of a breaker  i was instantly dragged up the beach by the natives who on finding i had nothing worth having upon me let me alone  i then made signs to my friends in the ship to leave me which they did  at first the natives listened to me in silence but laughed at what i said while i preached the gospel of our blessed saviour jesus christ to them  afterwards they treated me ill sometimes but i persevered and continued to dwell among them and dispute and exhort them to give up their sinful ways of life burn their idols and come to jesus  about a month after i landed i heard that the chief was dead  he was the father of the present chief who is now a most consistent member of the church  it is a custom here that when a chief dies his wives are strangled and buried with him  knowing this i hastened to his house to endeavour to prevent such cruelty if possible  when i arrived i found two of the wives had already been killed while another was in the act of being strangled  i pleaded hard for her but it was too late she was already dead  i then entreated the son to spare the fourth wife and after much hesitation my prayer was granted but in halfanhour afterwards this poor woman repented of being unfaithful as she termed it to her husband and insisted on being strangled which was accordingly done  all this time the chiefs son was walking up and down before his fathers house with a brow black as thunder  when he entered i went in with him and found to my surprise that his father was not dead the old man was sitting on a mat in a corner with an expression of placid resignation on his face  why said i have you strangled your fathers wives before he is dead  to this the son replied he is dead  that is no longer my father  he is as good as dead now  he is to be buried alive  i now remembered having heard that it is a custom among the feejee islanders that when the reigning chief grows old and infirm the heir to the chieftainship has a right to depose his father in which case he is considered as dead and is buried alive  the young chief was now about to follow this custom and despite my earnest entreaties and pleadings the old chief was buried that day before my eyes in the same grave with his four strangled wives  oh my heart groaned when i saw this and i prayed to god to open the hearts of these poor creatures as he had already opened mine and pour into them the light and the love of the gospel of jesus  my prayer was answered very soon  a week afterwards the son who was now chief of the tribe came to me bearing his god on his shoulders and groaning beneath its weight  flinging it down at my feet he desired me to burn it  you may conceive how overjoyed i was at this  i sprang up and embraced him while i shed tears of joy  then we made a fire and burned the god to ashes amid an immense concourse of the people who seemed terrified at what was being done and shrank back when we burned the god expecting some signal vengeance to be taken upon us but seeing that nothing happened they changed their minds and thought that our god must be the true one after all  from that time the mission prospered steadily and now while there is not a single man in the tribe who has not burned his household gods and become a convert to christianity there are not a few i hope who are true followers of the lamb having been plucked as brands from the burning by him who can save unto the uttermost  i will not tell you more of our progress at this time but you see he said waving his hand around him the village and the church did not exist a year ago  we were indeed much interested in this account and i could not help again in my heart praying to god to prosper those missionary societies that send such inestimable blessings to these islands of dark and bloody idolatry  the teacher also added that the other tribes were very indignant at this one for having burned its gods and threatened to destroy it altogether but they had done nothing yet  and if they should said the teacher the lord is on our side of whom shall we be afraid  have the missionaries many stations in these seas inquired jack  oh yes  the london missionary society have a great many in the tahiti group and other islands in that quarter  then the wesleyans have the feejee islands all to themselves and the americans have many stations in other groups  but still my friend there are hundreds of islands here the natives of which have never heard of jesus or the good word of god or the holy spirit and thousands are living and dying in the practice of those terrible sins and bloody murders of which you have already heardi trust my friends he added looking earnestly into our facesi trust that if you ever return to england you will tell your christian friends that the horrors which they hear of in regard to these islands are literally true and that when they have heard the worst the half has not been told them for there are perpetrated here foul deeds of darkness of which man may not speak  you may also tell them he said looking around with a smile while a tear of gratitude trembled in his eye and rolled down his coalblack cheektell them of the blessings that the gospel has wrought here  we assured our friend that we would certainly not forget his request on returning towards the village about noon we remarked on the beautiful whiteness of the cottages  that is owing to the lime with which they are plastered said the teacher  when the natives were converted as i have described i set them to work to build cottages for themselves and also this handsome church which you see  when the framework and other parts of the house were up i sent the people to fetch coral from the sea  they brought immense quantities  then i made them cut wood and piling the coral above it set it on fire  look look cried the poor people in amazement what wonderful people the christians are  he is roasting stones  we shall not need taro or breadfruit any more we may eat stones  but their surprise was still greater when the coral was reduced to a fine soft white powder  they immediately set up a great shout and mingling the lime with water rubbed their faces and their bodies all over with it and ran through the village screaming with delight  they were also much surprised at another thing they saw me do  i wished to make some household furniture and constructed a turninglathe to assist me  the first thing that i turned was the leg of a sofa which was no sooner finished than the chief seized it with wonder and delight and ran through the village exhibiting it to the people who looked upon it with great admiration  the chief then tying a string to it hung it round his neck as an ornament  he afterwards told me that if he had seen it before he became a christian he would have made it his god  as the teacher concluded this anecdote we reached his door  saying that he had business to attend to he left us to amuse ourselves as we best could  now lads said jack turning abruptly towards us and buttoning up his jacket as he spoke im off to see the battle  ive no particular fondness for seein bloodshed but i must find out the nature o these fellows and see their customs with my own eyes so that i may be able to speak of it again if need be authoritatively  its only six miles off and we dont run much more risk than that of getting a rap with a stray stone or an overshot arrow  will you go  to be sure we will said peterkin  if they chance to see us well cut and run for it added jack  dear me cried peterkin you run  i thought you would scorn to run from any one  so i would if it were my duty to fight returned jack coolly but as i dont want to fight and dont intend to fight if they offer to attack us ill run away like the veriest coward that ever went by the name of peterkin  so come along    chapter thirty one  a strange and bloody battlethe lion bearded in his denfrightful scenes of cruelty and fears for the future  we had ascertained from the teacher the direction to the spot on which the battle was to be fought and after a walk of two hours reached it the summit of a bare hill was the place chosen for unlike most of the other islanders who are addicted to bushfighting those of mango are in the habit of meeting on open ground  we arrived before the two parties had commenced the deadly struggle and creeping as close up as we dared among the rocks we lay and watched them  the combatants were drawn up face to face each side ranged in rank four deep  those in the first row were armed with long spears the second with clubs to defend the spearmen the third row was composed of young men with slings and the fourth consisted of women who carried baskets of stones for the slingers and clubs and spears with which to supply the warriors  soon after we arrived the attack was made with great fury  there was no science displayed  the two bodies of savages rushed headlong upon each other and engaged in a general melee and a more dreadful set of men i have never seen  they wore grotesque warcaps made of various substances and decorated with feathers  their faces and bodies were painted so as to make them look as frightful as possible and as they brandished their massive clubs leaped shouted yelled and dashed each other to the ground i thought i had never seen men look so like demons before  we were much surprised at the conduct of the women who seemed to be perfect furies and hung about the heels of their husbands in order to defend them  one stout young woman we saw whose husband was hard pressed and about to be overcome she lifted a large stone and throwing it at his opponents head felled him to the earth  but the battle did not last long  the band most distant from us gave way and were routed leaving eighteen of their comrades dead upon the field  these the victors brained as they lay and putting some of their brains on leaves went off with them we were afterwards informed to their temples to present them to their gods as an earnest of the human victims who were soon to be brought there  we hastened back to the christian village with feelings of the deepest sadness at the sanguinary conflict which we had just witnessed  next day after breakfasting with our friend the teacher we made preparations for carrying out our plan  at first the teacher endeavoured to dissuade us  you do not know said he turning to jack the danger you run in venturing amongst these ferocious savages  i feel much pity for poor avatea but you are not likely to succeed in saving her and you may die in the attempt  well said jack quietly i am not afraid to die in a good cause  the teacher smiled approvingly at him as he said this and after a little further conversation agreed to accompany us as interpreter saying that although tararo was unfriendly to him he had hitherto treated him with respect  we now went on board the schooner having resolved to sail round the island and drop anchor opposite the heathen village  we manned her with natives and hoped to overawe the savages by displaying our brass gun to advantage  the teacher soon after came on board and setting our sails we put to sea  in two hours more we made the cliffs reverberate with the crash of the big gun which we fired by way of salute while we ran the british ensign up to the peak and cast anchor  the commotion on shore showed us that we had struck terror into the hearts of the natives but seeing that we did not offer to molest them a canoe at length put off and paddled cautiously towards us  the teacher showed himself and explaining that we were friends and wished to palaver with the chief desired the native to go and tell him to come on board  we waited long and with much impatience for an answer  during this time the native teacher conversed with us again and told us many things concerning the success of the gospel among those islands and perceiving that we were by no means so much gratified as we ought to have been at the hearing of such good news he pressed us more closely in regard to our personal interest in religion and exhorted us to consider that our souls were certainly in as great danger as those of the wretched heathen whom we pitied so much if we had not already found salvation in jesus christ  nay further he added if such be your unhappy case you are in the sight of god much worse than these savagesforgive me my young friends for saying sofor they have no knowledge no light and do not profess to believe while you on the contrary have been brought up in the light of the blessed gospel and call yourselves christians these poor savages are indeed the enemies of our lord but you if ye be not true believers are traitors  i must confess that my heart condemned me while the teacher spoke in this earnest manner and i knew not what to reply  peterkin too did not seem to like it and i thought would willingly have escaped  but jack seemed deeply impressed and wore an anxious expression on his naturally grave countenance while he assented to the teachers remarks and put to him many earnest questions  meanwhile the natives who composed our crew having nothing particular to do had squatted down on the deck and taken out their little books containing the translated portions of the new testament along with hymns and spellingbooks and were now busily engagedsome vociferating the alphabet others learning prayers off by heart while a few sang hymnsall of them being utterly unmindful of our presence  the teacher soon joined them and soon afterwards they all engaged in a prayer which was afterwards translated to us and proved to be a petition for the success of our undertaking and for the conversion of the heathen  while we were thus engaged a canoe put off from shore and several savages leaped on deck one of whom advanced to the teacher and informed him that tararo could not come on board that day being busy with some religious ceremonies before the gods which could on no account be postponed  he was also engaged with a friendly chief who was about to take his departure from the island and therefore begged that the teacher and his friends would land and pay a visit to him  to this the teacher returned answer that we would land immediately  now lads said jack as we were about to step into our little boat im not going to take any weapons with me and i recommend you to take none either  we are altogether in the power of these savages and the utmost we could do if they were to attack us would be to kill a few of them before we were ourselves overpowered  i think that our only chance of success lies in mild measures  dont you think so  to this i assented gladly and peterkin replied by laying down a huge bellmouthed blunderbuss and divesting himself of a pair of enormous horsepistols with which he had purposed to overawe the natives  we then jumped into our boat and rowed ashore  on reaching the beach we were received by a crowd of naked savages who shouted a rude welcome and conducted us to a house or shed where a baked pig and a variety of vegetables were prepared for us  having partaken of these the teacher begged to be conducted to the chief but there seemed some hesitation and after some consultation among themselves one of the men stood forward and spoke to the teacher  what says he inquired jack when the savage had concluded  he says that the chief is just going to the temple of his god and cannot see us yet so we must be patient my friend  well cried jack rising if he wont come to see me ill een go and see him  besides i have a great desire to witness their proceedings at this temple of theirs  will you go with me friend  i cannot said the teacher shaking his head  i must not go to the heathen temples and witness their inhuman rites except for the purpose of condemning their wickedness and folly  very good returned jack then ill go alone for i cannot condemn their doings till i have seen them  jack arose and we having determined to go also followed him through the bananagroves to a rising ground immediately behind the village on the top of which stood the bure or temple under the dark shade of a group of ironwood trees  as we went through the village i was again led to contrast the rude huts and sheds and their almost naked savagelooking inhabitants with the natives of the christian village who to use the teachers scriptural expression were now clothed and in their right mind  as we turned into a broad path leading towards the hill we were arrested by the shouts of an approaching multitude in the rear  drawing aside into the bushes we awaited their coming up and as they drew near we observed that it was a procession of the natives many of whom were dancing and gesticulating in the most frantic manner  they had an exceedingly hideous aspect owing to the black red and yellow paints with which their faces and naked bodies were bedaubed  in the midst of these came a band of men carrying three or four planks on which were seated in rows upwards of a dozen men  i shuddered involuntarily as i recollected the sacrifice of human victims at the island of emo and turned with a look of fear to jack as i said  oh jack  i have a terrible dread that they are going to commit some of their cruel practices on these wretched men  we had better not go to the temple  we shall only be horrified without being able to do any good for i fear they are going to kill them  jacks face wore an expression of deep compassion as he said in a low voice no fear ralph the sufferings of these poor fellows are over long ago  i turned with a start as he spoke and glancing at the men who were now quite near to the spot where we stood saw that they were all dead they were tied firmly with ropes in a sitting posture on the planks and seemed as they bent their sightless eyeballs and grinning mouths over the dancing crew below as if they were laughing in ghastly mockery at the utter inability of their enemies to hurt them now  these we discovered afterwards were the men who had been slain in the battle of the previous day and were now on their way to be first presented to the gods and then eaten  behind these came two men leading between them a third whose hands were pinioned behind his back  he walked with a firm step and wore a look of utter indifference on his face as they led him along so that we concluded he must be a criminal who was about to receive some slight punishment for his faults  the rear of the procession was brought up by a shouting crowd of women and children with whom we mingled and followed to the temple  here we arrived in a few minutes  the temple was a tall circular building open at one side  around it were strewn heaps of human bones and skulls  at a table inside sat the priest an elderly man with a long grey beard  he was seated on a stool and before him lay several knives made of wood bone and splinters of bamboo with which he performed his office of dissecting dead bodies  farther in lay a variety of articles that had been dedicated to the god and among them were many spears and clubs  i observed among the latter some with human teeth sticking in them where the victims had been clubbed in their mouths  before this temple the bodies which were painted with vermilion and soot were arranged in a sitting posture and a man called a danvosa orator advanced and laying his hands on their heads began to chide them apparently in a low bantering tone  what he said we knew not but as he went on he waxed warm and at last shouted to them at the top of his lungs and finally finished by kicking the bodies over and running away amid the shouts and laughter of the people who now rushed forward  seizing the bodies by a leg or an arm or by the hair of the head they dragged them over stumps and stones and through sloughs until they were exhausted  the bodies were then brought back to the temple and dissected by the priest after which they were taken out to be baked  close to the temple a large fire was kindled in which stones were heated red hot  when ready these were spread out on the ground and a thick coating of leaves strewn over them to slack the heat  on this lovo or oven the bodies were then placed covered over and left to bake  the crowd now ran with terrible yells towards a neighbouring hill or mound on which we observed the framework of a house lying ready to be erected  sick with horror yet fascinated by curiosity we staggered after them mechanically scarce knowing where we were going or what we did and feeling a sort of impression that all we saw was a dreadful dream  arrived at the place we saw the multitude crowding round a certain spot  we pressed forward and obtained a sight of what they were doing a large wooden beam or post lay on the ground beside the other parts of the framework of the house and close to the end of it was a hole about seven feet deep and upwards of two feet wide  while we looked the man whom we had before observed with his hands pinioned was carried into the circle  his hands were now free but his legs were tightly strapped together  the post of the house was then placed in the hole and the man put in beside it  his head was a good way below the surface of the hole and his arms were clasped round the post  earth was now thrown in until all was covered over and stamped down and this we were afterwards told was a ceremony usually performed at the dedication of a new temple or the erection of a chiefs house  come come cried jack on beholding this horrible tragedy we have seen enough enoughfar more than enough  let us go  jacks face looked ghastly pale and haggard as we hurried back to rejoin the teacher and i have no doubt that he felt terrible anxiety when he considered the number and ferocity of the savages and the weakness of the few arms which were ready indeed to essay but impotent to effect avateas deliverance from these ruthless men    chapter thirty two  an unexpected discovery and a bold reckless defiance with its consequencesplans of escape and heroic resolves  when we returned to the shore and related to our friend what had passed he was greatly distressed and groaned in spirit but we had not sat long in conversation when we were interrupted by the arrival of tararo on the beach accompanied by a number of followers bearing baskets of vegetables and fruits on their heads  we advanced to meet him and he expressed through our interpreter much pleasure in seeing us  and what is it that my friends wish to say to me he inquired  the teacher explained that we came to beg that avatea might be spared  tell him said jack that i consider that i have a right to ask this of him having not only saved the girls life but the lives of his own people also and say that i wish her to be allowed to follow her own wishes and join the christians  while this was being translated the chiefs brow lowered and we could see plainly that our request met with no favourable reception  he replied with considerable energy and at some length  what says he inquired jack  i regret to say that he will not listen to the proposal  he says he has pledged his word to his friend that the girl shall be sent to him and a deputy even now on this island awaiting the fulfilment of the pledge  jack bit his lip in suppressed anger  tell tararo he exclaimed with a flashing eye that if he does not grant my demand it will be worse for him  say i have a big gun on board my schooner that will blow his village into the sea if he does not give up the girl  nay my friend said the teacher gently i will not tell him that we must overcome evil with good  what does my friend say inquired the chief who seemed nettled by jacks looks of defiance  he is displeased replied the teacher  tararo turned away with a smile of contempt and walked towards the men who carried the baskets of vegetables and who had now emptied the whole on the beach in an enormous pile  what are they doing there  i inquired  i think that they are laying out a gift which they intend to present to some one said the teacher  at this moment a couple of men appeared leading a young girl between them and going towards the heap of fruits and vegetables placed her on top of it  we started with surprise and fear for in the young female before us we recognised the samoan girl avatea  we stood rooted to the earth with surprise and thickcoming fears  oh my dear young friend whispered the teacher in a voice of deep emotion while he seized jack by the arm she is to be made a sacrifice even now  is she cried jack with a vehement shout spurning the teacher aside and dashing over two natives who stood in his way while he rushed towards the heap sprang up its side and seized avatea by the arm  in another moment he dragged her down placed her back to a large tree and wrenching a warclub from the hand of a native who seemed powerless and petrified with surprise whirled it above his head and yelled rather than shouted while his face blazed with fury come on the whole nation of you an ye like it and do your worst  it seemed as though the challenge had been literally accepted for every savage on the ground ran precipitately at jack with club and spear and doubtless would speedily have poured out his brave blood on the sod had not the teacher rushed in between them and raising his voice to its utmost cried  stay your hands warriors  it is not your part to judge in this matter  it is for tararo the chief to say whether or not the young man shall live or die  the natives were arrested and i know not whether it was the gratifying acknowledgment of his superiority thus made by the teacher or some lingering feeling of gratitude for jacks former aid in time of need that influenced tararo but he stepped forward and waving his hand said to his people desist  the young mans life is mine  then turning to jack he said you have forfeited your liberty and life to me  submit yourself for we are more numerous than the sand upon the shore  you are but one why should you die  villain exclaimed jack passionately  i may die but assuredly i shall not perish alone  i will not submit until you promise that this girl shall not be injured  you are very bold replied the chief haughtily but very foolish yet i will say that avatea shall not be sent awayat least for three days  you had better accept these terms whispered the teacher entreatingly if you persist in this mad defiance you will be slain and avatea will be lost  three days are worth having  jack hesitated a moment then lowered his club and throwing it moodily to the ground crossed his arms on his breast and hung down his head in silence  tararo seemed pleased by his submission and told the teacher to say that he did not forget his former services and therefore would leave him free as to his person but that the schooner would be detained till he had further considered the matter  while the teacher translated this he approached as near to where avatea was standing as possible without creating suspicion and whispered to her a few words in the native language  avatea who during the whole of the foregoing scene had stood leaning against the tree perfectly passive and seemingly quite uninterested in all that was going on replied by a single rapid glance of her dark eye which was instantly cast down again on the ground at her feet  tararo now advanced and taking the girl by the hand led her unresistingly away while jack peterkin and i returned with the teacher on board the schooner  on reaching the deck we went down to the cabin where jack threw himself in a state of great dejection on a couch but the teacher seated himself by his side and laying his hand upon his shoulder said  do not give way to anger my young friend  god has given us three days and we must use the means that are in our power to free this poor girl from slavery  we must not sit in idle disappointment we must act  act cried jack raising himself and tossing back his hair wildly it is mockery to talk of acting when one is bound hand and foot  how can i act  i cannot fight a whole nation of savages singlehanded yes he said with a bitter smile i can fight them but i cannot conquer them or save avatea  patience my friend your spirit is not a good one just now  you cannot expect that blessing which alone can ensure success unless you are more submissive  i will tell you my plans if you will listen  listen cried jack eagerly  of course i will my good fellow  i did not know you had any plans  out with them  i only hope you will show me how i can get the girl on board of this schooner and id up anchor and away in no time  but proceed with your plans  the teacher smiled sadly  ah my friend if one fathom of your anchorchain were to rattle as you drew it in a thousand warriors would be standing on your deck  no no that could not be done  even now your ship would be taken from you were it not that tararo has some feeling of gratitude towards you  but i know tararo well  he is a man of falsehood as all the unconverted savages are  the chief to whom he has promised this girl is very powerful and tararo must fulfil his promise  he has told you that he would do nothing to the girl for three days but that is because the party who are to take her away will not be ready to start for three days  still as he might have made you a prisoner during those three days i say that god has given them to us  well but what do you propose to do said jack impatiently  my plan involves much danger but i see no other and i think you have courage to brave it  it is this  there is an island about fifty miles to the south of this the natives of which are christians and have been so for two years or more and the principal chief is avateas lover once there avatea would be safe  now i suggest that you should abandon your schooner  do you think that you can make so great a sacrifice  friend replied jack when i make up my mind to go through with a thing of importance i can make any sacrifice  the teacher smiled  well then the savages could not conceive it possible that for the sake of a girl you would voluntarily lose your fine vessel therefore as long as she lies here they think they have you all safe  so i suggest that we get a quantity of stores conveyed to a sequestered part of the shore provide a small canoe put avatea on board and you three would paddle to the christian island  bravo cried peterkin springing up and seizing the teachers hand missionary youre a regular brick  i didnt think you had so much in you  as for me continued the teacher i will remain on board till they discover that you are gone  then they will ask me where you are gone to and i will refuse to tell  and whatll be the result of that inquired jack  i know not  perhaps they will kill me but he added looking at jack with a peculiar smile i too am not afraid to die in a good cause  but how are we to get hold of avatea inquired jack  i have arranged with her to meet us at a particular spot to which i will guide you tonight  we shall then arrange about it  she will easily manage to elude her keepers who are not very strict in watching her thinking it impossible that she could escape from the island indeed i am sure that such an idea will never enter their heads  but as i have said you run great danger  fifty miles in a small canoe on the open sea is a great voyage to make  you may miss the island too in which case there is no other in that direction for a hundred miles or more and if you lose your way and fall among other heathens you know the law of feejeea castaway who gains the shore is doomed to die  you must count the cost my young friend  i have counted it replied jack  if avatea consents to run the risk most certainly i will and so will my comrades also  besides added jack looking seriously into the teachers face your bibleour bibletells of one who delivers those who call on him in the time of trouble who holds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hand  we now set about active preparations for the intended voyage collected together such things as we should require and laid out on the deck provisions sufficient to maintain us for several weeks purposing to load the canoe with as much as she could hold consistently with speed and safety  these we covered with a tarpaulin intending to convey them to the canoe only a few hours before starting  when night spread her sable curtain over the scene we prepared to land but first kneeling along with the natives and the teacher the latter implored a blessing on our enterprise  then we rowed quietly to the shore and followed our sable guide who led us by a long detour in order to avoid the village to the place of rendezvous  we had not stood more than five minutes under the gloomy shade of the thick foliage when a dark figure glided noiselessly up to us  ah here you are said jack as avatea approachednow then tell her what weve come about and dont waste time  i understan leetl english said avatea in a low voice  why where did you pick up english exclaimed jack in amazement  you were dumb as a stone when i saw you last  she has learned all she knows of it from me said the teacher since she came to the island  we now gave avatea a full explanation of our plans entering into all the details and concealing none of the danger so that she might be fully aware of the risk she ran  as we had anticipated she was too glad of the opportunity thus afforded her to escape from her persecutors to think of the danger or risk  then youre willing to go with us are you said jack  yis i willing to go  and youre not afraid to trust yourself out on the deep sea so far  no i not fraid to go  safe with christian  after some further consultation the teacher suggested that it was time to return so we bade avatea goodnight and having appointed to meet at the cliff where the canoe lay on the following night just after dark we hastened awaywe to row back to the schooner with muffled oars avatea to glide back to her prisonhut among the mango savages    chapter thirty three  the flightthe pursuitdespair and its resultsthe lion bearded in his den againawful danger threatened and wonderfully averteda terrific storm  as the time for our meditated flight drew near we became naturally very fearful lest our purpose should be discovered and we spent the whole of the following day in a state of nervous anxiety  we resolved to go ashore and ramble about the village as if to observe the habits and dwellings of the people as we thought that an air of affected indifference to the events of the previous day would be more likely than any other course of conduct to avert suspicion as to our intentions while we were thus occupied the teacher remained on board with the christian natives whose powerful voices reached us ever and anon as they engaged in singing hymns or in prayer  at last the long and tedious day came to a close the sun sank into the sea and the shortlived twilight of those regions to which i have already referred ended abruptly in a dark night  hastily throwing a few blankets into our little boat we stepped into it and whispering farewell to the natives in the schooner rowed gently over the lagoon taking care to keep as near to the beach as possible  we rowed in the utmost silence and with muffled oars so that had any one observed us at the distance of a few yards he might have almost taken us for a phantom boat or a shadow on the dark water  not a breath of air was stirring but fortunately the gentle ripple of the sea upon the shore mingled with the soft roar of the breaker on the distant reef effectually drowned the slight plash that we unavoidably made in the water by the dipping of our oars  a quarter of an hour sufficed to bring us to the overhanging cliff under whose black shadow our little canoe lay with her bow in the water ready to be launched and most of her cargo already stowed away  as the keel of our little boat grated on the sand a hand was laid upon the bow and a dim form was seen  ha said peterkin in a whisper as he stepped upon the beach is that you avatea  yis it am me was the reply  all rightnow then gentlyhelp me to shove off the canoe whispered jack to the teacherand peterkin do you shove these blankets aboard we may want them before longavatea step into the middle thats right  is all ready whispered the teacher  not quite replied peterkinhere ralph lay hold o this pair of oars and stow them away if you can  i dont like paddles  after were safe away ill try to rig up rowlocks for them  now then in with you and shove off  one more earnest squeeze of the kind teachers hand and with his whispered blessing yet sounding in our ears we shot like an arrow from the shore sped over the still waters of the lagoon and paddled as swiftly as strong arms and willing hearts could urge us over the long swell of the open sea  all that night and the whole of the following day we plied our paddles in almost total silence and without a halt save twice to recruit our failing energies with a mouthful of food and a draught of water  jack had taken the bearing of the island just after starting and laying a small pocketcompass before him kept the head of the canoe due south for our chance of hitting the island depended very much on the faithfulness of our steersman in keeping our tiny bark exactly and constantly on its proper course  peterkin and i paddled in the bow and avatea worked untiringly in the middle  as the suns lower limb dipped on the gilded edge of the sea jack ceased working threw down his paddle and called a halt  there he cried heaving a deep longdrawn sigh weve put a considerable breadth of water between us and these black rascals so now well have a hearty supper and a sound sleep  hear hear cried peterkin  nobly spoken jackhand me a drop of water ralphwhy girl whats wrong with you  you look just like a black owl blinking in the sunshine  avatea smiled  i sleepy she said and as if to prove the truth of this she laid her head on the edge of the canoe and fell fast asleep  thats uncommon sharp practice said peterkin with a broad grin dont you think we should awake her to make her eat something first or perhaps he added with a grave meditative lookperhaps we might put some food in her mouth which is so elegantly open at the present moment and see if shed swallow it while asleepif so ralph you might come round to the front here and feed her quietly while jack and i are tucking into the victuals  it would be a monstrous economy of time  i could not help smiling at peterkins idea which indeed when i pondered it seemed remarkably good in theory nevertheless i declined to put it in practice being fearful of the result should the victuals chance to go down the wrong throat  but on suggesting this to peterkin he exclaimed  down the wrong throat man  why a fellow with halfaneye might see that if it went down avateas throat it could not go down the wrong throatunless indeed you have all of a sudden become inordinately selfish and think that all the throats in the world are wrong ones except your own  however dont talk so much and hand me the pork before jack finishes it  i feel myself entitled to at least one minute morsel  peterkin youre a villaina paltry little villain said jack quietly as he tossed the hind legs including the tail of a cold roast pig to his comrade and i must again express my regret that unavoidable circumstances have thrust your society upon me and that necessity has compelled me to cultivate your acquaintance  were it not that you are incapable of walking upon the water i would order you sir out of the canoe  there youve awakened avatea with your long tongue retorted peterkin with a frown as the girl gave vent to a deep sigh  no he continued it was only a snore  perchance she dreameth of her black apolloi say ralph do leave just one little slice of that yam between you and jack i run a chance of being put on short allowance if notyeiaaow  peterkins concluding remark was a yawn of so great energy that jack recommended him to postpone the conclusion of his meal till next morninga piece of advice which he followed so quickly that i was forcibly reminded of his remark a few minutes before in regard to the sharp practice of avatea  my readers will have observed probably by this time that i am much given to meditation they will not therefore be surprised to learn that i fell into a deep reverie on the subject of sleep which was continued without intermission into the night and prolonged without interruption into the following morning  but i cannot feel assured that i actually slept during that time although i am tolerably certain that i was not awake  thus we lay like a shadow on the still bosom of the ocean while the night closed in and all around was calm dark and silent  a thrilling cry of alarm from peterkin startled us in the morning just as the grey dawn began to glimmer in the east  whats wrong cried jack starting up  peterkin replied by pointing with a look of anxious dread towards the horizon and a glance sufficed to show us that one of the largestsized warcanoes was approaching us  with a groan of mingled despair and anger jack seized his paddle glanced at the compass and in a suppressed voice commanded us to give way  but we did not require to be urged  already our four paddles were glancing in the water and the canoe bounded over the glassy sea like a dolphin while a shout from our pursuers told that they had observed our motions  i see something like land ahead said jack in a hopeful tone  it seems impossible that we could have made the island yet still if it is so we may reach it before these fellows can catch us for our canoe is light and our muscles are fresh  no one replied for to say truth we felt that in a long chase we had no chance whatever with a canoe which held nearly a hundred warriors nevertheless we resolved to do our utmost to escape and paddled with a degree of vigour that kept us well in advance of our pursuers  the warcanoe was so far behind us that it seemed but a little speck on the sea and the shouts to which the crew occasionally gave vent came faintly towards us on the morning breeze  we therefore hoped that we should be able to keep in advance for an hour or two when we might perhaps reach the land ahead  but this hope was suddenly crushed by the supposed land not long after rising up into the sky thus proving itself to be a fogbank  a bitter feeling of disappointment filled each heart and was expressed on each countenance as we beheld this termination to our hopes  but we had little time to think of regret  our danger was too great and imminent to permit of a moments relaxation from our exertions  no hope now animated our bosoms but a feeling of despair strange to say lent us power to work and nerved our arms with such energy that it was several hours ere the savages overtook us  when we saw that there was indeed no chance of escape and that paddling any longer would only serve to exhaust our strength without doing any good we turned the side of our canoe towards the approaching enemy and laid down our paddles  silently and with a look of bitter determination on his face jack lifted one of the light boatoars that we had brought with us and resting it on his shoulder stood up in an attitude of bold defiance peterkin took the other oar and also stood up but there was no anger visible on his countenance when not sparkling with fun it usually wore a mild sad expression which was deepened on the present occasion as he glanced at avatea who sat with her face resting in her hands upon her knees  without knowing very well what i intended to do i also arose and grasped my paddle with both hands  on came the large canoe like a warhorse of the deep with the foam curling from its sharp bow and the spearheads of the savages glancing in the beams of the rising sun  perfect silence was maintained on both sides and we could hear the hissing water and see the frowning eyes of the warriors as they came rushing on  when about twenty yards distant five or six of the savages in the bow rose and laying aside their paddles took up their spears  jack and peterkin raised their oars while with a feeling of madness whirling in my brain i grasped my paddle and prepared for the onset  but before any of us could strike a blow the sharp prow of the warcanoe struck us like a thunderbolt on the side and hurled us into the sea  what occurred after this i cannot tell for i was nearly drowned but when i recovered from the state of insensibility into which i had been thrown i found myself stretched on my back bound hand and foot between jack and peterkin in the bottom of the large canoe  in this condition we lay the whole day during which time the savages only rested one hour  when night came they rested again for another hour and appeared to sleep just as they sat  but we were neither unbound nor allowed to speak to each other during the voyage nor was a morsel of food or a draught of water given to us  for food however we cared little but we would have given much for a drop of water to cool our parched lips  and we would have been glad too had they loosened the cords that bound us for they were tightly fastened and occasioned us much pain  the air also was unusually hotso much so that i felt convinced that a storm was brewing  this also added to our sufferings however these were at length relieved by our arrival at the island from which we had fled  while we were being led ashore we caught a glimpse of avatea who was seated in the hinder part of the canoe  she was not fettered in any way  our captors now drove us before them towards the hut of tararo at which we speedily arrived and found the chief seated with an expression on his face that boded us no good  our friend the teacher stood beside him with a look of anxiety on his mild features  how comes it said tararo turning to the teacher that these youths have abused our hospitality  tell him replied jack that we have not abused his hospitality for his hospitality has not been extended to us  i came to the island to deliver avatea and my only regret is that i have failed to do so  if i get another chance i will try to save her yet  the teacher shook his head  nay my young friend i had better not tell him that it will only incense him  i care not replied jack  if you dont tell him that youll tell him nothing for i wont say anything softer  on hearing jacks speech tararo frowned and his eye flashed with anger  go presumptuous boy he said  my debt to you cancelled  you and your companions shall die  as he spoke he rose and signed to several of attendants who seized jack and peterkin and violently by the collars and dragging us from the house of the chief led us through the wood to the outskirts of the village  here they thrust us into a species of natural cave in a cliff and having barricaded the entrance left us in total darkness  after feeling about for some timefor our legs were unshackled although our wrists were still bound with thongswe found a low ledge of rock running along one side of the cavern  on this we seated ourselves and for a long time maintained unbroken silence  at last i could restrain my feelings no longer  alas dear jack and peterkin said i what is to become of us  i fear that we are doomed to die  i know not replied jack in a tremulous voicei know not  ralph i regret deeply the hastiness of my violent temper which i must confess has been the chief cause of our being brought to this sad condition perhaps the teacher may do something for us  but i have little hope  ah no said peterkin with a heavy sigh i am sure he cant help us tararo doesnt care more for him than for one of his dogs  truly said i there seems no chance of deliverance unless the almighty puts forth his arm to save us  yet i must say i have great hope my comrades for we have come to this dark place by no fault of oursunless it be a fault to try to succour a woman in distress  i was interrupted in my remarks by a noise at the entrance to the cavern which was caused by the removal of the barricade  immediately after three men entered and taking us by the collars of our coats led us away through the forest  as we advanced we heard much shouting and beating of native drums in the village and at first we thought that our guards were conducting us to the hut of tararo again  but in this we were mistaken  the beating of drums gradually increased and soon after we observed a procession of the natives coming towards us  at the head of this procession we were placed and then we all advanced together towards the temple where human victims were wont to be sacrificed  a thrill of horror ran through my heart as i recalled to mind the awful scenes that i had before witnessed at that dreadful spot  but deliverance came suddenly from a quarter whence we little expected it during the whole of that day there had been an unusual degree of heat in the atmosphere and the sky assumed that lurid aspect which portends a thunderstorm  just as we were approaching the horrid temple a growl of thunder burst overhead and heavy drops of rain began to fall  those who have not witnessed gales and storms in tropical regions can form but a faint conception of the fearful hurricane that burst upon the island of mango at this time  before we reached the temple the storm burst upon us with a deafening roar and the natives who knew too well the devastation that was to follow fled right and left through the woods in order to save their property leaving us alone in the midst of the howling storm  the trees around us bent before the blast like willows and we were about to flee in order to seek shelter when the teacher ran toward us with a knife in his hand  thank the lord he said cutting our bonds i am in time  now seek the shelter of the nearest rock  this we did without a moments hesitation for the whistling wind burst ever and anon like thunderclaps among the trees and tearing them from their roots hurled them with violence to the ground  rain cut across the land in sheets and lightning played like forked serpents in the air while high above the roar of the hissing tempest the thunder crashed and burst and rolled in awful majesty  in the village the scene was absolutely appalling  roofs were blown completely off the houses in many cases and in others the houses themselves were levelled with the ground  in the midst of this the natives were darting to and froin some instances saving their goods but in many others seeking to save themselves from the storm of destruction that whirled around them  but terrific although the tempest was on land it was still more tremendous on the mighty ocean  billows sprang as it were from the great deep and while their crests were absolutely scattered into white mist they fell upon the beach with a crash that seemed to shake the solid land  but they did not end there each successive wave swept higher and higher on the beach until the ocean lashed its angry waters among the trees and bushes and at length in a sheet of white curdled foam swept into the village and upset and carried off or dashed into wreck whole rows of the native dwellings it was a sublime an awful scene calculated in some degree at least to impress the mind of beholders with the might and majesty of god  we found shelter in a cave that night and all the next day during which time the storm raged in fury  but on the night following it abated somewhat and in the morning we went to the village to seek for food being so famished with hunger that we lost all feeling of danger and all wish to escape in our desire to satisfy the cravings of nature  but no sooner had we obtained food than we began to wish that we had rather endeavoured to make our escape into the mountains  this we attempted to do soon afterwards but the natives were now able to look after us and on our showing a disposition to avoid observation and make towards the mountains we were seized by three warriors who once more bound our wrists and thrust us into our former prison  it is true jack made a vigorous resistance and knocked down the first savage who seized him with a welldirected blow of his fist but he was speedily overpowered by others  thus we were again prisoners with the prospect of torture and a violent death before us    chapter thirty four  imprisonmentsinking hopesunexpected freedom to more than one and in more senses than one  for a long long month we remained in our dark and dreary prison during which dismal time we did not see the face of a human being except that of the silent savage who brought us our daily food  there have been one or two seasons in my life during which i have felt as if the darkness of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart could never pass away until death should make me cease to feel  the present was such a season  during the first part of our confinement we felt a cold chill at our hearts every time we heard a footfall near the cave dreading lest it should prove to be that of our executioner  but as time dragged heavily on we ceased to feel this alarm and began to experience such a deep irrepressible longing for freedom that we chafed and fretted in our confinement like tigers  then a feeling of despair came over us and we actually longed for the time when the savages would take us forth to die  but these changes took place very gradually and were mingled sometimes with brighter thoughts for there were times when we sat in that dark cavern on our ledge of rock and conversed almost pleasantly about the past until we wellnigh forgot the dreary present  but we seldom ventured to touch upon the future  a few decayed leaves and boughs formed our bed and a scanty supply of yams and taro brought to us once a day constituted our food  well ralph how have you slept said jack in a listless tone on rising one morning from his humble couch  were you much disturbed by the wind last night  no said i  i dreamed of home all night and i thought that my mother smiled upon me and beckoned me to go to her but i could not for i was chained  and i dreamed too said peterkin but it was of our happy home on the coral island  i thought we were swimming in the water garden  then the savages gave a yell and we were immediately in the cave at spouting cliff which somehow or other changed into this gloomy cavern and i awoke to find it true  peterkins tone was so much altered by the depressing influence of his long imprisonment that had i not known it was he who spoke i should scarcely have recognised it so sad was it and so unlike to the merry cheerful voice we had been accustomed to hear  i pondered this much and thought of the terrible decline of happiness that may come on human beings in so short a time how bright the sunshine in the sky at one time and in a short space bow dark the overshadowing cloud  i had no doubt that the bible would have given me much light and comfort on this subject if i had possessed one and i once more had occasion to regret deeply having neglected to store my memory with its consoling truths  while i meditated thus peterkin again broke the silence of the cave by saying in a melancholy tone oh i wonder if we shall ever see our dear island more  his voice trembled and covering his face with both hands he bent down his head and wept  it was an unusual sight for me to see our once joyous companion in tears and i felt a burning desire to comfort him but alas what could i say  i could hold out no hope and although i essayed twice to speak the words refused to pass my lips  while i hesitated jack sat down beside him and whispered a few words in his ear while peterkin threw himself on his friends breast and rested his head on his shoulder  thus we sat for some time in deep silence  soon after we heard footsteps at the entrance of the cave and immediately our jailer entered  we were so much accustomed to his regular visits however that we paid little attention to him expecting that he would set down our meagre fare as usual and depart  but to our surprise instead of doing so he advanced towards us with a knife in his hand and going up to jack he cut the thongs that bound his wrists then he did the same to peterkin and me  for fully five minutes we stood in speechless amazement with our freed hands hanging idly by our sides  the first thought that rushed into my mind was that the time had come to put us to death and although as i have said before we actually wished for death in the strength of our despair now that we thought it drew really near i felt all the natural love of life revive in my heart mingled with a chill of horror at the suddenness of our call  but i was mistaken  after cutting our bonds the savage pointed to the caves mouth and we marched almost mechanically into the open air here to our surprise we found the teacher standing under a tree with his hands clasped before him and the tears trickling down his dark cheeks  on seeing jack who came out first he sprang towards him and clasping him in his arms exclaimed  oh my dear young friend through the great goodness of god you are free  free cried jack  ay free repeated the teacher shaking us warmly by the hands again and againfree to go and come as you will  the lord has unloosed the bonds of the captive and set the prisoners free  a missionary has been sent to us and tararo has embraced the christian religion  the people are even now burning their gods of wood  come my dear friends and see the glorious sight  we could scarcely credit our senses  so long had we been accustomed in our cavern to dream of deliverance that we imagined for a moment this must surely be nothing more than another vivid dream  our eyes and minds were dazzled too by the brilliant sunshine which almost blinded us after our long confinement to the gloom of our prison so that we felt giddy with the variety of conflicting emotions that filled our throbbing bosoms but as we followed the footsteps of our sable friend and beheld the bright foliage of the trees and heard the cries of the paroquets and smelt the rich perfume of the flowering shrubs the truththat we were really delivered from prison and from deathrushed with overwhelming power into our souls and with one accord while tears sprang to our eyes we uttered a loud long cheer of joy  it was replied to by a shout from a number of the natives who chanced to be near  running towards us they shook us by the hand with every demonstration of kindly feeling  they then fell behind and forming a sort of procession conducted us to the dwelling of tararo  the scene that met our eyes here was one that i shall never forget  on a rude bench in front of his house sat the chief  a native stood on his left hand who from his dress seemed to be a teacher  on his right stood an english gentleman who i at once and rightly concluded was a missionary  he was tall thin and apparently past forty with a bald forehead and thin grey hair  the expression of his countenance was the most winning i ever saw and his clear grey eyes beamed with a look that was frank fearless loving and truthful  in front of the chief was an open space in the centre of which lay a pile of wooden idols ready to be set on fire and around these were assembled thousands of natives who had come to join in or to witness the unusual sight  a bright smile overspread the missionarys face as he advanced quickly to meet us and he shook us warmly by the hands  i am overjoyed to meet you my dear young friends he said  my friend and your friend the teacher has told me your history and i thank our father in heaven with all my heart that he has guided me to this island and made me the instrument of saving you  we thanked the missionary most heartily and asked him in some surprise how he had succeeded in turning the heart of tararo in our favour  i will tell you that at a more convenient time he answered meanwhile we must not forget the respect due to the chief  he waits to receive you  in the conversation that immediately followed between us and tararo the latter said that the light of the gospel of jesus christ had been sent to the island and that to it we were indebted for our freedom moreover he told us that we were at liberty to depart in our schooner whenever we pleased and that we should be supplied with as much provision as we required  he concluded by shaking hands with us warmly and performing the ceremony of rubbing noses  this was indeed good news to us and we could hardly find words to express our gratitude to the chief and to the missionary  and what of avatea inquired jack  the missionary replied by pointing to a group of natives in the midst of whom the girl stood  beside her was a tall strapping fellow whose noble mien and air of superiority bespoke him a chief of no ordinary kind  that youth is her lover  he came this very morning in his warcanoe to treat with tararo for avatea  he is to be married in a few days and afterwards returns to his island home with his bride  thats capital said jack as he stepped up to the savage and gave him a hearty shake of the hand  i wish you joy my ladand you too avatea  as jack spoke avateas lover took him by the hand and led him to the spot where tararo and the missionary stood surrounded by most of the chief men of the tribe  the girl herself followed and stood on his left hand while her lover stood on his right and commanding silence made the following speech which was translated by the missionary  young friend you have seen few years but your head is old  your heart also is large and very brave  i and avatea are your debtors and we wish in the midst of this assembly to acknowledge our debt and to say that it is one which we can never repay  you have risked your life for one who was known to you only for a few days  but she was a woman in distress and that was enough to secure to her the aid of a christian man  we who live in these islands of the sea know that the true christians always act thus  their religion is one of love and kindness  we thank god that so many christians have been sent here we hope many more will come  remember that i and avatea will think of you and pray for you and your brave comrades when you are far away  to this kind speech jack returned a short sailorlike reply in which he insisted that he had only done for avatea what he would have done for any woman under the sun  but jacks forte did not lie in speechmaking so he terminated rather abruptly by seizing the chiefs hand and shaking it violently after which he made a hasty retreat  now then ralph and peterkin said jack as we mingled with the crowd it seems to me that the object we came here for having been satisfactorily accomplished we have nothing more to do but get ready for sea as fast as we can and hurrah for old england  thats my idea precisely said peterkin endeavouring to wink but he had wept so much of late poor fellow that he found it difficult however im not going away till i see these fellows burn their gods  peterkin had his wish for in a few minutes afterwards fire was put to the pile the roaring flames ascended and amid the acclamations of the assembled thousands the false gods of mango were reduced to ashes    chapter thirty five  conclusion  to part is the lot of all mankind  the world is a scene of constant leavetaking and the hands that grasp in cordial greeting today are doomed ere long to unite for the last time when the quivering lips pronounce the word farewell  it is a sad thought but should we on that account exclude it from our minds  may not a lesson worth learning be gathered in the contemplation of it  may it not perchance teach us to devote our thoughts more frequently and attentively to that land where we meet but part no more  how many do we part from in this world with a light goodbye whom we never see again  often do i think in my meditations on this subject that if we realised more fully the shortness of the fleeting intercourse that we have in this world with many of our fellowmen we would try more earnestly to do them good to give them a friendly smile as it were in passing for the longest intercourse on earth is little more than a passing word and glance and show that we have sympathy with them in the short quick struggle of life by our kindly words and looks and actions  the time soon drew near when we were to quit the islands of the south seas and strange though it may appear we felt deep regret at parting with the natives of the island of mango for after they embraced the christian faith they sought by showing us the utmost kindness to compensate for the harsh treatment we had experienced at their hands and we felt a growing affection for the native teachers and the missionary and especially for avatea and her husband  before leaving we had many long and interesting conversations with the missionary in one of which he told us that he had been making for the island of rarotonga when his nativebuilt sloop was blown out of its course during a violent gale and driven to this island  at first the natives refused to listen to what he had to say but after a weeks residence among them tararo came to him and said that he wished to become a christian and would burn his idols  he proved himself to be sincere for as we have seen he persuaded all his people to do likewise  i use the word persuaded advisedly for like all the other feejee chiefs tararo was a despot and might have commanded obedience to his wishes but he entered so readily into the spirit of the new faith that he perceived at once the impropriety of using constraint in the propagation of it  he set the example therefore and that example was followed by almost every man of the tribe  during the short time that we remained at the island repairing our vessel and getting her ready for sea the natives had commenced building a large and commodious church under the superintendence of the missionary and several rows of new cottages were marked out so that the place bid fair to become in a few months as prosperous and beautiful as the christian village at the other end of the island  after avatea was married she and her husband were sent away loaded with presents chiefly of an edible nature  one of the native teachers went with them for the purpose of visiting still more distant islands of the sea and spreading if possible the light of the glorious gospel there  as the missionary intended to remain for several weeks longer in order to encourage and confirm his new converts jack and peterkin and i held a consultation in the cabin of our schoonerwhich we found just as we had left her for everything that had been taken out of her was restored  we now resolved to delay our departure no longer  the desire to see our beloved native land was strong upon us and we could not wait  three natives volunteered to go with us to tahiti where we thought it likely that we should be able to procure a sufficient crew of sailors to man our vessel so we accepted their offer gladly  it was a bright clear morning when we hoisted the snowwhite sails of the pirate schooner and left the shores of mango  the missionary and thousands of the natives came down to bid us godspeed and to see us sail away  as the vessel bent before a light fair wind we glided quickly over the lagoon under a cloud of canvas  just as we passed through the channel in the reef the natives gave us a loud cheer and as the missionary waved his hat while he stood on a coral rock with his grey hairs floating in the wind we heard the single word farewell borne faintly over the sea  that night as we sat on the taffrail gazing out upon the wide sea and up into the starry firmament a thrill of joy strangely mixed with sadness passed through our hearts for we were at length homeward bound and were gradually leaving far behind us the beautiful brightgreen coral islands of the pacific ocean
