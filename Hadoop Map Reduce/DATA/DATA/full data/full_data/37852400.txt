lie and how i got out of it      the esquimaux maidens romance      christian science and the book of mrs eddy      is he living or is he dead      my debut as a literary person      at the appetitecure      concerning the jews      from the london times of 1904      about playacting      travelling with a reformer      diplomatic pay and clothes      luck      the captains story      stirring times in austria      meisterschaft      my boyhood dreams           to the above old people      in memoriamolivia susan clemens      the man that corrupted hadleyburg  it was many years ago hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town in all the region round about it had kept that reputation unsmirched during three generations and was prouder of it than of any other of its possessions it was so proud of it and so anxious to insure its perpetuation that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing to its babies in the cradle and made the like teachings the staple of their culture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their education also throughout the formative years temptations were kept out of the way of the young people so that their honesty could have every chance to harden and solidify and become a part of their very bone the neighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy and affected to sneer at hadleyburgs pride in it and call it vanity but all the same they were obliged to acknowledge that hadleyburg was in reality an incorruptible town and if pressed they would also acknowledge that the mere fact that a young man hailed from hadleyburg was all the recommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal town to seek for responsible employment  but at last in the drift of time hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend a passing strangerpossibly without knowing it certainly without caring for hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself and cared not a rap for strangers or their opinions still it would have been well to make an exception in this ones case for he was a bitter man and revengeful all through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his injury in mind and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a compensating satisfaction for it he contrived many plans and all of them were good but none of them was quite sweeping enough the poorest of them would hurt a great many individuals but what he wanted was a plan which would comprehend the entire town and not let so much as one person escape unhurt at last he had a fortunate idea and when it fell into his brain it lit up his whole head with an evil joy he began to form a plan at once saying to himself that is the thing to doi will corrupt the town  six months later he went to hadleyburg and arrived in a buggy at the house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night he got a sack out of the buggy shouldered it and staggered with it through the cottage yard and knocked at the door a womans voice said come in and he entered and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour saying politely to the old lady who sat reading the missionary herald by the lamp  pray keep your seat madam i will not disturb you therenow it is pretty well concealed one would hardly know it was there can i see your husband a moment madam  no he was gone to brixton and might not return before morning  very well madam it is no matter i merely wanted to leave that sack in his care to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be found i am a stranger he does not know me i am merely passing through the town tonight to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind my errand is now completed and i go pleased and a little proud and you will never see me again there is a paper attached to the sack which will explain everything goodnight madam  the old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger and was glad to see him go but her curiosity was roused and she went straight to the sack and brought away the paper it began as follows   to be published or the right man sought out by private inquiry   either will answer  this sack contains gold coin weighing a hundred   and sixty pounds four ounces   mercy on us and the door not locked  mrs richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it then pulled down the windowshades and stood frightened worried and wondering if there was anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more safe she listened awhile for burglars then surrendered to curiosity and went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper   i am a foreigner and am presently going back to my own country to remain there permanently i am grateful to america for what i have received at her hands during my long stay under her flag and to one of her citizensa citizen of hadleyburgi am especially grateful for a great kindness done me a year or two ago two great kindnesses in fact i will explain i was a gambler i say i was i was a ruined gambler i arrived in this village at night hungry and without a penny i asked for helpin the dark i was ashamed to beg in the light i begged of the right man he gave me twenty dollarsthat is to say he gave me life as i considered it he also gave me fortune for out of that money i have made myself rich at the gamingtable and finally a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this day and has at last conquered me and in conquering has saved the remnant of my morals i shall gamble no more now i have no idea who that man was but i want him found and i want him to have this money to give away throw away or keep as he pleases it is merely my way of testifying my gratitude to him if i could stay i would find him myself but no matter he will be found this is an honest town an incorruptible town and i know i can trust it without fear this man can be identified by the remark which he made to me i feel persuaded that he will remember it  and now my plan is this if you prefer to conduct the inquiry privately do so tell the contents of this present writing to any one who is likely to be the right man if he shall answer i am the man the remark i made was soandso apply the testto wit open the sack and in it you will find a sealed envelope containing that remark if the remark mentioned by the candidate tallies with it give him the money and ask no further questions for he is certainly the right man  but if you shall prefer a public inquiry then publish this present writing in the local paperwith these instructions added to wit thirty days from now let the candidate appear at the townhall at eight in the evening friday and hand his remark in a sealed envelope to the rev mr burgess if he will be kind enough to act and let mr burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack open it and see if the remark is correct if correct let the money be delivered with my sincere gratitude to my benefactor thus identified  mrs richards sat down gently quivering with excitement and was soon lost in thinkingsafter this pattern what a strange thing it is  and what a fortune for that kind man who set his bread afloat upon the waters if it had only been my husband that did itfor we are so poor so old and poor then with a sighbut it was not my edward no it was not he that gave a stranger twenty dollars it is a pity too i see it now then with a shudderbut it is gamblers money the wages of sin we couldnt take it we couldnt touch it i dont like to be near it it seems a defilement she moved to a farther chair i wish edward would come and take it to the bank a burglar might come at any moment it is dreadful to be here all alone with it  at eleven mr richards arrived and while his wife was saying i am so glad youve come he was saying i am so tiredtired clear out it is dreadful to be poor and have to make these dismal journeys at my time of life always at the grind grind grind on a salaryanother mans slave and he sitting at home in his slippers rich and comfortable  i am so sorry for you edward you know that but be comforted we have our livelihood we have our good name  yes mary and that is everything dont mind my talkits just a moments irritation and doesnt mean anything kiss methere its all gone now and i am not complaining any more what have you been getting whats in the sack  then his wife told him the great secret it dazed him for a moment then he said  it weighs a hundred and sixty pounds why mary its forty thousand dollarsthink of ita whole fortune not ten men in this village are worth that much give me the paper  he skimmed through it and said  isnt it an adventure why its a romance its like the impossible things one reads about in books and never sees in life he was well stirred up now cheerful even gleeful he tapped his old wife on the cheek and said humorously why were rich mary rich all weve got to do is to bury the money and burn the papers if the gambler ever comes to inquire well merely look coldly upon him and say what is this nonsense you are talking we have never heard of you and your sack of gold before and then he would look foolish and  and in the meantime while you are running on with your jokes the money is still here and it is fast getting along toward burglartime  true very well what shall we domake the inquiry private no not that it would spoil the romance the public method is better think what a noise it will make and it will make all the other towns jealous for no stranger would trust such a thing to any town but hadleyburg and they know it its a great card for us i must get to the printingoffice now or i shall be too late  but stopstopdont leave me here alone with it edward  but he was gone for only a little while however not far from his own house he met the editorproprietor of the paper and gave him the document and said here is a good thing for you coxput it in  it may be too late mr richards but ill see  at home again he and his wife sat down to talk the charming mystery over they were in no condition for sleep the first question was who could the citizen have been who gave the stranger the twenty dollars it seemed a simple one both answered it in the same breath  barclay goodson  yes said richards he could have done it and it would have been like him but theres not another in the town  everybody will grant that edwardgrant it privately anyway for six months now the village has been its own proper self once morehonest narrow selfrighteous and stingy  it is what he always called it to the day of his deathsaid it right out publicly too  yes and he was hated for it  oh of course but he didnt care i reckon he was the besthated man among us except the reverend burgess  well burgess deserves ithe will never get another congregation here mean as the town is it knows how to estimate him edward doesnt it seem odd that the stranger should appoint burgess to deliver the money  well yesit does that isthat is  why so much thatising would you select him  mary maybe the stranger knows him better than this village does  much that would help burgess  the husband seemed perplexed for an answer the wife kept a steady eye upon him and waited finally richards said with the hesitancy of one who is making a statement which is likely to encounter doubt  mary burgess is not a bad man  his wife was certainly surprised  nonsense she exclaimed  he is not a bad man i know the whole of his unpopularity had its foundation in that one thingthe thing that made so much noise  that one thing indeed as if that one thing wasnt enough all by itself  plenty plenty only he wasnt guilty of it  how you talk not guilty of it everybody knows he was guilty  mary i give you my wordhe was innocent  i cant believe it and i dont how do you know  it is a confession i am ashamed but i will make it i was the only man who knew he was innocent i could have saved him andandwell you know how the town was wrought upi hadnt the pluck to do it it would have turned everybody against me i felt mean ever so mean ut i didnt dare i hadnt the manliness to face that  mary looked troubled and for a while was silent then she said stammeringly  ii dont think it would have done for you totoone mustnterpublic opinionone has to be so carefulso it was a difficult road and she got mired but after a little she got started again it was a great pity butwhy we couldnt afford it edwardwe couldnt indeed oh i wouldnt have had you do it for anything  it would have lost us the goodwill of so many people mary and thenand then  what troubles me now is what he thinks of us edward  he he doesnt suspect that i could have saved him  oh exclaimed the wife in a tone of relief i am glad of that as long as he doesnt know that you could have saved him hehewell that makes it a great deal better why i might have known he didnt know because he is always trying to be friendly with us as little encouragement as we give him more than once people have twitted me with it theres the wilsons and the wilcoxes and the harknesses they take a mean pleasure in saying your friend burgess because they know it pesters me i wish he wouldnt persist in liking us so i cant think why he keeps it up  i can explain it its another confession when the thing was new and hot and the town made a plan to ride him on a rail my conscience hurt me so that i couldnt stand it and i went privately and gave him notice and he got out of the town and stayed out till it was safe to come back  edward if the town had found it out  dont it scares me yet to think of it i repented of it the minute it was done and i was even afraid to tell you lest your face might betray it to somebody i didnt sleep any that night for worrying but after a few days i saw that no one was going to suspect me and after that i got to feeling glad i did it and i feel glad yet maryglad through and through  so do i now for it would have been a dreadful way to treat him yes im glad for really you did owe him that you know but edward suppose it should come out yet some day  it wont  why  because everybody thinks it was goodson  of course they would  certainly and of course he didnt care they persuaded poor old sawlsberry to go and charge it on him and he went blustering over there and did it goodson looked him over like as if he was hunting for a place on him that he could despise the most then he says so you are the committee of inquiry are you sawlsberry said that was about what he was hm do they require particulars or do you reckon a kind of a general answer will do if they require particulars i will come back mr goodson i will take the general answer first very well then tell them to go to helli reckon thats general enough and ill give you some advice sawlsberry when you come back for the particulars fetch a basket to carry what is left of yourself home in  just like goodson its got all the marks he had only one vanity he thought he could give advice better than any other person  it settled the business and saved us mary the subject was dropped  bless you im not doubting that  then they took up the goldsack mystery again with strong interest soon the conversation began to suffer breaksinterruptions caused by absorbed thinkings the breaks grew more and more frequent at last richards lost himself wholly in thought he sat long gazing vacantly at the floor and byandby he began to punctuate his thoughts with little nervous movements of his hands that seemed to indicate vexation meantime his wife too had relapsed into a thoughtful silence and her movements were beginning to show a troubled discomfort finally richards got up and strode aimlessly about the room ploughing his hands through his hair much as a somnambulist might do who was having a bad dream then he seemed to arrive at a definite purpose and without a word he put on his hat and passed quickly out of the house his wife sat brooding with a drawn face and did not seem to be aware that she was alone now and then she murmured lead us not into t butbutwe are so poor so poor lead us not into ah who would be hurt by itand no one would ever know lead us the voice died out in mumblings after a little she glanced up and muttered in a halffrightened halfglad way  he is gone but oh dear he may be too latetoo late maybe notmaybe there is still time she rose and stood thinking nervously clasping and unclasping her hands a slight shudder shook her frame and she said out of a dry throat god forgive meits awful to think such thingsbut lord how we are madehow strangely we are made  she turned the light low and slipped stealthily over and knelt down by the sack and felt of its ridgy sides with her hands and fondled them lovingly and there was a gloating light in her poor old eyes she fell into fits of absence and came half out of them at times to mutter if we had only waitedoh if we had only waited a little and not been in such a hurry  meantime cox had gone home from his office and told his wife all about the strange thing that had happened and they had talked it over eagerly and guessed that the late goodson was the only man in the town who could have helped a suffering stranger with so noble a sum as twenty dollars then there was a pause and the two became thoughtful and silent and byandby nervous and fidgety at last the wife said as if to herself  nobody knows this secret but the richardses and us nobody  the husband came out of his thinkings with a slight start and gazed wistfully at his wife whose face was become very pale then he hesitatingly rose and glanced furtively at his hat then at his wifea sort of mute inquiry mrs cox swallowed once or twice with her hand at her throat then in place of speech she nodded her head in a moment she was alone and mumbling to herself  and now richards and cox were hurrying through the deserted streets from opposite directions they met panting at the foot of the printingoffice stairs by the nightlight there they read each others face cox whispered  nobody knows about this but us  the whispered answer was  not a soulon honour not a soul  if it isnt too late to  the men were starting upstairs at this moment they were overtaken by a boy and cox asked  is that you johnny  yes sir  you neednt ship the early mailnor any mail wait till i tell you  its already gone sir  gone it had the sound of an unspeakable disappointment in it  yes sir timetable for brixton and all the towns beyond changed today sirhad to get the papers in twenty minutes earlier than common i had to rush if i had been two minutes later  the men turned and walked slowly away not waiting to hear the rest neither of them spoke during ten minutes then cox said in a vexed tone  what possessed you to be in such a hurry i cant make out  the answer was humble enough  i see it now but somehow i never thought you know until it was too late but the next time  next time be hanged it wont come in a thousand years  then the friends separated without a goodnight and dragged themselves home with the gait of mortally stricken men at their homes their wives sprang up with an eager wellthen saw the answer with their eyes and sank down sorrowing without waiting for it to come in words in both houses a discussion followed of a heated sorta new thing there had been discussions before but not heated ones not ungentle ones the discussions tonight were a sort of seeming plagiarisms of each other mrs richards said  if you had only waited edwardif you had only stopped to think but no you must run straight to the printingoffice and spread it all over the world  it said publish it  that is nothing it also said do it privately if you liked there nowis that true or not  why yesyes it is true but when i thought what a stir it would make and what a compliment it was to hadleyburg that a stranger should trust it so  oh certainly i know all that but if you had only stopped to think you would have seen that you couldnt find the right man because he is in his grave and hasnt left chick nor child nor relation behind him and as long as the money went to somebody that awfully needed it and nobody would be hurt by it andand  she broke down crying her husband tried to think of some comforting thing to say and presently came out with this  but after all mary it must be for the bestit must be we know that and we must remember that it was so ordered  ordered oh everythings ordered when a person has to find some way out when he has been stupid just the same it was ordered that the money should come to us in this special way and it was you that must take it on yourself to go meddling with the designs of providenceand who gave you the right it was wicked that is what it wasjust blasphemous presumption and no more becoming to a meek and humble professor of  but mary you know how we have been trained all our lives long like the whole village till it is absolutely second nature to us to stop not a single moment to think when theres an honest thing to be done  oh i know it i know itits been one everlasting training and training and training in honestyhonesty shielded from the very cradle against every possible temptation and so its artificial honesty and weak as water when temptation comes as we have seen this night god knows i never had shade nor shadow of a doubt of my petrified and indestructible honesty until nowand now under the very first big and real temptation iedward it is my belief that this towns honesty is as rotten as mine is as rotten as yours it is a mean town a hard stingy town and hasnt a virtue in the world but this honesty it is so celebrated for and so conceited about and so help me i do believe that if ever the day comes that its honesty falls under great temptation its grand reputation will go to ruin like a house of cards there now ive made confession and i feel better i am a humbug and ive been one all my life without knowing it let no man call me honest againi will not have it  iwell mary i feel a good deal as you do i certainly do it seems strange too so strange i never could have believed itnever  a long silence followed both were sunk in thought at last the wife looked up and said  i know what you are thinking edward  richards had the embarrassed look of a person who is caught  i am ashamed to confess it mary but  its no matter edward i was thinking the same question myself  i hope so state it  you were thinking if a body could only guess out what the remark was that goodson made to the stranger  its perfectly true i feel guilty and ashamed and you  im past it let us make a pallet here weve got to stand watch till the bank vault opens in the morning and admits the sack oh dear oh dearif we hadnt made the mistake  the pallet was made and mary said  the open sesamewhat could it have been i do wonder what that remark could have been but come we will get to bed now  and sleep  no think  yes think  by this time the coxes too had completed their spat and their reconciliation and were turning into think to think and toss and fret and worry over what the remark could possibly have been which goodson made to the stranded derelict that golden remark that remark worth forty thousand dollars cash  the reason that the village telegraphoffice was open later than usual that night was this the foreman of coxs paper was the local representative of the associated press one might say its honorary representative for it wasnt four times a year that he could furnish thirty words that would be accepted but this time it was different his despatch stating what he had caught got an instant answer   send the whole thingall the detailstwelve hundred words   a colossal order  the foreman filled the bill and he was the proudest man in the state by breakfasttime the next morning the name of hadleyburg the incorruptible was on every lip in america from montreal to the gulf from the glaciers of alaska to the orangegroves of florida and millions and millions of people were discussing the stranger and his moneysack and wondering if the right man would be found and hoping some more news about the matter would come soonright away     ii   hadleyburg village woke up worldcelebratedastonishedhappyvain vain beyond imagination its nineteen principal citizens and their wives went about shaking hands with each other and beaming and smiling and congratulating and saying this thing adds a new word to the dictionaryhadleyburg synonym for incorruptibledestined to live in dictionaries for ever and the minor and unimportant citizens and their wives went around acting in much the same way everybody ran to the bank to see the goldsack and before noon grieved and envious crowds began to flock in from brixton and all neighbouring towns and that afternoon and next day reporters began to arrive from everywhere to verify the sack and its history and write the whole thing up anew and make dashing freehand pictures of the sack and of richardss house and the bank and the presbyterian church and the baptist church and the public square and the townhall where the test would be applied and the money delivered and damnable portraits of the richardses and pinkerton the banker and cox and the foreman and reverend burgess and the postmasterand even of jack halliday who was the loafing goodnatured noaccount irreverent fisherman hunter boys friend straydogs friend typical sam lawson of the town the little mean smirking oily pinkerton showed the sack to all comers and rubbed his sleek palms together pleasantly and enlarged upon the towns fine old reputation for honesty and upon this wonderful endorsement of it and hoped and believed that the example would now spread far and wide over the american world and be epochmaking in the matter of moral regeneration and so on and so on  by the end of a week things had quieted down again the wild intoxication of pride and joy had sobered to a soft sweet silent delighta sort of deep nameless unutterable content all faces bore a look of peaceful holy happiness  then a change came it was a gradual change so gradual that its beginnings were hardly noticed maybe were not noticed at all except by jack halliday who always noticed everything and always made fun of it too no matter what it was he began to throw out chaffing remarks about people not looking quite so happy as they did a day or two ago and next he claimed that the new aspect was deepening to positive sadness next that it was taking on a sick look and finally he said that everybody was become so moody thoughtful and absentminded that he could rob the meanest man in town of a cent out of the bottom of his breeches pocket and not disturb his reverie  at this stageor at about this stagea saying like this was dropped at bedtimewith a sigh usuallyby the head of each of the nineteen principal households  ah what could have been the remark that goodson made  and straightwaywith a shuddercame this from the mans wife  oh dont what horrible thing are you mulling in your mind put it away from you for gods sake  but that question was wrung from those men again the next nightand got the same retort but weaker  and the third night the men uttered the question yet againwith anguish and absently this timeand the following nightthe wives fidgeted feebly and tried to say something but didnt  and the night after that they found their tongues and respondedlongingly  oh if we could only guess  hallidays comments grew daily more and more sparklingly disagreeable and disparaging he went diligently about laughing at the town individually and in mass but his laugh was the only one left in the village it fell upon a hollow and mournful vacancy and emptiness not even a smile was findable anywhere halliday carried a cigarbox around on a tripod playing that it was a camera and halted all passers and aimed the thing and said readynow look pleasant please but not even this capital joke could surprise the dreary faces into any softening  so three weeks passedone week was left it was saturday evening after supper instead of the aforetime saturdayevening flutter and bustle and shopping and larking the streets were empty and desolate richards and his old wife sat apart in their little parlourmiserable and thinking this was become their evening habit now the lifelong habit which had preceded it of reading knitting and contented chat or receiving or paying neighbourly calls was dead and gone and forgotten ages agotwo or three weeks ago nobody talked now nobody read nobody visitedthe whole village sat at home sighing worrying silent trying to guess out that remark  the postman left a letter richards glanced listlessly at the superscription and the postmarkunfamiliar bothand tossed the letter on the table and resumed his mighthavebeens and his hopeless dull miseries where he had left them off two or three hours later his wife got wearily up and was going away to bed without a goodnightcustom nowbut she stopped near the letter and eyed it awhile with a dead interest then broke it open and began to skim it over richards sitting there with his chair tilted back against the wall and his chin between his knees heard something fall it was his wife he sprang to her side but she cried out  leave me alone i am too happy read the letterread it  he did he devoured it his brain reeling the letter was from a distant state and it said   i am a stranger to you but no matter  i have something to tell i have just arrived home from mexico and learned about that episode of course you do not know who made that remark but i know and i am the only person living who does know it was goodson i knew him well many years ago i passed through your village that very night and was his guest till the midnight train came along i overheard him make that remark to the stranger in the darkit was in hale alley he and i talked of it the rest of the way home and while smoking in his house he mentioned many of your villagers in the course of his talkmost of them in a very uncomplimentary way but two or three favourably among these latter yourself i say favourablynothing stronger i remember his saying he did not actually like any person in the townnot one but that youi think he said youam almost surehad done him a very great service once possibly without knowing the full value of it and he wished he had a fortune he would leave it to you when he died and a curse apiece for the rest of the citizens now then if it was you that did him that service you are his legitimate heir and entitled to the sack of gold i know that i can trust to your honour and honesty for in a citizen of hadleyburg these virtues are an unfailing inheritance and so i am going to reveal to you the remark well satisfied that if you are not the right man you will seek and find the right one and see that poor goodsons debt of gratitude for the service referred to is paid this is the remark you are far from being a bad man go and reform  howard l stephenson   oh edward the money is ours and i am so grateful oh so gratefulkiss me dear its for ever since we kissedand we needed it sothe moneyand now you are free of pinkerton and his bank and nobodys slave any more it seems to me i could fly for joy  it was a happy halfhour that the couple spent there on the settee caressing each other it was the old days come againdays that had begun with their courtship and lasted without a break till the stranger brought the deadly money byandby the wife said  oh edward how lucky it was you did him that grand service poor goodson i never liked him but i love him now and it was fine and beautiful of you never to mention it or brag about it then with a touch of reproach but you ought to have told me edward you ought to have told your wife you know  well ierwell mary you see  now stop hemming and hawing and tell me about it edward i always loved you and now im proud of you everybody believes there was only one good generous soul in this village and now it turns out that youedward why dont you tell me  wellererwhy mary i cant  you cant why cant you  you see hewell hehe made me promise i wouldnt  the wife looked him over and said very slowly  madeyoupromise edward what do you tell me that for  mary do you think i would lie  she was troubled and silent for a moment then she laid her hand within his and said  no no we have wandered far enough from our bearingsgod spare us that in all your life you have never uttered a lie but nownow that the foundations of things seem to be crumbling from under us wewe she lost her voice for a moment then said brokenly lead us not into temptation i think you made the promise edward let it rest so let us keep away from that ground nowthat is all gone by let us be happy again it is no time for clouds  edward found it something of an effort to comply for his mind kept wanderingtrying to remember what the service was that he had done goodson  the couple lay awake the most of the night mary happy and busy edward busy but not so happy mary was planning what she would do with the money edward was trying to recall that service at first his conscience was sore on account of the lie he had told maryif it was a lie after much reflectionsuppose it was a lie what then was it such a great matter arent we always acting lies then why not tell them look at marylook what she had done while he was hurrying off on his honest errand what was she doing lamenting because the papers hadnt been destroyed and the money kept is theft better than lying  that point lost its stingthe lie dropped into the background and left comfort behind it the next point came to the front had he rendered that service well here was goodsons own evidence as reported in stephensons letter there could be no better evidence than thatit was even proof that he had rendered it of course so that point was settled no not quite he recalled with a wince that this unknown mr stephenson was just a trifle unsure as to whether the performer of it was richards or some otherand oh dear he had put richards on his honour he must himself decide whither that money must goand mr stephenson was not doubting that if he was the wrong man he would go honourably and find the right one oh it was odious to put a man in such a situationah why couldnt stephenson have left out that doubt what did he want to intrude that for  further reflection how did it happen that richardss name remained in stephensons mind as indicating the right man and not some other mans name that looked good yes that looked very good in fact it went on looking better and better straight alonguntil byandby it grew into positive proof and then richards put the matter at once out of his mind for he had a private instinct that a proof once established is better left so  he was feeling reasonably comfortable now but there was still one other detail that kept pushing itself on his notice of course he had done that servicethat was settled but what was that service he must recall ithe would not go to sleep till he had recalled it it would make his peace of mind perfect and so he thought and thought he thought of a dozen thingspossible services even probable servicesbut none of them seemed adequate none of them seemed large enough none of them seemed worth the moneyworth the fortune goodson had wished he could leave in his will and besides he couldnt remember having done them anyway now thennow thenwhat kind of a service would it be that would make a man so inordinately grateful ahthe saving of his soul that must be it yes he could remember now how he once set himself the task of converting goodson and laboured at it as much ashe was going to say three months but upon closer examination it shrunk to a month then to a week then to a day then to nothing yes he remembered now and with unwelcome vividness that goodson had told him to go to thunder and mind his own businesshe wasnt hankering to follow hadleyburg to heaven  so that solution was a failurehe hadnt saved goodsons soul richards was discouraged then after a little came another idea had he saved goodsons property no that wouldnt dohe hadnt any his life that is it of course why he might have thought of it before this time he was on the right track sure his imaginationmill was hard at work in a minute now  thereafter during a stretch of two exhausting hours he was busy saving goodsons life he saved it in all kinds of difficult and perilous ways in every case he got it saved satisfactorily up to a certain point then just as he was beginning to get well persuaded that it had really happened a troublesome detail would turn up which made the whole thing impossible as in the matter of drowning for instance in that case he had swum out and tugged goodson ashore in an unconscious state with a great crowd looking on and applauding but when he had got it all thought out and was just beginning to remember all about it a whole swarm of disqualifying details arrived on the ground the town would have known of the circumstance mary would have known of it it would glare like a limelight in his own memory instead of being an inconspicuous service which he had possibly rendered without knowing its full value and at this point he remembered that he couldnt swim anyway  ahthere was a point which he had been overlooking from the start it had to be a service which he had rendered possibly without knowing the full value of it why really that ought to be an easy huntmuch easier than those others and sure enough byandby he found it goodson years and years ago came near marrying a very sweet and pretty girl named nancy hewitt but in some way or other the match had been broken off the girl died goodson remained a bachelor and byandby became a soured one and a frank despiser of the human species soon after the girls death the village found out or thought it had found out that she carried a spoonful of negro blood in her veins richards worked at these details a good while and in the end he thought he remembered things concerning them which must have gotten mislaid in his memory through long neglect he seemed to dimly remember that it was he that found out about the negro blood that it was he that told the village that the village told goodson where they got it that he thus saved goodson from marrying the tainted girl that he had done him this great service without knowing the full value of it in fact without knowing that he was doing it but that goodson knew the value of it and what a narrow escape he had had and so went to his grave grateful to his benefactor and wishing he had a fortune to leave him it was all clear and simple now and the more he went over it the more luminous and certain it grew and at last when he nestled to sleep satisfied and happy he remembered the whole thing just as if it had been yesterday in fact he dimly remembered goodsons telling him his gratitude once meantime mary had spent six thousand dollars on a new house for herself and a pair of slippers for her pastor and then had fallen peacefully to rest  that same saturday evening the postman had delivered a letter to each of the other principal citizensnineteen letters in all no two of the envelopes were alike and no two of the superscriptions were in the same hand but the letters inside were just like each other in every detail but one they were exact copies of the letter received by richardshandwriting and alland were all signed by stephenson but in place of richardss name each receivers own name appeared  all night long eighteen principal citizens did what their castebrother richards was doing at the same timethey put in their energies trying to remember what notable service it was that they had unconsciously done barclay goodson in no case was it a holiday job still they succeeded  and while they were at this work which was difficult their wives put in the night spending the money which was easy during that one night the nineteen wives spent an average of seven thousand dollars each out of the forty thousand in the sacka hundred and thirtythree thousand altogether  next day there was a surprise for jack halliday he noticed that the faces of the nineteen chief citizens and their wives bore that expression of peaceful and holy happiness again he could not understand it neither was he able to invent any remarks about it that could damage it or disturb it and so it was his turn to be dissatisfied with life his private guesses at the reasons for the happiness failed in all instances upon examination when he met mrs wilcox and noticed the placid ecstasy in her face he said to himself her cat has had kittensand went and asked the cook it was not so the cook had detected the happiness but did not know the cause when halliday found the duplicate ecstasy in the face of shadbelly billson village nickname he was sure some neighbour of billsons had broken his leg but inquiry showed that this had not happened the subdued ecstasy in gregory yatess face could mean but one thinghe was a motherinlaw short it was another mistake and pinkertonpinkertonhe has collected ten cents that he thought he was going to lose and so on and so on in some cases the guesses had to remain in doubt in the others they proved distinct errors in the end halliday said to himself anyway it roots up that theres nineteen hadleyburg families temporarily in heaven i dont know how it happened i only know providence is off duty today  an architect and builder from the next state had lately ventured to set up a small business in this unpromising village and his sign had now been hanging out a week not a customer yet he was a discouraged man and sorry he had come but his weather changed suddenly now first one and then another chief citizens wife said to him privately  come to my house monday weekbut say nothing about it for the present we think of building  he got eleven invitations that day that night he wrote his daughter and broke off her match with her student he said she could marry a mile higher than that  pinkerton the banker and two or three other welltodo men planned countryseatsbut waited that kind dont count their chickens until they are hatched  the wilsons devised a grand new thinga fancydress ball they made no actual promises but told all their acquaintanceship in confidence that they were thinking the matter over and thought they should give itand if we do you will be invited of course people were surprised and said one to another why they are crazy those poor wilsons they cant afford it several among the nineteen said privately to their husbands it is a good idea we will keep still till their cheap thing is over then we will give one that will make it sick  the days drifted along and the bill of future squanderings rose higher and higher wilder and wilder more and more foolish and reckless it began to look as if every member of the nineteen would not only spend his whole forty thousand dollars before receivingday but be actually in debt by the time he got the money in some cases lightheaded people did not stop with planning to spend they really spenton credit they bought land mortgages farms speculative stocks fine clothes horses and various other things paid down the bonus and made themselves liable for the restat ten days presently the sober second thought came and halliday noticed that a ghastly anxiety was beginning to show up in a good many faces again he was puzzled and didnt know what to make of it the wilcox kittens arent dead for they werent born nobodys broken a leg theres no shrinkage in motherinlaws nothing has happenedit is an insolvable mystery  there was another puzzled man toothe rev mr burgess for days wherever he went people seemed to follow him or to be watching out for him and if he ever found himself in a retired spot a member of the nineteen would be sure to appear thrust an envelope privately into his hand whisper to be opened at the townhall friday evening then vanish away like a guilty thing he was expecting that there might be one claimant for the sackdoubtful however goodson being deadbut it never occurred to him that all this crowd might be claimants when the great friday came at last he found that he had nineteen envelopes     iii   the townhall had never looked finer  the platform at the end of it was backed by a showy draping of flags at intervals along the walls were festoons of flags the gallery fronts were clothed in flags the supporting columns were swathed in flags all this was to impress the stranger for he would be there in considerable force and in a large degree he would be connected with the press the house was full the 412 fixed seats were occupied also the 68 extra chairs which had been packed into the aisles the steps of the platform were occupied some distinguished strangers were given seats on the platform at the horseshoe of tables which fenced the front and sides of the platform sat a strong force of special correspondents who had come from everywhere it was the bestdressed house the town had ever produced there were some tolerably expensive toilets there and in several cases the ladies who wore them had the look of being unfamiliar with that kind of clothes at least the town thought they had that look but the notion could have arisen from the towns knowledge of the fact that these ladies had never inhabited such clothes before  the goldsack stood on a little table at the front of the platform where all the house could see it the bulk of the house gazed at it with a burning interest a mouthwatering interest a wistful and pathetic interest a minority of nineteen couples gazed at it tenderly lovingly proprietarily and the male half of this minority kept saying over to themselves the moving little impromptu speeches of thankfulness for the audiences applause and congratulations which they were presently going to get up and deliver every now and then one of these got a piece of paper out of his vest pocket and privately glanced at it to refresh his memory  of course there was a buzz of conversation going onthere always is but at last when the rev mr burgess rose and laid his hand on the sack he could hear his microbes gnaw the place was so still he related the curious history of the sack then went on to speak in warm terms of hadleyburgs old and wellearned reputation for spotless honesty and of the towns just pride in this reputation he said that this reputation was a treasure of priceless value that under providence its value had now become inestimably enhanced for the recent episode had spread this fame far and wide and thus had focussed the eyes of the american world upon this village and made its name for all time as he hoped and believed a synonym for commercial incorruptibility applause and who is to be the guardian of this noble famethe community as a whole no the responsibility is individual not communal from this day forth each and every one of you is in his own person its special guardian and individually responsible that no harm shall come to it do youdoes each of youaccept this great trust tumultuous assent then all is well transmit it to your children and to your childrens children today your purity is beyond reproachsee to it that it shall remain so today there is not a person in your community who could be beguiled to touch a penny not his ownsee to it that you abide in this grace we will we will this is not the place to make comparisons between ourselves and other communitiessome of them ungracious towards us they have their ways we have ours let us be content applause i am done under my hand my friends rests a strangers eloquent recognition of what we are through him the world will always henceforth know what we are we do not know who he is but in your name i utter your gratitude and ask you to raise your voices in indorsement  the house rose in a body and made the walls quake with the thunders of its thankfulness for the space of a long minute then it sat down and mr burgess took an envelope out of his pocket the house held its breath while he slit the envelope open and took from it a slip of paper he read its contentsslowly and impressivelythe audience listening with tranced attention to this magic document each of whose words stood for an ingot of gold  the remark which i made to the distressed stranger was this you are very far from being a bad man go and reform then he continuedwe shall know in a moment now whether the remark here quoted corresponds with the one concealed in the sack and if that shall prove to be soand it undoubtedly willthis sack of gold belongs to a fellowcitizen who will henceforth stand before the nation as the symbol of the special virtue which has made our town famous throughout the landmr billson  the house had gotten itself all ready to burst into the proper tornado of applause but instead of doing it it seemed stricken with a paralysis there was a deep hush for a moment or two then a wave of whispered murmurs swept the placeof about this tenor billson oh come this is too thin twenty dollars to a strangeror anybodybillson tell it to the marines and now at this point the house caught its breath all of a sudden in a new access of astonishment for it discovered that whereas in one part of the hall deacon billson was standing up with his head weekly bowed in another part of it lawyer wilson was doing the same there was a wondering silence now for a while everybody was puzzled and nineteen couples were surprised and indignant  billson and wilson turned and stared at each other billson asked bitingly  why do you rise mr wilson  because i have a right to perhaps you will be good enough to explain to the house why you rise  with great pleasure because i wrote that paper  it is an impudent falsity i wrote it myself  it was burgesss turn to be paralysed he stood looking vacantly at first one of the men and then the other and did not seem to know what to do the house was stupefied lawyer wilson spoke up now and said  i ask the chair to read the name signed to that paper  that brought the chair to itself and it read out the name  john wharton billson  there shouted billson what have you got to say for yourself now and what kind of apology are you going to make to me and to this insulted house for the imposture which you have attempted to play here  no apologies are due sir and as for the rest of it i publicly charge you with pilfering my note from mr burgess and substituting a copy of it signed with your own name there is no other way by which you could have gotten hold of the testremark i alone of living men possessed the secret of its wording  there was likely to be a scandalous state of things if this went on everybody noticed with distress that the shorthand scribes were scribbling like mad many people were crying chair chair order order burgess rapped with his gavel and said  let us not forget the proprieties due there has evidently been a mistake somewhere but surely that is all if mr wilson gave me an envelopeand i remember now that he didi still have it  he took one out of his pocket opened it glanced at it looked surprised and worried and stood silent a few moments then he waved his hand in a wandering and mechanical way and made an effort or two to say something then gave it up despondently several voices cried out  read it read it what is it  so he began in a dazed and sleepwalker fashion  the remark which i made to the unhappy stranger was this you are far from being a bad man the house gazed at him marvelling go and reform murmurs amazing what can this mean this one said the chair is signed thurlow g wilson  there cried wilson i reckon that settles it i knew perfectly well my note was purloined  purloined retorted billson ill let you know that neither you nor any man of your kidney must venture to  the chair order gentlemen order take your seats both of you please  they obeyed shaking their heads and grumbling angrily the house was profoundly puzzled it did not know what to do with this curious emergency presently thompson got up thompson was the hatter he would have liked to be a nineteener but such was not for him his stock of hats was not considerable enough for the position he said  mr chairman if i may be permitted to make a suggestion can both of these gentlemen be right i put it to you sir can both have happened to say the very same words to the stranger it seems to me  the tanner got up and interrupted him the tanner was a disgruntled man he believed himself entitled to be a nineteener but he couldnt get recognition it made him a little unpleasant in his ways and speech said he  sho thats not the point that could happentwice in a hundred yearsbut not the other thing neither of them gave the twenty dollars a ripple of applause  billson i did  wilson i did  then each accused the other of pilfering  the chair order sit down if you pleaseboth of you neither of the notes has been out of my possession at any moment  a voice goodthat settles that  the tanner mr chairman one thing is now plain one of these men has been eavesdropping under the other ones bed and filching family secrets if it is not unparliamentary to suggest it i will remark that both are equal to it the chair order order i withdraw the remark sir and will confine myself to suggesting that if one of them has overheard the other reveal the testremark to his wife we shall catch him now  a voice how  the tanner easily the two have not quoted the remark in exactly the same words you would have noticed that if there hadnt been a considerable stretch of time and an exciting quarrel inserted between the two readings  a voice name the difference  the tanner the word very is in billsons note and not in the other  many voices thats sohes right  the tanner and so if the chair will examine the testremark in the sack we shall know which of these two fraudsthe chair orderwhich of these two adventurersthe chair order orderwhich of these two gentlemenlaughter and applauseis entitled to wear the belt as being the first dishonest blatherskite ever bred in this townwhich he has dishonoured and which will be a sultry place for him from now out vigorous applause  many voices open itopen the sack  mr burgess made a slit in the sack slid his hand in and brought out an envelope in it were a couple of folded notes he said  one of these is marked not to be examined until all written communications which have been addressed to the chairif anyshall have been read the other is marked the test allow me it is wordedto wit  i do not require that the first half of the remark which was made to me by my benefactor shall be quoted with exactness for it was not striking and could be forgotten but its closing fifteen words are quite striking and i think easily rememberable unless these shall be accurately reproduced let the applicant be regarded as an impostor my benefactor began by saying he seldom gave advice to anyone but that it always bore the hallmark of high value when he did give it then he said thisand it has never faded from my memory you are far from being a bad man  fifty voices that settles itthe moneys wilsons wilson wilson speech speech  people jumped up and crowded around wilson wringing his hand and congratulating ferventlymeantime the chair was hammering with the gavel and shouting  order gentlemen order order let me finish reading please when quiet was restored the reading was resumedas follows  go and reformor mark my wordssome day for your sins you will die and go to hell or hadleyburgtry and make it the former  a ghastly silence followed first an angry cloud began to settle darkly upon the faces of the citizenship after a pause the cloud began to rise and a tickled expression tried to take its place tried so hard that it was only kept under with great and painful difficulty the reporters the brixtonites and other strangers bent their heads down and shielded their faces with their hands and managed to hold in by main strength and heroic courtesy at this most inopportune time burst upon the stillness the roar of a solitary voicejack hallidays  thats got the hallmark on it  then the house let go strangers and all even mr burgesss gravity broke down presently then the audience considered itself officially absolved from all restraint and it made the most of its privilege it was a good long laugh and a tempestuously wholehearted one but it ceased at lastlong enough for mr burgess to try to resume and for the people to get their eyes partially wiped then it broke out again and afterward yet again then at last burgess was able to get out these serious words  it is useless to try to disguise the factwe find ourselves in the presence of a matter of grave import it involves the honour of your townit strikes at the towns good name the difference of a single word between the testremarks offered by mr wilson and mr billson was itself a serious thing since it indicated that one or the other of these gentlemen had committed a theft  the two men were sitting limp nerveless crushed but at these words both were electrified into movement and started to get up  sit down said the chair sharply and they obeyed that as i have said was a serious thing and it wasbut for only one of them but the matter has become graver for the honour of both is now in formidable peril shall i go even further and say in inextricable peril both left out the crucial fifteen words he paused during several moments he allowed the pervading stillness to gather and deepen its impressive effects then added there would seem to be but one way whereby this could happen i ask these gentlemenwas there collusionagreement  a low murmur sifted through the house its import was hes got them both  billson was not used to emergencies he sat in a helpless collapse but wilson was a lawyer he struggled to his feet pale and worried and said  i ask the indulgence of the house while i explain this most painful matter i am sorry to say what i am about to say since it must inflict irreparable injury upon mr billson whom i have always esteemed and respected until now and in whose invulnerability to temptation i entirely believedas did you all but for the preservation of my own honour i must speakand with frankness i confess with shameand i now beseech your pardon for itthat i said to the ruined stranger all of the words contained in the testremark including the disparaging fifteen sensation when the late publication was made i recalled them and i resolved to claim the sack of coin for by every right i was entitled to it now i will ask you to consider this point and weigh it well that strangers gratitude to me that night knew no bounds he said himself that he could find no words for it that were adequate and that if he should ever be able he would repay me a thousandfold now then i ask you this could i expectcould i believecould i even remotely imaginethat feeling as he did he would do so ungrateful a thing as to add those quite unnecessary fifteen words to his testset a trap for meexpose me as a slanderer of my own town before my own people assembled in a public hall it was preposterous it was impossible his test would contain only the kindly opening clause of my remark of that i had no shadow of doubt you would have thought as i did you would not have expected a base betrayal from one whom you had befriended and against whom you had committed no offence and so with perfect confidence perfect trust i wrote on a piece of paper the opening wordsending with go and reformand signed it when i was about to put it in an envelope i was called into my back office and without thinking i left the paper lying open on my desk he stopped turned his head slowly toward billson waited a moment then added i ask you to note this when i returned a little latter mr billson was retiring by my street door sensation  in a moment billson was on his feet and shouting  its a lie its an infamous lie  the chair be seated sir mr wilson has the floor  billsons friends pulled him into his seat and quieted him and wilson went on  those are the simple facts my note was now lying in a different place on the table from where i had left it i noticed that but attached no importance to it thinking a draught had blown it there that mr billson would read a private paper was a thing which could not occur to me he was an honourable man and he would be above that if you will allow me to say it i think his extra word very stands explained it is attributable to a defect of memory i was the only man in the world who could furnish here any detail of the testmarkby honourable means i have finished  there is nothing in the world like a persuasive speech to fuddle the mental apparatus and upset the convictions and debauch the emotions of an audience not practised in the tricks and delusions of oratory wilson sat down victorious the house submerged him in tides of approving applause friends swarmed to him and shook him by the hand and congratulated him and billson was shouted down and not allowed to say a word the chair hammered and hammered with its gavel and kept shouting  but let us proceed gentlemen let us proceed  at last there was a measurable degree of quiet and the hatter said  but what is there to proceed with sir but to deliver the money  voices thats it thats it come forward wilson  the hatter i move three cheers for mr wilson symbol of the special virtue which  the cheers burst forth before he could finish and in the midst of themand in the midst of the clamour of the gavel alsosome enthusiasts mounted wilson on a big friends shoulder and were going to fetch him in triumph to the platform the chairs voice now rose above the noise  order to your places you forget that there is still a document to be read when quiet had been restored he took up the document and was going to read it but laid it down again saying i forgot this is not to be read until all written communications received by me have first been read he took an envelope out of his pocket removed its enclosure glanced at itseemed astonishedheld it out and gazed at itstared at it  twenty or thirty voices cried out  what is it read it read it  and he didslowly and wondering  the remark which i made to the strangervoices hello hows thiswas this you are far from being a bad man voices great scott go and reform voice oh saw my leg off signed by mr pinkerton the banker  the pandemonium of delight which turned itself loose now was of a sort to make the judicious weep those whose withers were unwrung laughed till the tears ran down the reporters in throes of laughter set down disordered pothooks which would never in the world be decipherable and a sleeping dog jumped up scared out of its wits and barked itself crazy at the turmoil all manner of cries were scattered through the din were getting richtwo symbols of incorruptibilitywithout counting billson threecount shadbelly inwe cant have too many all rightbillsons elected alas poor wilson victim of two thieves  a powerful voice silence the chairs fished up something more out of its pocket  voices hurrah is it something fresh read it read read  the chair reading the remark which i made etc you are far from being a bad man go etc signed gregory yates  tornado of voices four symbols rah for yates fish again  the house was in a roaring humour now and ready to get all the fun out of the occasion that might be in it several nineteeners looking pale and distressed got up and began to work their way towards the aisles but a score of shouts went up  the doors the doorsclose the doors no incorruptible shall leave this place sit down everybody the mandate was obeyed  fish again read read  the chair fished again and once more the familiar words began to fall from its lipsyou are far from being a bad man  name name whats his name  l ingoldsby sargent  five elected pile up the symbols go on go on  you are far from being a bad  name name  nicholas whitworth  hooray hooray its a symbolical day  somebody wailed in and began to sing this rhyme leaving out its to the lovely mikado tune of when a mans afraid of a beautiful maid the audience joined in with joy then just in time somebody contributed another line       and dont you this forget   the house roared it out  a third line was at once furnished       corruptibles far from hadleyburg are   the house roared that one too  as the last note died jack hallidays voice rose high and clear freighted with a final line       but the symbols are here you bet  that was sung with booming enthusiasm then the happy house started in at the beginning and sang the four lines through twice with immense swing and dash and finished up with a crashing threetimesthree and a tiger for hadleyburg the incorruptible and all symbols of it which we shall find worthy to receive the hallmark tonight  then the shoutings at the chair began again all over the place  go on go on read read some more read all youve got  thats itgo on we are winning eternal celebrity  a dozen men got up now and began to protest they said that this farce was the work of some abandoned joker and was an insult to the whole community without a doubt these signatures were all forgeries  sit down sit down shut up you are confessing well find your names in the lot  mr chairman how many of those envelopes have you got  the chair counted  together with those that have been already examined there are nineteen  a storm of derisive applause broke out  perhaps they all contain the secret i move that you open them all and read every signature that is attached to a note of that sortand read also the first eight words of the note  second the motion  it was put and carrieduproariously then poor old richards got up and his wife rose and stood at his side her head was bent down so that none might see that she was crying her husband gave her his arm and so supporting her he began to speak in a quavering voice  my friends you have known us twomary and meall our lives and i think you have liked us and respected us  the chair interrupted him  allow me it is quite truethat which you are saying mr richards this town does know you two it does like you it does respect you moreit honours you and loves you  hallidays voice rang out  thats the hallmarked truth too if the chair is right let the house speak up and say it rise now thenhip hip hipall together  the house rose in mass faced toward the old couple eagerly filled the air with a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs and delivered the cheers with all its affectionate heart  the chair then continued  what i was going to say is this we know your good heart mr richards but this is not a time for the exercise of charity toward offenders shouts of right right i see your generous purpose in your face but i cannot allow you to plead for these men  but i was going to  please take your seat mr richards we must examine the rest of these notessimple fairness to the men who have already been exposed requires this as soon as that has been donei give you my word for thisyou shall be heard  many voices rightthe chair is rightno interruption can be permitted at this stage go onthe names the namesaccording to the terms of the motion  the old couple sat reluctantly down and the husband whispered to the wife it is pitifully hard to have to wait the shame will be greater than ever when they find we were only going to plead for ourselves  straightway the jollity broke loose again with the reading of the names  you are far from being a bad man signature robert j titmarsh  you are far from being a bad man signature eliphalet weeks  you are far from being a bad man signature oscar b wilder  at this point the house lit upon the idea of taking the eight words out of the chairmans hands he was not unthankful for that thenceforward he held up each note in its turn and waited the house droned out the eight words in a massed and measured and musical deep volume of sound with a daringly close resemblance to a wellknown church chantyou are far from being a baaad man then the chair said signature archibald wilcox and so on and so on name after name and everybody had an increasingly and gloriously good time except the wretched nineteen now and then when a particularly shining name was called the house made the chair wait while it chanted the whole of the testremark from the beginning to the closing words and go to hell or hadleyburgtry and make it the forormer and in these special cases they added a grand and agonised and imposing aaaamen  the list dwindled dwindled dwindled poor old richards keeping tally of the count wincing when a name resembling his own was pronounced and waiting in miserable suspense for the time to come when it would be his humiliating privilege to rise with mary and finish his plea which he was intending to word thus  for until now we have never done any wrong thing but have gone our humble way unreproached we are very poor we are old and have no chick nor child to help us we were sorely tempted and we fell it was my purpose when i got up before to make confession and beg that my name might not be read out in this public place for it seemed to us that we could not bear it but i was prevented it was just it was our place to suffer with the rest it has been hard for us it is the first time we have ever heard our name fall from any ones lipssullied be mercifulfor the sake or the better days make our shame as light to bear as in your charity you can at this point in his reverie mary nudged him perceiving that his mind was absent the house was chanting you are far etc  be ready mary whispered your name comes now he has read eighteen  the chant ended  next next next came volleying from all over the house  burgess put his hand into his pocket the old couple trembling began to rise burgess fumbled a moment then said  i find i have read them all  faint with joy and surprise the couple sank into their seats and mary whispered  oh bless god we are savedhe has lost oursi wouldnt give this for a hundred of those sacks  the house burst out with its mikado travesty and sang it three times with everincreasing enthusiasm rising to its feet when it reached for the third time the closing line  but the symbols are here you bet  and finishing up with cheers and a tiger for hadleyburg purity and our eighteen immortal representatives of it  then wingate the saddler got up and proposed cheers for the cleanest man in town the one solitary important citizen in it who didnt try to steal that moneyedward richards  they were given with great and moving heartiness then somebody proposed that richards be elected sole guardian and symbol of the now sacred hadleyburg tradition with power and right to stand up and look the whole sarcastic world in the face  passed by acclamation then they sang the mikado again and ended it with  and theres one symbol left you bet  there was a pause then  a voice now then whos to get the sack  the tanner with bitter sarcasm thats easy the money has to be divided among the eighteen incorruptibles they gave the suffering stranger twenty dollars apieceand that remarkeach in his turnit took twentytwo minutes for the procession to move past staked the strangertotal contribution 360 all they want is just the loan backand interestforty thousand dollars altogether  many voices derisively thats it divvy divvy be kind to the poordont keep them waiting  the chair order i now offer the strangers remaining document it says if no claimant shall appear grand chorus of groans i desire that you open the sack and count out the money to the principal citizens of your town they to take it in trust cries of oh oh oh and use it in such ways as to them shall seem best for the propagation and preservation of your communitys noble reputation for incorruptible honesty more criesa reputation to which their names and their efforts will add a new and farreaching lustre enthusiastic outburst of sarcastic applause that seems to be all nohere is a postscript  pscitizens of hadleyburg there is no testremarknobody made one great sensation there wasnt any pauper stranger nor any twentydollar contribution nor any accompanying benediction and complimentthese are all inventions general buzz and hum of astonishment and delight allow me to tell my storyit will take but a word or two i passed through your town at a certain time and received a deep offence which i had not earned any other man would have been content to kill one or two of you and call it square but to me that would have been a trivial revenge and inadequate for the dead do not suffer besides i could not kill you alland anyway made as i am even that would not have satisfied me i wanted to damage every man in the place and every womanand not in their bodies or in their estate but in their vanitythe place where feeble and foolish people are most vulnerable so i disguised myself and came back and studied you you were easy game you had an old and lofty reputation for honesty and naturally you were proud of itit was your treasure of treasures the very apple of your eye as soon as i found out that you carefully and vigilantly kept yourselves and your children out of temptation i knew how to proceed why you simple creatures the weakest of all weak things is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire i laid a plan and gathered a list of names my project was to corrupt hadleyburg the incorruptible my idea was to make liars and thieves of nearly half a hundred smirchless men and women who had never in their lives uttered a lie or stolen a penny i was afraid of goodson he was neither born nor reared in hadleyburg i was afraid that if i started to operate my scheme by getting my letter laid before you you would say to yourselves goodson is the only man among us who would give away twenty dollars to a poor deviland then you might not bite at my bait but heaven took goodson then i knew i was safe and i set my trap and baited it it may be that i shall not catch all the men to whom i mailed the pretended testsecret but i shall catch the most of them if i know hadleyburg nature voices righthe got every last one of them i believe they will even steal ostensible gamblemoney rather than miss poor tempted and mistrained fellows i am hoping to eternally and everlastingly squelch your vanity and give hadleyburg a new renownone that will stickand spread far if i have succeeded open the sack and summon the committee on propagation and preservation of the hadleyburg reputation  a cyclone of voices open it open it the eighteen to the front committee on propagation of the tradition forwardthe incorruptibles  the chair ripped the sack wide and gathered up a handful of bright broad yellow coins shook them together then examined them  friends they are only gilded disks of lead  there was a crashing outbreak of delight over this news and when the noise had subsided the tanner called out  by right of apparent seniority in this business mr wilson is chairman of the committee on propagation of the tradition i suggest that he step forward on behalf of his pals and receive in trust the money  a hundred voices wilson wilson wilson speech speech  wilson in a voice trembling with anger you will allow me to say and

twentydollar pieces and give the result to the right manthe man whom hadleyburg delights to honouredward richards  this was received with great enthusiasm the dog taking a hand again the saddler started the bids at a dollar the brixton folk and barnums representative fought hard for it the people cheered every jump that the bids made the excitement climbed moment by moment higher and higher the bidders got on their mettle and grew steadily more and more daring more and more determined the jumps went from a dollar up to five then to ten then to twenty then fifty then to a hundred then  at the beginning of the auction richards whispered in distress to his wife oh mary can we allow it itityou see it is an honourreward a testimonial to purity of character andandcan we allow it hadnt i

as you think bestdo as you think best  edward fellthat is he sat still sat with a conscience which was not satisfied but which was overpowered by circumstances  meantime a stranger who looked like an amateur detective gotten up as an impossible english earl had been watching the evenings proceedings with manifest interest and with a contented expression in his face and he had been privately commenting to himself he was now soliloquising somewhat like this none of the eighteen are bidding that is not satisfactory i must change thatthe dramatic unities require it they must buy the sack they tried to steal they must pay a heavy price toosome of them are rich and another thing when i make a mistake in hadleyburg nature the man that puts that error upon me is entitled to a high honorarium and some one must pay this poor old richards has brought my judgment to shame he is an honest mani dont understand it but i acknowledge it yes he saw my deucesand with a straight flush and by rights the pot is his and it shall be a jackpot too if i can manage it he disappointed me but let that pass  he was watching the bidding at a thousand the market broke the prices tumbled swiftly he waitedand still watched one competitor dropped out then another and another he put in a bid or two now when the bids had sunk to ten dollars he added a five some one raised him a three he waited a moment then flung in a fiftydollar jump and the sack was hisat 1282 the house broke out in cheersthen stopped for he was on his feet and had lifted his hand he began to speak  i desire to say a word and ask a favour i am a speculator in rarities and i have dealings with persons interested in numismatics all over the world i can make a profit on this purchase just as it stands but there is a way if i can get your approval whereby i can make every one of these leaden twentydollar pieces worth its face in gold and perhaps more grant me that approval and i will give part of my gains to your mr richards whose invulnerable probity you have so justly and so cordially recognised tonight his share shall be ten thousand dollars and i will hand him the money tomorrow great applause from the house but the invulnerable probity made the richardses blush prettily however it went for modesty and did no harm if you will pass my proposition by a good majorityi would like a twothirds votei will regard that as the towns consent and that is all i ask rarities are always helped by any device which will rouse curiosity and compel remark now if i may have your permission to stamp upon the faces of each of these ostensible coins the names of the eighteen gentlemen who  ninetenths of the audience were on their feet in a momentdog and alland the proposition was carried with a whirlwind of approving applause and laughter  they sat down and all the symbols except dr clay harkness got up violently protesting against the proposed outrage and threatening to  i beg you not to threaten me said the stranger calmly i know my legal rights and am not accustomed to being frightened at bluster applause he sat down dr harkness saw an opportunity here he was one of the two very rich men of the place and pinkerton was the other harkness was proprietor of a mint that is to say a popular patent medicine he was running for the legislature on one ticket and pinkerton on the other it was a close race and a hot one and getting hotter every day both had strong appetites for money each had bought a great tract of land with a purpose there was going to be a new railway and each wanted to be in the legislature and help locate the route to his own advantage a single vote might make the decision and with it two or three fortunes the stake was large and harkness was a daring speculator he was sitting close to the stranger he leaned over while one or another of the other symbols was entertaining the house with protests and appeals and asked in a whisper  what is your price for the sack  forty thousand dollars  ill give you twenty  no  twentyfive  no  say thirty  the price is forty thousand dollars not a penny less  all right ill give it i will come to the hotel at ten in the morning i dont want it known will see you privately  very good then the stranger got up and said to the house  i find it late the speeches of these gentlemen are not without merit not without interest not without grace yet if i may be excused i will take my leave i thank you for the great favour which you have shown me in granting my petition i ask the chair to keep the sack for me until tomorrow and to hand these three fivehundreddollar notes to mr richards they were passed up to the chair  at nine i will call for the sack and at eleven will deliver the rest of the ten thousand to mr richards in person at his home goodnight  then he slipped out and left the audience making a vast noise which was composed of a mixture of cheers the mikado song dogdisapproval and the chant you are far from being a baad manaaa amen     iv   at home the richardses had to endure congratulations and compliments until midnight then they were left to themselves they looked a little sad and they sat silent and thinking finally mary sighed and said  do you think we are to blame edwardmuch to blame and her eyes wandered to the accusing triplet of big banknotes lying on the table where the congratulators had been gloating over them and reverently fingering them edward did not answer at once then he brought out a sigh and said hesitatingly  wewe couldnt help it mary itwell it was ordered all things are  mary glanced up and looked at him steadily but he didnt return the look presently she said  i thought congratulations and praises always tasted good butit seems to me nowedward  well  are you going to stay in the bank  nno  resign  in the morningby note  it does seem best  richards bowed his head in his hands and muttered  before i was not afraid to let oceans of peoples money pour through my hands butmary i am so tired so tired  we will go to bed  at nine in the morning the stranger called for the sack and took it to the hotel in a cab at ten harkness had a talk with him privately the stranger asked for and got five cheques on a metropolitan bankdrawn to bearerfour for 1500 each and one for 34000 he put one of the former in his pocketbook and the remainder representing 38500 he put in an envelope and with these he added a note which he wrote after harkness was gone at eleven he called at the richards house and knocked mrs richards peeped through the shutters then went and received the envelope and the stranger disappeared without a word she came back flushed and a little unsteady on her legs and gasped out  i am sure i recognised him last night it seemed to me that maybe i had seen him somewhere before  he is the man that brought the sack here  i am almost sure of it  then he is the ostensible stephenson too and sold every important citizen in this town with his bogus secret now if he has sent cheques instead of money we are sold too after we thought we had escaped i was beginning to feel fairly comfortable once more after my nights rest but the look of that envelope makes me sick it isnt fat enough 8500 in even the largest banknotes makes more bulk than that  edward why do you object to cheques  cheques signed by stephenson i am resigned to take the 8500 if it could come in banknotesfor it does seem that it was so ordered marybut i have never had much courage and i have not the pluck to try to market a cheque signed with that disastrous name it would be a trap that man tried to catch me we escaped somehow or other and now he is trying a new way if it is cheques  oh edward it is too bad and she held up the cheques and began to cry  put them in the fire quick we mustnt be tempted it is a trick to make the world laugh at us along with the rest andgive them to me since you cant do it he snatched them and tried to hold his grip till he could get to the stove but he was human he was a cashier and he stopped a moment to make sure of the signature then he came near to fainting  fan me mary fan me they are the same as gold  oh how lovely edward why  signed by harkness what can the mystery of that be mary  edward do you think  look herelook at this fifteenfifteenfifteenthirtyfour thirtyeight thousand five hundred mary the sack isnt worth twelve dollars and harknessapparentlyhas paid about par for it  and does it all come to us do you thinkinstead of the ten thousand  why it looks like it and the cheques are made to bearer too  is that good edward what is it for  a hint to collect them at some distant bank i reckon perhaps harkness doesnt want the matter known what is thata note  yes it was with the cheques  it was in the stephenson handwriting but there was no signature it said   i am a disappointed man  your honesty is beyond the reach of temptation i had a different idea about it but i wronged you in that and i beg pardon and do it sincerely i honour youand that is sincere too this town is not worthy to kiss the hem of your garment dear sir i made a square bet with myself that there were nineteen debauchable men in your selfrighteous community i have lost take the whole pot you are entitled to it   richards drew a deep sigh and said  it seems written with fireit burns so maryi am miserable again  i too ah dear i wish  to think maryhe believes in me  oh dont edwardi cant bear it  if those beautiful words were deserved maryand god knows i believed i deserved them oncei think i could give the forty thousand dollars for them and i would put that paper away as representing more than gold and jewels and keep it always but nowwe could not live in the shadow of its accusing presence mary  he put it in the fire  a messenger arrived and delivered an envelope richards took from it a note and read it it was from burgess   you saved me in a difficult time  i saved you last night  it was at cost of a lie but i made the sacrifice freely and out of a grateful heart none in this village knows so well as i know how brave and good and noble you are at bottom you cannot respect me knowing as you do of that matter of which i am accused and by the general voice condemned but i beg that you will at least believe that i am a grateful man it will help me to bear my burden signed burgess   saved once more  and on such terms  he put the note in the lire ii wish i were dead mary i wish i were out of it all  oh these are bitter bitter days edward the stabs through their very generosity are so deepand they come so fast  three days before the election each of two thousand voters suddenly found himself in possession of a prized mementoone of the renowned bogus doubleeagles around one of its faces was stamped these words the remark i made to the poor stranger was around the other face was stamped these go and reform signed pinkerton thus the entire remaining refuse of the renowned joke was emptied upon a single head and with calamitous effect it revived the recent vast laugh and concentrated it upon pinkerton and harknesss election was a walkover  within twentyfour hours after the richardses had received their cheques their consciences were quieting down discouraged the old couple were learning to reconcile themselves to the sin which they had committed but they were to learn now that a sin takes on new and real terrors when there seems a chance that it is going to be found out this gives it a fresh and most substantial and important aspect at church the morning sermon was of the usual pattern it was the same old things said in the same old way they had heard them a thousand times and found them innocuous next to meaningless and easy to sleep under but now it was different the sermon seemed to bristle with accusations it seemed aimed straight and specially at people who were concealing deadly sins after church they got away from the mob of congratulators as soon as they could and hurried homeward chilled to the bone at they did not know whatvague shadowy indefinite fears and by chance they caught a glimpse of mr burgess as he turned a corner he paid no attention to their nod of recognition he hadnt seen it but they did not know that what could his conduct mean it might meanit mightmeanoh a dozen dreadful things was it possible that he knew that richards could have cleared him of guilt in that bygone time and had been silently waiting for a chance to even up accounts at home in their distress they got to imagining that their servant might have been in the next room listening when richards revealed the secret to his wife that he knew of burgesss innocence next richards began to imagine that he had heard the swish of a gown in there at that time next he was sure he had heard it they would call sarah in on a pretext and watch her face if she had been betraying them to mr burgess it would show in her manner they asked her some questionsquestions which were so random and incoherent and seemingly purposeless that the girl felt sure that the old peoples minds had been affected by their sudden good fortune the sharp and watchful gaze which they bent upon her frightened her and that completed the business she blushed she became nervous and confused and to the old people these were plain signs of guiltguilt of some fearful sort or otherwithout doubt she was a spy and a traitor when they were alone again they began to piece many unrelated things together and get horrible results out of the combination when things had got about to the worst richards was delivered of a sudden gasp and his wife asked  oh what is itwhat is it  the noteburgesss note its language was sarcastic i see it now he quoted at bottom you cannot respect me knowing as you do of that matter of which i am accusedoh it is perfectly plain now god help me he knows that i know you see the ingenuity of the phrasing it was a trapand like a fool i walked into it and mary  oh it is dreadfuli know what you are going to sayhe didnt return your transcript of the pretended testremark  nokept it to destroy us with mary he has exposed us to some already i know iti know it well i saw it in a dozen faces after church ah he wouldnt answer our nod of recognitionhe knew what he had been doing  in the night the doctor was called the news went around in the morning that the old couple were rather seriously illprostrated by the exhausting excitement growing out of their great windfall the congratulations and the late hours the doctor said the town was sincerely distressed for these old people were about all it had left to be proud of now  two days later the news was worse the old couple were delirious and were doing strange things by witness of the nurses richards had exhibited chequesfor 8500 nofor an amazing sum38500 what could be the explanation of this gigantic piece of luck  the following day the nurses had more newsand wonderful they had concluded to hide the cheques lest harm come to them but when they searched they were gone from under the patients pillowvanished away the patient said  let the pillow alone what do you want  we thought it best that the cheques  you will never see them againthey are destroyed they came from satan i saw the hellbrand on them and i knew they were sent to betray me to sin then he fell to gabbling strange and dreadful things which were not clearly understandable and which the doctor admonished them to keep to themselves  richards was right the cheques were never seen again  a nurse must have talked in her sleep for within two days the forbidden gabblings were the property of the town and they were of a surprising sort they seemed to indicate that richards had been a claimant for the sack himself and that burgess had concealed that fact and then maliciously betrayed it  burgess was taxed with this and stoutly denied it and he said it was not fair to attach weight to the chatter of a sick old man who was out of his mind still suspicion was in the air and there was much talk  after a day or two it was reported that mrs richardss delirious deliveries were getting to be duplicates of her husbands suspicion flamed up into conviction now and the towns pride in the purity of its one undiscredited important citizen began to dim down and flicker toward extinction  six days passed then came more news the old couple were dying richardss mind cleared in his latest hour and he sent for burgess burgess said  let the room be cleared i think he wishes to say something in privacy  no said richards i want witnesses i want you all to hear my confession so that i may die a man and not a dog i was cleanartificiallylike the rest and like the rest i fell when temptation came i signed a lie and claimed the miserable sack mr burgess remembered that i had done him a service and in gratitude and ignorance he suppressed my claim and saved me you know the thing that was charged against burgess years ago my testimony and mine alone could have cleared him and i was a coward and left him to suffer disgrace  nonomr richards you  my servant betrayed my secret to him  no one has betrayed anything to me and then he did a natural and justifiable thing he repented of the saving kindness which he had done me and he exposed meas i deserved  neveri make oath  out of my heart i forgive him  burgesss impassioned protestations fell upon deaf ears the dying man passed away without knowing that once more he had done poor burgess a wrong the old wife died that night  the last of the sacred nineteen had fallen a prey to the fiendish sack the town was stripped of the last rag of its ancient glory its mourning was not showy but it was deep  by act of the legislatureupon prayer and petitionhadleyburg was allowed to change its name to never mind whati will not give it away and leave one word out of the motto that for many generations had graced the towns official seal  it is an honest town once more and the man will have to rise early that catches it napping again      my first lie and how i got out of it  as i understand it what you desire is information about my first lie and how i got out of it i was born in 1835 i am well along and my memory is not as good as it was if you had asked about my first truth it would have been easier for me and kinder of you for i remember that fairly well i remember it as if it were last week the family think it was week before but that is flattery and probably has a selfish project back of it when a person has become seasoned by experience and has reached the age of sixtyfour which is the age of discretion he likes a family compliment as well as ever but he does not lose his head over it as in the old innocent days  i do not remember my first lie it is too far back but i remember my second one very well i was nine days old at the time and had noticed that if a pin was sticking in me and i advertised it in the usual fashion i was lovingly petted and coddled and pitied in a most agreeable way and got a ration between meals besides  it was human nature to want to get these riches and i fell i lied about the pinadvertising one when there wasnt any you would have done it george washington did it anybody would have done it during the first half of my life i never knew a child that was able to rise about that temptation and keep from telling that lie up to 1867 all the civilised children that were ever born into the world were liarsincluding george then the safetypin came in and blocked the game but is that reform worth anything no for it is reform by force and has no virtue in it it merely stops that form of lying it doesnt impair the disposition to lie by a shade it is the cradle application of conversion by fire and sword or of the temperance principle through prohibition  to return to that early lie they found no pin and they realised that another liar had been added to the worlds supply for by grace of a rare inspiration a quite commonplace but seldom noticed fact was borne in upon their understandingsthat almost all lies are acts and speech has no part in them then if they examined a little further they recognised that all people are liars from the cradle onwards without exception and that they begin to lie as soon as they wake in the morning and keep it up without rest or refreshment until they go to sleep at night if they arrived at that truth it probably grieved themdid if they had been heedlessly and ignorantly educated by their books and teachers for why should a person grieve over a thing which by the eternal law of his make he cannot help he didnt invent the law it is merely his business to obey it and keep still join the universal conspiracy and keep so still that he shall deceive his fellowconspirators into imagining that he doesnt know that the law exists it is what we all dowe that know i am speaking of the lie of silent assertion we can tell it without saying a word and we all do itwe that know in the magnitude of its territorial spread it is one of the most majestic lies that the civilisations make it their sacred and anxious care to guard and watch and propagate  for instance it would not be possible for a humane and intelligent person to invent a rational excuse for slavery yet you will remember that in the early days of the emancipation agitation in the north the agitators got but small help or countenance from any one argue and plead and pray as they might they could not break the universal stillness that reigned from pulpit and press all the way down to the bottom of societythe clammy stillness created and maintained by the lie of silent assertionthe silent assertion that there wasnt anything going on in which humane and intelligent people were interested  from the beginning of the dreyfus case to the end of it all france except a couple of dozen moral paladins lay under the smother of the silentassertion lie that no wrong was being done to a persecuted and unoffending man the like smother was over england lately a good half of the population silently letting on that they were not aware that mr chamberlain was trying to manufacture a war in south africa and was willing to pay fancy prices for the materials  now there we have instances of three prominent ostensible civilisations working the silentassertion lie could one find other instances in the three countries i think so not so very many perhaps but say a billionjust so as to keep within bounds are those countries working that kind of lie day in and day out in thousands and thousands of varieties without ever resting yes we know that to be true the universal conspiracy of the silentassertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere and always in the interest of a stupidity or a sham never in the interest of a thing fine or respectable is it the most timid and shabby of all lies it seems to have the look of it for ages and ages it has mutely laboured in the interest of despotisms and aristocracies and chattel slaveries and military slaveries and religious slaveries and has kept them alive keeps them alive yet here and there and yonder all about the globe and will go on keeping them alive until the silentassertion lie retires from businessthe silent assertion that nothing is going on which fair and intelligent men are aware of and are engaged by their duty to try to stop  what i am arriving at is this when whole races and peoples conspire to propagate gigantic mute lies in the interest of tyrannies and shams why should we care anything about the trifling lies told by individuals why should we try to make it appear that abstention from lying is a virtue why should we want to beguile ourselves in that way why should we without shame help the nation lie and then be ashamed to do a little lying on our own account why shouldnt we be honest and honourable and lie every time we get a chance that is to say why shouldnt we be consistent and either lie all the time or not at all why should we help the nation lie the whole day long and then object to telling one little individual private lie in our own interest to go to bed on just for the refreshment of it i mean and to take the rancid taste out of our mouth  here in england they have the oddest ways they wont tell a spoken lienothing can persuade them except in a large moral interest like politics or religion i mean to tell a spoken lie to get even the poorest little personal advantage out of it is a thing which is impossible to them they make me ashamed of myself sometimes they are so bigoted they will not even tell a lie for the fun of it they will not tell it when it hasnt even a suggestion of damage or advantage in it for any one this has a restraining influence upon me in spite of reason and i am always getting out of practice  of course they tell all sorts of little unspoken lies just like anybody but they dont notice it until their attention is called to it they have got me so that sometimes i never tell a verbal lie now except in a modified form and even in the modified form they dont approve of it still that is as far as i can go in the interest of the growing friendly relations between the two countries i must keep some of my selfrespectand my health i can live on a pretty low diet but i cant get along on no sustenance at all  of course there are times when these people have to come out with a spoken lie for that is a thing which happens to everybody once in a while and would happen to the angels if they came down here much particularly to the angels in fact for the lies i speak of are selfsacrificing ones told for a generous object not a mean one but even when these people tell a lie of that sort it seems to scare them and unsettle their minds it is a wonderful thing to see and shows that they are all insane in fact it is a country which is full of the most interesting superstitions  i have an english friend of twentyfive years standing and yesterday when we were coming downtown on top of the bus i happened to tell him a liea modified one of course a halfbreed a mulatto i cant seem to tell any other kind now the market is so flat i was explaining to him how i got out of an embarrassment in austria last year i do not know what might have become of me if i hadnt happened to remember to tell the police that i belonged to the same family as the prince of wales that made everything pleasant and they let me go and apologised too and were ever so kind and obliging and polite and couldnt do too much for me and explained how the mistake came to be made and promised to hang the officer that did it and hoped i would let bygones be bygones and not say anything about it and i said they could depend on me my friend said austerely  you call it a modified lie where is the modification  i explained that it lay in the form of my statement to the police i didnt say i belonged to the royal family i only said i belonged to the same family as the princemeaning the human family of course and if those people had had any penetration they would have known it i cant go around furnishing brains to the police it is not to be expected  how did you feel after that performance  well of course i was distressed to find that the police had misunderstood me but as long as i had not told any lie i knew there was no occasion to sit up nights and worry about it  my friend struggled with the case several minutes turning it over and examining it in his mind then he said that so far as he could see the modification was itself a lie it being a misleading reservation of an explanatory fact and so i had told two lies instead of only one  i wouldnt have done it said he i have never told a lie and i should be very sorry to do such a thing  just then he lifted his hat and smiled a basketful of surprised and delighted smiles down at a gentleman who was passing in a hansom  who was that g  i dont know  then why did you do that  because i saw he thought he knew me and was expecting it of me if i hadnt done it he would have been hurt i didnt want to embarrass him before the whole street  well your heart was right g and your act was right what you did was kindly and courteous and beautiful i would have done it myself but it was a lie  a lie i didnt say a word how do you make it out  i know you didnt speak still you said to him very plainly and enthusiastically in dumb show hello you in town awful glad to see you old fellow when did you get back concealed in your actions was what you have called a misleading reservation of an explanatory factthe act that you had never seen him before you expressed joy in encountering hima lie and you made that reservationanother lie it was my pair over again but dont be troubledwe all do it  two hours later at dinner when quite other matters were being discussed he told how he happened along once just in the nick of time to do a great service for a family who were old friends of his the head of it had suddenly died in circumstances and surroundings of a ruinously disgraceful character if know the facts would break the hearts of the innocent family and put upon them a load of unendurable shame there was no help but in a giant lie and he girded up his loins and told it  the family never found out g  never in all these years they have never suspected they were proud of him and had always reason to be they are proud of him yet and to them his memory is sacred and stainless and beautiful  they had a narrow escape g  indeed they had  for the very next man that came along might have been one of these heartless and shameless truthmongers you have told the truth a million times in your life g but that one golden lie atones for it all persevere  some may think me not strict enough in my morals but that position is hardly tenable there are many kinds of lying which i do not approve i do not like an injurious lie except when it injures somebody else and i do not like the lie of bravado nor the lie of virtuous ecstasy the latter was affected by bryant the former by carlyle  mr bryant said truth crushed to earth will rise again i have taken medals at thirteen worlds fairs and may claim to be not without capacity but i never told as big a one as that mr bryant was playing to the gallery we all do it carlyle said in substance thisi do not remember the exact words this gospel is eternalthat a lie shall not live i have a reverent affection for carlyles books and have read his revelation eight times and so i prefer to think he was not entirely at himself when he told that one to me it is plain that he said it in a moment of excitement when chasing americans out of his backyard with brickbats they used to go there and worship at bottom he was probably fond of it but he was always able to conceal it he kept bricks for them but he was not a good shot and it is matter of history that when he fired they dodged and carried off the brick for as a nation we like relics and so long as we get them we do not much care what the reliquary thinks about it i am quite sure that when he told that large one about a lie not being able to live he had just missed an american and was over excited he told it above thirty years ago but it is alive yet alive and very healthy and hearty and likely to outlive any fact in history carlyle was truthful when calm but give him americans enough and bricks enough and he could have taken medals himself  as regards that time that george washington told the truth a word must be said of course it is the principal jewel in the crown of america and it is but natural that we should work it for all it is worth as milton says in his lay of the last minstrel it was a timely and judicious truth and i should have told it myself in the circumstances but i should have stopped there it was a stately truth a lofty trutha tower and i think it was a mistake to go on and distract attention from its sublimity by building another tower alongside of it fourteen times as high i refer to his remark that he could not lie i should have fed that to the marines or left it to carlyle it is just in his style it would have taken a medal at any european fair and would have got an honourable mention even at chicago if it had been saved up but let it pass the father of his country was excited i have been in those circumstances and i recollect  with the truth he told i have no objection to offer as already indicated i think it was not premeditated but an inspiration with his fine military mind he had probably arranged to let his brother edward in for the cherry tree results but by an inspiration he saw his opportunity in time and took advantage of it by telling the truth he could astonish his father his father would tell the neighbours the neighbours would spread it it would travel to all firesides in the end it would make him president and not only that but first president he was a farseeing boy and would be likely to think of these things therefore to my mind he stands justified for what he did but not for the other tower it was a mistake still i dont know about that upon reflection i think perhaps it wasnt for indeed it is that tower that makes the other one live if he hadnt said i cannot tell a lie there would have been no convulsion that was the earthquake that rocked the planet that is the kind of statement that lives for ever and a fact barnacled to it has a good chance to share its immortality  to sum up on the whole i am satisfied with things the way they are there is a prejudice against the spoken lie but none against any other and by examination and mathematical computation i find that the proportion of the spoken lie to the other varieties is as 1 to 22894 therefore the spoken lie is of no consequence and it is not worth while to go around fussing about it and trying to make believe that it is an important matter the silent colossal national lie that is the support and confederate of all the tyrannies and shams and inequalities and unfairnesses that afflict the peoplesthat is the one to throw bricks and sermons at but let us be judicious and let somebody else begin  and thenbut i have wandered from my text how did i get out of my second lie i think i got out with honour but i cannot be sure for it was a long time ago and some of the details have faded out of my memory i recollect that i was reversed and stretched across some ones knee and that something happened but i cannot now remember what it was i think there was music but it is all dim now and blurred by the lapse of time and this may be only a senile fancy       the esquimaux maidens romance  yes i will tell you anything about my life that you would like to know mr twain she said in her soft voice and letting her honest eyes rest placidly upon my face for it is kind and good of you to like me and care to know about me  she had been absently scraping blubbergrease from her cheeks with a small boneknife and transferring it to her fur sleeve while she watched the aurora borealis swing its flaming streamers out of the sky and wash the lonely snow plain and the templed icebergs with the rich hues of the prism a spectacle of almost intolerable splendour and beauty but now she shook off her reverie and prepared to give me the humble little history i had asked for she settled herself comfortably on the block of ice which we were using as a sofa and i made ready to listen  she was a beautiful creature i speak from the esquimaux point of view others would have thought her a trifle overplump she was just twenty years old and was held to be by far the most bewitching girl in her tribe even now in the open air with her cumbersome and shapeless fur coat and trousers and boots and vast hood the beauty of her face was at least apparent but her figure had to be taken on trust among all the guests who came and went i had seen no girl at her fathers hospitable trough who could be called her equal yet she was not spoiled she was sweet and natural and sincere and if she was aware that she was a belle there was nothing about her ways to show that she possessed that knowledge  she had been my daily comrade for a week now and the better i knew her the better i liked her she had been tenderly and carefully brought up in an atmosphere of singularly rare refinement for the polar regions for her father was the most important man of his tribe and ranked at the top of esquimaux civilisation i made long dogsledge trips across the mighty ice floes with lascathat was her nameand found her company always pleasant and her conversation agreeable i went fishing with her but not in her perilous boat i merely followed along on the ice and watched her strike her game with her fatally accurate spear we went sealing together several times i stood by while she and the family dug blubber from a stranded whale and once i went part of the way when she was hunting a bear but turned back before the finish because at bottom i am afraid of bears  however she was ready to begin her story now and this is what she said  our tribe had always been used to wander about from place to place over the frozen seas like the other tribes but my father got tired of that two years ago and built this great mansion of frozen snowblockslook at it it is seven feet high and three or four times as long as any of the othersand here we have stayed ever since he was very proud of his house and that was reasonable for if you have examined it with care you must have noticed how much finer and completer it is than houses usually are but if you have not you must for you will find it has luxurious appointments that are quite beyond the common for instance in that end of it which you have called the parlour the raised platform for the accommodation of guests and the family at meals is the largest you have ever seen in any houseis it not so  yes you are quite right lasca it is the largest we have nothing resembling it in even the finest houses in the united states this admission made her eyes sparkle with pride and pleasure i noted that and took my cue  i thought it must have surprised you she said and another thing it is bedded far deeper in furs than is usual all kinds of fursseal seaotter silvergrey fox bear marten sableevery kind of fur in profusion and the same with the iceblock sleepingbenches along the walls which you call beds are your platforms and sleepingbenches better provided at home  indeed they are not lascathey do not begin to be that pleased her again all she was thinking of was the number of furs her aesthetic father took the trouble to keep on hand not their value i could have told her that those masses of rich furs constituted wealthor would in my countrybut she would not have understood that those were not the kind of things that ranked as riches with her people i could have told her that the clothes she had on or the everyday clothes of the commonest person about her were worth twelve or fifteen hundred dollars and that i was not acquainted with anybody at home who wore twelvehundred dollar toilets to go fishing in but she would not have understood it so i said nothing she resumed  and then the sloptubs we have two in the parlour and two in the rest of the house it is very seldom that one has two in the parlour have you two in the parlour at home  the memory of those tubs made me gasp but i recovered myself before she noticed and said with effusion  why lasca it is a shame of me to expose my country and you must not let it go further for i am speaking to you in confidence but i give you my word of honour that not even the richest man in the city of new york has two sloptubs in his drawingroom  she clapped her furclad hands in innocent delight and exclaimed  oh but you cannot mean it you cannot mean it  indeed i am in earnest dear there is vanderbilt vanderbilt is almost the richest man in the whole world now if i were on my dying bed i could say to you that not even he has two in his drawingroom why he hasnt even onei wish i may die in my tracks if it isnt true  her lovely eyes stood wide with amazement and she said slowly and with a sort of awe in her voice  how strangehow incredibleone is not able to realise it is he penurious  noit isnt that it isnt the expense he minds buterwell you know it would look like showing off yes that is it that is the idea he is a plain man in his way and shrinks from display  why that humility is right enough said lasca if one does not carry it too farbut what does the place look like  well necessarily it looks pretty barren and unfinished but  i should think so i never heard anything like it is it a fine housethat is otherwise  pretty fine yes it is very well thought of  the girl was silent awhile and sat dreamily gnawing a candleend apparently trying to think the thing out at last she gave her head a little toss and spoke out her opinion with decision  well to my mind theres a breed of humility which is itself a species of showing off when you get down to the marrow of it and when a man is able to afford two sloptubs in his parlour and doesnt do it it may be that he is truly humbleminded but its a hundred times more likely that he is just trying to strike the public eye in my judgment your mr vanderbilt knows what he is about  i tried to modify this verdict feeling that a double sloptub standard was not a fair one to try everybody by although a sound enough one in its own habitat but the girls head was set and she was not to be persuaded presently she said  do the rich people with you have as good sleepingbenches as ours and made out of as nice broad iceblocks  well they are pretty goodgood enoughbut they are not made of iceblocks  i want to know why arent they made of iceblocks  i explained the difficulties in the way and the expensiveness of ice in a country where you have to keep a sharp eye on your iceman or your icebill will weigh more than your ice then she cried out  dear me do you buy your ice  we most surely do dear  she burst into a gale of guileless laughter and said  oh i never heard of anything so silly my theres plenty of itit isnt worth anything why there is a hundred miles of it in sight right now i wouldnt give a fishbladder for the whole of it  well its because you dont know how to value it you little provincial muggings if you had it in new york in midsummer you could buy all the whales in the market with it  she looked at me doubtfully and said  are you speaking true  absolutely i take my oath to it  this made her thoughtful presently she said with a little sigh  i wish i could live there  i had merely meant to furnish her a standard of values which she could understand but my purpose had miscarried i had only given her the impression that whales were cheap and plenty in new york and set her mouth to watering for them it seemed best to try to mitigate the evil which i had done so i said  but you wouldnt care for whalemeat if you lived there nobody does  what  indeed they dont  why dont they  welll i hardly know its prejudice i think yes that is itjust prejudice i reckon somebody that hadnt anything better to do started a prejudice against it some time or other and once you get a caprice like that fairly going you know it will last no end of time  that is trueperfectly true said the girl reflectively like our prejudice against soap hereour tribes had a prejudice against soap at first you know  i glanced at her to see if she was in earnest evidently she was i hesitated then said cautiously  but pardon me they had a prejudice against soap hadwith falling inflection  yesbut that was only at first nobody would eat it  ohi understand i didnt get your idea before  she resumed  it was just a prejudice the first time soap came here from the foreigners nobody liked it but as soon as it got to be fashionable everybody liked it and now everybody has it that can afford it are you fond of it  yes indeed i should die if i couldnt have itespecially here do you like it  i just adore it do you like candles  i regard them as an absolute necessity are you fond of them  her eyes fairly danced and she exclaimed  oh dont mention it candlesand soap  and fishinteriors  and trainoil  and slush  and whaleblubber  and carrion and sourkrout and beeswax and tar and turpentine and molasses and  dontoh donti shall expire with ecstasy  and then serve it all up in a slushbucket and invite the neighbours and sail in  but this vision of an ideal feast was too much for her and she swooned away poor thing i rubbed snow in her face and brought her to and after a while got her excitement cooled down byandby she drifted into her story again  so we began to live here in the fine house but i was not happy the reason was this i was born for love for me there could be no true happiness without it i wanted to be loved for myself alone i wanted an idol and i wanted to be my idols idol nothing less than mutual idolatry would satisfy my fervent nature i had suitors in plentyin overplenty indeedbut in each and every case they had a fatal defect sooner or later i discovered that defectnot one of them failed to betray itit was not me they wanted but my wealth  your wealth  yes for my father is much the richest man in this tribeor in any tribe in these regions  i wondered what her fathers wealth consisted of it couldnt be the houseanybody could build its mate it couldnt be the fursthey were not valued it couldnt be the sledge the dogs the harpoons the boat the bone fishhooks and needles and such thingsno these were not wealth then what could it be that made this man so rich and brought this swarm of sordid suitors to his house it seemed to me finally that the best way to find out would be to ask so i did it the girl was so manifestly gratified by the question that i saw she had been aching to have me ask it she was suffering fully as much to tell as i was to know she snuggled confidentially up to me and said  guess how much he is worthyou never can  i pretended to consider the matter deeply she watching my anxious and labouring countenance with a devouring and delighted interest and when at last i gave it up and begged her to appease my longing by telling me herself how much this polar vanderbilt was worth she put her mouth close to my ear and whispered impressively  twentytwo fishhooksnot bone but foreignmade out of real iron  then she sprang back dramatically to observe the effect i did my level best not to disappoint her i turned pale and murmured  great scott  its as true as you live mr twain  lasca you are deceiving meyou cannot mean it  she was frightened and troubled she exclaimed  mr twain every word of it is trueevery word you believe meyou do believe me now dont you say you believe medo say you believe me  iwell yes i doi am trying to but it was all so sudden so sudden and prostrating you shouldnt do such a thing in that sudden way it  oh im so sorry if i had only thought  well its all right and i dont blame you any more for you are young and thoughtless and of course you couldnt foresee what an effect  but oh dear i ought certainly to have known better why  you see lasca if you had said five or six hooks to start with and then gradually  oh i see i seethen gradually added one and then two and thenah why couldnt i have thought of that  never mind child its all righti am better nowi shall be over it in a little while butto spring the whole twentytwo on a person unprepared and not very strong anyway  oh it was a crime but you forgive mesay you forgive me do  after harvesting a good deal of very pleasant coaxing and petting and persuading i forgave her and she was happy again and byandby she got under way with her narrative once more i presently discovered that the family treasury contained still another featurea jewel of some sort apparentlyand that she was trying to get around speaking squarely about it lest i get paralysed again but i wanted to known about that thing too and urged her to tell me what it was she was afraid but i insisted and said i would brace myself this time and be prepared then the shock would not hurt me she was full of misgivings but the temptation to reveal that marvel to me and enjoy my astonishment and admiration was too strong for her and she confessed that she had it on her person and said that if i was sure i was preparedand so on and so onand with that she reached into her bosom and brought out a battered square of brass watching my eye anxiously the while i fell over against her in a quite wellacted faint which delighted her heart and nearly frightened it out of her too at the same time when i came to and got calm she was eager to know what i thought of her jewel  what do i think of it i think it is the most exquisite thing i ever saw  do you really how nice of you to say that but it is a love now isnt it  well i should say so id rather own it than the equator  i thought you would admire it she said i think it is so lovely and there isnt another one in all these latitudes people have come all the way from the open polar sea to look at it did you ever see one before  i said no this was the first one i had ever seen it cost me a pang to tell that generous lie for i had seen a million of them in my time this humble jewel of hers being nothing but a battered old new york central baggage check  land said i you dont go about with it on your person this way alone and with no protection not even a dog  ssh not so loud she said nobody knows i carry it with me they think it is in papas treasury that is where it generally is  where is the treasury  it was a blunt question and for a moment she looked startled and a little suspicious but i said  oh come dont you be afraid about me at home we have seventy millions of people and although i say it myself that shouldnt there is not one person among them all but would trust me with untold fishhooks  this reassured her and she told me where the hooks were hidden in the house then she wandered from her course to brag a little about the size of the sheets of transparent ice that formed the windows of the mansion and asked me if i had ever seen their like at home and i came right out frankly and confessed that i hadnt which pleased her more than she could find words to dress her gratification in it was so easy to please her and such a pleasure to do it that i went on and said  ah lasca you are a fortune girlthis beautiful house this dainty jewel that rich treasure all this elegant snow and sumptuous icebergs and limitless sterility and public bears and walruses and noble freedom and largeness and everybodys admiring eyes upon you and everybodys homage and respect at your command without the asking young rich beautiful sought courted envied not a requirement unsatisfied not a desire ungratified nothing to wish for that you cannot haveit is immeasurable goodfortune i have seen myriads of girls but none of whom these extraordinary things could be truthfully said but you alone and you are worthyworthy of it all lascai believe it in my heart  it made her infinitely proud and happy to hear me say this and she thanked me over and over again for that closing remark and her voice and eyes showed that she was touched presently she said  still it is not all sunshinethere is a cloudy side the burden of wealth is a heavy one to bear sometimes i have doubted if it were not better to be poorat least not inordinately rich it pains me to see neighbouring tribesmen stare as they pass by and overhear them say reverently one to another therethat is shethe millionaires daughter and sometimes they say sorrowfully she is rolling in fishhooks and ii have nothing it breaks my heart when i was a child and we were poor we slept with the door open if we chose but nownow we have to have a nightwatchman in those days my father was gentle and courteous to all but now he is austere and haughty and cannot abide familiarity once his family were his sole thought but now he goes about thinking of his fishhooks all the time and his wealth makes everybody cringing and obsequious to him formerly nobody laughed at his jokes they being always stale and farfetched and poor and destitute of the one element that can really justify a jokethe element of humour but now everybody laughs and cackles at these dismal things and if any fails to do it my father is deeply displeased and shows it formerly his opinion was not sought upon any matter and was not valuable when he volunteered it it has that infirmity yet but nevertheless it is sought by all and applauded by alland he helps do the applauding himself having no true delicacy and a plentiful want of tact he has lowered the tone of all our tribe once they were a frank and manly race now they are measly hypocrites and sodden with servility in my heart of hearts i hate all the ways of millionaires our tribe was once plain simple folk and content with the bone fishhooks of their fathers now they are eaten up with avarice and would sacrifice every sentiment of honour and honesty to possess themselves of the debasing iron fishhooks of the foreigner however i must not dwell on these sad things as i have said it was my dream to be loved for myself alone  at last this dream seemed about to be fulfilled a stranger came by one day who said his name was kalula i told him my name and he said he loved me my heart gave a great bound of gratitude and pleasure for i had loved him at sight and now i said so he took me to his breast and said he would not wish to be happier than he was now we went strolling together far over the icefloes telling all about each other and planning oh the loveliest future when we were tired at last we sat down and ate for he had soap and candles and i had brought along some blubber we were hungry and nothing was ever so good  he belonged to a tribe whose haunts were far to the north and i found that he had never heard of my father which rejoiced me exceedingly i mean he had heard of the millionaire but had never heard his nameso you see he could not know that i was the heiress you may be sure that i did not tell him i was loved for myself at last and was satisfied i was so happyoh happier than you can think  byandby it was towards supper time and i led him home as we approached our house he was amazed and cried out  how splendid is that your fathers  it gave me a pang to hear that tone and see that admiring light in his eye but the feeling quickly passed away for i loved him so and he looked so handsome and noble all my family of aunts and uncles and cousins were pleased with him and many guests were called in and the house was shut up tight and the rag lamps lighted and when everything was hot and comfortable and suffocating we began a joyous feast in celebration of my betrothal  when the feast was over my fathers vanity overcame him and he could not resist the temptation to show off his riches and let kalula see what grand goodfortune he had stumbled intoand mainly of course he wanted to enjoy the poor mans amazement i could have criedbut it would have done no good to try to dissuade my father so i said nothing but merely sat there and suffered  my father went straight to the hidingplace in full sight of everybody and got out the fishhooks and brought them and flung them scatteringly over my head so that they fell in glittering confusion on the platform at my lovers knee  of course the astounding spectacle took the poor lads breath away he could only stare in stupid astonishment and wonder how a single individual could possess such incredible riches then presently he glanced brilliantly up and exclaimed  ah it is you who are the renowned millionaire  my father and all the rest burst into shouts of happy laughter and when my father gathered the treasure carelessly up as if it might be mere rubbish and of no consequence and carried it back to its place poor kulalas surprise was a study he said  is it possible that you put such things away without counting them  my father delivered a vainglorious horselaugh and said  well truly a body may know you have never been rich since a mere matter of a fishhook or two is such a mighty matter in your eyes  kalula was confused and hung his head but said  ah indeed sir i was never worth the value of the barb of one of those precious things and i have never seen any man before who was so rich in them as to render the counting of his hoard worth while since the wealthiest man i have ever known till now was possessed of but three  my foolish father roared again with jejune delight and allowed the impression to remain that he was not accustomed to count his hooks and keep sharp watch over them he was showing off you see count them why he counted them every day  i had met and got acquainted with my darling just at dawn i had brought him home just at dark three hours afterwardsfor the days were shortening toward the sixmonths night at that time we kept up the festivities many hours then at last the guests departed and the rest of us distributed ourselves along the walls on sleepingbenches and soon all were steeped in dreams but me i was too happy too excited to sleep after i had lain quiet a long long time a dim form passed by me and was swallowed up in the gloom that pervaded the farther end of the house i could not make out who it was or whether it was man or woman presently that figure or another one passed me going the other way i wondered what it all meant but wondering did no good and while i was still wondering i fell asleep  i do not know how long i slept but at last i came suddenly broad awake and heard my father say in a terrible voice by the great snow god theres a fishhook gone something told me that that meant sorrow for me and the blood in my veins turned cold the presentiment was confirmed in the same instant my father shouted up everybody and seize the stranger then there was an outburst of cries and curses from all sides and a wild rush of dim forms through the obscurity i flew to my beloveds help but what could i do but wait and wring my handshe was already fenced away from me by a living wall he was being bound hand and foot not until he was secured would they let me get to him i flung myself upon his poor insulted form and cried my grief out upon his breast while my father and all my family scoffed at me and heaped threats and shameful epithets upon him he bore his ill usage with a tranquil dignity which endeared him to me more than ever and made me proud and happy to suffer with him and for him i heard my father order that the elders of the tribe be called together to try my kalula for his life  what i said before any search has been made for the lost hook  lost hook they all shouted in derision and my father added mockingly stand back everybody and be properly seriousshe is going to hunt up that lost hook oh without doubt she will find itwhereat they all laughed again  i was not disturbedi had no fears no doubts i said  it is for you to laugh now it is your turn but ours is coming wait and see  i got a rag lamp i thought i should find that miserable thing in one little moment and i set about that matter with such confidence that those people grew grace beginning to suspect that perhaps they had been too hasty but alas and alasoh the bitterness of that search there was deep silence while one might count his fingers ten or twelve times then my heart began to sink and around me the mockings began again and grew steadily louder and more assured until at last when i gave up they burst into volley after volley of cruel laughter  none will ever know what i suffered then but my love was my support and my strength and i took my rightful place at my kalulas side and put my arm about his neck and whispered in his ear saying  you are innocent my ownthat i know but say it to me yourself for my comfort then i can bear whatever is in store for us  he answered  as surely as i stand upon the brink of death at this moment i am innocent be comforted then o bruised heart be at peace o thou breath of my nostrils life of my life  now then let the elders comeand as i said the words there was a gathering sound of crunching snow outside and then a vision of stooping forms filing in at the doorthe elders  my father formally accused the prisoner and detailed the happenings of the night he said that the watchman was outside the door and that in the house were none but the family and the stranger would the family steal their own property he paused the elders sat silent many minutes at last one after another said to his neighbour this looks bad for the strangersorrowful words for me to hear then my father sat down o miserable miserable me at that very moment i could have proved my darling innocent but i did not know it  the chief of the court asked  is there any here to defend the prisoner  i rose and said  why should he steal that hook or any or all of them in another day he would have been heir to the whole  i stood waiting there was a long silence the steam from the many breaths rising about me like a fog at last one elder after another nodded his head slowly several times and muttered there is force in what the child has said oh the heartlift that was in those wordsso transient but oh so precious i sat down  if any would say further let him speak now or after hold his peace said the chief of the court  my father rose and said  in the night a form passed by me in the gloom going toward the treasury and presently returned i think now it was the stranger  oh i was like to swoon i had supposed that that was my secret not the grip of the great ice god himself could have dragged it out of my heart the chief of the court said sternly to my poor kalula  speak  kalula hesitated then answered  it was i i could not sleep for thinking of the beautiful hooks i went there and kissed them and fondled them to appease my spirit and drown it in a harmless joy then i put them back i may have dropped one but i stole none  oh a fatal admission to make in such a place there was an awful hush i knew he had pronounced his own doom and that all was over on every face you could see the words hieroglyphed it is a confessionand paltry lame and thin  i sat drawing in my breath in faint gaspsand waiting presently i heard the solemn words i knew were coming and each word as it came was a knife in my heart  it is the command of the court that the accused be subjected to the trial by water  oh curses be upon the head of him who brought trial by water to our land it came generations ago from some far country that lies none knows where before that our fathers used augury and other unsure methods of trial and doubtless some poor guilty creatures escaped with their lives sometimes but it is not so with trial by water which is an invention by wiser men than we poor ignorant savages are by it the innocent are proved innocent without doubt or question for they drown and the guilty are proven guilty with the same certainty for they do not drown my heart was breaking in my bosom for i said he is innocent and he will go down under the waves and i shall never see him more  i never left his side after that i mourned in his arms all the precious hours and he poured out the deep stream of his love upon me and oh i was so miserable and so happy at last they tore him from me and i followed sobbing after them and saw them fling him into the seathen i covered my face with my hands agony oh i know the deepest deeps of that word  the next moment the people burst into a shout of malicious joy and i took away my hands startled oh bitter sighthe was swimming my heart turned instantly to stone to ice i said he was guilty and he lied to me i turned my back in scorn and went my way homeward  they took him far out to sea and set him on an iceberg that was drifting southward in the great waters then my family came home and my father said to me  your thief sent his dying message to you saying tell her i am innocent and that all the days and all the hours and all the minutes while i starve and perish i shall love her and think of her and bless the day that gave me sight of her sweet face quite pretty even poetical  i said he is dirtlet me never hear mention of him again and oh to thinkhe was innocent all the time  nine monthsnine dull sad monthswent by and at last came the day of the great annual sacrifice when all the maidens of the tribe wash their faces and comb their hair with the first sweep of my comb out came the fatal fishhook from where it had been all those months nestling and i fell fainting into the arms of my remorseful father groaning he said we murdered him and i shall never smile again he has kept his word listen from that day to this not a month goes by that i do not comb my hair but oh where is the good of it all now  so ended the poor maids humble little talewhereby we learn that since a hundred million dollars in new york and twentytwo fishhooks on the border of the arctic circle represent the same financial supremacy a man in straitened circumstances is a fool to stay in new york when he can buy ten cents worth of fishhooks and emigrate       christian science and the book of mrs eddy       it is the first time since the dawndays of creation that a voice      has gone crashing through space with such placid and complacent      confidence and command  i  this last summer when i was on my way back to vienna from the appetitecure in the mountains i fell over a cliff in the twilight and broke some arms and legs and one thing or another and by good luck was found by some peasants who had lost an ass and they carried me to the nearest habitation which was one of those large low thatchroofed farmhouses with apartments in the garret for the family and a cunning little porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of brightcoloured flowers and cats on the ground floor a large and light sittingroom separated from the milchcattle apartment by a partition and in the front yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house the manurepile that sentence is germanic and shows that i am acquiring that sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables a man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars  there was a village a mile away and a horsedoctor lived there but there was no surgeon it seemed a bad outlook mine was distinctly a surgery case then it was remembered that a lady from boston was summering in that village and she was a christian science doctor and could cure anything so she was sent for it was night by this time and she could not conveniently come but sent word that it was no matter there was no hurry she would give me absent treatment now and come in the morning meantime she begged me to make myself tranquil and comfortable and remember that there was nothing the matter with me i thought there must be some mistake  did you tell her i walked off a cliff seventyfive feet high  yes  and struck a boulder at the bottom and bounced  yes  and struck another one and bounced again  yes  and struck another one and bounced yet again  yes  and broke the boulders  yes  that accounts for it she is thinking of the boulders why didnt you tell her i got hurt too  i did i told her what you told me to tell her that you were now but an incoherent series of compound fractures extending from your scalplock to your heels and that the comminuted projections caused you to look like a hatrack  and it was after this that she wished me to remember that there was nothing the matter with me  those were her words  i do not understand it i believe she has not diagnosed the case with sufficient care did she look like a person who was theorising or did she look like one who has fallen off precipices herself and brings to the aid of abstract science the confirmation of personal experience  bitte  it was too large a contract for the stubenmadchens vocabulary she couldnt call the hand i allowed the subject to rest there and asked for something to eat and smoke and something hot to drink and a basket to pile my legs in and another capable person to come and help me curse the time away but i could not have any of these things  why  she said you would need nothing at all  but i am hungry and thirsty and in desperate pain  she said you would have these delusions but must pay no attention to them she wants you to particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain  she does does she  it is what she said  does she seem o be in full and functional possession of her intellectual plant such as it is  bitte  do they let her run at large or do they tie her up  tie her up  there goodnight run along you are a good girl but your mental geschirr is not arranged for light and airy conversation leave me to my delusions   ii  it was a night of anguish of courseat least i supposed it was for it had all the symptoms of itbut it passed at last and the christian scientist came and i was glad she was middleaged and large and bony and erect and had an austere face and a resolute jaw and a roman beak and was a widow in the third degree and her name was fuller i was eager to get to business and find relief but she was distressingly deliberate she unpinned and unhooked and uncoupled her upholsteries one by one abolished the wrinkles with a flirt of her hand and hung the articles up peeled off her gloves and disposed of them got a book out of her handbag then drew a chair to the bedside descended into it without hurry and i hung out my tongue she said with pity but without passion  return it to its receptacle we deal with the mind only not with its dumb servants  i could not offer my pulse because the connection was broken but she detected the apology before i could word it and indicated by a negative tilt of her head that the pulse was another dumb servant that she had no use for then i thought i would tell her my symptoms and how i felt so that she would understand the case but that was another inconsequence she did not need to know those things moreover my remark about how i felt was an abuse of language a misapplication of terms  one does not feel she explained there is no such thing as feeling therefore to speak of a nonexistent thing as existent as a contradiction matter has no existence nothing exists but mind the mind cannot feel pain it can only imagine it  but if it hurts just the same  it doesnt a thing which is unreal cannot exercise the functions of reality pain is unreal hence pain cannot hurt  in making a sweeping gesture to indicate the act of shooing the illusion of pain out of the mind she raked her hand on a pin in her dress said ouch and went tranquilly on with her talk you should never allow yourself to speak of how you feel nor permit others to ask you how you are feeling you should never concede that you are ill nor permit others to talk about disease or pain or death or similar nonexistences in your preserve such talk only encourages the mind to continue its empty imaginings just at that point the stubenmadchen trod on the cats tail and the cat let fly a frenzy of catprofanity i asked with caution  is a cats opinion about pain valuable  a cat has no opinion opinions proceed from the mind only the lower animals being eternally perishable have not been granted mind without mind opinion is impossible  she merely imagined she felt a painthe cat  she cannot imagine a pain for imagination is an effect of mind without mind there is no imagination a cat has no imagination  then she had a real pain  i have already told you there is no such thing as real pain  it is strange and interesting i do wonder what was the matter with the cat because there being no such thing as real pain and she not being able to imagine an imaginary thing it would seem that god in his pity has compensated the cat with some kind of a mysterious emotion useable when her tail is trodden on which for the moment joins cat and christian in one common brotherhood of  she broke in with an irritated  peace the cat feels nothing the christian feels nothing your empty and foolish imaginings are profanation and blasphemy and can do you an injury it is wiser and better and holier to recognise and confess that there is no such thing as disease or pain or death  i am full of imaginary tortures i said but i do not think i could be any more uncomfortable if they were real ones what must i do to get rid of them  there is no occasion to get rid of them since they do not exist they are illusions propagated by matter and matter has no existence there is no such thing as matter  it sounds right and clear but yet it seems in a degree elusive it seems to slip through just when you think you are getting a grip on it  explain  well for instance if there is no such thing as matter how can matter propagate things  in her compassion she almost smiled she would have smiled if there were any such thing as a smile  it is quite simple she said the fundamental propositions of christian science explain it and they are summarised in the four following selfevident propositions 1 god is all in all 2 god is good good is mind 3 god spirit being all nothing is matter 4 life god omnipotent good deny death evil sin disease therenow you see  it seemed nebulous it did not seem to say anything about the difficulty in handhow nonexistent matter can propagate illusions i said with some hesitancy  doesdoes it explain  doesnt it even if read backward it will do it  with a budding hope i asked her to do it backward  very well disease sin evil death deny good omnipotent god life matter is nothing all being spirit god mind is good good is god all in all is god theredo you understand now  ititwell it is plainer than it was before still  well  could you try it some more ways  as many as you like it always means the same interchanged in any way you please it cannot be made to mean anything different from what it means when put in any other way because it is perfect you can jumble it all up and it makes no difference it always comes out the way it was before it was a marvellous mind that produced it as a mental tour de force it is without a mate it defies alike the simple the concrete and the occult  it seems to be a corker  i blushed for the word but it was out before i could stop it  a what  awonderful structurecombination so to speak or profound thoughtsunthinkable onesun  it is true read backwards or forwards or perpendicularly or at any given angle these four propositions will always be found to agree in statement and proof  ahproof now we are coming at it the statements agree they agree withwithanyway they agree i noticed that but what is it they provei mean in particular  why nothing could be clearer they prove 1 godprinciple life truth love soul spirit mind do you get that  iwell i seem to go on please  2 mangods universal idea individual perfect eternal is it clear  iti think so continue  3 ideaan image in mind the immediate object of understanding there it isthe whole sublime arcana of christian science in a nutshell do you find a weak place in it anywhere  wellno it seems strong  very well there is more those three constitute the scientific definition of immortal mind next we have the scientific definition of mortal mind thus first degree depravity 1 physicalpassions and appetites fear depraved will pride envy deceit hatred revenge sin disease death  phantasms madamunrealities as i understand it  every one second degree evil disappearing 1 moralhonesty affection compassion hope faith meekness temperance is it clear  crystal  third degree spiritual salvation 1 spiritualfaith wisdom power purity understanding health love you see how searchingly and coordinately interdependent and anthropomorphous it all is in this third degree as we know by the revelations of christian science mortal mind disappears  not earlier  no not until the teaching and preparation for the third degree are completed  it is not until then that one is enabled to take hold of christian science effectively and with the right sense of sympathy and kinship as i understand you that is to say it could not succeed during the process of the second degree because there would still be remains of mind left and thereforebut i interrupted you you were about to further explain the good results proceeding from the erosions and disintegrations effected by the third degree it is very interesting go on please  yes as i was saying in this third degree mortal mind disappears science so reverses the evidence before the corporeal human senses as to make this scriptural testimony true in our hearts the last shall be first and the first shall be last that god and his idea may be to uswhat divinity really is and must of necessity beallinclusive  it is beautiful and with that exhaustive exactness your choice and arrangement of words confirms and establishes what you have claimed for the powers and functions of the third degree the second could probably produce only temporary absence of mind it is reserved to the third to make it permanent a sentence framed under the auspices of the second could have a kind of meaninga sort of deceptive semblance of itwhereas it is only under the magic of the third that that defect would disappear also without doubt it is the third degree that contributes another remarkable specialty to christian science viz ease and flow and lavishness of words and rhythm and swing and smoothness there must be a special reason for this  yesgodall allgod good good nonmatter matteration spirit bones truth  that explains it  there is nothing in christian science that is not explicable for god is one time is one individuality is one and may be one of a series one of many as an individual man individual horse whereas god is one not one of a series but one alone and without an equal  these are noble thoughts they make one burn to know more how does christian science explain the spiritual relation of systematic duality to incidental reflection  christian science reverses the seeming relation of soul and bodyas astronomy reverses the human perception of the movement of the solar systemand makes body tributary to mind as it is the earth which is in motion while the sun is at rest though in viewing the sun rise one finds it impossible to believe the sun not to be really rising so the body is but the humble servant of the restful mind though it seems otherwise to finite sense but we shall never understand this while we admit that soul is in body or mind in matter and that man is included in nonintelligence soul is god unchangeable and eternal and man coexists with and reflects soul for the allinall is the altogether and the altogether embraces the allone soulmind mindsoul love spirit bones liver one of a series alone and without an equal  it is very curious the effect which christian science has upon the verbal bowels particularly the third degree it makes one think of a dictionary with the cholera but i only thought this i did not say it  what is the origin of christian science is it a gift of god or did it just happen  in a sense it is a gift of god that is to say its powers are from him but the credit of the discovery of the powers and what they are for is due to an american lady  indeed when did this occur  in 1866 that is the immortal date when pain and disease and death disappeared from the earth to return no more for ever that is the fancies for which those terms stand disappeared the things themselves had never existed therefore as soon as it was perceived that there were no such things they were easily banished the history and nature of the great discovery are set down in the book here and  did the lady write the book  yes she wrote it all herself the title is science and health with key to the scripturesfor she explains the scriptures they were not understood before not even by the twelve disciples she begins thusi will read it to you  but she had forgotten to bring her glasses  well it is no matter she said i remember the wordsindeed all christian scientists know the book by heart it is necessary in our practice we should otherwise make mistakes and do harm she begins thus in the year 1866 i discovered the science of metaphysical healing and named it christian science and she saysquite beautifully i thinkthrough christian science religion and medicine are inspired with a diviner nature and essence fresh pinions are given to faith and understanding and thoughts acquaint themselves intelligently with god her very words  it is elegant and it is a fine thought toomarrying religion to medicine instead of medicine to the undertaker in the old way for religion and medicine properly belong together they being the basis of all spiritual and physical health what kind of medicine do you give for the ordinary diseases such as  we never give medicine in any circumstances whatever we  but madam it says  i dont care what it says and i dont wish to talk about it  i am sorry if i have offended but you see the mention seemed in some way inconsistent and  there are no inconsistencies in christian science the thing is impossible for the science is absolute it cannot be otherwise since it proceeds directly from the allinall and the everythinginwhich also soul bones truth one of a series alone and without equal it is mathematics purified from material dross and made spiritual  i can see that but  it rests upon the immovable basis of an apodictical principle  the word flattened itself against my mind trying to get in and disordered me a little and before i could inquire into its pertinency she was already throwing the needed light  this apodictical principle is the absolute principle of scientific mindhealing the sovereign omnipotence which delivers the children of men from pain disease decay and every ill that flesh is heir to  surely not every ill every decay  every one there are no exceptions there is no such thing as decayit is an unreality it has no existence  but without your glasses your failing eyesight does not permit you to  my eyesight cannot fail nothing can fail the mind is master and the mind permits no retrogression  she was under the inspiration of the third degree therefore there could be no profit in continuing this part of the subject i shifted to other ground and inquired further concerning the discoverer of the science  did the discovery come suddenly like klondike or after long study and calculation like america  the comparisons are not respectful since they refer to trivialitiesbut let it pass i will answer in the discoverers own words god had been graciously fitting me during many years for the reception of a final revelation of the absolute principle of scientific mindhealing  many years how many  eighteen centuries  all god godgood goodgod truth bones liver one of a series alone and without equalit is amazing  you may well say it sir yet it is but the truth this american lady our revered and sacred founder is distinctly referred to and her coming prophesied in the twelfth chapter of the apocalypse she could not have been more plainly indicated by st john without actually mentioning her name  how strange how wonderful  i will quote her own words for her key to the scriptures the twelfth chapter of the apocalypse has a special suggestiveness in connection with this nineteenth century theredo you note that thinknote it well  butwhat does it mean  listen and you will know i quote her inspired words again in the opening of the sixth seal typical of six thousand years since adam there is one distinctive feature which has special reference to the present age thus  revelation xii 1 and there appeared a great wonder in heavena woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars  that is our head our chief our discoverer of christian sciencenothing can be plainer nothing surer and note this  revelation xii 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of god  that is boston  i recognise it madam these are sublime things and impressive i never understood these passages before please go on with thewith theproofs  very well listen  and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book  a little book merely a little bookcould words be modester yet how stupendous its importance do you know what book that was  was it  i hold it in my handchristian science  love livers lights bones truth kidneys one of a series alone and without equalit is beyond imagination and wonder  hear our founders eloquent words then will a voice from harmony cry go and take the little book take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey mortal obey the heavenly evangel take up divine science read it from beginning to end study it ponder it it will be indeed sweet at its first taste when it heals you but murmur not over truth if you find its digestion bitter you now know the history of our dear and holy science sir and that its origin is not of this earth but only its discovery i will leave the book with you and will go now but give yourself no uneasinessi will give you absent treatment from now till i go to bed   iii  under the powerful influence of the near treatment and the absent treatment together my bones were gradually retreating inward and disappearing from view the good word took a brisk start now and went on quite swiftly my body was diligently straining and stretching this way and that to accommodate the processes of restoration and every minute or two i heard a dull click inside and knew that the two ends of a fracture had been successfully joined this muffled clicking and gritting and grinding and rasping continued during the next three hours and then stoppedthe connections had all been made all except dislocations there were only seven of these hips shoulders knees neck so that was soon over one after another they slipped into their sockets with a sound like pulling a distant cork and i jumped up as good as new as to framework and sent for the horsedoctor  i was obliged to do this because i had a stomachache and a cold in the head and i was not willing to trust these things any longer in the hands of a woman whom i did not know and in whose ability to successfully treat mere disease i had lost all confidence my position was justified by the fact that the cold and the ache had been in her charge from the first along with the fractures but had experienced not a shade of relief and indeed the ache was even growing worse and worse and more and more bitter now probably on account of the protracted abstention from food and drink  the horsedoctor came a pleasant man and full of hope and professional interest in the case in the matter of smell he was pretty aromatic in fact quite horsey and i tried to arrange with him for absent treatment but it was not in his line so out of delicacy i did not press it he looked at my teeth and examined my hock and said my age and general condition were favourable to energetic measures therefore he would give me something to turn the stomachache into the botts and the cold in the head into the blind staggers then he should be on his own beat and would know what to do he made up a bucket of branmash and said a dipperful of it every two hours alternated with a drench with turpentine and axlegrease in it would either knock my ailments out of me in twentyfour hours or so interest me in other ways as to make me forget they were on the premises he administered my first dose himself then took his leave saying i was free to eat and drink anything i pleased and in any quantity i liked but i was not hungry any more and did not care for food  i took up the christian scientist book and read half of it then took a dipperful of drench and read the other half the resulting experiences were full of interest and adventure all through the rumblings and grindings and quakings and effervescings accompanying the evolution of the ache into the botts and the cold into the blind staggers i could note the generous struggle for mastery going on between the mash and the drench and the literature and often i could tell which was ahead and could easily distinguish the literature from the others when the others were separate though not when they were mixed for when a branmash and an eclectic drench are mixed together they look just like the apodictical principle out on a lark and no one can tell it from that the finish was reached at last the evolutions were complete and a fine success but i think that this result could have been achieved with fewer materials i believe the mash was necessary to the conversion of the stomachache into the boots but i think one could develop the blind staggers out of the literature by itself also that blind staggers produced in this way would be of a better quality and more lasting than any produced by the artificial processes of a horsedoctor  for of all the strange and frantic and incomprehensible and uninterpretable books which the imagination of man has created surely this one is the prize sample it is written with a limitless confidence and complacency and with a dash and stir and earnestness which often compel the effects of eloquence even when the words do not seem to have any traceable meaning there are plenty of people who imagine they understand the book i know this for i have talked with them but in all cases they were people who also imagined that there were no such things as pain sickness and death and no realities in the world nothing actually existent but mind it seems to me to modify the value of their testimony when these people talk about christian science they do as mrs fuller did they do not use their own language but the books they pour out the books showy incoherences and leave you to find out later that they were not originating but merely quoting they seem to know the volume by heart and to revere it as they would a bibleanother bible perhaps i ought to say plainly the book was written under the mental desolations of the third degree and i feel sure that none but the membership of that degree can discover meanings in it when you read it you seem to be listening to a lively and aggressive and oracular speech delivered in an unknown tongue a speech whose spirit you get but not the particulars or to change the figure you seem to be listening to a vigorous instrument which is making a noise it thinks is a tune but which to persons not members of the band is only the martial tooting of a trombone and merely stirs the soul through the noise but does not convey a meaning  the books serenities of selfsatisfaction do almost seem to smack of a heavenly originthey have no bloodkin in the earth it is more than human to be so placidly certain about things and so finely superior and so airily content with ones performance without ever presenting anything which may rightfully be called by the strong name of evidence and sometimes without even mentioning a reason for a deduction at all it thunders out the startling words i have proved so and so it takes the pope and all the great guns of his church in battery assembled to authoritatively settle and establish the meaning of a sole and single unclarified passage of scripture and this at vast cost of time and study and reflection but the author of this work is superior to all that she finds the whole bible in an unclarified condition and at small expense of time and no expense of mental effort she clarifies it from lid to lid reorganises and improves the meanings then authoritatively settles and establishes them with formulae which you cannot tell from let there be light and here you have it it is the first time since the dawndays of creation that a voice has gone crashing through space with such placid and complacent confidence and command   iv  a word upon a question of authorship not that quite but rather a question of emendation and revision we know that the bibleannex was not written by mrs eddy but was handed down to her eighteen hundred years ago by the angel of the apocalypse but did she translate it alone or did she have help there seems to be evidence that she had help for there are four several copyrights on it1875 1885 1890 1894 it did not come down in english for in that language it could not have acquired copyrightthere were no copyright laws eighteen centuries ago and in my opinion no english languageat least up there this makes it substantially certain that the annex is a translation then was not the first translation complete if it was on what grounds were the later copyrights granted  i surmise that the first translation was poor and that a friend or friends of mrs eddy mended its english three times and finally got it into its present shape where the grammar is plenty good enough and the sentences are smooth and plausible though they do not mean anything i think i am right in this surmise for mrs eddy cannot write english today and this is argument that she never could i am not able to guess who did the mending but i think it was not done by any member of the eddy trust nor by the editors of the christian science journal for their english is not much better than mrs eddys  however as to the main point it is certain that mrs eddy did not doctor the annexs english herself her original spontaneous undoctored english furnishes ample proof of this here are samples from recent articles from her unappeasable pen double columned with them are a couple of passages from the annex it will be seen that they throw light the italics are mine     1 what plague spot          therefore the efficient    or bacilli were sic gnawing

annex and the lumbering ragged ignorant output of the translators natural spontaneous and unmedicated penwork the english of the annex has been slicked up by a very industrious and painstaking handbut it was not mrs eddys  if mrs eddy really wrote or translated the annex her original draft was exactly in harmony with the english of her plaguespot or bacilli which were gnawing at the insides of the metropolis and bringing its heart on bended knee thus exposing to the eye the rest of the skeleton breathing slowly through a barren breast and it bore little or no resemblance to the book as we have it nownow that the salaried polisher has holystoned all of the genuine eddyties out of it  will the plaguespot article go into a volume just as it stands i think not i think the polisher will take off his coat and vest and cravat and demonstrate over it a couple of weeks and sweat it into a shape something like the followingand then mrs eddy will publish it and leave people to believe that she did the polishing herself  1 what injurious influence was it that was affecting the citys morals it was a social club which propagated an interest in idle amusements disseminated a knowledge of games et

sidewalk the macadamised road the primitive corduroy et cetera  3 its pleasant suburbs gone there was little left to admire save the wrecked graveyard with its uncanny exposures  the annex contains one sole and solitary humorous remark there is a most elaborate and voluminous index and it is preceded by this note  this index will enable the student to find any thought or idea contained in the book   v  no one doubtscertainly not ithat the mind exercises a powerful influence over the body from the beginning of time the sorcerer the interpreter of dreams the fortuneteller the charlatan the quack the wild medicineman the educated physician the mesmerist and the hypnotist have made use of the clients imagination to help them in their work they have all recognised the potency and availability of that force physicians cure many patients with a bread pill they know that where the disease is only a fancy the patients confidence in the doctor will make the bread pill effective  faith in the doctor perhaps that is the entire thing it seems to look like it in old times the king cured the kings evil by the touch of the royal hand he frequently made extraordinary cures could his footman have done it nonot in his own clothes disguised as the king could he have done it i think we may not doubt it i think we may feel sure that it was not the kings touch that made the cure in any instance but the patients faith in the efficacy of a kings touch genuine and remarkable cures have been achieved through contact with the relics of a saint is it not likely that any other bones would have done as well if the substitution had been concealed from the patient when i was a boy a farmers wife who lived five miles from our village had great fame as a faithdoctorthat was what she called herself sufferers came to her from all around and she laid her hand upon them and said have faithit is all that is necessary and they went away well of their ailments she was not a religious woman and pretended to no occult powers she said that the patients faith in her did the work several times i saw her make immediate cures of severe toothaches my mother was the patient in austria there is a peasant who drives a great trade in this sort of industry and has both the high and the low for patients he gets into prison every now and then for practising without a diploma but his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out for his work is unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high in bavaria there is a man who performed so many great cures that he had to retire from his profession of stagecarpentering in order to meet the demand of his constantly increasing body of customers he goes on from year to year doing his miracles and has become very rich he pretends to no religious helps no supernatural aids but thinks there is something in his makeup which inspires the confidence of his patients and that it is this confidence which does the work and not some mysterious power issuing from himself  within the last quarter of a century in america several sects of curers have appeared under various names and have done notable things in the way of healing ailments without the use of medicines there are the mind cure the faith cure the prayer cure the mentalscience cure and the christianscience cure and apparently they all do their miracles with the same old powerful instrumentthe patients imagination differing names but no difference in the process but they do not give that instrument the credit each sect claims that its way differs from the ways of the others  they all achieve some cures there is no question about it and the faith cure and the prayer cure probably do no harm when they do no good since they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines if he wants to but the others bar medicines and claim ability to cure every conceivable human ailment through the application of their mental forces alone they claim ability to cure malignant cancer and other affections which have never been cured in the history of the race there would seem to be an element of danger here it has the look of claiming too much i think public confidence would probably be increased if less were claimed  i believe it might be shown that all the mind sects except christian science have lucid intervals intervals in which they betray some diffidence and in effect confess that they are not the equals of the deity but if the christian scientist even stops with being merely the equal of the deity it is not clearly provable by his christianscience amended bible in the usual bible the deity recognises pain disease and death as facts but the christian scientist knows better knows better and is not diffident about saying so  the christian scientist was not able to cure my stomachache and my cold but the horsedoctor did it this convinces me that christian science claims too much in my opinion it ought to let diseases alone and confine itself to surgery there it would have everything its own way  the horsedoctor charged me thirty kreutzers and i paid him in fact i doubled it and gave him a shilling mrs fuller brought in an itemised bill for a crate of broken bones mended in two hundred and thirtyfour placesone dollar per fracture  nothing exists but mind  nothing she answered all else is substanceless all else is imaginary  i gave her an imaginary cheque and now she is suing me for substantial dollars it looks inconsistent   vi  let us consider that we are all partially insane it will explain us to each other it will unriddle many riddles it will make clear and simple many things which are involved in haunting and harassing difficulties and obscurities now  those of us who are not in the asylum and not demonstrably due there are nevertheless no doubt insane in one or two particularsi think we must admit this but i think that we are otherwise healthyminded i think that when we all see one thing alike it is evidence that as regards that one thing our minds are perfectly sound now there are really several things which we do all see alike things which we all accept and about which we do not dispute for instance we who are outside of the asylum all agree that water seeks its level that the sun gives light and heat that fire consumes that fog is damp that 6 times 6 are thirtysix that 2 from 10 leave eight that 8 and 7 are fifteen these are perhaps the only things we are agreed about but although they are so few they are of inestimable value because they make an infallible standard of sanity whosoever accepts them we know to be substantially sane sufficiently sane in the working essentials sane whoever disputes a single one of them we know to be wholly insane and qualified for the asylum  very well the man who disputes none of them we concede to be entitled to go at largebut that is concession enough we cannot go any further than that for we know that in all matters of mere opinion that same man is insanejust as insane as we are just as insane as shakespeare was just as insane as the pope is we know exactly where to put our finger upon his insanity it is where his opinion differs from ours  that is a simple rule and easy to remember when i a thoughtful and unbiased presbyterian examine the koran i know that beyond any question every mohammedan is insane not in all things but in religious matters when a thoughtful and unbiased mohammedan examines the westminster catechism he knows that beyond any question i am spiritually insane i cannot prove to him that he is insane because you never can prove anything to a lunaticfor that is a part of his insanity and the evidence of it he cannot prove to me that i am insane for my mind has the same defect that afflicts his all democrats are insane but not one of them knows it none but the republicans and mugwumps know it all the republicans are insane but only the democrats and mugwumps can perceive it the rule is perfect in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane when i look around me i am often troubled to see how many people are mad to mention only a few      the atheist                      the shakers     the infidel                      the millerites     the agnostic                     the mormons     the baptist                      the laurence oliphant     the methodist                      harrisites     the catholic and the other       the grand lamas people       115 christian sects the        the monarchists       presbyterian excepted          the imperialists     the 72 mohammedan sects          the democrats     the buddhist                     the republicans but not     the blavatskybuddhist             the mugwumps     the nationalist                  the mindcurists     the confucian                    the faithcurists     the spiritualist                 the mental scientists     the 2000 east indian             the allopaths       sects                          the homeopaths     the peculiar people              the electropaths     the swedenborgians   thebut theres no end to the list there are millions of them and all insane each in his own way insane as to his pet fad or opinion but otherwise sane and rational  this should move us to be charitable toward one anothers lunacies i recognise that in his special belief the christian scientist is insane because he does not believe as i do but i hail him as my mate and fellow because i am as insane as heinsane from his point of view and his point of view is as authoritative as mine and worth as much that is to say worth a brass farthing upon a great religious or political question the opinion of the dullest head in the world is worth the same as the opinion of the brightest head in the worlda brass farthing how do we arrive at this it is simple the affirmative opinion of a stupid man is neutralised by the negative opinion of his stupid neighbourno decision is reached the affirmative opinion of the intellectual giant gladstone is neutralised by the negative opinion of the intellectual giant cardinal newmanno decision is reached opinions that prove nothing are of course without valueany but a dead person knows that much this obliges us to admit the truth of the unpalatable proposition just mentioned abovethat in disputed matters political and religious one mans opinion is worth no more than his peers and hence it follows that no mans opinion possesses any real value it is a humbling thought but there is no way to get around it all opinions upon these great subjects are brassfarthing opinions  it is a mere plain simple factas clear and as certain as that 8 and 7 make fifteen and by it we recognise that we are all insane as concerns those matters if we were sane we should all see a political or religious doctrine alike there would be no dispute it would be a case of 8 and 7just as it is in heaven where all are sane and none insane there there is but one religion one belief the harmony is perfect there is never a discordant note  under protection of these preliminaries i suppose i may now repeat without offence that the christian scientist is insane i mean him no discourtesy and i am not chargingnor even imaginingthat he is insaner than the rest of the human race i think he is more picturesquely insane that some of us at the same time i am quite sure that in one important and splendid particular he is saner than is the vast bulk of the race  why is he insane i told you before it is because his opinions are not ours i know of no other reason and i do not need any other it is the only way we have of discovering insanity when it is not violent it is merely the picturesqueness of his insanity that makes it more interesting than my kind or yours for instance consider his little bookthe one described in the previous article the little book exposed in the sky eighteen centuries ago by the flaming angel of the apocalypse and handed down in our day to mrs mary baker g eddy of new hampshire and translated by her word for word into english with help of a polisher and now published and distributed in hundreds of editions by her at a clear profit per volume above cost of 700 per centa profit which distinctly belongs to the angel of the apocalypse and let him collect it if he can a little book which the cs very frequently calls by just that name and always inclosed in quotationmarks to keep its high origin exultantly in mind a little book which explains and reconstructs and newpaints and decorates the bible and puts a mansard roof on it and a lightningrod and all the other modern improvements a little book which for the present affects to travel in yoke with the bible and be friendly to it and within half a century will hitch it in the rear and thenceforth travel tandem itself in the lead in the coming great march of christian scientism through the protestant dominions of the planet  perhaps i am putting the tandem arrangement too far away perhaps five years might be nearer the mark than fifty for a viennese lady told me last night that in the christian science mosque in boston she noticed some things which seem to me to promise a shortening of the interval on one side there was a display of texts from the new testament signed with the saviours initials jc and on the opposite side a display of texts from the little book signedwith the authors mere initials nosigned with mrs mary baker g eddys name in full perhaps the angel of the apocalypse likes this kind of piracy i made this remark lightly to a christian scientist this morning but he did not receive it lightly but said it was jesting upon holy things he said there was no piracy for the angel did not compose the book he only brought itgod composed it i could have retorted that it was a case of piracy just the same that the displayed texts should be signed with the authors initials and that to sign them with the translators train of names was another case of jesting upon holy things however i did not say these things for this scientist was a large person and although by his own doctrine we have no substance but are fictions and unrealities i knew he could hit me an imaginary blow which would furnish me an imaginary pain which could last me a week the lady said that in that mosque there were two pulpits in one of them was a man with the former bible in the other a woman with mrs eddys apocalyptic annex and from these books the man and the woman were reading verse and verse about       hungry ones throng to hear the bible read in connection with the      textbook of christian science science and health with key to the      scriptures by mary baker g  eddy  these are our only preachers      they are the word of godchristian science journal october      1898  are these things picturesque the viennese lady told me that in a chapel of the mosque there was a picture or image of mrs eddy and that before it burns a neverextinguished light is that picturesque how long do you think it will be before the christian scientist will be worshipping that image and praying to it how long do you think it will be before it is claimed that mrs eddy is a redeemer a christ or christs equal already her army of disciples speak of her reverently as our mother how long will it be before they place her on the steps of the throne beside the virginand later a step higher first mary the virgin and mary the matron later with a change of precedence mary the matron and mary the virgin let the artist get ready with his canvas and his brushes the new renaissance is on its way and there will be money in altarcanvasesa thousand times as much as the popes and their church ever spent on the old masters for their riches were as poverty as compared with what is going to pour into the treasurechest of the christianscientist papacy byandby let us not doubt it we will examine the financial outlook presently and see what it promises a favourite subject of the new old master will be the first verse of the twelfth chapter of revelationa verse which mrs eddy says in her annex to the scriptures has one distinctive feature which has special reference to the present ageand to her as is rather pointedly indicated       and there appeared a great wonder in heavena woman clothed with      the sun and the moon under her feet etc  the woman clothed with the sun will be a portrait of mrs eddy  is it insanity to believe that christian scientism is destined to make the most formidable show that any new religion has made in the world since the birth and spread of mohammedanism and that within a century from now it may stand second to rome only in numbers and power in christendom  if this is a wild dream it will not be easy to prove it is so just yet i think there seems argument that it may come true the christianscience boom is not yet five years old yet already it has 500 churches and 1000000 members in america  it has its start you see and it is a phenomenally good one moreover it is latterly spreading with a constantly accelerating swiftness it has a better chance to grow and prosper and achieve permanency than any other existing ism for it has more to offer than any other the past teaches us that in order to succeed a movement like this must not be a mere philosophy it must be a religion also that it must not claim entire originality but content itself with passing for an improvement on an existing religion and show its hand later when strong and prosperouslike mohammedanism  next there must be moneyand plenty of it  next the power and authority and capital must be concentrated in the grip of a small and irresponsible clique with nobody outside privileged to ask questions or find fault  next as before remarked it must bait its hook with some new and attractive advantages over the baits offered by the other religions  a new movement equipped with some of these endowmentslike spiritualism for instancemay count upon a considerable success a new movement equipped with the bulk of themlike mohammedanism for instancemay count upon a widely extended conquest mormonism had all the requisites but oneit had nothing new and nothing valuable to bait with and besides it appealed to the stupid and the ignorant only spiritualism lacked the important detail of concentration of money and authority in the hands of an irresponsible clique  the above equipment is excellent admirable powerful but not perfect there is yet another detail which is worth the whole of it put togetherand more a detail which has never been joined in the beginning of a religious movement to a supremely good working equipment since the world began until now a new personage to worship christianity had the saviour but at first and for generations it lacked money and concentrated power in mrs eddy christian science possesses the new personage for worship and in additionhere in the very beginninga working equipment that has not a flaw in it in the beginning mohammedanism had no money and it has never had anything to offer its client but heavennothing here below that was valuable in addition to heaven hereafter christian science has present health and a cheerful spirit to offerfor cashand in comparison with this bribe all other thisworld bribes are poor and cheap you recognise that this estimate is admissible do you not  to whom does bellamys nationalism appeal necessarily to the few people who read and dream and are compassionate and troubled for the poor and the harddriven to whom does spiritualism appeal necessarily to the few its boom has lasted for half a century and i believe it claims short of four millions of adherents in america who are attracted by swedenborgianism and some of the other fine and delicate isms the few again educated people sensitively organised with superior mental endowments who seek lofty planes of thought and find their contentment there and who are attracted by christian science there is no limit its field is horizonless its appeal is as universal as is the appeal of christianity itself it appeals to the rich the poor the high the low the cultured the ignorant the gifted the stupid the modest the vain the wise the silly the soldier the civilian the hero the coward the idler the worker the godly the godless the freeman the slave the adult the child they who are ailing they who have friends that are ailing to mass it in a phrase its clientele is the human race will it march i think so   vii  remember its principal great offer to rid the race of pain and disease can it do it in large measure yes how much of the pain and disease in the world is created by the imaginations of the sufferers and then kept alive by those same imaginations fourfifths not anything short of that i should think can christian science banish that fourfifths i think so can any other organised force do it none that i know of would this be a new world when that was accomplished and a pleasanter onefor us well people as well as for those fussy and fretting sick ones would it seem as if there was not as much gloomy weather as there used to be i think so  in the meantime would the scientist kill off a good many patients i think so more than get killed off now by the legalised methods i will take up that question presently  at present i wish to ask you to examine some of the scientists performances as registered in his magazine the christian science journaloctober number 1898 first a baptist clergyman gives us this true picture of the average orthodox christianand he could have added that it is a true picture of the average civilised human being  he is a worried and fretted and fearful man afraid of himself and his propensities afraid of colds and fevers afraid of treading on serpents or drinking deadly things  then he gives us this contrast  the average christian scientist has put all anxiety and fretting under his feet he does have a victory over fear and care that is not achieved by the average orthodox christian  he has put all anxiety and fretting under his feet what proportion of your earnings or income would you be willing to pay for that frame of mind year in year out it really outvalues any price that can be put upon it where can you purchase it at any outlay of any sort in any church or out of it except the scientists  well it is the anxiety and fretting about colds and fevers and draughts and getting our feet wet and about forbidden food eaten in terror of indigestion that brings on the cold and the fever and the indigestion and the most of our other ailments and so if the science can banish that anxiety from the world i think it can reduce the worlds disease and pain about fourfifths  in this october number many of the redeemed testify and give thanks and not coldly but with passionate gratitude as a rule they seem drunk with health and with the surprise of it the wonder of it the unspeakable glory and splendour of it after a long sober spell spent in inventing imaginary diseases and concreting them with doctorstuff the first witness testifies that when this most beautiful truth first dawned on him he had nearly all the ills that flesh is heir to that those he did not have he thought he hadand thus made the tale about complete what was the natural result why he was a dumppit for all the doctors druggists and patent medicines of the country christian science came to his help and the old sick conditions passed away and along with them the dismal forebodings which he had been accustomed to employ in conjuring up ailments and so he was a healthy and cheerful man now and astonished  but i am not astonished for from other sources i know what must have been his method of applying christian science if i am in the right he watchfully and diligently diverted his mind from unhealthy channels and compelled it to travel in healthy ones nothing contrivable by human invention could be more formidably effective than that in banishing imaginary ailments and in closing the entrances against subsequent applicants of their breed i think his method was to keep saying i am well i am soundsound and well well and sound perfectly sound perfectly well i have no pain theres no such thing as pain i have no disease theres no such thing as disease nothing is real but mind all is mind allgood goodgood life soul liver bones one of a series ante and pass the buck  i do not mean that that was exactly the formula used but that it doubtless contains the spirit of it the scientist would attach value to the exact formula no doubt and to the religious spirit in which it was used i should think that any formula that would divert the mind from unwholesome channels and force it into healthy ones would answer every purpose with some people though not with all i think it most likely that a very religious man would find the addition of the religious spirit a powerful reinforcement in his case  the second witness testifies that the science banished an old organic trouble which the doctor and the surgeon had been nursing with drugs and the knife for seven years  he calls it his claim a surfaceminer would think it was not his claim at all but the property of the doctor and his pal the surgeonfor he would be misled by that word which is christianscience slang for ailment the christian scientist has no ailment to him there is no such thing and he will not use the lying word all that happens to him is that upon his attention an imaginary disturbance sometimes obtrudes itself which claims to be an ailment but isnt  this witness offers testimony for a clergyman seventy years old who had preached forty years in a christian church and has not gone over to the new sect he was almost blind and deaf he was treated by the cs method and when he heard the voice of truth he saw spiritually saw spiritually it is a little indefinite they had better treat him again indefinite testimonies might properly be wastebasketed since there is evidently no lack of definite ones procurable but this cs magazine is poorly edited and so mistakes of this kind must be expected  the next witness is a soldier of the civil war when christian science found him he had in stock the following claims       indigestion      rheumatism      catarrh      chalky deposits in        shoulder joints        arm joints        hand joints      atrophy of the muscles of        arms        shoulders      stiffness of all those joints      insomnia      excruciating pains most of the time   these claims have a very substantial sound they came of exposure in the campaigns the doctors did all they could but it was little prayers were tried but i never realised any physical relief from that source after thirty years of torture he went to a christian scientist and took an hours treatment and went home painless two days later he began to eat like a well man then the claims vanishedsome at once others more gradually finally they have almost entirely disappeared anda thing which is of still greater valuehe is now contented and happy that is a detail which as earlier remarked is a scientistchurch specialty with thirtyone years effort the methodist church had not succeeded in furnishing it to this harassed soldier  and so the tale goes on witness after witness bulletins his claims declares their prompt abolishment and gives mrs eddys discovery the praise milkleg is cured nervous prostration is cured consumption is cured and st vituss dance made a pastime and now and then an interesting new addition to the science slang appears on the page we have demonstrations over chilblains and such things it seems to be a curtailed way of saying demonstrations of the power of christianscience truth over the fiction which masquerades under the name of chilblains the children as well as the adults share in the blessings of the science through the study of the little book they are learning how to be healthful peaceful and wise sometimes they are cured of their little claims by the professional healer and sometimes more advanced children say over the formula and cure themselves  a little farwestern girl of nine equipped with an adult vocabulary states her age and says i thought i would write a demonstration to you she had a claim derived from getting flung over a ponys head and landed on a rockpile she saved herself from disaster by remember to say god is all while she was in the air i couldnt have done it i shouldnt have even thought of it i should have been too excited nothing but christian science could have enabled that child to do that calm and thoughtful and judicious thing in those circumstances she came down on her head and by all the rules she should have broken it but the intervention of the formula prevented that so the only claim resulting was a blackened eye monday morning it was still swollen and shut at school it hurt pretty badthat is it seemed to so i was excused and went down in the basement and said now i am depending on mamma instead of god and i will depend on god instead of mamma no doubt this would have answered but to make sure she added mrs eddy to the team and recited the scientific statement of being which is one of the principal incantations i judge then i felt my eye opening why it would have opened an oyster i think it is one of the touchingest things in childhistory that pious little rat down cellar pumping away at the scientific statement of being  there is a page about another good childlittle gordon little gordon came into the world without the assistance of surgery or anaesthetics he was a demonstration a painless one therefore his coming evoked joy and thankfulness to god and the discoverer of christian science it is a noticeable feature of this literaturethe so frequent linking together of the two beings in an equal bond also of their two bibles when little gordon was two years old he was playing horse on the bed where i had left my little book i noticed him stop in his play take the book carefully in his little hands kiss it softly then look about for the highest place of safety his arms could reach and put it there this pious act filled the mother with such a train of thought as i had never experienced before i thought of the sweet mother of long ago who kept things in her heart etc it is a bold comparison however unconscious profanations are about as common in the mouths of the lay membership of the new church as are frank and open ones in the mouths of its consecrated chiefs  some days later the family librarychristian science bookswas lying in a deepseated window it was another chance for the holy child to show off he left his play and went there and pushed all the books to one side except the annex it he took in both hands slowly raised it to his lips then removed it carefully and seated himself in the window it had seemed to the mother too wonderful to be true that first time but now she was convinced that neither imagination nor accident had anything to do with it later little gordon let the author of his being see him do it after that he did it frequently probably every time anybody was looking i would rather have that child than a chromo if this tale has any object it is to intimate that the inspired book was supernaturally able to convey a sense of its sacred and awful character to this innocent little creature without the intervention of outside aids the magazine is not edited with highpriced discretion the editor has a claim and he ought to get it treated  among other witnesses there is one who had a jumping toothache which several times tempted her to believe that there was sensation in matter but each time it was overcome by the power of truth she would not allow the dentist to use cocaine but sat there and let him punch and drill and split and crush the tool and tear and slash its ulcerations and pull out the nerve and dig out fragments of bone and she wouldnt once confess that it hurt and to this day she thinks it didnt and i have not a doubt that she is ninetenths right and that her christian science faith did her better service than she could have gotten out of cocaine  there is an account of a boy who got broken all up into small bits by an accident but said over the scientific statement of being or some of the other incantations and got well and sound without having suffered any real pain and without the intrusion of a surgeon i can believe this because my own case was somewhat similar as per my former article  also there is an account of the restoration to perfect health in a single night of a fatally injured horse by the application of christian science i can stand a good deal but i recognise that the ice is getting thin here that horse had as many as fifty claims how could he demonstrate over them could he do the allgood goodgood goodgracious liver bones truth all down but nine set them up on the other alley could he intone the scientific statement of being now could he wouldnt it give him a relapse let us draw the line at horses horses and furniture  there is a plenty of other testimonies in the magazine but these quoted samples will answer they show the kind of trade the science is driving now we come back to the question does it kill a patient here and there and now and then we must concede it does it compensate for this i am persuaded that it can make a plausible showing in that direction for instance when it lays its hands upon a soldier who has suffered thirty years of helpless torture and makes him whole in body and mind what is the actual sum of that achievement this i think that it has restored to life a subject who had essentially died ten deaths a year for thirty years and each of them a long and painful one but for its interference that man would have essentially died thirty times more in the three years which have since elapsed there are thousand of young people in the land who are now ready to enter upon a lifelong death similar to that mans every time the science captures one of these and secures to him lifelong immunity from imaginationmanufactured disease it may plausibly claim that in his person it has saved 300 lives meantime it will kill a man every now and then but no matter it will still be ahead on the credit side   viii       we consciously declare that science and health with key to the      scriptures was foretold as well as its author mary baker eddy in      revelation x  she is the mighty angel or gods highest thought      to this age verse 1 giving us the spiritual interpretation of the      bible in the little book open verse 2  thus we prove that      christian science is the second coming of christtruthspirit      lecture by dr  george tomkins dd cs  there you have it in plain speech she is the mighty angel she is the divinely and officially sent bearer of gods highest thought for the present she brings the second advent we must expect that before she has been in her grave fifty years she will be regarded by her following as having been herself the second advent she is already worshipped and we must expect this feeling to spread territorially and also to deepen in intensity 1  particularly after her death for then as anyone can foresee eddyworship will be taught in the sundayschools and pulpits of the cult already whatever she puts her trademark on thought it be only a memorial spoon is holy and is eagerly and passionately and gratefully bought by the disciple and becomes a fetish in his house i say bought for the boston christianscience trust gives nothing away everything it has for sale and the terms are cash and not cash only but cash in advance its god is mrs eddy first then the dollar not a spiritual dollar but a real one from end to end of the christianscience literature not a single material thing in the world is conceded to be real except the dollar but all through and through its advertisements that reality is eagerly and persistently recognised the hunger of the trust for the dollar its adoration of the dollar its lust after the dollar its ecstasy in the mere thought of the dollarthere has been nothing like it in the world in any age or country nothing so coarse nothing so lubricous nothing so bestial except a french novels attitude towards adultery  the dollar is hunted down in all sorts of ways the christianscience motherchurch and bargaincounter in boston peddles all kinds of spiritual wares to the faithful always at extravagant prices and always on the one conditioncash cash in advance the angel of the apocalypse could not go there and get a copy of his own pirated book on credit many many precious

divinity circuit compensation balance twin screw and the other modern improvements and at the same bargain counter can be had the christian science journal i wish it were in refined taste to apply a rudely and ruggedly descriptive epithet to that literary slushbucket so as to give one an accurate idea of what it is like i am moved to do it but i must not it is better to be refined than accurate when one is talking about a production like that  christianscience literary oleomargarine is a monopoly of the mother church headquarters factory in boston none genuine without the trademark of the trust you must apply there and not elsewhere and you pay your money before you get your soapfat  the trust has still other sources of income mrs eddy is president and perhaps proprietor of the trusts metaphysical college in boston where the student who has practised cs healing during three years the best he knew how perfects himself in the game by a two weeks course and pays one hundred dollars for it and i have a case among my statistics where the student had a three weeks course and paid three hundred for it  the trust does love the dollar when it isnt a spiritual one  in order to force the sale of mrs eddys bibleannex no healer metaphysical collegebred or other is allowed to practise the game unless he possess a copy of that holy nightmare that means a large and constantly augmenting income for the trust no cs family would consider itself loyal or pious or painproof without an annex or two in the house that means an income for the trustin the near futureof millions not thousandsmillions a year  no member young or old of a christianscientist church can retain that membership unless he pay capitation tax to the boston trust every year that means an income for the trustin the near futureof millions more per year  it is a reasonably safe guess that in america in 1910 there will be 10000000 christian scientists and 3000000 in great britain that these figures will be trebled by 1920 that in america in 1910 the christian scientists will be a political force in 1920 politically formidableto remain that permanently and i think it a reasonable guess that the trust which is already in our day pretty brusque in its ways will then be the most insolent and unscrupulous and tyrannical politicoreligious master that has dominated a people since the palmy days of the inquisition and a stronger master than the strongest of bygone times because this one will have a financial strength not dreamed of by any predecessor as effective a concentration of irresponsible power as any predecessor had in the railway the telegraph and the subsidised newspaper better facilities for watching and managing his empire than any predecessor has had and after a generation or two he will probably divide christendom with the catholic church  the roman church has a perfect organisation and it has an effective centralisation of powerbut not of its cash its multitude of bishops are rich but their riches remain in large measure in their own hands they collect from 200000000 of people but they keep the bulk of the result at home the boston pope of byandby will draw his dollarahead capitationtax from 300000000 of the human race and the annex and the rest of his bookshop will fetch in double as much more and his metaphysical colleges the annual pilgrimage to mrs eddys tomb from all over the worldadmission the christianscience dollar payable in advancepurchases of consecrated glass beads candles memorial spoons aureoled chromoportraits and bogus autographs of mrs eddy cash offerings at her shrineno crutches of cured cripples received and no imitations of miraculously restored broken legs and necks allowed to be hung up except when made out of the holy metal and proved by fireassay cash for miracles worked at the tomb these moneysources with a thousand to be yet invented and ambushed upon the devotee will bring the annual increment well up above a billion and nobody but the trust will have the handling of it no bishops appointed unless they agree to hand in 90 per cent of the catch in that day the trust will monopolise the manufacture and sale of the old and new testaments as well as the annex and raise their price to annex rates and compel the devotee to buy for even today a healer has to have the annex and the scriptures or he is not allowed to work the game and that will bring several hundred million dollars more in those days the trust will have an income approaching 5000000 a day and no expenses to be taken out of it no taxes to pay and no charities to support that last detail should not be lightly passed over by the read it is well entitled to attention  no charities to support no nor even to contribute to one searches in vain the trusts advertisements and the utterances of its pulpit for any suggestion that it spends a penny on orphans widows discharged prisoners hospitals ragged schools night missions city missions foreign missions libraries old peoples homes or any other object that appeals to a human beings purse through his heart2  i have hunted hunted and hunted by correspondence and otherwise and have not yet got upon the track of a farthing that the trust has spent upon any worthy object nothing makes a scientist so uncomfortable as to ask him if he knows of a case where christian science has spent money on a benevolence either among its own adherents or elsewhere he is obliged to say no and then one discovers that the person questioned has been asked the question many times before and that it is getting to be a sore subject with him why a sore subject because he has written his chiefs and asked with high confidence for an answer that will confound these questionersand the chiefs did not reply he has written againand then againnot with confidence but humbly now and has begged for defensive ammunition in the voice of supplication a reply does at last cometo this effect we must have faith in our mother and rest content in the conviction that whatever she3 does with the money it is in accordance with orders from heaven for she does no act of any kind without first demonstrating over it  that settles itas far as the disciple is concerned his mind is entirely satisfied with that answer he gets down his annex and does an incantation or two and that mesmerises his spirit and puts that to sleepbrings it peace peace and comfort and joy until some inquirer punctures the old sore again  through friends in america i asked some questions and in some cases got definite and informing answers in other cases the answers were not definite and not valuable from the definite answers i gather than the capitationtax is compulsory and that the sum is one dollar to the question does any of the money go to charities the answer from an authoritative source was no not in the sense usually conveyed by this word the italics are mine that answer is cautious but definite i thinkutterly and unassailably definitealthough quite christianscientifically foggy in its phrasing christian science is generally foggy generally diffuse generally garrulous the writer was aware that the first word in his phrase answered the question which i was asking but he could not help adding nine dark words meaningless ones unless explained by him it is quite likelyas intimated by himthat christian science has invented a new class of objects to apply the word charity to but without an explanation we cannot know what they are we quite easily and naturally and confidently guess that they are in all cases objects which will return five hundred per cent on the trusts investment in them but guessing is not knowledge it is merely in this case a sort of ninetenths certainty deducible from what we think we know of the trusts trade principles and its sly and furtive and shifty ways  sly deep judicious the trust understands business the trust does not give itself away it defeats all the attempts of us impertinents to get at its trade secrets to this day after all our diligence we have not been able to get it to confess what it does with the money it does not even let its own disciples find out all it says is that the matter has been demonstrated over now and then a lay scientist says with a grateful exultation that mrs eddy is enormously rich but he stops there as to whether any of the money goes to other charities or not he is obliged to admit that he does not know however the trust is composed of human beings and this justifies the conjecture that if it had a charity on its list which it did not need to blush for we should soon hear of it  without money and without price those used to be the terms mrs eddys annex cancels them the motto of christian science is the labourer is worthy of his hire and now that it has been demonstrated over we find its spiritual meaning to be do anything and everything your hand may find to do and charge cash for it and collect the money in advance the scientist has on his tongues end a cutanddried bostonsupplied set of rather lean arguments whose function is to show that it is a heavencommanded duty to do this and that the croupiers of the game have no choice by to obey  the trust seems to be a reincarnation exodus xxxii4  i have no reverence for mrs eddy and the rest of the trustif there is a restbut i am not lacking in reverence for the sincerities of the lay membership of the new church there is every evidence that the lay members are entirely sincere in their faith and i think sincerity is always entitled to honour and respect let the inspiration of the sincerity be what it may zeal and sincerity can carry a new religion further than any other missionary except fire and sword and i believe that the new religion will conquer the half of christendom in a hundred years i am not intending this as a compliment to the human race i am merely stating an opinion and yet i think that perhaps it is a compliment to the race i keep in mind that saying of an orthodox preacherquoted further back he conceded that this new christianity frees its possessors life from frets fears vexations bitterness and all sorts of imaginationpropagated maladies and pains and fills his world with sunshine and his heart with gladness if christian science with this stupendous equipmentand final salvation addedcannot win half the christian globe i must be badly mistaken in the makeup of the human race  i think the trust will be handed down like the other papacy and will always know how to handle its limitless cash it will press the button the zeal the energy the sincerity the enthusiasm of its countless vassals will do the rest   ix  the power which a mans imagination has over his body to heal it or make it sick is a force which none of us is born without the first man had it the last one will possess it if left to himself a man is most likely to use only the mischievous half of the forcethe half which invents imaginary ailments for him and cultivates them and if he is one of these very wise people he is quite likely to scoff at the beneficent half of the force and deny its existence and so to heal or help that man two imaginations are required his own and some outsiders the outsider b must imagine that his incantations are the healing power that is curing a and a must imagine that this is so it is not so at all but no matter the cure is effected and that is the main thing the outsiders work is unquestionably valuable so valuable that it may fairly be likened to the essential work performed by the engineer when he handles the throttle and turns on the steam the actual power is lodged exclusively in the engine but if the engine were left alone it would never start of itself whether the engineer be named jim or bob or tom it is all onehis services are necessary and he is entitled to such wage as he can get you to pay whether he be named christian scientist or mental scientist or mind curist or lourdes miracleworker or kingsevil expert it is all onehe is merely the engineer he simply turns on the same old steam and the engine does the whole work  in the case of the cureengine it is a distinct advantage to clothe the engineer in religious overalls and give him a pious name it greatly enlarges the business and does no one any harm  the christianscientist engineer drives exactly the same trade as the other engineers yet he outprospers the whole of them put together is it because he has captured the takingest name i think that that is only a small part of it i think that the secret of his high prosperity lies elsewhere  the christian scientist has organised the business now that was certainly a gigantic idea there is more intellect in it than would be needed in the invention of a couple of millions of eddy scienceandhealth bible annexes electricity in limitless volume has existed in the air and the rocks and the earth and everywhere since time beganand was going to waste all the while in our time we have organised that scattered and wandering force and set it to work and backed the business with capital and concentrated it in few and competent hands and the results are as we see  the christian scientist has taken a force which has been lying idle in every member of the human race since time began and has organised it and backed the business with capital and concentrated it at boston headquarters in the hands of a small and very competent trust and there are results  therein lies the promise that this monopoly is going to extend its commerce wide in the earth i think that if the business were conducted in the loose and disconnected fashion customary with such things it would achieve but little more than the modest prosperity usually secured by unorganised great moral and commercial ventures but i believe that so long as this one remains compactly organised and closely concentrated in a trust the spread of its dominion will continue  vienna

churches that give have nothing to hide  3 i may be introducing the capital s a little earlystill it is on its way       is he living or is he dead  i was spending the month of march 1892 at mentone in the riviera at this retired spot one has all the advantages privately which are to be had publicly at monte carlo and nice a few miles farther along that is to say one has the flooding sunshine the balmy air and the brilliant blue sea without the marring additions of human powwow and fuss and feathers and display mentone is quiet simple restful unpretentious the rich and the gaudy do not come there as a rule i mean the rich do not come there now and then a rich man comes and i presently got acquainted with one of these partially to disguise him i will call him smith one day in the hotel des anglais at the second breakfast he exclaimed  quick cast your eye on the man going out at the door take in every detail of him  why  do you know who he is  yes he spent several days here before you came he is an old retired and very rich silk manufacturer from lyons they say and i guess he is alone in the world for he always looks sad and dreamy and doesnt talk with anybody his name is theophile magnan  i supposed that smith would now proceed to justify the large interest which he had shown in monsieur magnan but instead he dropped into a brown study and was apparently lost to me and to the rest of the world during some minutes now and then he passed his fingers through his flossy white hair to assist his thinking and meantime he allowed his breakfast to go on cooling at last he said  no its gone i cant call it back  cant call what back  its one of hans andersens beautiful little stories but its gone fro me part of it is like this a child has a caged bird which it loves but thoughtlessly neglects the bird pours out its song unheard and unheeded but in time hunger and thirst assail the creature and its song grows plaintive and feeble and finally ceasesthe bird dies the child comes and is smitten to the heart with remorse then with bitter tears and lamentations it calls its mates and they bury the bird with elaborate pomp and the tenderest grief without knowing poor things that it isnt children only who starve poets to death and then spend enough on their funerals and monuments to have kept them alive and made them easy and comfortable now  but here we were interrupted about ten that evening i ran across smith and he asked me up to his parlour to help him smoke and drink hot scotch it was a cosy place with its comfortable chairs its cheerful lamps and its friendly open fire of seasoned olivewood to make everything perfect there was a muffled booming of the surf outside after the second scotch and much lazy and contented chat smith said  now we are properly primedi to tell a curious history and you to listen to it it has been a secret for many yearsa secret between me and three others but i am going to break the seal now are you comfortable  perfectly go on  here follows what he told me  a long time ago i was a young artista very young artist in factand i wandered about the country parts of france sketching here and sketching there and was presently joined by a couple of darling young frenchmen who were at the same kind of thing that i was doing we were as happy as we were poor or as poor as we were happyphrase it to suit yourself claude frere and carl boulangerthese are the names of those boys dear dear fellows and the sunniest spirits that ever laughed at poverty and had a noble good time in all weathers  at last we ran hard aground in a breton village and an artist as poor as ourselves took us in and literally saved us from starvingfrancois millet  what the great francois millet  great he wasnt any greater than we were then he hadnt any fame even in his own village and he was so poor that he hadnt anything to feed us on but turnips and even the turnips failed us sometimes we four became fast friends doting friends inseparables we painted away together with all our might piling up stock piling up stock but very seldom getting rid of any of it we had lovely times together but o my soul how we were pinched now and then  for a little over two years this went on at last one day claude said  boys weve come to the end do you understand thatabsolutely to the end everybody has strucktheres a league formed against us ive been all around the village and its just as i tell you they refuse to credit us for another centime until all the odds and ends are paid up  this struck us as cold every face was blank with dismay we realised that our circumstances were desperate now there was a long silence finally millet said with a sigh  nothing occurs to menothing suggest something lads  there was no response unless a mournful silence may be called a response carl got up and walked nervously up and down a while then said  its a shame look at these canvases stacks and stacks of as good pictures as anybody in europe paintsi dont care who he is yes and plenty of lounging strangers have said the sameor nearly that anyway  but didnt buy millet said  no matter they said it and its true too look at your angelus there will anybody tell me  pah carlmy angelus i was offered five francs for it  when  who offered it  where is he  why didnt you take it  comedont all speak at once i thought he would give morei was sure of ithe looked itso i asked him eight  welland then  he said he would call again  thunder and lightning why francois  oh i knowi know it was a mistake and i was a fool boys i meant for the best youll grant me that and i  why certainly we know that bless your dear heart but dont you be a fool again  i i wish somebody would come along and offer us a cabbage for ityoud see  a cabbage oh dont name itit makes my mouth water talk of things less trying  boys said carl do these pictures lack merit answer me that  no  arent they of very great and high merit answer me that  yes  of such great and high merit that if an illustrious name were attached to them they would sell at splendid prices isnt it so  certainly it is nobody doubts that  butim not jokingisnt it so  why of course its soand we are not joking but what of it what of it how does that concern us  in this way comradeswell attach an illustrious name to them  the lively conversation stopped the faces were turned inquiringly upon carl what sort of riddle might this be where was an illustrious name to be borrowed and who was to borrow it  carl sat down and said  now i have a perfectly serious thing to propose i think it is the only way to keep us out of the almshouse and i believe it to be a perfectly sure way i base this opinion upon certain multitudinous and longestablished facts in human history i believe my project will make us all rich  rich youve lost your mind  no i havent  yes you haveyouve lost your mind what do you call rich  a hundred thousand francs apiece  he has lost his mind i knew it  yes he has carl privation has been too much for you and  carl you want to take a pill and get right to bed  bandage him firstbandage his head and then  no bandage his heels his brains have been settling for weeksive noticed it  shut up said millet with ostensible severity and let the boy have his say now thencome out with your project carl what is it  well then by way of preamble i will ask you to note this fact in human history that the merit of many a great artist has never been acknowledged until after he was starved and dead this has happened so often that i make bold to found a law upon it this law that the merit of every great unknown and neglected artist must and will be recognised and his pictures climb to high prices after his death my project is this we must cast lotsone of us must die  the remark fell so calmly and so unexpectedly that we almost forgot to jump then there was a wild chorus of advice againmedical advicefor the help of carls brain but he waited patiently for the hilarity to calm down and then went on again with his project  yes one of us must die to save the othersand himself we will cast lots the one chosen shall be illustrious all of us shall be rich hold still nowhold still dont interrupti tell you i know what i am talking about here is the idea during the next three months the one who is to die shall paint with all his might enlarge his stock all he cannot pictures no skeleton sketches studies parts of studies fragments of studies a dozen dabs of the brush on eachmeaningless of course but his with his cipher on them turn out fifty a day each to contain some peculiarity or mannerism easily detectable as histheyre the things that sell you know and are collected at fabulous prices for the worlds museums after the great man is gone well have a ton of them readya ton and all that time the rest of us will be busy supporting the moribund and working paris and the dealerspreparations for the coming event you know and when everything is hot and just right well spring the death on them and have the notorious funeral you get the idea  no at least not qu  not quite dont you see the man doesnt really die he changes his name and vanishes we bury a dummy and cry over it with all the world to help and i  but he wasnt allowed to finish everybody broke out into a rousing hurrah of applause and all jumped up and capered about the room and fell on each others necks in transports of gratitude and joy for hours we talked over the great plan without ever feeling hungry and at last when all the details had been arranged satisfactorily we cast lots and millet was electedelected to die as we called it then we scraped together those things which one never parts with until he is betting them against future wealthkeepsake trinkets and suchlikeand these we pawned for enough to furnish us a frugal farewell supper and breakfast and leave us a few francs over for travel and a stake of turnips and such for millet to live on for a few days  next morning early the three of us cleared out straightway after breakfaston foot of course each of us carried a dozen of millets small pictures purposing to market them carl struck for paris where he would start the work of building up millets name against the coming great day claude and i were to separate and scatter abroad over france  now it will surprise you to know what an easy and comfortable thing we had i walked two days before i began business then i began to sketch a villa in the outskirts of a big townbecause i saw the proprietor standing on an upper veranda he came down to look oni thought he would i worked swiftly intending to keep him interested occasionally he fired off a little ejaculation of approbation and byandby he spoke up with enthusiasm and said i was a master  i put down my brush reached into my satchel fetched out a millet and pointed to the cipher in the corner i said proudly  i suppose you recognise that well he taught me i should think i ought to know my trade  the man looked guiltily embarrassed and was silent i said sorrowfully  you dont mean to intimate that you dont know the cipher of francois millet  of course he didnt know that cipher but he was the gratefullest man you ever saw just the same for being let out of an uncomfortable place on such easy terms he said  no why it is millets sure enough i dont know what i could have been thinking of of course i recognise it now  next he wanted to buy it but i said that although i wasnt rich i wasnt that poor however at last i let him have it for eight hundred francs  eight hundred  yes millet would have sold it for a pork chop yes i got eight hundred francs for that little thing i wish i could get it back for eighty thousand but that times gone by i made a very nice picture of that mans house and i wanted to offer it to him for ten francs but that wouldnt answer seeing i was the pupil of such a master so i sold it to him for a hundred i sent the eight hundred francs straight to millet from that town and struck out again next day  but i didnt walkno i rode i have ridden ever since i sold one picture every day and never tried to sell two i always said to my customer  i am a fool to sell a picture of francois millets at all for that man is not going to live three months and when he dies his pictures cant be had for love or money  i took care to spread that little fact as far as i could and prepare the world for the event  i take credit to myself for our plan of selling the picturesit was mine i suggested it that last evening when we were laying out our campaign and all three of us agreed to give it a good fair trial before giving it up for some other it succeeded with all of us i walked only two days claude walked twoboth of afraid to make millet celebrated too close to homebut carl walked only half a day the bright conscienceless rascal and after that he travelled like a duke  every now and then we got in with a country editor and started an item around through the press not an item announcing that a new painter had been discovered but an item which let on that everybody knew francois millet not an item praising him in any way but merely a word concerning the present condition of the mastersometimes hopeful sometimes despondent but always tinged with fears for the worst we always marked these paragraphs and sent the papers to all the people who had bought pictures of us  carl was soon in paris and he worked things with a high hand he made friends with the correspondents and got millets condition reported to england and all over the continent and america and everywhere  at the end of six weeks from the start we three met in paris and called a halt and stopped sending back to millet for additional pictures the boom was so high and everything so ripe that we saw that it would be a mistake not to strike now right away without waiting any longer so we wrote millet to go to bed and begin to waste away pretty fast for we should like him to die in ten days if he could get ready  then we figured up and found that among us we had sold eightyfive small pictures and studies and had sixtynine thousand francs to show for it carl had made the last sale and the most brilliant one of all he sold the angelus for twentytwo hundred francs how we did glorify himnot foreseeing that a day was coming byandby when france would struggle to own it and a stranger would capture it for five hundred and fifty thousand cash  we had a windup champagne supper that night and next day claude and i packed up and went off to nurse millet through his last days and keep busybodies out of the house and send daily bulletins to carl in paris for publication in the papers of several continents for the information of a waiting world the sad end came at last and carl was there in time to help in the final mournful rites  you remember that great funeral and what a stir it made all over the globe and how the illustrious of two worlds came to attend it and testify their sorrow we fourstill inseparablecarried the coffin and would allow none to help and we were right about that because it hadnt anything in it but a wax figure and any other coffinbearers would have found fault with the weight yes we same old four who had lovingly shared privation together in the old hard times now gone for ever carried the cof  which four  we fourfor millet helped to carry his own coffin in disguise you know disguised as a relativedistant relative  astonishing  but true just the same well you remember how the pictures went up money we didnt know what to do with it theres a man in paris today who owns seventy millet pictures he paid us two million francs for them and as for the bushels of sketches and studies which millet shovelled out during the six weeks that we were on the road well it would astonish you to know the figure we sell them at nowadaysthat is when we consent to let one go  it is a wonderful history perfectly wonderful  yesit amounts to that  whatever became of millet  can you keep a secret  i can  do you remember the man i called your attention to in the dining room today that was francois millet  great  scott yes for once they didnt starve a genius to death and then put into other pockets the rewards he should have had himself this songbird was not allowed to pipe out its heart unheard and then be paid with the cold pomp of a big funeral we looked out for that       my debut as a literary person  in those early days i had already published one little thing the jumping frog in an eastern paper but i did not consider that that counted in my view a person who published things in a mere newspaper could not properly claim recognition as a literary person he must rise away above that he must appear in a magazine he would then be a literary person also he would be famousright away these two ambitions were strong upon me this was in 1866 i prepared my contribution and then looked around for the best magazine to go up to glory in i selected the most important one in new york the contribution was accepted i signed it mark twain for that name had some currency on the pacific coast and it was my idea to spread it all over the world now at this one jump the article appeared in the december number and i sat up a month waiting for the january number for that one would contain the years list of contributors my name would be in it and i should be famous and could give the banquet i was meditating  i did not give the banquet i had not written the mark twain distinctly it was a fresh name to eastern printers and they put it mike swain or macswain i do not remember which at any rate i was not celebrated and i did not give the banquet i was a literary person but that was alla buried one buried alive  my article was about the burning of the clippership hornet on the line may 3 1866 there were thirtyone men on board at the time and i was in honolulu when the fifteen lean and ghostly survivors arrived there after a voyage of fortythree days in an open boat through the blazing tropics on ten days rations of food a very remarkable trip but it was conducted by a captain who was a remarkable man otherwise there would have been no survivors he was a new englander of the best seagoing stock of the old capable timescaptain josiah mitchell  i was in the islands to write letters for the weekly edition of the sacramento union a rich and influential daily journal which hadnt any use for them but could afford to spend twenty dollars a week for nothing the proprietors were lovable and wellbeloved men long ago dead no doubt but in me there is at least one person who still holds them in grateful remembrance for i dearly wanted to see the islands and they listened to me and gave me the opportunity when there was but slender likelihood that it could profit them in any way  i had been in the islands several months when the survivors arrived i was laid up in my room at the time and unable to walk here was a great occasion to serve my journal and i not able to take advantage of it necessarily i was in deep trouble but by good luck his excellency anson burlingame was there at the time on his way to take up his post in china where he did such good work for the united states he came and put me on a stretcher and had me carried to the hospital where the shipwrecked men were and i never needed to ask a question he attended to all of that himself and i had nothing to do but make the notes it was like him to take that trouble he was a great man and a great american and it was in his fine nature to come down from his high office and do a friendly turn whenever he could  we got through with this work at six in the evening i took no dinner for there was no time to spare if i would beat the other correspondents i spent four hours arranging the notes in their proper order then wrote all night and beyond it with this result that i had a very long and detailed account of the hornet episode ready at nine in the morning while the other correspondents of the san francisco journals had nothing but a brief outline reportfor they didnt sit up the nowandthen schooner was to sail for san francisco about nine when i reached the dock she was free forward and was just casting off her sternline my fat envelope was thrown by a strong hand and fell on board all right and my victory was a safe thing all in due time the ship reached san francisco but it was my complete report which made the stir and was telegraphed to the new york papers by mr cash he was in charge of the pacific bureau of the new york herald at the time  when i returned to california byandby i went up to sacramento and presented a bill for general correspondence at twenty dollars a week it was paid then i presented a bill for special service on the hornet matter of three columns of solid nonpareil at a hundred dollars a column the cashier didnt faint but he came rather near it he sent for the proprietors and they came and never uttered a protest they only laughed in their jolly fashion and said it was robbery but no matter it was a grand scoop the bill or my hornet report i didnt know which pay it its all right the best men that ever owned a newspaper  the hornet survivors reached the sandwich islands the 15th of june they were mere skinny skeletons their clothes hung limp about them and fitted them no better than a flag fits the flagstaff in a calm but they were well nursed in the hospital the people of honolulu kept them supplied with all the dainties they could need they gathered strength fast and were presently nearly as good as new within a fortnight the most of them took ship for san francisco that is if my dates have not gone astray in my memory i went in the same ship a sailingvessel captain mitchell of the hornet was along also the only passengers the hornet had carried these were two young men from stamford connecticutbrothers samuel and henry ferguson the hornet was a clipper of the first class and a fast sailer the young mens quarters were roomy and comfortable and were well stocked with books and also with canned meats and fruits to help out the shipfare with and when the ship cleared from new york harbour in the first week of january there was promise that she would make quick and pleasant work of the fourteen or fifteen thousand miles in front of her as soon as the cold latitudes were left behind and the vessel entered summer weather the voyage became a holiday picnic the ship flew southward under a cloud of sail which needed no attention no modifying or change of any kind for days together the young men read strolled the ample deck rested and drowsed in the shade of the canvas took their meals with the captain and when the day was done they played dummy whist with him till bedtime after the snow and ice and tempests of the horn the ship bowled northward into summer weather again and the trip was a picnic once more  until the early morning of the 3rd of may computed position of the ship 112 degrees 10 minutes longitude latitude 2 degrees above the equator no wind no seadead calm temperature of the atmosphere tropical blistering unimaginable by one who has not been roasted in it there was a cry of fire an unfaithful sailor had disobeyed the rules and gone into the boobyhatch with an open light to draw some varnish from a cask the proper result followed and the vessels hours were numbered  there was not much time to spare but the captain made the most of it the three boats were launchedlongboat and two quarterboats that the time was very short and the hurry and excitement considerable is indicated by the fact that in launching the boats a hole was stove in the side of one of them by some sort of collision and an oar driven through the side of another the captains first care was to have four sick sailors brought up and placed on deck out of harms wayamong them a portyghee this man had not done a days work on the voyage but had lain in his hammock four months nursing an abscess when we were taking notes in the honolulu hospital and a sailor told this to mr burlingame the third mate who was lying near raised his head with an effort and in a weak voice made this correctionwith solemnity and feeling  raising abscesses he had a family of them he done it to keep from standing his watch  any provisions that lay handy were gathered up by the men and two passengers and brought and dumped on the deck where the portyghee lay then they ran for more the sailor who was telling this to mr burlingame added  we pulled together thirtytwo days rations for the thirtyone men that way  the third mate lifted his head again and made another correctionwith bitterness  the portyghee et twentytwo of them while he was soldiering there and nobody noticing a damned hound  the fire spread with great rapidity the smoke and flame drove the men back and they had to stop their incomplete work of fetching provisions and take to the boats with only ten days rations secured  each boat had a compass a quadrant a copy of bowditchs navigator and a nautical almanac and the captains and chief mates boats had chronometers there were thirtyone men all told the captain took an account of stock with the following result four hams nearly thirty pounds of salt pork halfbox of raisins one hundred pounds of bread twelve twopound cans of oysters clams and assorted meats a keg containing four pounds of butter twelve gallons of water in a fortygallon scuttlebutt four onegallon demijohns full of water three bottles of brandy the property of passengers some pipes matches and a hundred pounds of tobacco no medicines of course the whole party had to go on short rations at once  the captain and the two passengers kept diaries on our voyage to san francisco we ran into a calm in the middle of the pacific and did not move a rod during fourteen days this gave me a chance to copy the diaries samuel fergusons is the fullest i will draw upon it now when the following paragraph was written the doomed ship was about one hundred and twenty days out from port and all hands were putting in the lazy time about as usual as no one was forecasting disaster       diary entry may 2  latitude 1 degree 28 minutes n longitude 111      degrees 38 minutes w  another hot and sluggish day at one time      however the clouds promised wind and there came a slight breeze      just enough to keep us going  the only thing to chronicle today      is the quantities of fish about nine bonitos were caught this      forenoon and some large albacores seen  after dinner the first      mate hooked a fellow which he could not hold so he let the line go      to the captain who was on the bow  he holding on brought the      fish to with a jerk and snap went the line hook and all  we also      saw astern swimming lazily after us an enormous shark which must      have been nine or ten feet long  we tried him with all sorts of      lines and a piece of pork but he declined to take hold  i suppose      he had appeased his appetite on the heads and other remains of the      bonitos we had thrown overboard  next days entry records the disaster the three boats got away retired to a short distance and stopped the two injured ones were leaking badly some of the men were kept busy baling others patched the holes as well as they could the captain the two passengers and eleven men were in the longboat with a share of the provisions and water and with no room to spare for the boat was only twentyone feet long six wide and three deep the chief mate and eight men were in one of the small boats the second mate and seven men in the other the passengers had saved no clothing but what they had on excepting their overcoats the ship clothed in flame and sending up a vast column of black smoke into the sky made a grand picture in the solitudes of the sea and hour after hour the outcasts sat and watched it meantime the captain ciphered on the immensity of the distance that stretched between him and the nearest available land and then scaled the rations down to meet the emergency half a biscuit for dinner one biscuit and some canned meat for dinner half a biscuit for tea a few swallows of water for each meal and so hunger began to gnaw while the ship was still burning       diary entry may 4  the ship burned all night very brightly and      hopes are that some ship has seen the light and is bearing down upon      us  none seen however this forenoon so we have determined to go      together north and a little west to some islands in 18 degrees or 19      degrees north latitude and 114 degrees to 115 degrees west      longitude hoping in the meantime to be picked up by some ship  the      ship sank suddenly at about 5 am  we find the sun very hot and      scorching but all try to keep out of it as much as we can  they did a quite natural thing now waited several hours for that possible ship that might have seen the light to work her slow way to them through the nearly dead calm then they gave it up and set about their plans if you will look at the map you will say that their course could be easily decided albemarle island galapagos group lies straight eastward nearly a thousand miles the islands referred to in the diary as some islands revillagigedo islands lie as they think in some widely uncertain region northward about one thousand miles and westward one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles acapulco on the mexican coast lies about northeast something short of one thousand miles you will say random rocks in the ocean are not what is wanted let them strike for acapulco and the solid continent that does look like the rational course but one presently guesses from the diaries that the thing would have been wholly irrationalindeed suicidal if the boats struck for albemarle they would be in the doldrums all the way and that means a watery perdition with winds which are wholly crazy and blow from all points of the compass at once and also perpendicularly if the boats tried for acapulco they would get out of the doldrums when halfway therein case they ever got halfwayand then they would be in lamentable case for there they would meet the northeast trades coming down in their teeth and these boats were so rigged that they could not sail within eight points of the wind so they wisely started northward with a slight slant to the west they had but ten days short allowance of food the longboat was towing the others they could not depend on making any sort of definite progress in the doldrums and they had four or five hundred miles of doldrums in front of them yet they are the real equator a tossing roaring rainy belt ten or twelve hundred miles broad which girdles the globe  it rained hard the first night and all got drenched but they filled up their waterbutt the brothers were in the stern with the captain who steered the quarters were cramped no one got much sleep kept on our course till squalls headed us off  stormy and squally the next morning with drenching rains a heavy and dangerous cobbling sea one marvels how such boats could live in it is it called a feat of desperate daring when one man and a dog cross the atlantic in a boat the size of a longboat and indeed it is but this longboat was overloaded with men and other plunder and was only three feet deep we naturally thought often of all at home and were glad to remember that it was sacrament sunday and that prayers would go up from our friends for us although they know not our peril  the captain got not even a catnap during the first three days and nights but he got a few winks of sleep the fourth night the worst sea yet about ten at night the captain changed his course and headed eastnortheast hoping to make clipperton rock if he failed no matter he would be in a better position to make those other islands i will mention here that he did not find that rock  on may 8 no wind all day sun blistering hot they take to the oars plenty of dolphins but they couldnt catch any i think we are all beginning to realise more and more the awful situation we are in it often takes a ship a week to get through the doldrums how much longer then such a craft as ours we are so crowded that we cannot stretch ourselves out for a good sleep but have to take it any way we can get it  of course this feature will grow more and more trying but it will be human nature to cease to set it down there will be five weeks of it yetwe must try to remember that for the diarist it will make our beds the softer  may 9 the sun gives him a warning looking with both eyes the horizon crossed thus  henry keeps well but broods over our troubles more than i wish he did they caught two dolphins they tasted well the captain believed the compass out of the way but the longinvisible north star came outa welcome sightand endorsed the compass  may 10 latitude 7 degrees 0 minutes 3 seconds n longitude 111 degrees 32 minutes w so they have made about three hundred miles of northing in the six days since they left the region of the lost ship drifting in calms all day and baking hot of course i have been down there and i remember that detail even as the captain says all romance has long since vanished and i think the most of us are beginning to look the fact of our awful situation full in the face we are making but little headway on our course bad news from the rearmost boat the men are improvident they have eaten up all of the canned meats brought from the ship and are now growing discontented not so with the chief mates peoplethey are evidently under the eye of a man  under date of may 11 standing still or worse we lost more last night than we made yesterday in fact they have lost three miles of the three hundred of northing they had so laboriously made the cock that was rescued and pitched into the boat while the ship was on fire still lives and crows with the breaking of dawn cheering us a good deal what has he been living on for a week did the starving men feed him from their dire poverty the second mates boat out of water again showing that they overdrink their allowance the captain spoke pretty sharply to them it is true i have the remark in my old notebook i got it of the third mate in the hospital at honolulu but there is not room for it here and it is too combustible anyway besides the third mate admired it and what he admired he was likely to enhance  they were still watching hopefully for ships the captain was a thoughtful man and probably did not disclose on them that that was substantially a waste of time in this latitude the horizon is filled with little upright clouds that look very much like ships mr ferguson saved three bottles of brandy from his private stores when he left the ship and the liquor came good in these days the captain serves out two tablespoonfuls of brandy and waterhalf and halfto our crew he means the watch that is on duty they stood regular watchesfour hours on and four off the chief mate was an excellent officera selfpossessed resolute fine allround man the diarist makes the following notethere is character in it i offered one bottle of brandy to the chief mate but he declined saying he could keep the afterboat quiet and we had not enough for all    henry fergusons diary

lightning and thunder      and wind and rain in my life before  that boys diary is of the economical sort that a person might properly be expected to keep in such circumstancesand be forgiven for the economy too his brother perishing of consumption hunger thirst blazing heat drowning rains loss of sleep lack of exercise was persistently faithful and circumstantial with his diary from the first day to the lastan instance of noteworthy fidelity and resolution in spite of the tossing and plunging boat he wrote it close and fine in a hand as easy to read as print they cant seem to get north of 7 degrees n they are still there the next day       diary entry may 12  a good rain last night and we caught a good      deal though not enough to fill up our tank pails c  our object      is to get out of these doldrums but it seems as if we cannot do it      today we have had it very variable and hope we are on the northern      edge thought we are not much above 7 degrees  this morning we all      thought we had made out a sail but it was one of those deceiving      clouds  rained a good deal today making all hands wet and      uncomfortable we filled up pretty nearly all our waterpots      however  i hope we may have a fine night for the captain certainly      wants rest and while there is any danger of squalls or danger of      any kind he is always on hand  i never would have believed that      open boats such as ours with their loads could live in some of the      seas we have had  during the night 12th13th the cry of a ship brought us to our feet it seemed to be the glimmer of a vessels signallantern rising out of the curve of the sea there was a season of breathless hope while they stood watching with their hands shading their eyes and their hearts in their throats then the promise failed the light was a rising star it is a long time agothirtytwo yearsand it doesnt matter now yet one is sorry for their disappointment thought often of those at home today and of the disappointment they will feel next sunday at not hearing from us by telegraph from san francisco it will be many weeks yet before the telegram is received and it will come as a thunderclap of joy then and with the seeming of a miracle for it will raise from the grave men mourned as dead today our rations were reduced to a quarter of a biscuit a meal with about half a pint of water this is on may 13 with more than a month of voyaging in front of them yet however as they do not know that we are all feeling pretty cheerful  in the afternoon of the 14th there was a thunderstorm which toward night seemed to close in around us on every side making it very dark and squally our situation is becoming more and more desperate for they were making very little northing and every day diminishes our small stock of provisions they realise that the boats must soon separate and each fight for its own life towing the quarterboats is a hindering business  that night and next day light and baffling winds and but little progress hard to bear that persistent standing still and the food wasting away everything in a perfect sop and all so cramped and no change of clothes soon the sun comes out and roasts them joe caught another dolphin today in his maw we found a flyingfish and two skipjacks there is an event now which rouses an enthusiasm of hope a landbird arrives it rests on the yard for awhile and they can look at it all they like and envy it and thank it for its message as a subject of talk it is beyond pricea fresh new topic for tongues tired to death of talking upon a single theme shall we ever see the land again and when is the bird from clipperton rock they hope so and they take heart of grace to believe so as it turned out the bird had no message it merely came to mock  may 16 the cock still lives and daily carols forth his praise it will be a rainy night but i do not care if we can fill up our waterbutts  on the 17th one of those majestic spectres of the deep a waterspout stalked by them and they trembled for their lives young henry set it down in his scanty journal with the judicious comment that it might have been a fine sight from a ship  from captain mitchells log for this day only half a bushel of breadcrumbs left and a month to wander the seas yet  it rained all night and all day everybody uncomfortable now came a swordfish chasing a bonito and the poor thing seeking help and friends took refuge under the rudder the big swordfish kept hovering around scaring everybody badly the mens mouths watered for him for he would have made a whole banquet but no one dared to touch him of course for he would sink a boat promptly if molested providence protected the poor bonito from the cruel swordfish this was just and right providence next befriended the shipwrecked sailors they got the bonito this was also just and right but in the distribution of mercies the swordfish himself got overlooked he now went away to muse over these subtleties probably the men in all the boats seem pretty well the feeblest of the sick ones not able for a long time to stand his watch on board the ship is wonderfully recovered this is the third mates detected portyghee that raised the family of abscesses       passed a most awful night  rained hard nearly all the time and      blew in squalls accompanied by terrific thunder and lightning from      all points of the compasshenrys log       most awful night i ever witnessedcaptains log  latitude may 18 11 degrees 11 minutes so they have averaged but forty miles of northing a day during the fortnight further talk of separating too bad but it must be done for the safety of the whole at first i never dreamed but now hardly shut my eyes for a catnap without conjuring up something or otherto be accounted for by weakness i suppose but for their disaster they think they would be arriving in san francisco about this time i should have liked to send bthe telegram for her birthday this was a young sister  on the 19th the captain called up the quarterboats and said one would have to go off on its own hook the longboat could no longer tow both of them the second mate refused to go but the chief mate was ready in fact he was always ready when there was a mans work to the fore he took the second mates boat six of its crew elected to remain and two of his own crew came with him nine in the boat now including himself he sailed away and toward sunset passed out of sight the diarist was sorry to see him go it was natural one could have better spared the portyghee after thirtytwo years i find my prejudice against this portyghee reviving his very looks have long passed out of my memory but no matter i am coming to hate him as religiously as ever water will now be a scarce article for as we get out of the doldrums we shall get showers only now and then in the trades this life is telling severely on my strength henry holds out firstrate henry did not start well but under hardships he improved straight along  latitude sunday may 20 12 degrees 0 minutes 9 seconds they ought to be well out of the doldrums now but they are not no breezethe longedfor trades still missing they are still anxiously watching for a sail but they have only visions of ships that come to naughtthe shadow without the substance the second mate catches a booby this afternoon a bird which consists mainly of feathers but as they have no other meat it will go well  may 21 they strike the trades at last the second mate catches three more boobies and gives the longboat one dinner half a can of mincemeat divided up and served around which strengthened us somewhat they have to keep a man bailing all the time the hole knocked in the boat when she was launched from the burning ship was never efficiently mended heading about northwest now they hope they have easting enough to make some of these indefinite isles failing that they think they will be in a better position to be picked up it was an infinitely slender chance but the captain probably refrained from mentioning that  the next day is to be an eventful one       diary entry may 22  last night wind headed us off so that part      of the time we had to steer eastsoutheast and then      westnorthwest and so on  this morning we were all startled by a      cry of sail ho sure enough we could see it  and for a time we      cut adrift from the second mates boat and steered so as to      attract its attention  this was about halfpast five am  after      sailing in a state of high excitement for almost twenty minutes we      made it out to be the chief mates boat  of course we were glad to      see them and have them report all well but still it was a bitter      disappointment to us all  now that we are in the trades it seems      impossible to make northing enough to strike the isles  we have      determined to do the best we can and get in the route of vessels      such being the determination it became necessary to cast off the      other boat which after a good deal of unpleasantness was done      we again dividing water and stores and taking cox into our boat      this makes our number fifteen  the second mates crew wanted to      all get in with us and cast the other boat adrift  it was a very      painful separation  so these isles that they have struggled for so long and so hopefully have to be given up what with lying birds that come to mock and isles that are but a dream and visions of ships that come to naught it is a pathetic time they are having with much heartbreak in it it was odd that the vanished boat three days lost to sight in that vast solitude should appear again but it brought coxwe cant be certain why but if it hadnt the diarist would never have seen the land again       diary entry our chances as we go west increase in regard to being      picked up but each day our scanty fare is so much reduced  without      the fish turtle and birds sent us i do not know how we should      have got along  the other day i offered to read prayers morning and      evening for the captain and last night commenced  the men      although of various nationalities and religions are very attentive      and always uncovered  may god grant my weak endeavour its issue       latitude may 24 14 degrees 18 minutes n  five oysters apiece for      dinner and three spoonfuls of juice a gill of water and a piece of      biscuit the size of a silver dollar  we are plainly getting      weakergod have mercy upon us all that night heavy seas break      over the weather side and make everybody wet and uncomfortable      besides requiring constant baling  next day nothing particular happened perhaps some of us would have regarded it differently passed a spar but not near enough to see what it was they saw some whales blow there were flyingfish skimming the seas but none came aboard misty weather with fine rain very penetrating  latitude may 26 15 degrees 50 minutes they caught a flyingfish and a booby but had to eat them raw the men grow weaker and i think despondent they say very little though and so to all the other imaginable and unimaginable horrors silence is addedthe muteness and brooding of coming despair it seems our best chance to get in the track of ships with the hope that some one will run near enough to our speck to see it he hopes the other boards stood west and have been picked up they will never be heard of again in this world       diary entry sunday may 27 latitude 16 degrees 0 minutes 5      seconds longitude by chronometer 117 degrees 22 minutes  our      fourth sunday  when we left the ship we reckoned on having about      ten days supplies and now we hope to be able by rigid economy to      make them last another week if possible1  last night the sea was      comparatively quiet but the wind headed us off to about      westnorthwest which has been about our course all day today      another flyingfish came aboard last night and one more today      both small ones  no birds  a booby is a great catch and a good      large one makes a small dinner for the fifteen of usthat is of      course as dinners go in the hornets longboat  tried this      morning to read the full service to myself with the communion but      found it too much am too weak and get sleepy and cannot give      strict attention so i put off half till this afternoon  i trust      god will hear the prayers gone up for us at home today and      graciously answer them by sending us succour and help in this our      season of deep distress  the next day was a good day for seeing a ship but none was seen the diarist still feels pretty well though very weak his brother henry bears up and keeps his strength the best of any on board i do not feel despondent at all for i fully trust that the almighty will hear our and the home prayers and he who suffers not a sparrow to fall sees and cares for us his creatures  considering the situation and circumstances the record for next day may 29 is one which has a surprise in it for those dull people who think that nothing but medicines and doctors can cure the sick a little starvation can really do more for the average sick man than can the best medicines and the best doctors i do not mean a restricted diet i mean total abstention from food for one or two days i speak from experience starvation has been my cold and fever doctor for fifteen years and has accomplished a cure in all instances the third mate told me in honolulu that the portyghee had lain in his hammock for months raising his family of abscesses and feeding like a cannibal we have seen that in spite of dreadful weather deprivation of sleep scorching drenching and all manner of miseries thirteen days of starvation wonderfully recovered him there were four sailors down sick when the ship was burned twentyfive days of pitiless starvation have followed and now we have this curious record all the men are hearty and strong even the ones that were down sick are well except poor peter when i wrote an article some months ago urging temporary abstention from food as a remedy for an inactive appetite and for disease i was accused of jesting but i was in earnest we are all wonderfully well and strong comparatively speaking on this day the starvation regime drew its belt a couple of buckleholes tighter the bread ration was reduced from the usual piece of cracker the size of a silver dollar to the half of that and one meal was abolished from the daily three this will weaken the men physically but if there are any diseases of an ordinary sort left in them they will disappear       two quarts breadcrumbs left onethird of a ham three small cans      of oysters and twenty gallons of watercaptains log  the hopeful tone of the diaries is persistent it is remarkable look at the map and see where the boat is latitude 16 degrees 44 minutes longitude 119 degrees 20 minutes it is more than two hundred miles west of the revillagigedo islands so they are quite out of the question against the trades rigged as this boat is the nearest land available for such a boat is the american group six hundred and fifty miles away westward still there is no note of surrender none even of discouragement yet may 30 we have now left one can of oysters three pounds of raisins one can of soup onethird of a ham three pints of biscuitcrumbs  and fifteen starved men to live on it while they creep and crawl six hundred and fifty miles somehow i feel much encouraged by this change of course west by north which we have made today six hundred and fifty miles on a hatful of provisions let us be thankful even after thirtytwo years that they are mercifully ignorant of the fact that it isnt six hundred and fifty that they must creep on the hatful but twentytwo hundred  isnt the situation romantic enough just as it stands no providence added a startling detail pulling an oar in that boat for common seamans wages was a banished dukedanish we hear no more of him just that mention that is all with the simple remark added that he is one of our best mena high enough compliment for a duke or any other man in those manhoodtesting circumstances with that little glimpse of him at his oar and that fine word of praise he vanishes out of our knowledge for all time for all time unless he should chance upon this note and reveal himself  the last day of may is come and now there is a disaster to report think of it reflect upon it and try to understand how much it means when you sit down with your family and pass your eye over your breakfasttable yesterday there were three pints of breadcrumbs this morning the little bag is found open and some of the crumbs are missing we dislike to suspect any one of such a rascally act but there is no question that this grave crime has been committed two days will certainly finish the remaining morsels god grant us strength to reach the american group the third mate told me in honolulu that in these days the men remembered with bitterness that the portyghee had devoured twentytwo days rations while he lay waiting to be transferred from the burning ship and that now they cursed him and swore an oath that if it came to cannibalism he should be the first to suffer for the rest       diary entry the captain has lost his glasses and therefore he      cannot read our pocket prayerbooks as much as i think he would      like though he is not familiar with them  further of the captain he is a good man and has been most kind to usalmost fatherly he says that if he had been offered the command of the ship sooner he should have brought his two daughters with him it makes one shudder yet to think how narrow an escape it was       the two meals rations a day are as follows fourteen raisins and a      piece of cracker the size of a penny for tea a gill of water and a      piece of ham and a piece of bread each the size of a penny for      breakfastcaptains log

and the      day and really it is most marvellous how every morsel that passes      our lips is blessed to us  it makes me think daily of the miracle      of the loaves and fishes  henry keeps up wonderfully which is a      great consolation to me  i somehow have great confidence and hope      that our afflictions will soon be ended though we are running      rapidly across the track of both outward and inward bound vessels      and away from them our chief hope is a whaler manofwar or some      australian ship  the isles we are steering for are put down in      bowditch but on my map are said to be doubtful  god grant they may      be there       hardest day yetcaptains log  doubtful it was worse than that a week later they sailed straight over them       diary entry june 2  latitude

am  very wet the sea breaking      over us in frequent sluices and soaking everything aft      particularly  all day the sea has been very high and it is a      wonder that we are not swamped  heaven grant that it may go down      this evening  our suspense and condition are getting terrible  i      managed this morning to crawl more than step to the forward end of      the boat and was surprised to find that i was so weak especially      in the legs and knees  the sun has been out again and i have dried      some things and hope for a better night       june 4  latitude 17 degrees 6 minutes longitude 131 degrees 30      minutes  shipped hardly any seas last night and today the sea has      gone down somewhat although it is still too high for comfort as we      have an occasional reminder that water is wet  the sun has been out      all day and so we have had a good drying  i have been trying for      the last ten or twelve days to get a pair of drawers dry enough to      put on and today at last succeeded  i mention this to show the      state in which we have lived  if our chronometer is anywhere near      right we ought to see the american isles tomorrow or next day  if      there are not there we have only the chance for a few days of a      stray ship for we cannot eke out the provisions more than five or      six days longer and our strength is failing very fast  i was much      surprised today to note how my legs have wasted away above my      knees they are hardly thicker than my upper arm used to be  still      i trust in gods infinite mercy and feel sure he will do what is      best for us  to survive as we have done thirtytwo days in an      open boat with only about ten days fair provisions for thirtyone      men in the first place and these divided twice

 diary entry june 5  quiet night and pretty comfortable day      though our sail and block show signs of failing and need taking      downwhich latter is something of a job as it requires the      climbing of the mast  we also had news from forward there being      discontent and some threatening complaints of unfair allowances      etc all as unreasonable as foolish still these things bid us be      on our guard  i am getting miserably weak but try to keep up the      best i can  if we cannot find those isles we can only try to make      northwest and get in the track of sandwich islandbound vessels      living as best we can in the meantime  today we changed to one      meal and that at about noon with a small ration or water at 8 or 9      am another at 12 am and a third at

far away and out of sight several days in the chief mates boat if he had not come back the captain and the two young passengers might have been slain now by these sailors who were becoming crazed through their sufferings        note secretly passed by henry to his brother       cox told me last night that there is getting to be a good deal of      ugly talk among the men against the captain and us aft  they say      that the captain is the cause of all that he did not try to save      the ship at all nor to get provisions and that even would not let      the men put in some they had and that partiality is shown us in      apportioning our rations aft asked cox the other day if he      would starve first or eat human flesh  cox answered he would      starve then told him he would only be killing himself  if we      do not find those islands we would do well to prepare for anything    is the loudest of all        reply       we can depend on i think and and cox can we not

am  an attempt to lower it proved      abortive  first the third mate tried and got up to the block and      fastened a temporary arrangement to reeve the halyards through but      had to come down weak and almost fainting before finishing then      joe tried and after twice ascending fixed it and brought down the      block but it was very exhausting work and afterward he was good      for nothing all day  the clueiron which we are trying to make      serve for the broken block works however very indifferently and      will i am afraid soon cut the rope  it is very necessary to get

looked like them  at noon we      decided to abandon looking any farther for them and tonight haul a      little more northerly so as to get in the way of sandwich island      vessels which fortunately come down pretty well this waysay to      latitude 19 degrees to 20 degrees to get the benefit of the      tradewinds  of course all the westing we have made is gain and i      hope the chronometer is wrong in our favour for i do not see how      any such delicate instrument can keep good time with the constant      jarring and thumping we get from the sea  with the strong trade we      have i hope that a week from sunday will put us in sight of the      sandwich islands if we are not safe by that time by being picked      up  it is twelve hundred miles to the sandwich islands the provisions are virtually exhausted but not the perishing diarists pluck       diary entry my cough troubled me a good deal last night and      therefore i got hardly any sleep at all  still i make out pretty      well and should not complain  yesterday the third mate mended the      block and this pm  the sail after some difficulty was got down      and harry got to the top of the mast and rove the halyards through      after some hardship so that it now works easy and well  this      getting up the mast is no easy matter at any time with the sea we      have and is very exhausting in our present state  we could only      reward harry by an extra ration of water  we have made good time      and course today  heading her up however makes the boat ship      seas and keeps us all wet

think we have got ten      days supply at our present rate of allowance  this with what      nourishment we can get from bootlegs and such chewable matter we      hope will enable us to weather it out till we get to the sandwich      islands or sailing in the meantime in the track of vessels      thither bound be picked up  my hope is in the latter for in all      human probability i cannot stand

seems to be      with us in everything we do and has preserved this boat      miraculously for since we left the ship we have sailed considerably      over three thousand miles which taking into consideration our      meagre stock of provisions is almost unprecedented  as yet i do      not feel the stint of food so much as i do that of water  even      henry who is naturally a good waterdrinker can save half of his      allowance from time to time when i cannot  my diseased throat may      have something to do with that however  nothing is now left which by any flattery can be called food but they must manage somehow for five days more for at noon they have still eight hundred miles to go it is a race for life now  this is no time for comments or other interruptions from

taste of food today      and we have got left a little meat and the remainder of the bone for      tomorrow  certainly never was there such a sweet knuckleone or      one that was so thoroughly appreciated  i do not know that i      feel any worse than i did last sunday notwithstanding the reduction      of diet and i trust that we may all have strength given us to      sustain the sufferings and hardships of the coming week  we      estimate that we are within seven hundred miles of the sandwich      islands and that our average daily is somewhat over a hundred      miles so that our hopes have some foundation in reason  heaven      send we may all live to see land       june 11  ate the meat and rind of our hambone and have the bone      and the greasy cloth from around the ham left to eat tomorrow  god      send us birds or fish and let us not perish of hunger or be      brought to the dreadful alternative of feeding on human flesh  as i      feel now i do not think anything could persuade me but you cannot      tell what you will do when you are reduced by hunger and your mind      wandering  i hope and pray we can make out to reach the islands      before we get to this strait but we have one or two desperate men      aboard though they are quiet enough now  it is my firm trust and      belief that we are going to be saved       all food gonecaptains log3

little smoke i think does some little good but i dont      know       june 14  hunger does not pain us much but we are dreadfully weak      our water is getting frightfully low  god grant we may see land      soon  nothing to eat but feel better than i did yesterday  toward      evening saw a magnificent rainbowthe first we had seen  captain      said cheer up boys its a prophecyits the bow of promise       june 15  god be for ever praised for his infinite mercy  land in      sight  rapidly neared it and soon were sure of it  two noble      kanakas swam out and took the boat ashore  we were joyfully      received by two white menmr jones and his steward charleyand a      crowd of native men women and children  they treated us      splendidlyaided us and carried us up the bank and brought us      water poi bananas and green coconuts but the white men took care      of us and prevented those who would have eaten too much from doing      so  everybody overjoyed to see us and all sympathy expressed in      faces deeds and words  we were then helped up to the house and      help we needed  mr jones and charley are the only white men here      treated us splendidly  gave us first about a teaspoonful of spirits      in water and then to each a cup of warm tea with a little bread      takes every care of us  gave us later another cup of tea and bread      the same and then let us go to rest  it is the happiest day of my      life  god in his mercy has heard our prayer  everybody is so      kind  words cannot tell       june 16  mr jones gave us a delightful bed and we surely had a      good nights rest but not sleepwe were too happy to sleep would      keep the reality and not let it turn to a delusiondreaded that we      might wake up and find ourselves in the boat again   it is an amazing adventure there is nothing of its sort in history that surpasses it in impossibilities made possible in one extraordinary detailthe survival of every person in the boatit probably stands alone in the history of adventures of its kinds usually merely a part of a boats company surviveofficers mainly and other educated and tenderlyreared men unused to hardship and heavy labour the untrained roughlyreared hard workers succumb but in this case even the rudest and roughest stood the privations and miseries of the voyage almost as well as did the collegebred young brothers and the captain i mean physically the minds of most of the sailors broke down in the fourth week and went to temporary ruin but physically the endurance exhibited was astonishing those men did not survive by any merit of their own of course but by merit of the character and intelligence of the captain they lived by the mastery of his spirit without him they would have been children without a nurse they would have exhausted their provisions in a week and their pluck would not have lasted even as long as the provisions  the boat came near to being wrecked at the last as it approached the shore the sail was let go and came down with a run then the captain saw that he was drifting swiftly toward an ugly reef and an effort was made to hoist the sail again but it could not be done the mens strength was wholly exhausted they could not even pull an oar they were helpless and death imminent it was then that they were discovered by the two kanakas who achieved the rescue they swam out and manned the boat and piloted her through a narrow and hardly noticeable break in the reefthe only break in it in a stretch of thirtyfive miles the spot where the landing was made was the only one in that stretch where footing could have been found on the shore everywhere else precipices came sheer down into forty fathoms of water also in all that stretch this was the only spot where anybody lived  within ten days after the landing all the men but one were up and creeping about properly they ought to have killed themselves with the food of the last few dayssome of them at any ratemen who had freighted their stomachs with strips of leather from old boots and with chips from the butter cask a freightage which they did not get rid of by digestion but by other means the captain and the two passengers did not eat strips and chips as the sailors did but scraped the bootleather and the wood and made a pulp of the scrapings by moistening them with water the third mate told me that the boots were old and full of holes then added thoughtfully but the holes digested the best speaking of digestion here is a remarkable thing and worth nothing during this strange voyage and for a while afterward on shore the bowels of some of the men virtually ceased from their functions in some cases there was no action for twenty and thirty days and in one case for fortyfour sleeping also came to be rare yet the men did very well without it during many days the captain did not sleep at alltwentyone i think on one stretch  when the landing was made all the men were successfully protected from overeating except the portyghee he escaped the watch and ate an incredible number of bananas a hundred and fiftytwo the third mate said but this was undoubtedly an exaggeration i think it was a hundred and fiftyone he was already nearly half full of leather it was hanging out of his ears i do not state this on the third mates authority for we have seen what sort of a person he was i state it on my own the portyghee ought to have died of course and even now it seems a pity that he didnt but he got well and as early as any of them and all full of leather too the way he was and buttertimber and handkerchiefs and bananas some of the men did eat handkerchiefs in those last days also socks and he was one of them  it is to the credit of the men that they did not kill the rooster that crowed so gallantly mornings he lived eighteen days and then stood up and stretched his neck and made a brave weak effort to do his duty once more and died in the act it is a picturesque detail and so is that rainbow toothe only one seen in the fortythree daysraising its triumphal arch in the skies for the sturdy fighters to sail under to victory and rescue  with ten days provisions captain josiah mitchell performed this memorable voyage of fortythree days and eight hours in an open boat sailing four thousand miles in reality and thirtythree hundred and sixty by direct courses and brought every man safe to land a bright simplehearted unassuming plucky and most companionable man i walked the deck with him twentyeight dayswhen i was not copying diariesand i remember him with reverent honour if he is alive he is eightysix years old now  if i remember rightly samuel ferguson died soon after we reached san francisco i do not think he lived to see his home again his disease had been seriously aggravated by his hardships  for a time it was hoped that the two quarterboats would presently be heard of but this hope suffered disappointment they went down with all on board no doubt not even sparing that knightly chief mate  the authors of the diaries allowed me to copy them exactly as they were written and the extracts that i have given are without any smoothing over or revision these diaries are finely modest and unaffected and with unconscious and unintentional art they rise toward the climax with graduated and gathering force and swing and dramatic intensity they sweep you along with a cumulative rush and when the cry rings out at last land in sight your heart is in your mouth and for a moment you think it is you that have been saved the last two paragraphs are not improvable by anybodys art they are literary gold and their very pauses and uncompleted sentences have in them an eloquence not reachable by any words  the interest of this story is unquenchable it is of the sort that time cannot decay i have not looked at the diaries for thirtytwo years but i find that they have lost nothing in that time lost they have gained for by some subtle law all tragic human experiences gain in pathos by the perspective of time we realize this when in naples we stand musing over the poor pompeian mother lost in the historic storm of volcanic ashes eighteen centuries ago who lies with her child gripped close to her breast trying to save it and whose despair and grief have been preserved for us by the fiery envelope which took her life but eternalized her form and features she moves us she haunts us she stays in our thoughts for many days we do not know why for she is nothing to us she has been nothing to anyone for eighteen centuries whereas of the like case today we should say poor thing it is pitiful and forget it in an hour  1 there are nineteen days of voyaging ahead yetmt  2 six days to sail yet neverthelessmt  3 it was at this time discovered that the crazed sailors had gotten the delusion that the captain had a million dollars in gold concealed aft and they were conspiring to kill him and the two passengers and seize itmt       at the appetitecure  this establishments name is hochberghaus it is in bohemia a short days journey from vienna and being in the austrian empire is of course a health resort the empire is made up of health resorts it distributes health to the whole world its waters are all medicinal they are bottled and sent throughout the earth the natives themselves drink beer this is selfsacrifice apparentlybut outlanders who have drunk vienna beer have another idea about it particularly the pilsner which one gets in a small cellar up an obscure back lane in the first bezirkthe name has escaped me but the place is easily found you inquire for the greek church and when you get to it go right along bythe next house is that little beermill it is remote from all traffic and all noise it is always sunday there there are two small rooms with low ceilings supported by massive arches the arches and ceilings are whitewashed otherwise the rooms would pass for cells in the dungeons of a bastile the furniture is plain and cheap there is no ornamentation anywhere yet it is a heaven for the selfsacrificers for the beer there is incomparable there is nothing like it elsewhere in the world in the first room you will find twelve or fifteen ladies and gentlemen of civilian quality in the other one a dozen generals and ambassadors one may live in vienna many months and not hear of this place but having once heard of it and sampled it the sampler will afterward infest it  however this is all incidentala mere passing note of gratitude for blessings receivedit has nothing to do with my subject my subject is health resorts all unhealthy people ought to domicile themselves in vienna and use that as a base making flights from time to time to the outlying resorts according to need a flight to marienbad to get rid of fat a flight to carlsbad to get rid of rheumatism a flight to kalteneutgeben to take the water cure and get rid of the rest of the diseases it is all so handy you can stand in vienna and toss a biscuit into kaltenleutgeben with a twelveinch gun you can run out thither at any time of the day you go by phenomenally slow trains and yet inside of an hour you have exchanged the glare and swelter of the city for wooded hills and shady forest paths and soft cool airs and the music of birds and the repose and the peace of paradise  and there are plenty of other health resorts at your service and convenient to get at from vienna charming places all of them vienna sits in the centre of a beautiful world of mountains with now and then a lake and forests in fact no other city is so fortunately situated  there is an abundance of health resorts as i have said among them this placehochberghaus it stands solitary on the top of a densely wooded mountain and is a building of great size it is called the appetite anstallt and people who have lost their appetites come here to get them restored when i arrived i was taken by professor haimberger to his consultingroom and questioned  it is six oclock when did you eat last  at noon  what did you eat  next to nothing  what was on the table  the usual things  chops chickens vegetables and so on  yes but dont mention themi cant bear it  are you tired of them  oh utterly i wish i might never hear of them again  the mere sight of food offends you does it  more it revolts me  the doctor considered awhile then got out a long menu and ran his eye slowly down it  i think said he that what you need to eat isbut here choose for yourself  i glanced at the list and my stomach threw a handspring of all the barbarous layouts that were ever contrived this was the most atrocious at the top stood tough underdone overdue tripe garnished with garlic halfway down the bill stood young cat old cat scrambled cat at the bottom stood sailorboots softened with tallowserved raw the wide intervals of the bill were packed with dishes calculated to gag a cannibal i said  doctor it is not fair to joke over so serious a case as mine i came here to get an appetite not to throw away the remnant thats left  he said gravely i am not joking why should i joke  but i cant eat these horrors  why not  he said it with a naivete that was admirable whether it was real or assumed  why not becausewhy doctor for months i have seldom been able to endure anything more substantial than omelettes and custards these unspeakable dishes of yours  oh you will come to like them they are very good and you must eat them it is a rule of the place and is strict i cannot permit any departure from it  i said smiling well then doctor you will have to permit the departure of the patient i am going  he looked hurt and said in a way which changed the aspect of things  i am sure you would not do me that injustice i accepted you in good faithyou will not shame that confidence this appetitecure is my whole living if you should go forth from it with the sort of appetite which you now have it could become known and you can see yourself that people would say my cure failed in your case and hence can fail in other cases you will not go you will not do me this hurt  i apologised and said i would stay  that is right i was sure you would not go it would take the food from my familys mouths  would they mind that do they eat these fiendish things  they my family his eyes were full of gentle wonder of course not  oh they dont do you  certainly not  i see its another case of a physician who doesnt take his own medicine  i dont need it it is six hours since you lunched will you have supper nowor later  i am not hungry but now is as good a time as any and i would like to be done with it and have it off my mind it is about my usual time and regularity is commanded by all the authorities yes i will try to nibble a little nowi wish a light horsewhipping would answer instead  the professor handed me that odious menu  chooseor will you have it later  oh dear me show me to my room i forgot your hard rule  wait just a moment before you finally decide there is another rule if you choose now the order will be filled at once but if you wait you will have to await my pleasure you cannot get a dish from that entire bill until i consent  all right show me to my room and send the cook to bed there is not going to be any hurry  the professor took me up one flight of stairs and showed me into a most inviting and comfortable apartment consisting of parlour bedchamber and bathroom  the front windows looked out over a farreaching spread of green glades and valleys and tumbled hills clothed with forestsa noble solitude unvexed by the fussy world in the parlour were many shelves filled with books the professor said he would now leave me to myself and added  smoke and read as much as you please drink all the water you like when you get hungry ring and give your order and i will decide whether it shall be filled or not yours is a stubborn bad case and i think the first fourteen dishes in the bill are each and all too delicate for its needs i ask you as a favour to restrain yourself and not call for them  restrain myself is it give yourself no uneasiness you are going to save money by me the idea of coaxing a sick mans appetite back with this buzzardfare is clear insanity  i said it with bitterness for i felt outraged by this calm cold talk over these heartless new engines of assassination the doctor looked grieved but not offended he laid the bill of fare of the commode at my beds head so that it would be handy and said  yours is not the worst case i have encountered by any means still it is a bad one and requires robust treatment therefore i shall be gratified if you will restrain yourself and skip down to no 15 and begin with that  then he left me and i began to undress for i was dogtired and very sleepy i slept fifteen hours and woke up finely refreshed at ten the next morning vienna coffee it was the first thing i thought ofthat unapproachable luxurythat sumptuous coffeehouse coffee compared with which all other european coffee and all american hotel coffee is mere fluid poverty i rang and ordered it also vienna bread that delicious invention the servant spoke through the wicket in the door and saidbut you know what he said he referred me to the bill of fare i allowed him to goi had no further use for him  after the bath i dressed and started for a walk and got as far as the door it was locked on the outside i rang and the servant came and explained that it was another rule the seclusion of the patient was required until after the first meal i had not been particularly anxious to get out before but it was different now being locked in makes a person wishful to get out i soon began to find it difficult to put in the time at two oclock i had been twentysix hours without food i had been growing hungry for some time i recognised that i was not only hungry now but hungry with a strong adjective in front of it yet i was not hungry enough to face the bill of fare  i must put in the time somehow i would read and smoke i did it hour by hour the books were all of one breedshipwrecks people lost in deserts people shut up in cavedin mines people starving in besieged cities i read about all the revolting dishes that ever famishing men had stayed their hunger with during the first hours these things nauseated me hours followed in which they did not so affect me still other hours followed in which i found myself smacking my lips over some tolerably infernal messes when i had been without food fortyfive hours i ran eagerly to the bell and ordered the second dish in the bill which was a sort of dumplings containing a compost made of caviar and tar  it was refused me during the next fifteen hours i visited the bell every now and then and ordered a dish that was further down the list always a refusal but i was conquering prejudice after prejudice right along i was making sure progress i was creeping up on no 15 with deadly certainty and my heart beat faster and faster my hopes rose higher and higher  at last when food had not passed my lips for sixty hours victory was mine and i ordered no 15  softboiled spring chickenin the egg six dozen hot and fragrant  in fifteen minutes it was there and the doctor along with it rubbing his hands with joy he said with great excitement  its a cure its a cure i knew i could do it dear sir my grand system never failednever youve got your appetite backyou know you have say it and make me happy  bring on your carrioni can eat anything in the bill  oh this is noble this is splendidbut i knew i could do it the system never fails how are the birds  never was anything so delicious in the world and yet as a rule i dont care for game but dont interrupt me donti cant spare my mouth i really cant  then the doctor said  the cure is perfect there is no more doubt nor danger let the poultry alone i can trust you with a beefsteak now  the beefsteak cameas much as a basketful of itwith potatoes and vienna bread and coffee and i ate a meal then that was worth all the costly preparation i had made for it and dripped tears of gratitude into the gravy all the timegratitude to the doctor for putting a little plain commonsense into me when i had been empty of it so many many years   ii  thirty years ago haimberger went off on a long voyage in a sailingship there were fifteen passengers on board the tablefare was of the regulation pattern of the day at 7 in the morning a cup of bad coffee in bed at 9 breakfast bad coffee with condensed milk soggy rolls crackers salt fish at 1 pm luncheon cold tongue cold ham cold corned beef soggy cold rolls crackers 5 pm dinner thick pea soup salt fish hot corned beef and sour kraut boiled pork and beans pudding 9 till 11 pm supper tea with condensed milk cold tongue cold ham pickles seabiscuit pickled oysters pickled pigs feet grilled bones golden buck  at the end of the first week eating had ceased nibbling had taken its place the passengers came to the table but it was partly to put in the time and partly because the wisdom of the ages commanded them to be regular in their meals they were tired of the coarse and monotonous fare and took no interest in it had no appetite for it all day and every day they roamed the ship half hungry plagued by their gnawing stomachs moody untalkative miserable among them were three confirmed dyspeptics these became shadows in the course of three weeks there was also a bedridden invalid he lived on boiled rice he could not look at the regular dishes  now came shipwrecks and life in open boats with the usual paucity of food provisions ran lower and lower the appetites improved then when nothing was left but raw ham and the ration of that was down to two ounces a day per person the appetites were perfect at the end of fifteen days the dyspeptics the invalid and the most delicate ladies in the party were chewing sailorboots in ecstasy and only complaining because the supply of them was limited yet these were the same people who couldnt endure the ships tedious corned beef and sour kraut and other crudities they were rescued by an english vessel within ten days the whole fifteen were in as good condition as they had been when the shipwreck occurred  they had suffered no damage by their adventure said the professor  do you note that  yes  do you note it well  yesi think i do  but you dont you hesitate you dont rise to the importance of it i will say it againwith emphasisnot one of them suffered any damage  now i begin to see yes it was indeed remarkable  nothing of the kind it was perfectly natural there was no reason why they should suffer damage they were undergoing natures appetitecure the best and wisest in the world  is that where you got your idea  that is where i got it  it taught those people a valuable lesson  what makes you think that  why shouldnt i you seem to think it taught you one  that is nothing to the point i am not a fool  i see were they fools  they were human beings  is it the same thing  why do you ask you know it yourself as regards his healthand the rest of the thingsthe average man is what his environment and his superstitions have made him and their function is to make him an ass he cant add up three or four new circumstances together and perceive what they mean it is beyond him he is not capable of observing for himself he has to get everything at secondhand if what are miscalled the lower animals were as silly as man is they would all perish from the earth in a year  those passengers learned no lesson then  not a sign of it they went to their regular meals in the english ship and pretty soon they were nibbling againnibbling appetiteless disgusted with the food moody miserable half hungry their outraged stomachs cursing and swearing and whining and supplicating all day long and in vain for they were the stomachs of fools  then as i understand it your scheme is  quite simple dont eat until you are hungry if the food fails to taste good fails to satisfy you rejoice you comfort you dont eat again until you are very hungry then it will rejoice youand do you good too  and i am to observe no regularity as to hours  when you are conquering a bad appetiteno after it is conquered regularity is no harm so long as the appetite remains good as soon as the appetite wavers apply the corrective againwhich is starvation long or short according to the needs of the case  the best diet i supposei mean the wholesomest  all diets are wholesome some are wholesomer than others but all the ordinary diets are wholesome enough for the people who use them whether the food be fine or coarse it will taste good and it will nourish if a watch be kept upon the appetite and a little starvation introduced every time it weakens nansen was used to fine fare but when his meals were restricted to bearmeat months at a time he suffered no damage and no discomfort because his appetite was kept at par through the difficulty of getting his bearmeat regularly  but doctors arrange carefully considered and delicate diets for invalids  they cant help it the invalid is full of inherited superstitions and wont starve himself he believes it would certainly kill him  it would weaken him wouldnt it  nothing to hurt look at the invalids in our shipwreck they lived fifteen days on pinches of raw ham a suck at sailorboots and general starvation it weakened them but it didnt hurt them it put them in fine shape to eat heartily of hearty food and build themselves up to a condition of robust health but they did not know enough to profit by that they lost their opportunity they remained invalids it served them right do you know the trick that the healthresort doctors play  what is it  my system disguisedcovert starvation grapecure bathcure mudcureit is all the same the grape and the bath and the mud make a show and do a trifle of the workthe real work is done by the surreptitious starvation the patient accustomed to four meals and late hoursat both ends of the daynow consider what he has to do at a health resort he gets up at 6 in the morning eats one egg tramps up and down a promenade two hours with the other fools eats a butterfly slowly drinks a glass of filtered sewage that smells like a buzzards breath promenades another two hours but alone if you speak to him he says anxiously my wateri am walking off my waterplease dont interrupt and goes stumping along again eats a candied roseleaf lies at rest in the silence and solitude of his room for hours mustnt read mustnt smoke the doctor comes and feels of his heart now and his pulse and thumps his breast and his back and his stomach and listens for results through a penny flageolet then orders the mans bathhalf a degree reaumur cooler than yesterday after the bath another egg a glass of sewage at three or four in the afternoon and promenade solemnly with the other freaks dinner at 6half a doughnut and a cup of tea walk again halfpast 8 suppermore butterfly at 9 to bed six weeks of this regimethink of it it starves a man out and puts him in splendid condition it would have the same effect in london new york jerichoanywhere  how long does it take to put a person in condition here  it ought to take but a day or two but in fact it takes from one to six weeks according to the character and mentality of the patient  how is that  do you see that crowd of women playing football and boxing and jumping fences yonder they have been here six or seven weeks they were spectral poor weaklings when they came they were accustomed to nibbling at dainties and delicacies at set hours four times a day and they had no appetite for anything i questioned them and then locked them into their roomsthe frailest ones to starve nine or ten hours the others twelve or fifteen before long they began to beg and indeed they suffered a good deal they complained of nausea headache and so on it was good to see them eat when the time was up they could not remember when the devouring of a meal had afforded them such rapturethat was their word now then that ought to have ended their cure but it didnt they were free to go to any meals in the house and they chose their accustomed four within a day or two i had to interfere their appetites were weakening i made them knock out a meal that set them up again then they resumed the four i begged them to learn to knock out a meal themselves without waiting for me up to a fortnight ago they couldnt they really hadnt manhood enough but they were gaining it and now i think they are safe they drop out a meal every now and then of their own accord they are in fine condition now and they might safely go home i think but their confidence is not quite perfect yet so they are waiting awhile  other cases are different  oh yes sometimes a man learns the whole trick in a week learns to regulate his appetite and keep it in perfect order learns to drop out a meal with frequency and not mind it  but why drop the entire meal out why not a part of it  its a poor device and inadequate if the stomach doesnt call vigorouslywith a shout as you may sayit is better not to pester it but just give it a real rest some people can eat more meals than others and still thrive there are all sorts of people and all sorts of appetites i will show you a man presently who was accustomed to nibble at eight meals a day it was beyond the proper gait of his appetite by two i have got him down to six a day now and he is all right and enjoys life how many meals to you affect per day  formerlyfor twentytwo yearsa meal and a half during the past two years two and a half coffee and a roll at 9 luncheon at 1 dinner at 730 or 8  formerly a meal and a halfthat is coffee and a roll at 9 dinner in the evening nothing betweenis that it  yes  why did you add a meal  it was the familys idea they were uneasy they thought i was killing myself  you found a meal and a half per day enough all through the twentytwo years  plenty  your present poor condition is due to the extra meal drop it out you are trying to eat oftener than your stomach demands you dont gain you lose you eat less food now in a day on two and a half meals than you formerly ate on one and a half  truea good deal less for in those olds days my dinner was a very sizeable thing  put yourself on a single meal a day nowdinnerfor a few days till you secure a good sound regular trustworthy appetite then take to your one and a half permanently and dont listen to the family any more when you have any ordinary ailment particularly of a feverish sort eat nothing at all during twentyfour hours that will cure it it will cure the stubbornest cold in the head too no cold in the head can survive twentyfour hours unmodified starvation  i know it i have proved it many a time       concerning the jews  some months ago i published a magazine article1 descriptive of a remarkable scene in the imperial parliament in vienna since then i have received from jews in america several letters of inquiry they were difficult letters to answer for they were not very definite but at last i have received a definite one it is from a lawyer and he really asks the questions which the other writers probably believed they were asking by help of this text i will do the best i can to publicly answer this correspondent and also the othersat the same time apologising for having failed to reply privately the lawyers letter reads as follows       i have read stirring times in austria  one point in particular      is of vital import to not a few thousand people including myself      being a point about which i have often wanted to address a question      to some disinterested person  the show of military force in the      austrian parliament which precipitated the riots was not      introduced by any jew  no jew was a member of that body  no jewish      question was involved in the ausgleich or in the language      proposition  no jew was insulting anybody  in short no jew was      doing any mischief toward anybody whatsoever  in fact the jews      were the only ones of the nineteen different races in austria which      did not have a partythey are absolute nonparticipants  yet in      your article you say that in the rioting which followed all classes      of people were unanimous only on one thing viz in being against      the jews  now will you kindly tell me why in your judgment the      jews have thus ever been and are even now in these days of      supposed intelligence the butt of baseless vicious animosities      i dare say that for centuries there has been no more quiet      undisturbing and wellbehaving citizen as a class than that same      jew  it seems to me that ignorance and fanaticism cannot alone      account for these horrible and unjust persecutions       tell me therefore from your vantage point of cold view what in      your mind is the cause  can american jews do anything to correct it      either in america or abroad  will it ever come to an end  will a      jew be permitted to live honestly decently and peaceably like the      rest of mankind  what has become of the golden rule  i will begin by saying that if i thought myself prejudiced against the jew i should hold it fairest to leave this subject to a person not crippled in that way but i think i have no such prejudice a few years ago a jew observed to me that there was no uncourteous reference to his people in my books and asked how it happened it happened because the disposition was lacking i am quite sure that bar one i have no race prejudices and i think i have no colour prejudices nor caste prejudices nor creed prejudices indeed i know it i can stand any society all that i care to know is that a man is a human beingthat is enough for me he cant be any worse i have no special regard for satan but i can at least claim that i have no prejudice against him it may even be that i lean a little his way on account of his not having a fair show all religions issue bibles against him and say the most injurious things about him but we never hear his side we have none but the evidence for the prosecution and yet we have rendered the verdict to my mind this is irregular it is unenglish it is unamerican it is french without this precedent dreyfus could not have been condemned of course satan has some kind of a case it goes without saying it may be a poor one but that is nothing that can be said about any of us as soon as i can get at the facts i will undertake his rehabilitation myself if i can find an unpolitic publisher it is a thing which we ought to be willing to do for any one who is under a cloud we may not pay satan reverence for that would be indiscreet but we can at least respect his talents a person who has during all time maintained the imposing position of spiritual head of fourfifths of the human race and political head of the whole of it must be granted the possession of executive abilities of the loftiest order in his large presence the other popes and politicians shrink to midges for the microscope i would like to see him i would rather see him and shake him by the tail than any other member of the european concert in the present paper i shall allow myself to use the word jew as if it stood for both religion and race it is handy and besides that is what the term means to the general world  in the above letter one notes these points  1 the jew is a wellbehaved citizen  2 can ignorance and fanaticism alone account for his unjust treatment  3 can jews do anything to improve the situation  4 the jews have no party they are nonparticipants  5 will the persecution ever come to an end  6 what has become of the golden rule  point no 1we must grant proposition no 1 for several sufficient reasons the jew is not a disturber of the peace of any country even his enemies will concede that he is not a loafer he is not a sot he is not noisy he is not a brawler nor a rioter he is not quarrelsome in the statistics of crime his presence is conspicuously rarein all countries with murder and other crimes of violence he has but little to do he is a stranger to the hangman in the police courts daily long roll of assaults and drunk and disorderlies his name seldom appears that the jewish home is a home in the truest sense is a fact which no one will dispute the family is knitted together by the strongest affections its members show each other every due respect and reverence for the elders is an inviolate law of the house the jew is not a burden on the charities of the state nor of the city these could cease from their functions without affecting him when he is well enough he works when he is incapacitated his own people take care of him and not in a poor and stingy way but with a fine and large benevolence his race is entitled to be called the most benevolent of all the races of men a jewish beggar is not impossible perhaps such a thing may exist but there are few men that can say they have seen that spectacle the jew has been staged in many uncomplimentary forms but so far as i know no dramatist has done him the injustice to stage him as a beggar whenever a jew has real need to beg his people save him from the necessity of doing it the charitable institutions of the jews are supported by jewish money and amply the jews make no noise about it it is done quietly they do not nag and pester and harass us for contributions they give us peace and set us an examplean example which he have not found ourselves able to follow for by nature we are not free givers and have to be patiently and persistently hunted down in the interest of the unfortunate  these facts are all on the credit side of the proposition that the jew is a good and orderly citizen summed up they certify that he is quiet peaceable industrious unaddicted to high crimes and brutal dispositions that his family life is commendable that he is not a burden upon public charities that he is not a beggar that in benevolence he is above the reach of competition these are the very quintessentials of good citizenship if you can add that he is as honest as the average of his neighboursbut i think that question is affirmatively answered by the fact that he is a successful business man the basis of successful business is honesty a business cannot thrive where the parties to it cannot trust each other in the matter of numbers the jew counts for little in the overwhelming population of new york but that his honest counts for much is guaranteed by the fact that the immense wholesale business of broadway from the battery to union square is substantially in his hands  i suppose that the most picturesque example in history of a traders trust in his fellowtrader was one where it was not christian trusting christian but christian trusting jew that hessian duke who used to sell his subjects to george iii to fight george washington with got rich at it and byandby when the wars engendered by the french revolution made his throne too warm for him he was obliged to fly the country he was in a hurry and had to leave his earnings behind9000000 he had to risk the money with some one without security he did not select a christian but a jewa jew of only modest means but of high character a character so high that it left him lonesomerothschild of frankfort thirty years later when europe had become quiet and safe again the duke came back from overseas and the jew returned the loan with interest added2  the jew has his other side he has some discreditable ways though he has not a monopoly of them because he cannot get entirely rid of vexatious christian competition we have seen that he seldom transgresses the laws against crimes of violence indeed his dealings with courts are almost restricted to matters connected with commerce he has a reputation for various small forms of cheating and for practising oppressive usury and for burning himself out to get the insurance and for arranging cunning contracts which leave him an exit but lock the other man in and for smart evasions which find him safe and comfortable just within the strict letter of the law when court and jury know very well that he has violated the spirit of it he is a frequent and faithful and capable officer in the civil service but he is charged with an unpatriotic disinclination to stand by the flag as a soldierlike the christian quaker  now if you offset these discreditable features by the creditable ones summarised in a preceding paragraph beginning with the words these facts are all on the credit side and strike a balance what must the verdict be this i think that the merits and demerits being fairly weighed and measured on both sides the christian can claim no superiority over the jew in the matter of good citizenship  yet in all countries from the dawn of history the jew has been persistently and implacably hated and with frequency persecuted   point no 2can fanaticism alone account for this  years ago i used to think that it was responsible for nearly all of it but latterly i have come to think that this was an error indeed it is now my conviction that it is responsible for hardly any of it  in this connection i call to mind genesis chapter xlvii  we have all thoughtfullyor unthoughtfullyread the pathetic story of the years of plenty and the years of famine in egypt and how joseph with that opportunity made a corner in broken hearts and the crusts of the poor and human libertya corner whereby he took a nations money all away to the last penny took a nations live stock all away to the last hoof took a nations land away to the last acre then took the nation itself buying it for bread man by man woman by woman child by child till all were slaves a corner which took everything left nothing a corner so stupendous that by comparison with it the most gigantic corners in subsequent history are but baby things for it dealt in hundreds of millions of bushels and its profits were reckonable by hundreds of millions of dollars and it was a disaster so crushing that its effects have not wholly disappeared from egypt today more than three thousand years after the event  is it presumably that the eye of egypt was upon joseph the foreign jew all this time i think it likely was it friendly we must doubt it was joseph establishing a character for his race which would survive long in egypt and in time would his name come to be familiarly used to express that characterlike shylocks it is hardly to be doubted let us remember that this was centuries before the crucifixion  i wish to come down eighteen hundred years later and refer to a remark made by one of the latin historians i read it in a translation many years ago and it comes back to me now with force it was alluding to a time when people were still living who could have seen the saviour in the flesh christianity was so new that the people of rome had hardly heard of it and had but confused notions of what it was the substance of the remark was this some christians were persecuted in rome through error they being mistaken for jews  the meaning seems plain these pagans had nothing against christians but they were quite ready to persecute jews for some reason or other they hated a jew before they even knew what a christian was may i not assume then that the persecution of jews is a thing which antedates christianity and was not born of christianity i think so what was the origin of the feeling  when i was a boy in the back settlements of the mississippi valley where a gracious and beautiful sunday school simplicity and practicality prevailed the yankee citizen of the new england states was hated with a splendid energy but religion had nothing to do with it in a trade the yankee was held to be about five times the match of the westerner his shrewdness his insight his judgment his knowledge his enterprise and his formidable cleverness in applying these forces were frankly confessed and most competently cursed  in the cotton states after the war the simple and ignorant negroes made the crops for the white planter on shares the jew came down in force set up shop on the plantation supplied all the negros wants on credit and at the end of the season was proprietor of the negros share of the present crop and of part of his share of the next one before long the whites detested the jew and it is doubtful if the negro loved him  the jew is begin legislated out of russia the reason is not concealed the movement was instituted because the christian peasant and villager stood no chance against his commercial abilities he was always ready to lend money on a crop and sell vodka and other necessities of life on credit while the crop was growing when settlement day came he owned the crop and next year or year after he owned the farm like joseph  in the dull and ignorant english of johns time everybody got into debt to the jew he gathered all lucrative enterprises into his hands he was the king of commerce he was ready to be helpful in all profitable ways he even financed crusades for the rescue of the sepulchre to wipe out his account with the nation and restore business to its natural and incompetent channels he had to be banished the realm  for the like reasons spain had to banish him four hundred years ago and austria about a couple of centuries later  in all the ages christian europe has been oblige to curtail his activities if he entered upon a mechanical trade the christian had to retire from it if he set up as a doctor he was the best one and he took the business if he exploited agriculture the other farmers had to get at something else since there was no way to successfully compete with him in any vocation the law had to step in and save the christian from the poorhouse trade after trade was taken away from the jew by statute till practically none was left he was forbidden to engage in agriculture he was forbidden to practise law he was forbidden to practise medicine except among jews he was forbidden the handicrafts even the seats of learning and the schools of science had to be closed against this tremendous antagonist still almost bereft of employments he found ways to make money even ways to get rich also ways to invest his takings well for usury was not denied him in the hard conditions suggested the jew without brains could not survive and the jew with brains had to keep them in good training and well sharpened up or starve ages of restriction to the one tool which the law was not able to take from himhis brainhave made that tool singularly competent ages of compulsory disuse of his hands have atrophied them and he never uses them now this history has a very very commercial look a most sordid and practical commercial look the business aspect of a chinese cheaplabour crusade religious prejudices may account for one part of it but not for the other nine  protestants have persecuted catholics but they did not take their livelihoods away from them the catholics have persecuted the protestants with bloody and awful bitterness but they never closed agriculture and the handicrafts against them why was that that has the candid look of genuine religious persecution not a tradeunion boycott in a religious dispute  the jews are harried and obstructed in austria and germany and lately in france but england and america give them an open field and yet survive scotland offers them an unembarrassed field too but there are not many takers there are a few jews in glasgow and one in aberdeen but that is because they cant earn enough to get away the scotch pay themselves that compliment but it is authentic  i feel convinced that the crucifixion has not much to do with the worlds attitude toward the jew that the reasons for it are older than that event as suggested by egypts experience and by romes regret for having persecuted an unknown quantity called a christian under the mistaken impression that she was merely persecuting a jew merely a jewa skinned eel who was used to it presumably i am persuaded that in russia austria and germany ninetenths of the hostility to the jew comes from the average christians inability to compete successfully with the average jew in businessin either straight business or the questionable sort  in berlin a few years ago i read a speech which frankly urged the expulsion of the jews from germany and the agitators reason was as frank as his proposition it was this that eightyfive percent of the successful lawyers of berlin were jews and that about the same percentage of the great and lucrative businesses of all sorts in germany were in the hands of the jewish race isnt it an amazing confession it was but another way of saying that in a population of 48000000 of whom only 500000 were registered as jews eightyfive per cent of the brains and honesty of the whole was lodged in the jews i must insist upon the honestyit is an essential of successful business taken by and large of course it does not rule out rascals entirely even among christians but it is a good working rule nevertheless the speakers figures may have been inexact but the motive of persecution stands out as clear as day  the man claimed that in berlin the banks the newspapers the theatres the great mercantile shipping mining and manufacturing interests the big army and city contracts the tramways and pretty much all other properties of high value and also the small businesses were in the hands of the jews he said the jew was pushing the christian to the wall all along the line that it was all a christian could do to scrape together a living and that the jew must be banished and soonthere was no other way of saving the christian here in vienna last autumn an agitator said that all these disastrous details were true of austriahungary also and in fierce language he demanded the expulsion of the jews when politicians come out without a blush and read the baby act in this frank way unrebuked it is a very good indication that they have a market back of them and know where to fish for votes  you note the crucial point of the mentioned agitation the argument is that the christian cannot compete with the jew and that hence his very bread is in peril to human beings this is a much more hateinspiring thing than is any detail connected with religion with most people of a necessity bread and meat take first rank religion second i am convinced that the persecution of the jew is not due in any large degree to religious prejudice  no the jew is a moneygetter and in getting his money he is a very serious obstruction to less capable neighbours who are on the same quest i think that that is the trouble in estimating worldly values the jew is not shallow but deep with precocious wisdom he found out in the morning of time that some men worship rank some worship heroes some worship power some worship god and that over these ideals they dispute and cannot unitebut that they all worship money so he made it the end and aim of his life to get it he was at it in egypt thirtysix centuries ago he was at it in rome when that christian got persecuted by mistake for him he has been at it ever since the cost to him has been heavy his success has made the whole human race his enemybut it has paid for it has brought him envy and that is the only thing which men will sell both soul and body to get he long ago observed that a millionaire commands respect a twomillionaire homage a multimillionaire the deepest deeps of adoration we all know that feeling we have seen it express itself we have noticed that when the average man mentions the name of a multimillionaire he does it with that mixture in his voice of awe and reverence and lust which burns in a frenchmans eye when it falls on another mans centime   point no 4the jews have no party they are nonparticipants  perhaps you have let the secret out and given yourself away it seems hardly a credit to the race that it is able to say that or to you sir that you can say it without remorse more that you should offer it as a plea against maltreatment injustice and oppression who gives the jew the right who gives any race the right to sit still in a free country and let somebody else look after its safety the oppressed jew was entitled to all pity in the former times under brutal autocracies for he was weak and friendless and had no way to help his case but he has ways now and he has had them for a century but i do not see that he has tried to make serious use of then when the revolution set him free in france it was an act of gracethe grace of other people he does not appear in it as a helper i do not know that he helped when england set him free among the twelve sane men of france who have stepped forward with great zola at their head to fight and win i hope and believe3 the battle for the most infamously misused jew of modern times do you find a great or rich or illustrious jew helping in the united states he was created free in the beginninghe did not need to help of course in austria and germany and france he has a vote but of what considerable use is it to him he doesnt seem to know how to apply it to the best effect with all his splendid capacities and all his fat wealth he is today not politically important in any country in america as early as 1854 the ignorant irish hodcarrier who had a spirit of his own and a way of exposing it to the weather made it apparent to all that he must be politically reckoned with yet fifteen years before that we hardly knew what an irishman looked like as an intelligent force and numerically he has always been away down but he has governed the country just the same it was because he was organised it made his vote valuablein fact essential  you will say the jew is everywhere numerically feeble that is nothing to the pointwith the irishmans history for an objectlesson but i am coming to your numerical feebleness presently in all parliamentary countries you could no doubt elect jews to the legislaturesand even one member in such a body is sometimes a force which counts how deeply have you concerned yourselves about this in austria france and germany or even in america for that matter you remark that the jews were not to blame for the riots in this reichsrath here and you add with satisfaction that there wasnt one in that body that is not strictly correct if it were would it not be in order for you to explain it and apologise for it not try to make a merit of it but i think that the jew was by no means in as large force there as he ought to have been with his chances austria opens the suffrage to him on fairly liberal terms and it must surely be his own fault that he is so much in the background politically  as to your numerical weakness i mentioned some figures awhile ago50000as the jewish population of germany i will add some more6000000 in russia 5000000 in austria 250000 in the united states i take them from memory i read them in the encyclopaedia brittannica ten or twelve years ago still i am entirely sure of them if those statistics are correct my argument is not as strong as it ought to be as concerns america but it still has strength it is plenty strong enough as concerns austria for ten years ago 5000000 was nine per cent of the empires population the irish would govern the kingdom of heaven if they had a strength there like that  i have some suspicions i got them at secondhand but they have remained with me these ten or twelve years when i read in the eb that the jewish population of the united states was 250000 i wrote the editor and explained to him that i was personally acquainted with more jews than that in my country and that his figures were without a doubt a misprint for 25000000 i also added that i was personally acquainted with that many there but that was only to raise his confidence in me for it was not true his answer miscarried and i never got it but i went around talking about the matter and people told me they had reason to suspect that for business reasons many jews whose dealings were mainly with the christians did not report themselves as jews in the census it looked plausible it looks plausible yet look at the city of new york and look at boston and philadelphia and new orleans and chicago and cincinnati and san franciscohow your race swarms in those placesand everywhere else in america down to the least little village read the signs on the marts of commerce and on the shops goldstein gold stone edelstein precious stone blumenthal flowervale rosenthal rosevale veilchenduft violent odour singvogel songbird rosenzweig rose branch and all the amazing list of beautiful and enviable names which prussia and austria glorified you with so long ago it is another instance of europes coarse and cruel persecution of your race not that it was coarse and cruel to outfit it with pretty and poetical names like those but it was coarse and cruel to make it pay for them or else take such hideous and often indecent names that today their owners never use them or if they do only on official papers and it was the many not the few who got the odious names they being too poor to bribe the officials to grant them better ones  now why was the race renamed i have been told that in prussia it was given to using fictitious names and often changing them so as to beat the taxgatherer escape military service and so on and that finally the idea was hit upon of furnishing all the inmates of a house with one and the same surname and then holding the house responsible right along for those inmates and accountable for any disappearances that might occur it made the jews keep track of each other for selfinterests sake and saved the government the trouble4  if that explanation of how the jews of prussia came to be renamed is correct if it is true that they fictitiously registered themselves to gain certain advantages it may possible be true that in america they refrain from registered themselves as jews to fend off the damaging prejudices of the christian customer i have no way of knowing whether this notion is well founded or not there may be other and better ways of explaining why only that poor little 250000 of our jews got into the encyclopaedia i may of course be mistaken but i am strongly of the opinion that we have an immense jewish population in america   point no 3can jews do anything to improve the situation  i think so if i may make a suggestion without seeming to be trying to teach my grandmother to suck eggs i will offer it in our days we have learned the value of combination we apply it everywherein railway systems in trusts in trade unions in salvation armies in minor politics in major politics in european concerts whatever our strength may be big or little we organise it we have found out that that is the only way to get the most out of it that is in it we know the weakness of individual sticks and the strength of the concentrated faggot suppose you try a scheme like this for instance in england and america put every jew on the censusbook as a jew in case you have not been doing that get up volunteer regiments composed of jews solely and when the drum beats fall in and go to the front so as to remove the reproach that you have few massenas among you and that you feed on a country but dont like to fight for it next in politics organise your strength band together and deliver the castingvote where you can and where you cant compel as good terms as possible you huddle to yourselves already in all countries but you huddle to no sufficient purpose politically speaking you do not seem to be organised except for your charities there you are omnipotent there you compel your due of recognitionyou do not have to beg for it it shows what you can do when you band together for a definite purpose  and then from america and england you can encourage your race in austria france and germany and materially help it it was a pathetic tale that was told by a poor jew a fortnight ago during the riots after he had been raided by the christian peasantry and despoiled of everything he had he said his vote was of no value to him and he wished he could be excused from casting it for indeed casting it was a sure damage to him since no matter which party he voted for the other party would come straight and take its revenge out of him nine per cent of the population these jews and apparently they cannot put a plank into any candidates platform if you will send our irish lads over here i think they will organise your race and change the aspect of the reichsrath  you seem to think that the jews take no hand in politics here that they are absolutely nonparticipants i am assured by men competent to speak that this is a very large error that the jews are exceedingly active in politics all over the empire but that they scatter their work and their votes among the numerous parties and thus lose the advantages to be had by concentration i think that in america they scatter too but you know more about that than i do  speaking of concentration dr herzl has a clear insight into the value of that have you heard of his plan he wishes to gather the jews of the world together in palestine with a government of their ownunder the suzerainty of the sultan i suppose at the convention of berne last year there were delegates from everywhere and the proposal was received with decided favour i am not the sultan and i am not objecting but if that concentration of the cunningest brains in the world were going to be made in a free country bar scotland i think it would be politic to stop it it will not be well to let that race find out its strength if the horses knew theirs we should not ride any more   point no 5will the persecution of the jews ever come to an end  on the score of religion i think it has already come to an end on the score of race prejudice and trade i have the idea that it will continue that is here and there in spots about the world where a barbarous ignorance and a sort of mere animal civilisation prevail but i do not think that elsewhere the jew need now stand in any fear of being robbed and raided among the high civilisations he seems to be very comfortably situated indeed and to have more than his proportionate share of the prosperities going it has that look in vienna i suppose the race prejudice cannot be removed but he can stand that it is no particular matter by his make and ways he is substantially a foreigner wherever he may be and even the angels dislike a foreigner i am using this world foreigner in the german sensestranger nearly all of us have an antipathy to a stranger even of our own nationality we pile gripsacks in a vacant seat to keep him from getting it and a dog goes further and does as a savage wouldchallenges him on the spot the german dictionary seems to make no distinction between a stranger and a foreigner in its view a stranger is a foreignera sound position i think you will always be by ways and habits and predilections substantially strangersforeignerswherever you are and that will probably keep the race prejudice against you alive  but you were the favourites of heaven originally and your manifold and unfair prosperities convince me that you have crowded back into that snug place again here is an incident that is significant last week in vienna a hailstorm struck the prodigious central cemetery and made wasteful destruction there in the christian part of it according to the official figures 621 windowpanes were broken more than 900 singingbirds were killed five great trees and many small ones were torn to shreds and the shreds scattered far and wide by the wind the ornamental plants and other decorations of the graces were ruined and more than a hundred tomblanterns shattered and it took the cemeterys whole force of 300 labourers more than three days to clear away the storms wreckage in the report occurs this remarkand in its italics you can hear it grit its christian teeth lediglich die israelitische abtheilung des friedhofes vom hagelwetter ganzlich verschont worden war not a hailstone hit the jewish reservation such nepotism makes me tired   point no 6what has become of the golden rule  it exists it continues to sparkle and is well taken care of it is exhibit a in the churchs assets and we pull it out every sunday and give it an airing but you are not permitted to try to smuggle it into this discussion where it is irrelevant and would not feel at home it is strictly religious furniture like an acolyte or a contributionplate or any of those things it has never intruded into business and jewish persecution is not a religious passion it is a business passion   to concludeif the statistics are right the jews constitute but one per cent of the human race it suggests a nebulous dim puff of stardust lost in the blaze of the milky way properly the jew ought hardly to be heard of but he is heard of has always been heard of he is as prominent on the planet as any other people and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk his contributions to the worlds list of great names in literature science art music finance medicine and abstruse learning are also away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers he has made a marvellous fight in this world in all the ages and has done it with his hands tied behind him he could be vain of himself and be excused for it the egyptian the babylonian and the persian rose filled the planet with sound and splendour then faded to dreamstuff and passed away the greek and the roman followed and made a vast noise and they are gone other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high for a time but it burned out and they sit in twilight now or have vanished the jew saw them all beat them all and is now what he always was exhibiting no decadence no infirmities of age no weakening of his parts no slowing of his energies no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind all things are mortal to the jew all other forces pass but he remains what is the secret of his immortality   postscriptthe jew as soldier  when i published the above article in harpers monthly i was ignorantlike the rest of the christian worldof the fact that the jew had a record as a soldier i have since seen the official statistics and i find that he furnished soldiers and high officers to the revolution the war of 1812 and the mexican war in the civil war he was represented in the armies and navies of both the north and the south by 10 per cent of his numerical strengththe same percentage that was furnished by the christian populations of the two sections this large fact means more than it seems to mean for it means that the jews patriotism was not merely level with the christians but overpassed it when the christian volunteer arrived in camp he got a welcome and applause but as a rule the jew got a snub his company was not desired and he was made to feel it that he nevertheless conquered his wounded pride and sacrificed both that and his blood for his flag raises the average and quality of his patriotism above the christians his record for capacity for fidelity and for gallant soldiership in the field is as good as any ones this is true of the jewish private soldiers and of the jewish generals alike majorgeneral o o howard speaks of one of his jewish staff officers as being of the bravest and best of anotherkilled at chancellorsvilleas being a true friend and a brave officer he highly praises two of his jewish brigadiergenerals finally he uses these strong words intrinsically there are no more patriotic men to be found in the country than those who claim to be of hebrew descent and who served with me in parallel commands or more directly under my instructions  fourteen jewish confederate and union families contributed between them fiftyone soldiers to the war among these a father and three sons and another a father and four sons  in the above article i was neither able to endorse nor repel the common approach that the jew is willing to feed upon a country but not to fight for it because i did not know whether it was true or false i supposed it to be true but it is not allowable to endorse wandering maxims upon suppositionexcept when one is trying to make out a case that slur upon the jew cannot hold up its head in presence of the figures of the war department it has done its work and done it long and faithfully and with high approval it ought to be pensioned off now and retired from active service  1 see stirring times in austria in this volume  2 here is another piece of picturesque history and it reminds us that shabbiness and dishonesty are not the monopoly of any race or creed but are merely human  congress has passed a bill to pay 37956 to moses pendergrass of libertyville missouri the story of the reason of this liberality is pathetically interesting and shows the sort of pickle that an honest man may get into who undertakes to do an honest job of work for uncle sam in 1886 moses pendergrass put in a bid for the contract to carry the mail on the route from knob lick to libertyville and coffman thirty miles a day from july 1 1887 for one years he got the postmaster at knob lick to write the letter for him and while moses intended that his bid should be 400 his scribe carelessly made it 4 moses got the contract and did not find out about the mistake until the end of the first quarter when he got his first pay when he found at what rate he was working he was sorely cast down and opened communication with the post office department the department informed his that he must either carry out his contract or throw it up and that if he threw it up his bondsman would have the pay the government 145985 damages so moses carried out his contract walked thirty miles every weekday for a year and carried the mail and received for his labour 4 or to be accurate 684 for the route being extended after his bid was accepted his pay was proportionately increased now after ten years a bill was finally passed to pay to moses the difference between what he earned in that unlucky year and what he received  the sun which tells the above story says that bills were introduced in three or four congresses for moses relief and that committees repeatedly investigated his claim  it took six congresses containing in their persons the compressed virtues of 70000000 of people and cautiously and carefully giving expression to those virtues in the fear of god and the next election eleven years to find out some way to cheat a fellow christian out of about 13 on his honestly executed contract and out of nearly 300 due him on its enlarged terms and they succeeded during the same time they paid out 1000000000 in pensionsa third of it unearned and undeserved this indicates a splendid allround competency in theft for it starts with farthings and works its industries all the way up to shiploads it may be possible that the jews can beat this but the man that bets on it is taking chances  3 the article was written in the summer of 1898  4 in austria the renaming was merely done because the jews in some newlyacquired regions had no surnames but were mostly named abraham and moses and therefore the taxgatherer could tell tother from which and was likely to lose his reason over the matter the renaming was put into the hands of the war department and a charming mess the graceless young lieutenants made of it to them a jew was of no sort of consequence and they labelled the race in a way to make the angels weep as an example take these two abraham bellyache and schmul godbedamnedculled from namens studien by karl emil fransos       from the london times of 1904  correspondence of the london times chicago april 1 1904  i resume by cabletelephone where i left off yesterday for many hours now this vast cityalong with the rest of the globe of coursehas talked of nothing but the extraordinary episode mentioned in my last report in accordance with your instructions i will now trace the romance from its beginnings down to the culmination of yesterdayor today call it which you like by an odd chance i was a personal actor in a part of this drama myself the opening scene plays in vienna date one oclock in the morning march 31 1898 i had spent the evening at a social entertainment about midnight i went away in company with the military attaches of the british italian and american embassies to finish with a late smoke this function had been appointed to take place in the house of lieutenant hillyer the third attache mentioned in the above list when we arrived there we found several visitors in the room young szczepanik1 mr k his financial backer mr w the latters secretary and lieutenant clayton of the united states army war was at that time threatening between spain and our country and lieutenant clayton had been sent to europe on military business i was well acquainted with young szczepanik and his two friends and i knew mr clayton slightly i had met him at west point years before when he was a cadet it was when general merritt was superintendent he had the reputation of being an able officer and also of being quicktempered and plainspoken  this smokingparty had been gathered together partly for business this business was to consider the availability of the telelectroscope for military service it sounds oddly enough now but it is nevertheless true that at that time the invention was not taken seriously by any one except its inventor even his financial support regarded it merely as a curious and interesting toy indeed he was so convinced of this that he had actually postponed its use by the general world to the end of the dying century by granting a two years exclusive lease of it to a syndicate whose intent was to exploit it at the paris worlds fair when we entered the smokingroom we found lieutenant clayton and szczepanik engaged in a warm talk over the telelectroscope in the german tongue clayton was saying  well you know my opinion of it anyway and he brought his fist down with emphasis upon the table  and i do not value it retorted the young inventor with provoking calmness of tone and manner  clayton turned to mr k and said  i cannot see why you are wasting money on this toy in my opinion the day will never come when it will do a farthings worth of real service for any human being  that may be yes that may be still i have put the money in it and am content i think myself that it is only a toy but szczepanik claims more for it and i know him well enough to believe that he can see father than i caneither with his telelectroscope or without it  the soft answer did not cool clayton down it seemed only to irritate him the more and he repeated and emphasised his conviction that the invention would never do any man a farthings worth of real service he even made it a brass farthing this time then he laid an english farthing on the table and added  take that mr k and put it away and if ever the telelectroscope does any man an actual servicemind a real serviceplease mail it to me as a reminder and i will take back what i have been saying will you  i will and mr k put the coin in his pocket  mr clayton now turned toward szczepanik and began with a taunta taunt which did not reach a finish szczepanik interrupted it with a hardy retort and followed this with a blow there was a brisk fight for a moment or two then the attaches separated the men  the scene now changes to chicago time the autumn of 1901 as soon as the paris contract released the telelectroscope it was delivered to public use and was soon connected with the telephonic systems of the whole world the improved limitlessdistance telephone was presently introduced and the daily doings of the globe made visible to everybody and audibly discussible too by witnesses separated by any number of leagues  byandby szczepanik arrived in chicago clayton now captain was serving in that military department at the time the two men resumed the viennese quarrel of 1898 on three different occasions they quarrelled and were separated by witnesses then came an interval of two months during which time szczepanik was not seen by any of his friends and it was at first supposed that he had gone off on a sight seeing tour and would soon be heard from but no no word came from him then it was supposed that he had returned to europe still time drifted on and he was not heard from nobody was troubled for he was like most inventors and other kinds of poets and went and came in a capricious way and often without notice  now comes the tragedy on december 29 in a dark and unused compartment of the cellar under captain claytons house a corpse was discovered by one of claytons maidservants friends of deceased identified it as szczepaniks the man had died by violence clayton was arrested indicted and brought to trial charged with this murder the evidence against him was perfect in every detail and absolutely unassailable clayton admitted this himself he said that a reasonable man could not examine this testimony with a dispassionate mind and not be convinced by it yet the man would be in error nevertheless clayton swore that he did not commit the murder and that he had had nothing to do with it  as your readers will remember he was condemned to death he had numerous and powerful friends and they worked hard to save him for none of them doubted the truth of his assertion i did what little i could to help for i had long since become a close friend of his and thought i knew that it was not in his character to inveigle an enemy into a corner and assassinate him during 1902 and 1903 he was several times reprieved by the governor he was reprieved once more in the beginning of the present year and the execution day postponed to march 31  the governors situation has been embarrassing from the day of the condemnation because of the fact that claytons wife is the governors niece the marriage took place in 1899 when clayton was thirtyfour and the girl twentythree and has been a happy one there is one child a little girl three years old pity for the poor mother and child kept the mouths of grumblers closed at first but this could not last for everfor in america politics has a hand in everythingand byandby the governors political opponents began to call attention to his delay in allowing the law to take its course these hints have grown more and more frequent of late and more and more pronounced as a natural result his own part grew nervous its leaders began to visit springfield and hold long private conferences with him he was now between two fires on the one hand his niece was imploring him to pardon her husband on the other were the leaders insisting that he stand to his plain duty as chief magistrate of the state and place no further bar to claytons execution duty won in the struggle and the governor gave his word that he would not again respite the condemned man this was two weeks ago mrs clayton now said  now that you have given your word my last hope is gone for i know you will never go back from it but you have done the best you could for john and i have no reproaches for you you love him and you love me and we know that if you could honourable save him you would do it i will go to him now and be what help i can to him and get what comfort i may out of the few days that are left to us before the night comes which will have no end for me in life you will be with me that day you will not let me bear it alone  i will take you to him myself poor child and i will be near you to the last  by the governors command clayton was now allowed every indulgence he might ask for which could interest his mind and soften the hardships of his imprisonment his wife and child spent the days with him i was his companion by night he was removed from the narrow cell which he had occupied during such a dreary stretch of time and given the chief wardens roomy and comfortable quarters his mind was always busy with the catastrophe of his life and with the slaughtered inventor and he now took the fancy that he would like to have the telelectroscope and divert his mind with it he had his wish the connection was made with the international telephonestation and day by day and night by night he called up one corner of the globe after another and looked upon its life and studied its strange sights and spoke with its people and realised that by grace of this marvellous instrument he was almost as free as the birds of the air although a prisoner under locks and bars he seldom spoke and i never interrupted him when he was absorbed in this amusement i sat in his parlour and read and smoked and the nights were very quiet and reposefully sociable and i found them pleasant now and then i would her him say give me yedo next give me hongkong next give me melbourne and i smoked on and read in comfort while he wandered about the remote underworld where the sun was shining in the sky and the people were at their daily work sometimes the talk that came from those far regions through the microphone attachment interested me and i listened  yesterdayi keep calling it yesterday which is quite natural for certain reasonsthe instrument remained unused and that also was natural for it was the eve of the execution day it was spent in tears and lamentations and farewells the governor and the wife and child remained until a quarterpast eleven at night and the scenes i witnessed were pitiful to see the execution was to take place at four in the morning a little after eleven a sound of hammering broke out upon the still night and there was a glare of light and the child cried out what is that papa and ran to the window before she could be stopped and clapped her small hands and said oh come and see mammasuch a pretty thing they are making the mother knewand fainted it was the gallows  she was carried away to her lodging poor woman and clayton and i were alonealone and thinking brooding dreaming we might have been statues we sat so motionless and still it was a wild night for winter was come again for a moment after the habit of this region in the early spring the sky was starless and black and a strong wind was blowing from the lake the silence in the room was so deep that all outside sounds seemed exaggerated by contrast with it these sounds were fitting ones they harmonised with the situation and the conditions the boom and thunder of sudden stormgusts among the roofs and chimneys then the dying down into moanings and wailings about the eaves and angles now and then a gnashing and lashing rush of sleet along the windowpanes and always the muffled and uncanny hammering of the gallowsbuilders in the courtyard after an age of this another soundfar off and coming smothered and faint through the riot of the tempesta bell tolling twelve another age and it was tolled again byandby again a dreary long interval after this then the spectral sound floated to us once moreone two three and this time we caught our breath sixty minutes of life left  clayton rose and stood by the window and looked up into the black sky and listened to the thrashing sleet and the piping wind then he said that a dying mans last of earth should bethis after a little he said i must see the sun againthe sun and the next moment he was feverishly calling china give me chinapeking  i was strangely stirred and said to myself to think that it is a mere human being who does this unimaginable miracleturns winter into summer night into day storm into calm gives the freedom of the great globe to a prisoner in his cell and the sun in his naked splendour to a man dying in egyptian darkness  i was listening  what light what brilliancy what radiance this is peking  yes  the time  midafternoon  what is the great crowd for and in such gorgeous costumes what masses and masses of rich colour and barbaric magnificence and how they flash and glow and burn in the flooding sunlight what is the occasion of it all  the coronation of our new emperorthe czar  but i thought that that was to take place yesterday  this is yesterdayto you  certainly it is but my mind is confused these days there are reasons for it is this the beginning of the procession  oh no it began to move an hour ago  is there much more of it still to come  two hours of it why do you sigh  because i should like to see it all  and why cant you  i have to gopresently  you have an engagement  after a pause softly yes after another pause who are these in the splendid pavilion  the imperial family and visiting royalties from here and there and yonder in the earth  and who are those in the adjoining pavilions to the right and left  ambassadors and their families and suites to the right unofficial foreigners to the left  if you will be so good i  boom that distant bell again tolling the halfhour faintly through the tempest of wind and sleet the door opened and the governor and the mother and child enteredthe woman in widows weeds she fell upon her husbands breast in a passion of sobs and ii could not stay i could not bear it i went into the bedchamber and closed the door i sat there waitingwaitingwaiting and listening to the rattling sashes and the blustering of the storm after what seemed a long long time i heard a rustle and movement in the parlour and knew that the clergyman and the sheriff and the guard were come there was some lowvoiced talking then a hush then a prayer with a sound of sobbing presently footfallsthe departure for the gallows then the childs happy voice dont cry now mamma when weve got papa again and taking him home  the door closed they were gone i was ashamed i was the only friend of the dying man that had no spirit no courage i stepped into the room and said i would be a man and would follow but we are made as we are made and we cannot help it i did not go  i fidgeted about the room nervously and presently went to the window and softly raised itdrawn by that dread fascination which the terrible and the awful exertand looked down upon the courtyard by the garish light of the electric lamps i saw the little group of privileged witnesses the wife crying on her uncles breast the condemned man standing on the scaffold with the halter around his neck his arms strapped to his body the black cap on his head the sheriff at his side with his hand on the drop the clergyman in front of him with bare head and his book in his hand  i am the resurrection and the life  i turned away i could not listen i could not look i did not know whither to go or what to do mechanically and without knowing it i put my eye to that strange instrument and there was peking and the czars procession the next moment i was leaning out of the window gasping suffocating trying to speak but dumb from the very imminence of the necessity of speaking the preacher could speak but i who had such need of wordsand may god have mercy upon your soul amen  the sheriff drew down the black cap and laid his hand upon the lever i got my voice  stop for gods sake the man is innocent come here and see szczepanik face to face  hardly three minutes later the governor had my place at the window and was saying  strike off his bonds and set him free  three minutes later all were in the parlour again the reader will imagine the scene i have no need to describe it it was a sort of mad orgy of joy  a messenger carried word to szczepanik in the pavilion and one could see the distressed amazement in his face as he listened to the tale then he came to his end of the line and talked with clayton and the governor and the others and the wife poured out her gratitude upon him for saving her husbands life and in her deep thankfulness she kissed him at twelve thousand miles range  the telelectroscopes of the world were put to service now and for many hours the kinds and queens of many realms with here and there a reporter talked with szczepanik and praised him and the few scientific societies which had not already made him an honorary member conferred that grace upon him  how had he come to disappear from among us it was easily explained he had not grown used to being a worldfamous person and had been forced to break away from the lionising that was robbing him of all privacy and repose so he grew a beard put on coloured glasses disguised himself a little in other ways then took a fictitious name and went off to wander about the earth in peace  such is the tale of the drama which began with an inconsequential quarrel in vienna in the spring of 1898 and came near ending as a tragedy in the spring of 1904   ii  correspondence of the london times chicago april 5 1904  today by a clipper of the electric line and the latters electric railway connections arrived an envelope from vienna for captain clayton containing an english farthing the receiver of it was a good deal moved he called up vienna and stood face to face with mr k and said  i do not need to say anything you can see it all in my face my wife has the farthing do not be afraidshe will not throw it away   iii  correspondence of the london times chicago april 23 1904  now that the after developments of the clayton case have run their course and reached a finish i will sum them up claytons romantic escape from a shameful death stepped all this region in an enchantment of wonder and joyduring the proverbial nine days then the sobering process followed and men began to take thought and to say but a man was killed and clayton killed him others replied that is true we have been overlooking that important detail we have been led away by excitement  the telling soon became general that clayton ought to be tried again measures were taken accordingly and the proper representations conveyed to washington for in america under the new paragraph added to the constitution in 1889 second trials are not state affairs but national and must be tried by the most august body in the landthe supreme court of the united states the justices were therefore summoned to sit in chicago the session was held day before yesterday and was opened with the usual impressive formalities the nine judges appearing in their black robes and the new chief justice lemaitre presiding in opening the case the chief justice said  it is my opinion that this matter is quite simple the prisoner at the bar was charged with murdering the man szczepanik he was tried for murdering the man szczepanik he was fairly tried and justly condemned and sentenced to death for murdering the man szczepanik it turns out that the man szczepanik was not murdered at all by the decision of the french courts in the dreyfus matter it is established beyond cavil or question that the decisions of courts and permanent and cannot be revised we are obliged to respect and adopt this precedent it is upon precedents that the enduring edifice of jurisprudence is reared the prisoner at the bar has been fairly and righteously condemned to death for the murder of the man szczepanik and in my opinion there is but one course to pursue in the matter he must be hanged  mr justice crawford said  but your excellency he was pardoned on the scaffold for that  the pardon is not valid and cannot stand because he was pardoned for killing szczepanik a man whom he had not killed a man cannot be pardoned for a crime which he has not committed it would be an absurdity  but your excellency he did kill a man  that is an extraneous detail we have nothing to do with it the court cannot take up this crime until the prisoner has expiated the other one  mr justice halleck said  if we order his execution your excellency we shall bring about a miscarriage of justice for the governor will pardon him again  he will not have the power he cannot pardon a man for a crime which he has not committed as i observed before it would be an absurdity  after a consultation mr justice wadsworth said  several of us have arrived at the conclusion your excellency that it would be an error to hang the prisoner for killing szczepanik instead of for killing the other man since it is proven that he did not kill szczepanik  on the contrary it is proven that he did kill szczepanik by the french precedent it is plain that we must abide by the finding of the court  but szczepanik is still alive  so is dreyfus  in the end it was found impossible to ignore or get around the french precedent there could be but one result clayton was delivered over for the execution it made an immense excitement the state rose as one man and clamored for claytons pardon and retrial the governor issued the pardon but the supreme court was in duty bound to annul it and did so and poor clayton was hanged yesterday the city is draped in black and indeed the like may be said of the state all america is vocal with scorn of french justice and of the malignant little soldiers who invented it and inflicted it upon the other christian lands  1 pronounced approximately shepannik         about playacting   i  i have a project to suggest but first i will write a chapter of introduction  i have just been witnessing a remarkable play here at the burg theatre in vienna i do not know of any play that much resembles it in fact it is such a departure from the common laws of the drama that the name play doesnt seem to fit it quite snugly however whatever else it may be it is in any case a great and stately metaphysical poem and deeply fascinating deeply fascinating is the right term for the audience sat four hours and five minutes without thrice breaking into applause except at the close of each act sat rapt and silentfascinated this piece is the master of palmyra it is twenty years old yet i doubt if you have ever heard of it it is by wilbrandt and is his masterpiece and the work which is to make his name permanent in german literature it has never been played anywhere except in berlin and in the great burg theatre in vienna yet whenever it is put on the stage it packs the house and the free list is suspended i know people who have seem it ten times they know the most of it by heart they do not tire of it and they say they shall still be quite willing to go and sit under its spell whenever they get the opportunity  there is a dash of metempsychosis in itand it is the strength of the piece the play gave me the sense of the passage of a dimly connected procession of dreampictures the scene of it is palmyra in roman times it covers a wide stretch of timei dont know how many yearsand in the course of it the chief actress is reincarnated several times four times she is a more or less young woman and once she is a lad in the first act she is zoea christian girl who has wandered across the desert from damascus to try to christianise the zeusworshipping pagans of palmyra in this character she is wholly spiritual a religious enthusiast a devotee who covets martyrdomand gets it  after many years she appears in the second act as phoebe a graceful and beautiful young lightolove from rome whose soul is all for the shows and luxuries and delights of this lifea dainty and capricious featherhead a creature of shower and sunshine a spoiled child but a charming one in the third act after an interval of many years she reappears as persida mother of a daughter who is in the fresh bloom of youth she is now a sort of combination of her two earlier selves in religious loyalty and subjection she is zoe in triviality of character and shallowness of judgementtogether with a touch of vanity in dressshe is phoebe  after a lapse of years she appears in the fourth act as nymphas a beautiful boy in whose character the previous incarnations are engagingly mixed  and after another stretch of years all these heredities are joined in the zenobia of the fifth acta person of gravity dignity sweetness with a heart filled with compassion for all who suffer and a hand prompt to put into practical form the hearts benignant impulses  there are a number of curious and interesting features in this piece for instance its hero appelles young handsome vigorous in the first act remains so all through the long flight of years covered by the five acts other men young in the firs act are touched with gray in the second are old and racked with infirmities in the third in the fourth all but one are gone to their long home and this one is a blind and helpless hulk of ninety or a hundred years it indicates that the stretch of time covered by the piece is seventy years or more the scenery undergoes decay toothe decay of age assisted and perfected by a conflagration the fine new temples and palaces of the second act are byandby a wreck of crumbled walls and prostrate columns mouldy grassgrown and desolate but their former selves are still recognisable in their ruins the ageing men and the ageing scenery together convey a profound illusion of that long lapse of time they make you live it yourself you leave the theatre with the weight of a century upon you  another strong effect death in person walks about the stage in every act so far as i could make out he was supposably not visible to any excepting two personsthe one he came for and appelles he used various costumes but there was always more black about them than any other tint and so they were always sombre also they were always deeply impressive and indeed aweinspiring the face was not subjected to changes but remained the same first and lasta ghastly white to me he was always welcome he seemed so realthe actual death not a playacting artificiality he was of a solemn and stately carriage and he had a deep voice and used it with a noble dignity wherever there was a turmoil of merrymaking or fighting or feasting or chaffing or quarreling or a gilded pageant or other manifestation of our trivial and fleeting life into it drifted that black figure with the corpseface and looked its fateful look and passed on leaving its victim shuddering and smitten and always its coming made the fussy human pack seem infinitely pitiful and shabby and hardly worth the attention of either saving or damning  in the beginning of the first act the young girl zoe appears by some great rocks in the desert and sits down exhausted to rest presently arrive a pauper couple stricken with age and infirmities and they begin to mumble and pray to the spirit of life who is said to inhabit that spot the spirit of life appears also deathuninvited they are supposably invisible death tall blackrobed corpsefaced stands motionless and waits the aged couple pray to the spirit of life for a means to prop up their existence and continue it their prayer fails the spirit of life prophesies zoes martyrdom it will take place before night soon appelles arrives young and vigorous and full of enthusiasm he has led a host against the persians and won the battle he is the pet of fortune rich honoured believed master of palmyra he has heard that whoever stretches himself out on one of those rocks there and asks for a deathless life can have his wish he laughs at the tradition but wants to make the trial anyway the invisible spirit of life warns him life without end can be regret without end but he persists let him keep his youth his strength and his mental faculties unimpaired and he will take all the risks he has his desire  from this time forth act after act the troubles and sorrows and misfortunes and humiliations of life beat upon him without pity or respite but he will not give up he will not confess his mistake whenever he meets death he still furiously defies himbut death patiently waits he the healer of sorrows is mans best friend the recognition of this will come as the years drag on and on and on the friends of the masters youth grow old and one by one they totter to the grave he goes on with his proud fight and will not yield at length he is wholly alone in the world all his friends are dead last of all his darling of darlings his son the lad nymphas who dies in his arms his pride is broken now and he would welcome death if death would come if death would hear his prayers and give him peace the closing act is fine and pathetic appelles meets zenobia the helper of all who suffer and tells her his story which moves her pity by common report she is endowed with more than earthly powers and since he cannot have the boon of death he appeals to her to drown his memory in forgetfulness of his griefsforgetfulness which is deaths equivalent she says roughly translated in an exaltation of compassion  come to me       kneel and may the power be granted me      to cool the fires of this poor tortured brain      and bring it peace and healing  he kneels from her hand which she lays upon his head a mysterious influence steals through him and he sinks into a dreamy tranquility       oh if i could but so drift      through this soft twilight into the night of peace      never to wake again  raising his hand as if in benediction       o mother earth farewell      gracious thou were to me  farewell      appelles goes to rest  death appears behind him and encloses the uplifted hand in his appelles shudders wearily and slowly turns and recognises his lifelong adversary he smiles and puts all his gratitude into one simple and touching sentence ich danke dir and dies  nothing i think could be more moving more beautiful than this close this piece is just one long soulful sardonic laugh at human life its title might properly be is life a failure and leave the five acts to play with the answer i am not at all sure that the author meant to laugh at life i only notice that he has done it without putting into words any ungracious or discourteous things about life the episodes in the piece seem to be saying all the time inarticulately note what a silly poor thing human life is how childish its ambitions how ridiculous its pomps how trivial its dignities how cheap its heroisms how capricious its course how brief its flight how stingy in happinesses how opulent in miseries how few its prides how multitudinous its humiliations how comic its tragedies how tragic its comedies how wearisome and monotonous its repetition of its stupid history through the ages with never the introduction of a new detail how hard it has tried from the creation down to play itself upon its possessor as a boon and has never proved its case in a single instance  take note of some of the details of the piece each of the five acts contains an independent tragedy of its own in each act someones edifice of hope or of ambition or of happiness goes down in ruins even appelles perennial youth is only a long tragedy and his life a failure there are two martyrdoms in the piece and they are curiously and sarcastically contrasted in the first act the pagans persecute zoe the christian girl and a pagan mob slaughters her in the fourth act those same pagansnow very old and zealousare become christians and they persecute the pagans a mob of them slaughters the pagan youth nymphas who is standing up for the old gods of his fathers no remark is made about this picturesque failure of civilisation but there it stands as an unworded suggestion that civilisation even when christianised was not able wholly to subdue the natural man in that old dayjust as in our day the spectacle of a shipwrecked french crew clubbing women and children who tried to climb into the lifeboats suggests that civilisation has not succeeded in entirely obliterating the natural man even yet common sailors a year ago in paris at a fire the aristocracy of the same nation clubbed girls and women out of the way to save themselves civilisation tested at top and bottom both you see and in still another panic of fright we have this same tough civilisation saving its honour by condemning an innocent man to multiform death and hugging and whitewashing the guilty one  in the second act a grand roman official is not above trying to blast appelles reputation by falsely charging him with misappropriating public moneys appelles who is too proud to endure even the suspicion of irregularity strips himself to naked poverty to square the unfair account and his troubles begin the blight which is to continue and spread strikes his life for the frivolous pretty creature whom he brought from rome has no taste for poverty and agrees to elope with a more competent candidate her presence in the house has previously brought down the pride and broken the heart of appelles poor old mother and her life is a failure death comes for her but is willing to trade her for the roman girl so the bargain is struck with appelles and the mother is spared for the present  no ones life escapes the blight timoleus the gay satirist of the first two acts who scoffed at the pious hypocrisies and moneygrubbing ways of the great roman lords is grown old and fat and bleareyed and racked with disease in the third has lost his stately purities and watered the acid of his wit his life has suffered defeat unthinkingly he swears by zeusfrom ancient habitand then quakes with fright for a fellowcommunicant is passing by reproached by a pagan friend of his youth for his apostasy he confesses that principle when unsupported by an assenting stomach has to climb down one must have bread and the bread is christian now then the poor old wreck once so proud of his iron rectitude hobbles away coughing and barking  in that same act appelles give his sweet young christian daughter and her fine young pagan lover his consent and blessing and makes them utterly happyfor five minutes then the priest and the mob come to tear them apart and put the girl in a nunnery for marriage between the sects is forbidden appelles wife could dissolve the rule and she wants to do it but under priestly pressure she wavers then fearing that in providing happiness for her child she would be committing a sin dangerous to her own she goes over to the opposition and throws the casting vote for the nunnery the blight has fallen upon the young couple and their life is a failure  in the fourth act longinus who made such a prosperous and enviable start in the first act is left alone in the desert sick blind helpless incredibly old to die not a friend left in the worldanother ruined life and in that act also appelles worshipped boy nymphas done to death by the mob breathes out his last sigh in his fathers armsone more failure in the fifth act appelles himself dies and is glad to do it he who so ignorantly rejoiced only four acts before over the splendid present of an earthly immortalitythe very worst failure of the lot   ii  now i approach my project here is the theatre list for saturday may 7 1898 cut from the advertising columns of a new york paper  graphic here  now i arrive at my project and make my suggestion from the look of this lightsome feast i conclude that what you need is a tonic send for the master of palmyra you are trying to make yourself believe that life is a comedy that its sole business is fun that there is nothing serious in it you are ignoring the skeleton in your closet send for the master of palmyra you are neglecting a valuable side of your life presently it will be atrophied you are eating too much mental sugar you will bring on brights disease of the intellect you need a tonic you need it very much send for the master of palmyra you will not need to translate it its story is as plain as a procession of pictures  i have made my suggestion now i wish to put an annex to it and that is this it is right and wholesome to have those light comedies and entertaining shows and i shouldnt wish to see them diminished but none of us is always in the comedy spirit we have our graver moods they come to us all the lightest of us cannot escape them these moods have their appetiteshealthy and legitimate appetitesand there ought to be some way of satisfying them it seems to me that new york ought to have one theatre devoted to tragedy with her three millions of population and seventy outside millions to draw upon she can afford it she can support it america devotes more time labour money and attention to distributing literary and musical culture among the general public than does any other nation perhaps yet here you find her neglecting what is possibly the most effective of all the breeders and nurses and disseminators of high literary taste and lofty emotionthe tragic stage to leave that powerful agency out is to haul the culturewagon with a crippled team nowadays when a mood comes which only shakespeare can set to music what must we do read shakespeare ourselves isnt it pitiful it is playing an organ solo on a jewsharp we cant read none but the booths can do it  thirty years ago edwin booth played hamlet a hundred nights in new york with three times the population how often is hamlet played now in a year if booth were back now in his prime how often could he play it in new york some will say twentyfive nights i will say three hundred and say it with confidence the tragedians are dead but i think that the taste and intelligence which made their market are not  what has come over us englishspeaking people during the first half of this century tragedies and great tragedians were as common with us as farce and comedy and it was the same in england now we have not a tragedian i believe and london with her fifty shows and theatres has but three i think it is an astonishing thing when you come to consider it vienna remains upon the ancient basis there has been no change she sticks to the former proportions a number of rollicking comedies admirably played every night and also every night at the burg theatrethat wonder of the world for grace and beauty and richness and splendour and costlinessa majestic drama of depth and seriousness or a standard old tragedy it is only within the last dozen years that men have learned to do miracles on the stage in the way of grand and enchanting scenic effects and it is at such a time as this that we have reduced our scenery mainly to different breeds of parlours and varying aspects of furniture and rugs i think we must have a burg in new york and burg scenery and a great company like the burg company then with a tragedytonic once or twice a month we shall enjoy the comedies all the better comedy keeps the heart sweet but we all know that there is wholesome refreshment for both mind and heart in an occasional climb among the solemn pomps of the intellectual snowsummits built by shakespeare and those others do i seem to be preaching it is out of my life i only do it because the rest of the clergy seem to be on vacation       travelling with a reformer  last spring i went out to chicago to see the fair and although i did not see it my trip was not wholly lostthere were compensations in new york i was introduced to a major in the regular army who said he was going to the fair and we agreed to go together i had to go to boston first but that did not interfere he said he would go along and put in the time he was a handsome man and built like a gladiator but his ways were gentle and his speech was soft and persuasive he was companionable but exceedingly reposeful yes and wholly destitute of the sense of humour he was full of interest in everything that went on around him but his serenity was indestructible nothing disturbed him nothing excited him  but before the day was done i found that deep down in him somewhere he had a passion quiet as he wasa passion for reforming petty public abuses he stood for citizenshipit was his hobby his idea was that every citizen of the republic ought to consider himself an unofficial policeman and keep unsalaried watch and ward over the laws and their execution he thought that the only effective way of preserving and protecting public rights was for each citizen to do his share in preventing or punishing such infringements of them as came under his personal notice  it was a good scheme but i thought it would keep a body in trouble all the time it seemed to me that one would be always trying to get offending little officials discharged and perhaps getting laughed at for all reward but he said no i had the wrong idea that there was no occasion to get anybody discharged that in fact you mustnt get anybody discharged that that would itself be a failure no one must reform the manreform him and make him useful where he was  must one report the offender and then beg his superior not to discharge him but reprimand him and keep him  no that is not the idea you dont report him at all for then you risk his bread and butter you can act as if you are going to report himwhen nothing else will answer but thats an extreme case that is a sort of force and force is bad diplomacy is the effective thing now if a man has tactif a man will exercise diplomacy  for two minutes we had been standing at a telegraph wicket and during all this time the major had been trying to get the attention of one of the young operators but they were all busy skylarking the major spoke now and asked one of them to take his telegram he got for reply  i reckon you can wait a minute cant you and the skylarking went on  the major said yes he was not in a hurry then he wrote another telegram       president western union tel co       come and dine with me this evening  i can tell you how business is      conducted in one of your branches  presently the young fellow who had spoken so pertly a little before reached out and took the telegram and when he read it he lost colour and began to apologise and explain he said he would lose his place if this deadly telegram was sent and he might never get another if he could be let off this time he would give no cause of complaint again the compromise was accepted  as we walked away the major said  now you see that was diplomacyand you see how it worked it wouldnt do any good to bluster the way people are always doing that boy can always give you as good as you send and youll come out defeated and ashamed of yourself pretty nearly always but you see he stands no chance against diplomacy gentle words and diplomacythose are the tools to work with  yes i see but everybody wouldnt have had your opportunity it isnt everybody that is on those familiar terms with the president of the western union  oh you misunderstand i dont know the presidenti only use him diplomatically it is for his good and for the public good theres no harm in it  i said with hesitation and diffidence  but is it ever right or noble to tell a lie  he took no note of the delicate selfrighteousness of the question but answered with undisturbed gravity and simplicity  yes sometimes lies told to injure a person and lies told to profit yourself are not justifiable but lies told to help another person and lies told in the public interestoh well that is quite another matter anybody knows that but never mind about the methods you see the result that youth is going to be useful now and wellbehaved he had a good face he was worth saving why he was worth saving on his mothers account if not his own of course he has a mothersisters too damn these people who are always forgetting that do you know ive never fought a duel in my lifenever onceand yet have been challenged like other people i could always see the other mans unoffending women folks or his little children standing between him and me they hadnt done anythingi couldnt break their hearts you know  he corrected a good many little abuses in the course of the day and always without frictionalways with a fine and dainty diplomacy which left no sting behind and he got such happiness and such contentment out of these performances that i was obliged to envy him his tradeand perhaps would have adopted it if i could have managed the necessary deflections from fact as confidently with my mouth as i believe i could with a pen behind the shelter of print after a little practice  away late that night we were coming uptown in a horsecar when three boisterous roughs got aboard and began to fling hilarious obscenities and profanities right and left among the timid passengers some of whom were women and children nobody resisted or retorted the conductor tried soothing words and moral suasion but the toughs only called him names and laughed at him very soon i saw that the major realised that this was a matter which was in his line evidently he was turning over his stock of diplomacy in his mind and getting ready i felt that the first diplomatic remark he made in this place would bring down a landslide of ridicule upon him and maybe something worse but before i could whisper to him and check him he had begun and it was too late he said in a level and dispassionate tone  conductor you must put these swine out i will help you  i was not looking for that in a flash the three roughs plunged at him but none of them arrived he delivered three such blows as one could not expect to encounter outside the prizering and neither of the men had life enough left in him to get up from where he fell the major dragged them out and threw them off the car and we got under way again  i was astonished astonished to see a lamb act so astonished at the strength displayed and the clean and comprehensive result astonished at the brisk and businesslike style of the whole thing the situation had a humorous side to it considering how much i had been hearing about mild persuasion and gentle diplomacy all day from this piledriver and i would have liked to call his attention to that feature and do some sarcasms about it but when i looked at him i saw that it would be of no usehis placid and contented face had no ray of humour in it he would not have understood when we left the car i said  that was a good stroke of diplomacythree good strokes of diplomacy in fact  that that wasnt diplomacy you are quite in the wrong diplomacy is a wholly different thing one cannot apply it to that sort they would not understand it no that was not diplomacy it was force  now that you mention it iyes i think perhaps you are right  right of course i am right it was just force  i think myself it had the outside aspect of it do you often have to reform people in that way  far from it it hardly ever happens not oftener than once in half a year at the outside  those men will get well  get well why certainly they will they are not in any danger i know how to hit and where to hit you noticed that i did not hit them under the jaw that would have killed them  i believed that i remarkedrather wittily as i thoughtthat he had been a lamb all day but now had all of a sudden developed into a rambatteringram but with dulcet frankness and simplicity he said no a batteringram was quite a different thing and not in use now this was maddening and i came near bursting out and saying he had no more appreciation of wit than a jackassin fact i had it right on my tongue but did not say it knowing there was no hurry and i could say it just as well some other time over the telephone  we started to boston the next afternoon the smoking compartment in the parlourcar was full and he went into the regular smoker across the aisle in the front seat sat a meek farmerlooking old man with a sickly pallor in his face and he was holding the door open with his foot to get the air presently a big brakeman came rushing through and when he got to the door he stopped gave the farmer an ugly scowl then wrenched the door to with such energy as to almost snatch the old mans boot off then on he plunged about his business several passengers laughed and the old gentleman looked pathetically shamed and grieved  after a little the conductor passed along and the major stopped him and asked him a question in his habitually courteous way  conductor where does one report the misconduct of a brakeman does one report to you  you can report him at new haven if you want to what has he been doing  the major told the story the conductor seemed amused he said with just a touch of sarcasm in his bland tones  as i understand you the brakeman didnt say anything  no he didnt say anything  but he scowled you say  yes  and snatched the door loose in a rough way  yes  thats the whole business is it  yes that is the whole of it  the conductor smiled pleasantly and said  well if you want to report him all right but i dont quite make out what its going to amount to youll sayas i understand youthat the brakeman insulted this old gentleman theyll ask you what he said youll say he didnt say anything at all i reckon theyll say how are you going to make out an insult when you acknowledge yourself that he didnt say a word  there was a murmur of applause at the conductors compact reasoning and it gave him pleasureyou could see it in his face but the major was not disturbed he said  therenow you have touched upon a crying defect in the complaint system the railway officialsas the public think and as you also seem to thinkare not aware that there are any insults except spoken ones so nobody goes to headquarters and reports insults of manner insults of gesture look and so forth and yet these are sometimes harder to bear than any words they are bitter hard to bear because there is nothing tangible to take hold of and the insulter can always say if called before the railway officials that he never dreamed of intending any offence it seems to me that the officials ought to specially and urgently request the public to report unworded affronts and incivilities  the conductor laughed and said  well that would be trimming it pretty fine sure  but not too fine i think i will report this matter at new haven and i have an idea that ill be thanked for it  the conductors face lost something of its complacency in fact it settled to a quite sober cast as the owner of it moved away i said  you are not really going to bother with that trifle are you  it isnt a trifle such things ought always to be reported it is a public duty and no citizen has a right to shirk it but i shant have to report this case  why  it wont be necessary diplomacy will do the business youll see  presently the conductor came on his rounds again and when he reached the major he leaned over and said  thats all right you neednt report him hes responsible to me and if he does it again ill give him a talking to  the majors response was cordial  now that is what i like you mustnt think that i was moved by any vengeful spirit for that wasnt the case it was dutyjust a sense of duty that was all my brotherinlaw is one of the directors of the road and when he learns that you are going to reason with your brakeman the very next time he brutally insults an unoffending old man it will please him you may be sure of that  the conductor did not look as joyous as one might have thought he would but on the contrary looked sickly and uncomfortable he stood around a little then said  i think something ought to be done to him now ill discharge him  discharge him what good would that do dont you think it would be better wisdom to teach him better ways and keep him  well theres something in that what would you suggest  he insulted the old gentleman in presence of all these people how would it do to have him come and apologise in their presence  ill have him here right off and i want to say this if people would do as youve done and report such things to me instead of keeping mum and going off and blackguarding the road youd see a different state of things pretty soon im much obliged to you  the brakeman came and apologised after he was gone the major said  now you see how simple and easy that was the ordinary citizen would have accomplished nothingthe brotherinlaw of a directory can accomplish anything he wants to  but are you really the brotherinlaw of a director  always always when the public interests require it i have a brotherinlaw on all the boardseverywhere it saves me a world of trouble  it is a good wide relationship  yes i have over three hundred of them  is the relationship never doubted by a conductor  i have never met with a case it is the honest truthi never have  why didnt you let him go ahead and discharge the brakeman in spite of your favourite policy you know he deserved it  the major answered with something which really had a sort of distant resemblance to impatience  if you would stop and think a moment you wouldnt ask such a question as that is a brakeman a dog that nothing but dogs methods will do for him he is a man and has a mans fight for life and he always has a sister or a mother or wife and children to support alwaysthere are no exceptions when you take his living away from him you take theirs away tooand what have they done to you nothing and where is the profit in discharging an uncourteous brakeman and hiring another just like him its unwisdom dont you see that the rational thing to do is to reform the brakeman and keep him of course it is  then he quoted with admiration the conduct of a certain division superintendent of the consolidated road in a case where a switchman of two years experience was negligent once and threw a train off the track and killed several people citizens came in a passion to urge the mans dismissal but the superintendent said  no you are wrong he has learned his lesson he will throw no more trains off the track he is twice as valuable as he was before i shall keep him  we had only one more adventure on the train between hartford and springfield the trainboy came shouting with an armful of literature and dropped a sample into a slumbering gentlemans lap and the man woke up with a start he was very angry and he and a couple of friends discussed the outrage with much heat they sent for the parlourcar conductor and described the matter and were determined to have the boy expelled from his situation the three complainants were wealthy holyoke merchants and it was evident that the conductor stood in some awe of them he tried to pacify them and explained that the boy was not under his authority but under that of one of the news companies but he accomplished nothing  then the major volunteered some testimony for the defence he said  i saw it all you gentlemen have not meant to exaggerate the circumstances but still that is what you have done the boy has done nothing more than all trainboys do if you want to get his ways softened down and his manners reformed i am with you and ready to help but it isnt fair to get him discharged without giving him a chance  but they were angry and would hear of no compromise they were well acquainted with the president of the boston and albany they said and would put everything aside next day and go up to boston and fix that boy  the major said he would be on hand too and would do what he could to save the boy one of the gentlemen looked him over and said  apparently it is going to be a matter of who can wield the most influence with the president do you know mr bliss personally  the major said with composure  yes he is my uncle  the effect was satisfactory there was an awkward silence for a minute or more then the hedging and the halfconfessions of overhaste and exaggerated resentment began and soon everything was smooth and friendly and sociable and it was resolved to drop the matter and leave the boys bread and butter unmolested  it turned out as i had expected the president of the road was not the majors uncle at allexcept by adoption and for this day and train only  we got into no episodes on the return journey probably it was because we took a night train and slept all the way  we left new york saturday night by the pennsylvania road after breakfast the next morning we went into the parlourcar but found it a dull place and dreary there were but few people in it and nothing going on then we went into the little smoking compartment of the same car and found three gentlemen in there two of them were grumbling over one of the rules of the roada rule which forbade cardplaying on the trains on sunday they had started an innocent game of highlowjack and had been stopped the major was interested he said to the third gentleman  did you object to the game  not at all i am a yale professor and a religious man but my prejudices are not extensive  then the major said to the others  you are at perfect liberty to resume your game gentlemen no one here objects  one of them declined the risk but the other one said he would like to begin again if the major would join him so they spread an overcoat over their knees and the game proceeded pretty soon the parlourcar conductor arrived and said brusquely  there there gentlemen that wont do put up the cardsits not allowed  the major was shuffling he continued to shuffle and said  by whose order is it forbidden  its my order i forbid it  the dealing began the major asked  did you invent the idea  what idea  the idea of forbidding cardplaying on sunday  noof course not  who did  the company  then it isnt your order after all but the companys is that it  yes but you dont stop playing i have to require you to stop playing immediately  nothing is gained by hurry and often much is lost who authorised the company to issue such an order  my dear sir that is a matter of no consequence to me and  but you forget that you are not the only person concerned it may be a matter of consequence to me it is indeed a matter of very great importance to me i cannot violate a legal requirement of my country without dishonouring myself i cannot allow any man or corporation to hamper my liberties with illegal rulesa thing which railway companies are always trying to dowithout dishonouring my citizenship so i come back to that question by whose authority has the company issued this order  i dont know thats their affair  mine too i doubt if the company has any right to issue such a rule this road runs through several states do you know what state we are in now and what its laws are in matters of this kind  its laws do not concern me but the companys orders do it is my duty to stop this game gentlemen and it must be stopped  possibly but still there is no hurry in hotels they post certain rules in the rooms but they always quote passages from the state law as authority for these requirements i see nothing posted here of this sort please produce your authority and let us arrive at a decision for you see yourself that you are marring the game  i have nothing of the kind but i have my orders and that is sufficient they must be obeyed  let us not jump to conclusions it will be better all around to examine into the matter without heat or haste and see just where we stand before either of us makes a mistakefor the curtailing of the liberties of a citizen of the united states is a much more serious matter than you and the railroads seem to think and it cannot be done in my person until the curtailer proves his right to do so now  my dear sir will you put down those cards  all in good time perhaps it depends you say this order must be obeyed must it is a strong word you see yourself how strong it is a wise company would not arm you with so drastic an order as this of course without appointing a penalty for its infringement otherwise it runs the risk of being a dead letter and a thing to laugh at what is the appointed penalty for an infringement of this law  penalty i never heard of any  unquestionably you must be mistaken your company orders you to come here and rudely break up an innocent amusement and furnishes you no way to enforce the order dont you see that that is nonsense what do you do when people refuse to obey this order do you take the cards away from them  no  do you put the offender off at the next station  well noof course we couldnt if he had a ticket  do you have him up before a court  the conductor was silent and apparently troubled the major started a new deal and said  you see that you are helpless and that the company has placed you in a foolish position you are furnished with an arrogant order and you deliver it in a blustering way and when you come to look into the matter you find you havent any way of enforcing obedience  the conductor said with chill dignity  gentlemen you have heard the order and my duty is ended as to obeying it or not you will do as you think fit and he turned to leave  but wait the matter is not yet finished i think you are mistaken about your duty being ended but if it really is i myself have a duty to perform yet  how do you mean  are you going to report my disobedience at headquarters in pittsburg  no what good would that do  you must report me or i will report you  report me for what  for disobeying the companys orders in not stopping this game as a citizen it is my duty to help the railway companies keep their servants to their work  are you in earnest  yes i am in earnest i have nothing against you as a man but i have this against you as an officerthat you have not carried out that order and if you do not report me i must report you and i will  the conductor looked puzzled and was thoughtful a moment then he burst out with  i seem to be getting myself into a scrape its all a muddle i cant make head or tail of it it never happened before they always knocked under and never said a word and so i never saw how ridiculous that stupid order with no penalty is i dont want to report anybody and i dont want to be reportedwhy it might do me no end of harm no do go on with the gameplay the whole day if you want toand dont lets have any more trouble about it  no i only sat down here to establish this gentlemans rightshe can have his place now but before wont you tell me what you think the company made this rule for can you imagine an excuse for it i mean a rational onean excuse that is not on its face silly and the invention of an idiot  why surely i can the reason it was made is plain enough it is to save the feelings of the other passengersthe religious ones among them i mean they would not like it to have the sabbath desecrated by cardplaying on the train  i just thought as much they are willing to desecrate it themselves by travelling on sunday but they are not willing that other people  by gracious youve hit it i never thought of that before the fact is it is a silly rule when you come to look into it  at this point the train conductor arrived and was going to shut down the game in a very highhanded fashion but the parlourcar conductor stopped him and took him aside to explain nothing more was heard of the matter  i was ill in bed eleven days in chicago and got no glimpse of the fair for i was obliged to return east as soon as i was able to travel the major secured and paid for a stateroom in a sleeper the day before we left so that i could have plenty of room and be comfortable but when we arrived at the station a mistake had been made and our car had not been put on the conductor had reserved a section for usit was the best he could do he said but major said we were not in a hurry and would wait for the car to be put on the conductor responded with pleasant irony  it may be that you are not in a hurry just as you say but we are come get aboard gentlemen get aboarddont keep us waiting  but the major would not get aboard himself nor allow me to do it he wanted his car and said he must have it this made the hurried and perspiring conductor impatient and he said  its the best we can dowe cant do impossibilities you will take the section or go without a mistake has been made and cant be rectified at this late hour its a thing that happens now and then and there is nothing for it but to put up with it and make the best of it other people do  ah that is just it you see if they had stuck to their rights and enforced them you wouldnt be trying to trample mine underfoot in this bland way now i havent any disposition to give you unnecessary trouble but it is my duty to protect the next man from this kind of imposition so i must have my car otherwise i will wait in chicago and sue the company for violating its contract  sue the companyfor a thing like that  certainly  do you really mean that  indeed i do  the conductor looked the major over wonderingly and then said  it beats meits brannewive never struck the mate to it before but i swear i think youd do it look here ill send for the stationmaster  when the stationmaster came he was a good deal annoyedat the major not at the person who had made the mistake he was rather brusque and took the same position which the conductor had taken in the beginning but he failed to move the softspoken artilleryman who still insisted that he must have his car however it was plain that there was only one strong side in this case and that that side was the majors the stationmaster banished his annoyed manner and became pleasant and even halfapologetic this made a good opening for a compromise and the major made a concession he said he would give up the engaged stateroom but he must have a stateroom after a deal of ransacking one was found whose owner was persuadable he exchanged it for our section and we got away at last the conductor called on us in the evening and was kind and courteous and obliging and we had a long talk and got to be good friends he said he wished the public would make trouble oftenerit would have a good effect he said that the railroads could not be expected to do their whole duty by the traveller unless the traveller would take some interest in the matter himself  i hoped that we were done reforming for the trip now but it was not so in the hotel car in the morning the major called for broiled chicken the waiter said  its not in the bill of fare sir we do not serve anything but what is in the bill  that gentleman yonder is eating a broiled chicken  yes but that is different he is one of the superintendents of the road  then all the more must i have broiled chicken i do not like these discriminations please hurrybring me a broiled chicken  the waiter brought the steward who explained in a low and polite voice that the thing was impossibleit was against the rule and the rule was rigid  very well then you must either apply it impartially or break it impartially you must take that gentlemans chicken away from him or bring me one  the steward was puzzled and did not quite know what to do he began an incoherent argument but the conductor came along just then and asked what the difficulty was the steward explained that here was a gentleman who was insisting on having a chicken when it was dead against the rule and not in the bill the conductor said  stick by your rulesyou havent any option wait a momentis this the gentleman then he laughed and said never mind your rulesits my advice and sound give him anything he wantsdont get him started on his rights give him whatever he asks for and it you havent got it stop the train and get it  the major ate the chicken but said he did it from a sense of duty and to establish a principle for he did not like chicken  i missed the fair it is true but i picked up some diplomatic tricks which i and the reader may find handy and useful as we go along       diplomatic pay and clothes  vienna january 5i find in this mornings papers the statement that the government of the united states has paid to the two members of the peace commission entitled to receive money for their services 100000 dollars each for their six weeks work in paris  i hope that this is true i will allow myself the satisfaction of considering that it is true and of treating it as a thing finished and settled  it is a precedent and ought to be a welcome one to our country a precedent always has a chance to be valuable as well as the other way and its best chance to be valuable or the other way is when it takes such a striking form as to fix a whole nations attention upon it if it come justified out of the discussion which will follow it will find a career ready and waiting for it  we realise that the edifice of public justice is built of precedents from the ground upward but we do not always realise that all the other details of our civilisation are likewise built of precedents the changes also which they undergo are due to the intrusion of new precedents which hold their ground against opposition and keep their place a precedent may die at birth or it may liveit is mainly a matter of luck if it be imitated once it has a chance if twice a better chance if three times it is reaching a point where account must be taken of it if four five or six times it has probably come to stayfor a whole century possibly if a town start a new bow or a new dance or a new temperance project or a new kind of hat and can get the precedent adopted in the next town the career of that precedent is begun and it will be unsafe to bet as to where the end of its journey is going to be it may not get this start at all and may have no career but if a crown prince introduce the precedent it will attract vast attention and its chances for a career are so great as to amount almost to a certainty  for a long time we have been reaping damage from a couple of disastrous precedents one is the precedent of shabby pay to public servants standing for the power and dignity of the republic in foreign lands the other is a precedent condemning them to exhibit themselves officially in clothes which are not only without grace or dignity but are a pretty loud and pious rebuke to the vain and frivolous costumes worn by the other officials to our day an american ambassadors official costume remains under the reproach of these defects at a public function in a european court all foreign representatives except ours wear clothes which in some way distinguish them from the unofficial throng and mark them as standing for their countries but our representative appears in a plain black swallowtail which stands for neither country nor people it has no nationality it is found in all countries it is as international as a nightshirt it has no particular meaning but our government tries to give it one it tries to make it stand for republican simplicity modesty and unpretentiousness tries and without doubt fails for it is not conceivable that this loud ostentation of simplicity deceives any one the statue that advertises its modesty with a figleaf really brings its modesty under suspicion worn officially our nonconforming swallowtail is a declaration of ungracious independence in the matter of manners and is uncourteous it says to all around in rome we do not choose to do as rome does we refuse to respect your tastes and your traditions we make no sacrifices to anyones customs and prejudices we yield no jot to the courtesies of life we prefer our manners and intrude them here  that is not the true american spirit and those clothes misrepresent us when a foreigner comes among us and trespasses against our customs and our code of manners we are offended and justly so but our government commands our ambassadors to wear abroad an official dress which is an offence against foreign manners and customers and the discredit of it falls upon the nation  we did not dress our public functionaries in undistinguished raiment before franklins time and the change would not have come if he had been an obscurity but he was such a colossal figure in the world that whatever he did of an unusual nature attracted the worlds attention and became a precedent in the case of clothes the next representative after him and the next had to imitate it after that the thing was custom and custom is a petrifaction nothing but dynamite can dislodge it for a century we imagine that our queer official costumery was deliberately devised to symbolise our republican simplicitya quality which we have never possessed and are too old to acquire now if we had any use for it or any leaning toward it but it is not so there was nothing deliberate about it it grew naturally and heedlessly out of the precedent set by franklin  if it had been an intentional thing and based upon a principle it would not have stopped where it did we should have applied it further instead of clothing our admirals and generals for courtsmartial and other public functions in superb dress uniforms blazing with colour and gold the government would put them in swallowtails and white cravats and make them look like ambassadors and lackeys if i am wrong in making franklin the father of our curious official clothes it is no matterhe will be able to stand it  it is my opinionand i make no charge for the suggestionthat whenever we appoint an ambassador or a minister we ought to confer upon him the temporary rank of admiral or general and allow him to wear the corresponding uniform at public functions in foreign countries i would recommend this for the reason that it is not consonant with the dignity of the united states of america that her representative should appear upon occasions of state in a dress which makes him glaringly conspicuous and that is what his present undertakeroutfit does when it appears with its dismal smudge in the midst of the butterfly splendours of a continental court it is a most trying position for a shy man a modest man a man accustomed to being like other people he is the most striking figure present there is no hiding from the multitudinous eyes it would be funny if it were not such a cruel spectacle to see the hunted creature in his solemn sables scuffling around in that sea of vivid colour like a mislaid presbyterian in perdition we are all aware that our representatives dress should not compel too much attention for anybody but an indian chief knows that that is a vulgarity i am saying these things in the interest of our national pride and dignity our representative is the flag he is the republic he is the united states of america and when these embodiments pass by we do not want them scoffed at we desire that people shall be obliged to concede that they are worthily clothed and politely  our government is oddly inconsistent in this matter of official dress when its representative is a civilian who has not been a solider it restricts him to the black swallowtail and white tie but if he is a civilian who has been a solider it allows him to wear the uniform of his former rank as an official dress when general sickles was minister to spain he always wore when on official duty the dress uniform of a majorgeneral when general grant visited foreign courts he went handsomely and properly ablaze in the uniform of a full general and was introduced by diplomatic survivals of his own presidential administration the latter by official necessity went in the meek and lowly swallowtaila deliciously sarcastic contrast the one dress representing the honest and honourable dignity of the nation the other the cheap hypocrisy of the republican simplicity tradition in paris our present representative can perform his official functions reputably clothed for he was an officer in the civil war in london our late ambassador was similarly situated for he also was an officer in the civil war but mr choate must represent the great republiceven at official breakfasts at seven in the morningin that same old funny swallowtail  our governments notions about proprieties of costume are indeed very very oddas suggested by that last fact the swallowtail is recognised the world over as not wearable in the daytime it is a nightdress and a nightdress onlya nightshirt is not more so yet when our representative makes an official visit in the morning he is obliged by his government to go in that nightdress it makes the very cabhorses laugh  the truth is that for awhile during the present century and up to something short of forty years ago we had a lucid interval and dropped the republican simplicity sham and dressed our foreign representatives in a handsome and becoming official costume this was discarded byandby and the swallowtail substituted i believe it is not now known which statesman brought about this change but we all know that stupid as he was as to diplomatic proprieties in dress he would not have sent his daughter to a state ball in a cornshucking costume nor to a cornshucking in a stateball costume to be harshly criticised as an illmannered offender against the proprieties of custom in both places and we know another thing viz that he himself would not have wounded the tastes and feelings of a family of mourners by attending a funeral in their house in a costume which was an offence against the dignities and decorum prescribed by tradition and sanctified by custom yet that man was so heedless as not to reflect that all the social customs of civilised peoples are entitled to respectful observance and that no man with a right spirit of courtesy in him ever has any disposition to transgress these customs  there is still another argument for a rational diplomatic dressa business argument we are a trading nation and our representative is a business agent if he is respected esteemed and liked where he is stationed he can exercise an influence which can extend our trade and forward our prosperity a considerable number of his business activities have their field in his social relations and clothes which do not offend against local manners and customers and prejudices are a valuable part of his equipment in this matterwould be if franklin had died earlier  i have not done with gratis suggestions yet we made a great deal of valuable advance when we instituted the office of ambassador that lofty rank endows its possessor with several times as much influence consideration and effectiveness as the rank of minister bestows for the sake of the countrys dignity and for the sake of her advantage commercially we should have ambassadors not ministers at the great courts of the world  but not at present salaries no if we are to maintain present salaries let us make no more ambassadors and let us unmake those we have already made the great position without the means of respectably maintaining itthere could be no wisdom in that a foreign representative to be valuable to his country must be on good terms with the officials of the capital and with the rest of the influential folk he must mingle with this society he cannot sit at homeit is not business it butters no commercial parsnips he must attend the dinners banquets suppers balls receptions and must return these hospitalities he should return as good as he gets too for the sake of the dignity of his country and for the sake of business have we ever had a minister or an ambassador who could do this on his salary nonot once from franklins time to ours other countries understand the commercial value of properly lining the pockets of their representatives but apparently our government has not learned it england is the most successful trader of the several trading nations and she takes good care of the watchmen who keep guard in her commercial towers it has been a long time now since we needed to blush for our representatives abroad it has become custom to send our fittest we send men of distinction cultivation characterour ablest our choicest our best then we cripple their efficiency through the meagreness of their pay here is a list of salaries for english and american ministers and ambassadors         city                               salaries                                    american       english       paris                         17500       45000      berlin                         17500        40000      vienna                         12000        40000      constantinople                 10000        40000      st  petersburg                17500        39000      rome                           12000        35000      washington                                 32500    sir julian pauncefote the english ambassador at washington has a very fine house besidesat no damage to his salary  english ambassadors pay no house rent they live in palaces owned by england our representatives pay houserent out of their salaries you can judge by the above figures what kind of houses the united states of america has been used to living in abroad and what sort of returnentertaining she has done there is not a salary in our list which would properly house the representative receiving it and in addition pay 3000 toward his familys bacon and doughnutsthe strange but economical and customary fare of the american ambassadors household except on sundays when petrified boston crackers are added  the ambassadors and ministers of foreign nations not only have generous salaries but their governments provide them with money wherewith to pay a considerable part of their hospitality bills i believe our government pays no hospitality bills except those incurred by the navy through this concession to the navy that arm is able to do us credit in foreign parts and certainly that is well and politic but why the government does not think it well and politic that our diplomats should be able to do us like credit abroad is one of those mysterious inconsistencies which have been puzzling me ever since i stopped trying to understand baseball and took up statesmanship as a pastime  to return to the matter of houserent good houses properly furnished in european capitals are not to be had at small figures consequently our foreign representatives have been accustomed to live in garretssometimes on the roof being poor men it has been the best they could do on the salary which the government has paid them how could they adequately return the hospitalities shown them it was impossible it would have exhausted the salary in three months still it was their official duty to entertain their influentials after some sort of fashion and they did the best they could with their limited purse in return for champagne they furnished lemonade in return for game they furnished ham in return for whale they furnished sardines in return for liquors they furnished condensed milk in return for the battalion of liveried and powdered flunkeys they furnished the hired girl in return for the fairy wilderness of sumptuous decorations they draped the stove with the american flag in return for the orchestra they furnished zither and ballads by the family in return for the ballbut they didnt return the ball except in cases where the united states lived on the roof and had room  is this an exaggeration it can hardly be called that i saw nearly the equivalent of it a good many years ago a minister was trying to create influential friends for a project which might be worth ten millions a year to the agriculturists of the republic and our government had furnished him ham and lemonade to persuade the opposition with the minister did not succeed he might not have succeeded if his salary had been what it ought to have been50000 or 6000 a yearbut his chances would have been very greatly improved and in any case he and his dinners and his country would not have been joked about by the hardhearted and pitied by the compassionate  any experienced drummer will testify that when you want to do business there is no economy in ham and lemonade the drummer takes his country customer to the theatre the opera the circus dines him wines him entertains him all the day and all the night in luxurious style and plays upon his human nature in all seductive ways for he knows by old experience that this is the best way to get a profitable order out of him he has this reward all governments except our own play the same policy with the same end in view and they also have their reward but ours refuses to do business by business ways and sticks to ham and lemonade this is the most expensive diet known to the diplomatic service of the world  ours is the only country of first importance that pays its foreign representatives trifling salaries if we were poor we could not find great fault with these economies perhapsat least one could find a sort of plausible excuse for them but we are not poor and the excuse fails as shown above some of our important diplomatic representatives receive 12000 others 17500 these salaries are all ham and lemonade and unworthy of the flag when we have a rich ambassador in london or paris he lives as the ambassador of a country like ours ought to live and it costs him 100000 a year to do it but why should we allow him to pay that out of his private pocket there is nothing fair about it and the republic is no proper subject for any ones charity in several cases our salaries of 12000 should be 50000 and all of the salaries of 17500 ought to be 75000 or 100000 since we pay no representatives houserent our state department realises the mistake which we are making and would like to rectify it but it has not the power  when a young girl reaches eighteen she is recognised as being a woman she adds six inches to her skirt she unplaits her dangling braids and balls her hair on top of her head she stops sleeping with her little sister and has a room to herself and becomes in many ways a thundering expense but she is in society now and papa has to stand it there is no avoiding it very well the great republic lengthened her skirts last year balled up her hair and entered the worlds society this means that if she would prosper and stand fair with society she must put aside some of her dearest and darlingest young ways and superstitions and do as society does of course she can decline if she wants to but this would be unwise she ought to realise now that she has come out that this is a right and proper time to change a part of her style she is in rome and it has long been granted that when one is in rome it is good policy to do as rome does to advantage rome noto advantage herself  if our government has really paid representatives of ours on the paris commission 100000 apiece for six weeks work i feel sure that it is the best cash investment the nation has made in many years for it seems quite impossible that with that precedent on the books the government will be able to find excuses for continuing its diplomatic salaries at the present mean figure  psvienna january 10i see by this mornings telegraphic news that i am not to be the new ambassador here after all thiswell i hardly know what to say iwell of course i do not care anything about it but it is at least a surprise i have for many months been using my influence at washington to get this diplomatic see expanded into an ambassadorship with the idea of course thbut never mind let it go it is of no consequence i say it calmly for i am calm but at the same timehowever the subject has no interest for me and never had i never really intended to take the place anywayi made up my mind to it months and months ago nearly a year but now while i am calm i would like to say thisthat so long as i shall continue to possess an americans proper pride in the honour and dignity of his country i will not take any ambassadorship in the gift of the flag at a salary short of 75000 a year if i shall be charged with wanting to live beyond my countrys means i cannot help it a country which cannot afford ambassadors wages should be ashamed to have ambassadors  think of a seventeenthousandfivehundreddollar ambassador particularly for america why it is the most ludicrous spectacle the most inconsistent and incongruous spectacle contrivable by even the most diseased imagination it is a billionaire in a paper collar a king in a breechclout an archangel in a tin halo and for pure sham and hypocrisy the salary is just the match of the ambassadors official clothesthat boastful advertisement of a republican simplicity which manifests itself at home in fiftythousanddollar salaries to insurance presidents and railway lawyers and in domestic palaces whose fittings and furnishings often transcend in costly display and splendour and richness the fittings and furnishings of the palaces of the sceptred masters of europe and which has invented and exported to the old world the palacecar the sleepingcar the tramcar the electric trolley the best bicycles the best motorcars the steamheater the best and smartest systems of electric calls and telephonic aids to laziness and comfort the elevator the private bathroom hot and cold water on tap the palacehotel with its multifarious conveniences comforts shows and luxuries theoh the list is interminable in a word republican simplicity found europe with one shirt on her back so to speak as far as real luxuries conveniences and the comforts of life go and has clothed her to the chin with the latter we are the lavishest and showiest and most luxuryloving people on the earth and at our masthead we fly one true and honest symbol the gaudiest flag the world has ever seen oh republican simplicity there are many many humbugs in the world but none to which you need take off your hat       luck  notethis is not a fancy sketch i got it from a clergyman who was an instructor at woolwich forty years ago and who vouched for its truthmt  it was at a banquet in london in honour of one of the two or three conspicuously illustrious english military names of this generation for reasons which will presently appear i will withhold his real name and titles and call him lieutenantgeneral lord arthur scoresby vc kcb etc etc etc what a fascination there is in a renowned name there say the man in actual flesh whom i had heard of so many thousands of times since that day thirty years before when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a crimean battlefield to remain for ever celebrated it was food and drink to me to look and look and look at that demigod scanning searching noting the quietness the reserve the noble gravity of his countenance the simple honesty that expressed itself all over him the sweet unconsciousness of his greatnessunconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon him unconsciousness of the deep loving sincere worship welling out of the breasts of those people and flowing toward him  the clergyman at my left was an old acquaintance of mineclergyman now but had spent the first half of his life in the camp and field and as an instructor in the military school at woolwich just at the moment i have been talking about a veiled and singular light glimmered in his eyes and he leaned down and muttered confidentially to meindicating the hero of the banquet with a gestureprivatelyhis glory is an accidentjust a product of incredible luck  this verdict was a great surprise to me if its subject had been napoleon or socrates or solomon my astonishment could not have been greater  some days later came the explanation of this strange remark and this is what the reverend told me  about forty years ago i was an instructor in the military academy at woolwich i was present in one of the sections when young scoresby underwent his preliminary examination i was touched to the quick with pity for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely while hewhy dear me he didnt know anything so to speak he was evidently good and sweet and lovable and guileless and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there as serene as a graven image and deliver himself of answers which were veritably miraculous for stupidity and ignorance all the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf i said to myself when he comes to be examined again he will be flung over of course so it will be simple a harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much as i can  i took him aside and found that he knew a little of caesars history and as he didnt know anything else i went to work and drilled him like a galleyslave on a certain line of stock questions concerning caesar which i knew would be used if youll believe me he went through with flying colours on examination day he went through on that purely superficial cram and got compliments too while others who knew a thousand times more than he got plucked by some strangely lucky accidentan accident not likely to happen twice in a centuryhe was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his drill  it was stupefying well although through his course i stood by him with something of the sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled child and he always saved himselfjust by miracle apparently  now of course the thing that would expose him and kill him at last was mathematics i resolved to make his death as easy as i could so i drilled him and crammed him and crammed him and drilled him just on the line of questions which the examiner would be most likely to use and then launched him on his fate well sir try to conceive of the result to my consternation he took the first prize and with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compliments  sleep there was no more sleep for me for a week my conscience tortured me day and night what i had done i had done purely through charity and only to ease the poor youths falli never had dreamed of any such preposterous result as the thing that had happened i felt as guilty and miserable as the creator of frankenstein here was a woodenhead whom i had put in the way of glittering promotions and prodigious responsibilities and but one thing could happen he and his responsibilities would all go to ruin together at the first opportunity  the crimean war had just broken out of course there had to be a war i said to myself we couldnt have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is found out i waited for the earthquake it came and it made me reel when it did come he was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment better men grow old and gray in the service before they climb to a sublimity like that and who could ever have foreseen that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such green and inadequate shoulders i could just barely have stood it if they had made him a cornet but a captainthink of it i thought my hair would turn white  consider what i didi who so loved repose and inaction i said to myself i am responsible to the country for this and i must go along with him and protect the country against him as far as i can so i took my poor little capital that i had saved up through years of work and grinding economy and went with a sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment and away we went to the field  and thereoh dear it was awful blunders why he never did anything but blunder but you see nobody was in the fellows secreteverybody had him focused wrong and necessarily misinterpreted his performance every timeconsequently they took his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius they did honestly his mildest blunders were enough to make a man in his right mind cry and they did make me cryand rage and rave too privately and the thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension was the fact that every fresh blunder he made increased the lustre of his reputation i kept saying to myself hell get so high that when discovery does finally come it will be like the sun falling out of the sky  he went right along up from grade to grade over the dead bodies of his superiors until at last in the hottest moment of the battle of down went our colonel and my heart jumped into my mouth for scoresby was next in rank now for it said i well all land in sheol in ten minutes sure  the battle was awfully hot the allies were steadily giving way all over the field our regiment occupied a position that was vital a blunder now must be destruction at this critical moment what does this immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its place and order a charge over a neighbouring hill where there wasnt a suggestion of an enemy there you go i said to myself this is the end at last  and away we did go and were over the shoulder of the hill before the insane movement could be discovered and stopped and what did we find an entire and unsuspected russian army in reserve and what happened we were eaten up that is necessarily what would have happened in ninetynine cases out of a hundred but no those russians argued that no single regiment would come browsing around there at such a time it must be the entire english army and that the sly russian game was detected and blocked so they turned tail and away they went pellmell over the hill and down into the field in wild confusion and we after them they themselves broke the solid russia centre in the field and tore through and in no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever saw and the defeat of the allies was turned into a sweeping and splendid victory marshal canrobert looked on dizzy with astonishment admiration and delight and sent right off for scoresby and hugged him and decorated him on the field in presence of all the armies  and what was scoresbys blunder that time merely the mistaking his right hand for his leftthat was all an order had come to him to fall back and support our right and instead he fell forward and went over the hill to the left but the name he won that day as a marvellous military genius filled the world with his glory and that glory will never fade while history books last  he is just as good and sweet and lovable and unpretending as a man can be but he doesnt know enough to come in when it rains he has been pursued day by day and year by year by a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness he has been a shining soldier in all our wars for half a generation he has littered his military life with blunders and yet has never committed one that didnt make him a knight or a baronet or a lord or something look at his breast why he is just clothed in domestic and foreign decorations well sir every one of them is a record of some shouting stupidity or other and taken together they are proof that the very best thing in all this world that can befall a man is to be born lucky        the captains story  there was a good deal of pleasant gossip about old captain hurricane jones of the pacific oceanpeace to his ashes two or three of us present had known him i particularly well for i had made four seavoyages with him he was a very remarkable man he was born on a ship he picked up what little education he had among his shipmates he began life in the forecastle and climbed grade by grade to the captaincy more than fifty years of his sixtyfive were spent at sea he had sailed all oceans seen all lands and borrowed a tint from all climates when a man has been fifty years at sea he necessarily knows nothing of men nothing of the world but its surface nothing of the worlds thought nothing of the worlds learning but its a b c and that blurred and distorted by the unfocussed lenses of an untrained mind such a man is only a gray and bearded child that is what old hurricane jones wassimply an innocent lovable old infant when his spirit was in repose he was as sweet and gentle as a girl when his wrath was up he was a hurricane that made his nickname seem tamely descriptive he was formidable in a fight for he was of powerful build and dauntless courage he was frescoed from head to heel with pictures and mottoes tattooed in red and blue india ink i was with him one voyage when he got his last vacant space tattooed this vacant space was around his left ankle during three days he stumped about the ship with his ankle bare and swollen and this legend gleaming red and angry out from a clouding of india ink virtue is its own rd there was a lack of room he was deeply and sincerely pious and swore like a fishwoman he considered swearing blameless because sailors would not understand an order unillumined by it he was a profound biblical scholarthat is he thought he was he believed everything in the bible but he had his own methods of arriving at his beliefs he was of the advanced school of thinkers and applied natural laws to the interpretation of all miracles somewhat on the plan of the people who make the six days of creation six geological epochs and so forth without being aware of it he was a rather severe satirist on modern scientific religionists such a man as i have been describing is rabidly fond of disquisition and argument one knows that without being told it  one trip the captain had a clergyman on board but did not know he was a clergyman since the passenger list did not betray the fact he took a great liking to this rev mr peters and talked with him a great deal told him yarns gave him toothsome scraps of personal history and wove a glittering streak of profanity through his garrulous fabric that was refreshing to a spirit weary of the dull neutralities of undecorated speech one day the captain said peters do you ever read the bible  wellyes  i judge it aint often by the way you say it now you tackle it in dead earnest once and youll find itll pay dont you get discouraged but hang right on first you wont understand it but byandby things will begin to clear up and then you wouldnt lay it down toear  yes i have heard that said  and its so too there aint a book that begins with it it lays over em all peters theres some pretty tough things in itthere aint any getting around thatbut you stick to them and think them out and when once you get on the inside everythings plain as day  the miracles too captain  yes sir the miracles too every one of them now theres that business with the prophets of baal like enough that stumped you  well i dont know but  own up now it stumped you well i dont wonder you hadnt any experience in ravelling such things out and naturally it was too many for you would you like to have me explain that thing to you and show you how to get at the meat of these matters  indeed i would captain if you dont mind  then the captain proceeded as follows ill do it with pleasure first you see i read and read and thought and thought till i got to understand what sort of people they were in the old bible times and then after that it was clear and easy now this was the way i put it up concerning isaac1 and the prophets of baal there was some mighty sharp men amongst the public characters of that old ancient day and isaac was one of them isaac had his failingsplenty of them too it aint for me to apologise for isaac he played a cold deck on the prophets of baal and like enough he was justifiable considering the odds that was against him no all i say it t want any miracle and that ill show you sos t you can see it yourself  well times had been getting rougher and rougher for prophetsthat is prophets of isaacs denomination there were four hundred and fifty prophets of baal in the community and only one presbyterian that is if isaac was a presbyterian which i reckon he was but it dont say naturally the prophets of baal took all the trade isaac was pretty low spirited i reckon but he was a good deal of a man and no doubt he went aprophesying around letting on to be doing a landoffice business but t want any use he couldnt run any opposition to amount to anything byandby things got desperate with him he sets his head to work and thinks it all out and then what does he do why he begins to throw out hints that the other parties are this and that and tothernothing very definite may be but just kind of undermining their reputation in a quiet way this made talk of course and finally got to the king the king asked isaac what he meant by his talk says isaac oh nothing particular only can they pray down fire from heaven on an altar it aint much maybe your majesty only can they do it thats the idea so the king was a good deal disturbed and he went to the prophets of baal and they said pretty airy that if he had an altar ready they were ready and they intimated he better get it insured too  so next morning all the children of israel and their parents and the other people gathered themselves together well here was that great crowd of prophets of baal packed together on one side and isaac walking up and down all alone on the other putting up his job when time was called isaac let on to be comfortable and indifferent told the other team to take the first innings so they went at it the whole four hundred and fifty praying around the altar very hopefully and doing their level best they prayed an hourtwo hoursthree hoursand so on plumb till noon it want any use they hadnt took a trick of course they felt kind of ashamed before all those people and well they might now what would a magnanimous man do keep still wouldnt he of course what did isaac do he graveled the prophets of baal every way he could think of says he you dont speak up loud enough your gods asleep like enough or may be hes taking a walk you want to holler you know or words to that effect i dont recollect the exact language mind i dont apologise for isaac he had his faults  well the prophets of baal prayed along the best they knew how all the afternoon and never raised a spark at last about sundown they were all tuckered out and they owned up and quit  what does isaac do now he steps up and says to some friends of his there pour four barrels of water on the altar everybody was astonished for the other side had prayed at it dry you know and got whitewashed they poured it on says he heave on four more barrels then he says heave on four more twelve barrels you see altogether the water ran all over the altar and all down the sides and filled up a trench around it that would hold a couple of hogsheadsmeasures it says i reckon it means about a hogshead some of the people were going to put on their things and go for they allowed he was crazy they didnt know isaac isaac knelt down and began to pray he strung along and strung along about the heathen in distant lands and about the sister churches and about the state and the country at large and about those thats in authority in the government and all the usual programme you know till everybody had got tired and gone to thinking about something else and then all of a sudden when nobody was noticing he outs with a match and rakes it on the under side of his leg and pff up the whole thing blazes like a house afire twelve barrels of water petroleum sir petroleum thats what it was  petroleum captain  yes sir the country was full of it isaac knew all about that you read the bible dont you worry about the tough places they aint tough when you come to think them out and throw light on them there aint a thing in the bible but what is true all you want is to go prayerfully to work and cipher out how twas done  1 this is the captains own mistake       stirring times in austria   i the government in the fryingpan  here in vienna in these closing days of 1897 ones blood gets no chance to stagnate the atmosphere is brimful of political electricity all conversation is political every man is a battery with brushes overworn and gives out blue sparks when you set him going on the common topic everybody has an opinion and lets you have it frank and hot and out of this multitude of counsel you get merely confusion and despair for no one really understands this political situation or can tell you what is going to be the outcome of it  things have happened here recently which would set any country but austria on fire from end to end and upset the government to a certainty but no one feels confident that such results will follow here here apparently one must wait and see what will happen then he will know and not before guessing is idle guessing cannot help the matter this is what the wise tell you they all say it they say it every day and it is the sole detail upon which they all agree  there is some approach to agreement upon another point that there will be no revolution men say look at our history revolutions have not been in our line and look at our political map its construction is unfavourable to an organised uprising and without unity what could a revolt accomplish it is disunion which has held our empire together for centuries and what it has done in the past it may continue to do now and in the future  the most intelligible sketch i have encountered of this unintelligible arrangement of things was contributed to the travellers record by mr forrest morgan of hartford three years ago he says       the austrohungarian monarchy is the patchworkquilt the midway      plaisance the national chaingang of europe a state that is not a      nation but a collection of nations some with national memories and      aspirations and others without some occupying distinct provinces      almost purely their own and others mixed with alien races but each      with a different language and each mostly holding the others      foreigners as much as if the link of a common government did not      exist  only one of its races even now comprises so much as      onefourth of the whole and not another so much as onesixth and      each has remained for ages as unchanged in isolation however      mingled together in locality as globules of oil in water  there      is nothing else in the modern world that is nearly like it though      there have been plenty in past ages it seems unreal and impossible      even though we know it is true it violates all our feeling as to      what a country should be in order to have a right to exist and it      seems as though it was too ramshackle to go on holding together any      length of time yet it has survived much in its present shape two      centuries of storms that have swept perfectly unified countries      from existence and others that have brought it to the verge of      ruin has survived formidable european coalitions to dismember it      and has steadily gained force after each forever changing in its      exact makeup losing in the west but gaining in the east the      changes leave the structure as firm as ever like the dropping off      and adding on of logs in a raft its mechanical union of pieces      showing all the vitality of genuine national life  that seems to confirm and justify the prevalent austrian faith that in this confusion of unrelated and irreconcilable elements this condition of incurable disunion there is strengthfor the government nearly every day some one explains to me that a revolution would not succeed here it couldnt you know broadly speaking all the nations in the empire hate the governmentbut they all hate each other too and with devoted and enthusiastic bitterness no two of them can combine the nation that rises must rise alone then the others would joyfully join the government against her and she would have just a flys chance against a combination of spiders this government is entirely independent it can go its own road and do as it pleases it has nothing to fear in countries like england and america where there is one tongue and the public interests are common the government must take account of public opinion but in austriahungary there are nineteen public opinionsone for each state notwo or three for each state since there are two or three nationalities in each a government cannot satisfy all these public opinions it can only go through the motions of trying this government does that it goes through the motions and they do not succeed but that does not worry the government much  the next man will give you some further information the government has a policya wise oneand sticks to it this policy istranquillity keep this hive of excitable nations as quiet as possible encourage them to amuse themselves with things less inflammatory that politics to this end it furnishes them an abundance of catholic priests to teach them to be docile and obedient and to be diligent in acquiring ignorance about things here below and knowledge about the kingdom of heaven to whose historic delights they are going to add the charm of their society byandby and furtherto this same endit cools off the newspapers every morning at five oclock whenever warm events are happening there is a censor of the press and apparently he is always on duty and hard at work a copy of each morning paper is brought to him at five oclock his official wagons wait at the doors of the newspaper offices and scud to him with the first copies that come from the press his company of assistants read every line in these papers and mark everything which seems to have a dangerous look then he passes final judgment upon these markings two things conspire to give to the results a capricious and unbalanced look his assistants have diversified notions as to what is dangerous and what isnt he cant get time to examine their criticisms in much detail and so sometimes the very same matter which is suppressed in one paper fails to be damned in another one and gets published in full feather and unmodified then the paper in which it was suppressed blandly copies the forbidden matter into its evening editionprovokingly giving credit and detailing all the circumstances in courteous and inoffensive languageand of course the censor cannot say a word  sometimes the censor sucks all the blood out of a newspaper and leaves it colourless and inane sometimes he leaves it undisturbed and lets it talk out its opinions with a frankness and vigour hardly to be surpassed i think in the journals of any country apparently the censor sometimes revises his verdicts upon second thought for several times lately he has suppressed journals after their issue and partial distribution the distributed copies are then sent for by the censor and destroyed i have two of these but at the time they were sent for i could not remember what i had done with them  if the censor did his work before the morning edition was printed he would be less of an inconvenience than he is but of course the papers cannot wait many minutes after five oclock to get his verdict they might as well go out of business as do that so they print and take their chances then if they get caught by a suppression they must strike out the condemned matter and print the edition over again that delays the issue several hours and is expensive besides the government gets the suppressed edition for nothing if it bought it that would be joyful and would give great satisfaction also the edition would be larger some of the papers do not replace the condemned paragraphs with other matter they merely snatch they out and leave blanks behindmourning blanks marked confiscated  the government discourages the dissemination of newspaper information in other ways for instance it does not allow newspapers to be sold on the streets therefore the newsboy is unknown in vienna and there is a stamp duty of nearly a cent upon each copy of a newspapers issue every american paper that reaches me has a stamp upon it which has been pasted there in the postoffice or downstairs in the hotel office but no matter who put it there i have to pay for it and that is the main thing sometimes friends send me so many papers that it takes all i can earn that week to keep this government going  i must take passing notice of another point in the governments measures for maintaining tranquillity everybody says it does not like to see any individual attain to commanding influence in the country since such a man can become a disturber and an inconvenience we have as much talent as the other nations says the citizen resignedly and without bitterness but for the sake of the general good of the country we are discouraged from making it overconspicuous and not only discouraged but tactfully and skillfully prevented from doing it if we show too much persistence consequently we have no renowned men in centuries we have seldom produced onethat is seldom allowed one to produce himself we can say today what no other nation of first importance in the family of christian civilisations can saythat there exists no austrian who has made an enduring name for himself which is familiar all around the globe  another helper toward tranquillity is the army it is as pervasive as the atmosphere it is everywhere all the mentioned creators promoters and preservers of the public tranquillity do their several shares in the quieting work they make a restful and comfortable serenity and reposefulness this is disturbed sometimes for a little while a mob assembles to protest against something it gets noisynoisierstill noisierfinally too noisy then the persuasive soldiery comes charging down upon it and in a few minutes all is quiet again and there is no mob  there is a constitution and there is a parliament the house draws its membership of 425 deputies from the nineteen or twenty states heretofore mentioned these men represent peoples who speak eleven different languages that means eleven distinct varieties of jealousies hostilities and warring interests this could be expected to furnish forth a parliament of a pretty inharmonious sort and make legislation difficult at timesand it does that the parliament is split up into many partiesthe clericals the progressists the german nationalists the young czechs the social democrats the christian socialists and some othersand it is difficult to get up working combinations among them they prefer to fight apart sometimes  the recent troubles have grown out of count badenis necessities he could not carry on his government without a majority vote in the house at his back and in order to secure it he had to make a trade of some sort he made it with the czechsthe bohemians the terms were not easy for him he must issue an ordinance making the czech tongue the official language in bohemia in place of the german this created a storm all the germans in austria were incensed in numbers they form but a fourth part of the empires population but they urge that the countrys public business should be conducted in one common tongue and that tongue a world languagewhich german is  however badeni secured his majority the german element in parliament was apparently become helpless the czech deputies were exultant  then the music began badenis voyage instead of being smooth was disappointingly rough from the start the government must get the ausgleich through it must not fail badenis majority was ready to carry it through but the minority was determined to obstruct it and delay it until the obnoxious czechlanguage measure should be shelved  the ausgleich is an adjustment arrangement settlement which holds austria and hungary together it dates from 1867 and has to be renewed every ten years it establishes the share which hungary must pay toward the expenses of the imperial government hungary is a kingdom the emperor of austria is its king and has its own parliament and governmental machinery but it has no foreign office and it has no armyat least its army is a part of the imperial army is paid out of the imperial treasury and is under the control of the imperial war office  the tenyear arrangement was due a year ago but failed to connect at least completely a years compromise was arranged a new arrangement must be effected before the last day of this year otherwise the two countries become separate entities the emperor would still be king of hungarythat is king of an independent foreign country there would be hungarian customhouses on the austrian border and there would be a hungarian army and a hungarian foreign office both countries would be weakened by this both would suffer damage  the opposition in the house although in the minority had a good weapon to fight with in the pending ausgleich if it could delay the ausgleich a few weeks the government would doubtless have to withdraw the hated language ordinance or lose hungary  the opposition began its fight its arms were the rules of the house it was soon manifest that by applying these rules ingeniously it could make the majority helpless and keep it so as long as it pleased it could shut off business every now and then with a motion to adjourn it could require the ayes and noes on the motion and use up thirty minutes on that detail it could call for the reading and verification of the minutes of the preceding meeting and use up half a day in that way it could require that several of its members be entered upon the list of permitted speakers previously to the opening of a sitting and as there is no timelimit further delays could thus be accomplished  these were all lawful weapons and the men of the opposition technically called the left were within their rights in using them they used them to such dire purpose that all parliamentary business was paralysed the right the government side could accomplish nothing then it had a saving idea this idea was a curious one it was to have the president and the vicepresidents of the parliament trample the rules under foot upon occasion  this for a profoundly embittered minority constructed out of fire and guncotton it was time for idle strangers to go and ask leave to look down out of a gallery and see what would be the result of it   ii a memorable sitting  and now took place that memorable sitting of the house which broke two records it lasted the best part of two days and a night surpassing by half an hour the longest sitting known to the worlds previous parliamentary history and breaking the longspeech record with dr lechers twelvehour effort the longest flow of unbroken talk that ever came out of one mouth since the world began  at 845 on the evening of the 28th of october when the house had been sitting a few minutes short of ten hours dr lecher was granted the floor it was a good place for theatrical effects i think that no other senate house is so shapely as this one or so richly and showily decorated its plan is that of an operahouse up toward the straight side of itthe stage siderise a couple of terraces of desks for the ministry and the official clerks or secretariesterraces thirty feet long and each supporting about half a dozen desks with spaces between them above these is the presidents terrace against the wall along it are distributed the proper accommodations for the presiding officer and his assistants the wall is of richly coloured marble highly polished its paneled sweep relieved by fluted columns and pilasters of distinguished grace and dignity which glow softly and frostily in the electric light around the spacious halfcircle of the floor bends the great twostoried curve of the boxes its frontage elaborately ornamented and sumptuously gilded on the floor of the house the 425 desks radiate fanwise from the presidents tribune  the galleries are crowded on this particular evening for word has gone about that the ausgleich is before the house that the president ritter von abrahamowicz has been throttling the rules that the opposition are in an inflammable state in consequence and that the night session is likely to be of an exciting sort  the gallery guests are fashionably dressed and the finery of the women makes a bright and pretty show under the strong electric light but down on the floor there is no costumery  the deputies are dressed in day clothes some of the clothes neat and trim others not there may be three members in evening dress but not more there are several catholic priests in their long black gowns and with crucifixes hanging from their necks no member wears his hat one may see by these details that the aspects are not those of an evening sitting of an english house of commons but rather those of a sitting of our house of representatives  in his high place sits the president abrahamowicz object of the oppositions limitless hatred he is sunk back in the depths of his armchair and has his chin down he brings the ends of his spread fingers together in front of his breast and reflectively taps them together with the air of one who would like to begin business but must wait and be as patient as he can it makes you think of richelieu now and then he swings his head up to the left or to the right and answers something which some one has bent down to say to him then he taps his fingers again he looks tired and maybe a trifle harassed he is a grayhaired long slender man with a colourless long face which in repose suggests a deathmask but when not in repose is tossed and rippled by a turbulent smile which washes this way and that and is not easy to keep up witha pious smile a holy smile a saintly smile a deprecating smile a beseeching and supplicating smile and when it is at work the large mouth opens and the flexible lips crumple and unfold and crumple again and move around in a genial and persuasive and angelic way and expose large glimpses of the teeth and that interrupts the sacredness of the smile and gives it momentarily a mixed worldly and political and satanic cast it is a most interesting face to watch and then the long hands and the bodythey furnish great and frequent help to the face in the business of adding to the force of the statesmans words  to change the tense at the time of which i have just been speaking the crowds in the galleries were gazing at the stage and the pit with rapt interest and expectancy one half of the great fan of desks was in effect empty vacant in the other half several hundred members were bunched and jammed together as solidly as the bristles in a brush and they also were waiting and expecting presently the chair delivered this utterance  dr lecher has the floor  then burst out such another wild and frantic and deafening clamour as has not been heard on this planet since the last time the comanches surprised a white settlement at night yells from the left counteryells from the right explosions of yells from all sides at once and all the air sawed and pawed and clawed and cloven by a writhing confusion of gesturing arms and hands out of the midst of this thunder and turmoil and tempest rose dr lecher serene and collected and the providential length of his enabled his head to show out of it he began his twelvehour speech at any rate his lips could be seen to move and that was evidence on high sat the president imploring order with his long hands put together as in prayer and his lips visibly but not hearably speaking at intervals he grasped his bell and swung it up and down with vigour adding its keen clamour to the storm weltering there below  dr lecher went on with his pantomime speech contented untroubled here and there and now and then powerful voices burst above the din and delivered an ejaculation that was heard then the din ceased for a moment or two and gave opportunity to hear what the chair might answer then the noise broke out again apparently the president was being charged with all sorts of illegal exercises of power in the interest of the right the government side among these with arbitrarily closing an order of business before it was finished with an unfair distribution of the right to the floor with refusal of the floor upon quibble and protest to members entitled to it with stopping a speakers speech upon quibble and protest and with other transgressions of the rules of the house one of the interrupters who made himself heard was a young fellow of slight build and neat dress who stood a little apart from the solid crowd and leaned negligently with folded arms and feet crossed against a desk trim and handsome strong face and thin features black hair roughed up parsimonious moustache resonant great voice of good tone and pitch it is wolf capable and hospitable with sword and pistol fighter of the recent duel with count badeni the head of the government he shot badeni through the arm and then walked over in the politest way and inspected his game shook hands expressed regret and all that out of him came early this thundering peal audible above the storm  i demand the floor i wish to offer a motion  in the sudden lull which followed the president answered dr lecher has the floor  wolf i move the close of the sitting  p representative lecher has the floor stormy outburst from the leftthat is the opposition  wolf i demand the floor for the introduction of a formal notion pause mr president are you going to grant it or not crash of approval from the left i will keep on demanding the floor till i get it  p i call representative wolf to order dr lecher has the floor  wolf mr president are you going to observe the rules of this house tempest of applause and confused ejaculations from the lefta boom and roar which long endured and stopped all business for the time being  dr von pessler by the rules motions are in order and the chair must put them to vote  for answer the president who is a polei make this remark in passing began to jangle his bell with energy at the moment that that wild pandemonium of voices broke out again  wolf hearable above the storm mr president i demand the floor we intend to find out here and now which is the hardest a poles skull or a germans  this brought out a perfect cyclone of satisfaction from the left in the midst of it someone again moved an adjournment the president blandly answered that dr lecher had the floor which was true and he was speaking too calmly earnestly and argumentatively and the official stenographers had left their places and were at his elbows taking down his words he leaning and orating into their earsa most curious and interesting scene  dr von pessler to the chair do not drive us to extremities  the tempest burst out again yells of approval from the left catcalls and ironical laughter from the right at this point a new and most effective noisemaker was pressed into service each desk has an extension consisting of a removable board eighteen inches long six wide and a halfinch thick a member pulled one of these out and began to belabour the top of his desk with it instantly other members followed suit and perhaps you can imagine the result of all conceivable rackets it is the most earsplitting intolerable and altogether fiendish  the persecuted president leaned back in his chair closed his eyes clasped his hands in his lap and a look of pathetic resignation crept over his long face it is the way a country schoolmaster used to look in days long past when he had refused his school a holiday and it had risen against him in illmannered riot and violence and insurrection twice a motion to adjourn had been offereda motion always in order in other houses and doubtless so in this one also the president had refused to put these motions by consequence he was not in a pleasant place now and was having a right hard time votes upon motions whether carried or defeated could make endless delay and postpone the ausgleich to next century  in the midst of these sorrowful circumstances and this hurricane of yells and screams and satanic clatter of deskboards representative dr kronawetter unfeelingly reminds the chair that a motion has been offered and adds say yes or no what do you sit there for and give no answer  p after i have given a speaker the floor i cannot give it to another after dr lecher is through i will put your motion storm of indignation from the left  wolf to the chair thunder and lightning look at the rule governing the case  kronawetter i move the close of the sitting and i demand the ayes and noes  dr lecher mr president have i the floor  p you have the floor  wolf to the chair in a stentorian voice which cleaves its way through the storm it is by such brutalities as these that you drive us to extremities are you waiting till someone shall throw into your face the word that shall describe what you are bringing about1 tempest of insulted fury from the right is that what you are waiting for old grayhead longcontinued clatter of deskboards from the left with shouts of the vote the vote an ironical shout from the right wolf is boss  wolf keeps on demanding the floor for his motion at length  p i call representative wolf to order your conduct is unheard of sir you forget that you are in a parliament you must remember where you are sir applause from the right dr lecher is still peacefully speaking the stenographers listening at his lips  wolf banging on his desk with his deskboard i demand the floor for my motion i wont stand this trampling of the rules under footno not if i die for it i will never yield you have got to stop me by force have i the floor  p representative wolf what kind of behaviour is this i call you to order again you should have some regard for your dignity  dr lecher speaks on wolf turns upon him with an offensive innuendo  dr lecher mr wolf i beg you to refrain from that sort of suggestions storm of handclapping from the right  this was applause from the enemy for lecher himself like wolf was an obstructionist  wolf growls to lecher you can scribble that applause in your album  p once more i call representative wolf to order do not forget that you are a representative sir  wolf slambanging with his deskboard i will force this matter are you going to grant me the floor or not  and still the sergeantatarms did not appear it was because there wasnt any it is a curious thing but the chair has no effectual means of compelling order  after some more interruptions  wolf banging with his board i demand the floor i will not yield  p i have no recourse against representative wolf in the presence of behaviour like this it is to be regretted that such is the case a shout from the right throw him out  it is true he had no effective recourse he had an official called an ordner whose help he could invoke in desperate cases but apparently the ordner is only a persuader not a compeller apparently he is a sergeantatarms who is not loaded a good enough gun to look at but not valuable for business  for another twenty or thirty minutes wolf went on banging with his board and demanding his rights then at last the weary president threatened to summon the dread ordermaker but both his manner and his words were reluctant evidently it grieved him to have to resort to this dire extremity he said to wolf if this goes on i shall feel obliged to summon the ordner and beg him to restore order in the house  wolf id like to see you do it suppose you fetch in a few policemen too great tumult are you going to put my motion to adjourn or not  dr lecher continues his speech wolf accompanies him with his boardclatter  the president despatches the ordner dr lang himself a deputy on his orderrestoring mission wolf with his board uplifted for defence confronts the ordner with a remark which boss tweed might have translated into now lets see what you are going to do about it noise and tumult all over the house  wolf stands upon his rights and says he will maintain them until he is killed in his tracks then he resumes his banging the president jangles his bell and begs for order and the rest of the house augments the racket the best it can  wolf i require an adjournment because i find myself personally threatened laughter from the right not that i fear for myself i am only anxious about what will happen to the man who touches me  the ordner i am not going to fight with you  nothing came of the efforts of the angel of peace and he presently melted out of the scene and disappeared wolf went on with his noise and with his demands that he be granted the floor resting his board at intervals to discharge criticisms and epithets at the chair once he reminded the chairman of his violated promise to grant him wolf the floor and said whence i came we call promisebreakers rascals and he advised the chairman to take his conscience to bed with him and use it as a pillow another time he said that the chair was making itself ridiculous before all europe in fact some of wolfs language was almost unparliamentary byandby he struck the idea of beating out a tune with his board later he decided to stop asking for the floor and to confer it upon himself and so he and dr lecher now spoke at the same time and mingled their speeches with the other noises and nobody heard either of them wolf rested himself now and then from speechmaking by reading in his clarion voice from a pamphlet  i will explain that dr lecher was not making a twelvehour speech for pastime but for an important purpose it was the governments intention to push the ausgleich through its preliminary stages in this one sitting for which it was the order of the day and then by vote refer it to a select committee it was the majoritys schemeas charged by the oppositionto drown debate upon the bill by pure noisedrown it out and stop it the debate being thus ended the vote upon the reference would followwith victory for the government but into the governments calculations had not entered the possibility of a singlebarrelled speech which should occupy the entire timelimit of the setting and also get itself delivered in spite of all the noise goliath was not expecting david but david was there and during twelve hours he tranquilly pulled statistical historical and argumentative pebbles out of his scrip and slung them at the giant and when he was done he was victor and the day was saved  in the english house an obstructionist has held the floor with biblereadings and other outside matters but dr lecher could not have that restful and recuperative privilegehe must confine himself strictly to the subject before the house more than once when the president could not hear him because of the general tumult he sent persons to listen and report as to whether the orator was speaking to the subject or not  the subject was a peculiarly difficult one and it would have troubled any other deputy to stick to it three hours without exhausting his ammunition because it required a vast and intimate knowledgedetailed and particularised knowledgeof the commercial railroading financial and international banking relations existing between two great sovereignties hungary and the empire but dr lecher is president of the board of trade of his city of brunn and was master of the situation his speech was not formally prepared he had a few notes jotted down for his guidance he had his facts in his head his heard was in his work and for twelve hours he stood there undisturbed by the clamour around him and with grace and ease and confidence poured out the riches of his mind in closely reasoned arguments clothed in eloquent and faultless phrasing  he is a young man of thirtyseven he is tall and wellproportioned and has cultivated and fortified his muscle by mountainclimbing if he were a little handsomer he would sufficiently reproduce for me the chauncey depew of the great new england dinner nights of some years ago he has depews charm of manner and graces of language and delivery  there was but one way for dr lecher to hold the floorhe must stay on his legs if he should sit down to rest a moment the floor would be taken from him by the enemy in the chair when he had been talking three or four hours he himself proposed an adjournment in order that he might get some rest from his wearing labours but he limited his motion with the condition that if it was lost he should be allowed to continue his speech and if it was carried he should have the floor at the next sitting wolf was now appeased and withdrew his own thousandtimesoffered motion and dr lechers was voted uponand lost so he went on speaking  by one oclock in the morning excitement and noisemaking had tired out nearly everybody but the orator gradually the seats of the right underwent depopulation the occupants had slipped out to the refreshmentrooms to eat and drink or to the corridors to chat some one remarked that there was no longer a quorum present and moved a call of the house the chair vicepresident dr kramarz refused to put it to vote there was a small dispute over the legality of this ruling but the chair held its ground  the left remained on the battlefield to support their champion he went steadily on with his speech and always it was strong virile felicitous and to the point he was earning applause and this enabled his party to turn that fact to account now and then they applauded him a couple of minutes on a stretch and during that time he could stop speaking and rest his voice without having the floor taken from him  at a quarter to two a member of the left demanded that dr lecher be allowed a recess for rest and said that the chairman was heartless dr lecher himself asked for ten minutes the chair allowed him five before the time had run out dr lecher was on his feet again  wolf burst out again with a motion to adjourn refused by the chair wolf said the whole parliament wasnt worth a pinch of powder the chair retorted that that was true in a case where a single member was able to make all parliamentary business impossible dr lecher continued his speech  the members of the majority went out by detachments from time to time and took naps upon sofas in the receptionrooms and also refreshed themselves with food and drinkin quantities nearly unbelievablebut the minority stayed loyally by their champion some distinguished deputies of the majority stayed by him too compelled thereto by admiration of his great performance when a man has been speaking eight hours is it conceivable that he can still be interesting still fascinating when dr lecher had been speaking eight hours he was still compactly surrounded by friends who would not leave him and by foes of all parties who could not and all hung enchanted and wondering upon his words and all testified their admiration with constant and cordial outbursts of applause surely this was a triumph without precedent in history  during the twelvehour effort friends brought to the orator three glasses of wine four cups of coffee and one glass of beera most stingy reenforcement of his wasting tissues but the hostile chair would permit no addition to it but no matter the chair could not beat that man he was a garrison holding a fort and was not to be starved out  when he had been speaking eight hours his pulse was 72 when he had spoken twelve it was 100  he finished his long speech in these terms as nearly as a permissibly free translation can convey them  i will now hasten to close my examination of the subject i conceive that we of the left have made it clear to the honourable gentlemen of the other side of the house that we are stirred by no intemperate enthusiasm for this measure in its present shape  what we require and shall fight for with all lawful weapons is a formal comprehensive and definitive solution and settlement of these vexed matters we desire the restoration of the earlier condition of things the cancellation of all this incapable governments pernicious trades with hungary and thenrelease from the sorry burden of the badeni ministry  i voice the hopei know not if it will be fulfilledi voice the deep and sincere and patriotic hope that the committee into whose hands this bill will eventually be committed will take its stand upon high ground and will return the ausgleichprovisorium to this house in a form which shall make it the protector and promoter alike of the great interests involved and of the honour of our fatherland after a pause turning towards the government benches but in any case gentlemen of the majority make sure of this henceforth as before you find us at our post the germans of austria will neither surrender nor die  then burst a storm of applause which rose and fell rose and fell burst out again and again and again explosion after explosion hurricane after hurricane with no apparent promise of ever coming to an end and meantime the whole left was surging and weltering about the champion all bent upon wringing his hand and congratulating him and glorifying him  finally he got away and went home and ate five loaves and twelve baskets of fish read the morning papers slept three hours took a short drive then returned to the house and sat out the rest of the thirtythreehour session  to merely stand up in one spot twelve hours on a stretch is a feat which very few men could achieve to add to the task the utterance of a hundred thousand words would be beyond the possibilities of the most of those few to superimpose the requirement that the words should be put into the form of a compact coherent and symmetrical oration would probably rule out the rest of the few bar dr lecher   iiicurious parliamentary etiquette  in consequence of dr lechers twelvehour speech and the other obstructions furnished by the minority the famous thirtythreehour sitting of the house accomplished nothing the government side had made a supreme effort assisting itself with all the helps at hand both lawful and unlawful yet had failed to get the ausgleich into the hands of a committee this was a severe defeat the right was mortified the left jubilant  parliament was adjourned for a weekto let the members cool off perhapsa sacrifice of precious time for but two months remained in which to carry the allimportant ausgleich to a consummation  if i have reported the behaviour of the house intelligibly the reader has been surprised by it and has wondered whence these lawmakers come and what they are made of and he has probably supposed that the conduct exhibited at the long sitting was far out of the common and due to special excitement and irritation as to the makeup of the house it is this the deputies come from all the walks of life and from all the grades of society there are princes counts barons priests peasants mechanics labourers lawyers judges physicians professors merchants bankers shopkeepers they are religious men they are earnest sincere devoted and they hate the jews the title of doctor is so common in the house that one may almost say that the deputy who does not bear it is by that reason conspicuous i am assured that it is not a selfgranted title and not an honorary one but an earned one that in austria it is very seldom conferred as a mere compliment that in austria the degrees of doctor of music doctor of philosophy and so on are not conferred by the seats of learning and so when an austrian is called doctor it means that he is either a lawyer or a physician and that he is not a selfeducated man but is collegebred and has been diplomaed for merit  that answers the question of the constitution of the house now as to the houses curious manners the manners exhibited by this convention of doctors were not at that time being tried as a wholly new experiment i will go back to a previous sitting in order to show that the deputies had already had some practice  there had been an incident the dignity of the house had been wounded by improprieties indulged in in its presence by a couple of the members this matter was placed in the hands of a committee to determine where the guilt lay and the degree of it and also to suggest the punishment the chairman of the committee brought in his report by this it appeared that in the course of a speech deputy schrammel said that religion had no proper place in the public schoolsit was a private matter whereupon deputy gregorig shouted how about free love  to this deputy iro flung out this retort sodawater at the wimberger  this appeared to deeply offend deputy gregorig who shouted back at iro you cowardly blatherskite say that again  the committee had sat three hours gregorig had apologised iro explained that he didnt say anything about sodawater at the wimberger he explained in writing and was very explicit i declare upon my word of honour that i did not say the words attributed to me  unhappily for his word of honour it was proved by the official stenographers and by the testimony of several deputies that he did say them  the committee did not officially know why the apparently inconsequential reference to sodawater at the wimberger should move deputy gregorig to call the utterer of it a cowardly blatherskite still after proper deliberation it was of the opinion that the house ought to formally censure the whole business this verdict seems to have been regarded as sharply severe i think so because deputy dr lueger burgermeister of vienna felt it a duty to soften the blow to his friend gregorig by showing that the sodawater remark was not so innocuous as it might look that indeed gregorigs tough retory was justifiableand he proceeded to explain why he read a number of scandalous postcards which he intimated had proceeded from iro as indicated by the handwriting though they were anonymous some of them were posted to gregorig at his place of business and could have been read by all his subordinates the others were posted to gregorigs wife lueger did not saybut everybody knewthat the cards referred to a matter of town gossip which made mr gregorig a chief actor in a tavern scene where siphonsquirting played a prominent and humorous part and wherein women had a share  there were several of the cards more than several in fact no fewer than five were sent in one day dr lueger read some of them and described others some of them had pictures on them one a picture of a hog with a monstrous snout and beside it a squirting sodasiphon below it some sarcastic doggerel  gregorig dealt in shirts cravats etc one of the cards bore these words muchrespected deputy and collarseweror stealer  another hurrah for the christiansocial work among the womenassemblages hurrah for the sodasquirter comment by dr lueger i cannot venture to read the rest of that one nor the signature either  another would you mind telling me if comment by dr lueger the rest of it is not properly readable  to deputy gregorigs wife muchrespected madam gregorigthe undersigned desires an invitation to the next sodasquirt comment by dr lueger neither the rest of the card nor the signature can i venture to read to the house so vulgar are they  the purpose of this cardto expose gregorig to his familywas repeated in others of these anonymous missives  the house by vote censured the two improper deputies  this may have had a modifying effect upon the phraseology of the membership for a while and upon its general exuberance also but it was not for long as has been seen it had become lively once more on the night of the long sitting at the next sitting after the long one there was certainly no lack of liveliness the president was persistently ignoring the rules of the house in the interest of the government side and the minority were in an unappeasable fury about it the ceaseless din and uproar the shouting and stamping and deskbanging were deafening but through it all burst voices now and then that made themselves heard some of the remarks were of a very candid sort and i believe that if they had been uttered in our house of representatives they would have attracted attention i will insert some samples here not in their order but selected on their merits  mr mayreder to the president you have lied you conceded the floor to me make it good or you have lied  mr glockner to the president leave get out  wolf indicating the president there sits a man to whom a certain title belongs  unto wolf who is continuously reading in a powerful voice from a newspaper arrive these personal remarks from

is said to know how to trim his political sails to catch any favouring wind that blows he manages to say a few words then the tempest overwhelms him again  wolf stops reading his paper a moment to say a drastic thing about lueger and his christiansocial pieties which sets the css in a sort of frenzy  mr vielohlawek you leave the christian socialists alone you wordofhonourbreaker obstruct all you want to but you leave them alone youve no business in this house you belong in a ginmill  mr prochazka in a lunaticasylum you mean  vielohlawek its a pity that such man should be leader of the germans

we are back fifty years ago in the arkansas legislature and we think we know what is going to happen and are glad we came and glad we are up in the gallery out of the way where we can see the whole

market report now  remark flung across the house to schonerer die grossmutter auf dem misthaufen erzeugt worden  it will be judicious not to translate that its flavour is pretty high in any case but it becomes particularly gamy when you remember that the first gallery was well stocked with ladies  apparently it was a great hit it fetched thunders of joyous enthusiasm out of the christian socialists and in their rapture they flung biting epithets with wasteful liberality at specially detested members of the opposition among others this one at schonerer bordell in der krugerstrasse then they added these words which they whooped howled and also even sand in a deepvoiced chorus schmul leeb kohn schmul leeb kohn schmul leeb kohn and made it splendidly audible above the banging of deskboards and the rest of the roaring cyclone of fiendish noises a gallery witticism comes flitting by from mouth to mouth around the great curve the swansong of austrian representative government

stands vast and conspicuous and conceited and selfsatisfied and roosterish and inconsequential at luegers elbow and is proud and cocky to be in such a great company he looks very well indeed really majestic and aware of it he crows out his little empty remark now and then and looks as pleased as if he had been delivered of the ausgleich indeed he does look notably fine he wears almost the only dress vest on the floor it exposes a continental spread of white shirtfront his hands are posed at ease in the lips of his trousers pockets his head is tilted back complacently he is attitudinising he is playing to the gallery however they are all doing that it is curious to see men who only vote and cant make speeches and dont know how to invent witty ejaculations wander about the vacated parts of the floor and stop in a good place and strike attitudesattitudes suggestive of weighty thought mostlyand glance furtively up at the galleries to see how it works or a couple will come together and shake hands in an artificial way and laugh a gay manufactured laugh and do some constrained and selfconscious attitudinising and they steal glances at the galleries to see if they are getting notice it is like a scene on the stagebyplay by minor actors at the back while the stars do the great work at the front even count badeni attitudinises for a moment strikes a reflective napoleonic attitude of fine picturesquenessbut soon thinks better of it and desists there are two who do not attitudinisepoor harried and insulted president abrahamowicz who seems wholly miserable and can find no way to put in the dreary time but by swinging his bell and discharging occasional remarks which nobody can hear and a resigned and patient priest who sits lonely in a great vacancy on majority territory and munches an apple  schonerer uplifts his foghorn of a voice and shakes the roof with an insult discharged at the majority  dr lueger the honourless party would better keep still here  gregorig the echo swelling out his shirtfront yes keep quiet pimp  schonerer to lueger political mountebank  prochazka to schonerer drunken clown  during the final hour of the sitting many happy phrases were distributed through the proceedings among them were theseand they are strikingly good ones  blatherskite  blackguard  scoundrel  brotheldaddy  this last was the contribution of dr gessman and gave great satisfaction and deservedly it seems to me that it was one of the most sparkling things that was said during the whole evening  at halfpast two in the morning the house adjourned the victory was with the opposition no not quite that the effective part of it was snatched away from them by an unlawful exercise of presidential forceanother contribution toward driving the mistreated minority out of their minds  at other sittings of the parliament gentlemen of the opposition shaking their fists toward the president addressed him as polish dog at one sitting an angry deputy turned upon a colleague and shouted   you must try to imagine what it was if i should offer it even in the original it would probably not get by the editors blue pencil to offer a translation would be to waste my ink of course this remark was frankly printed in its entirety by one of the vienna dailies but the others disguised the toughest half of it with stars  if the reader will go back over this chapter and gather its array of extraordinary epithets into a bunch and examine them he will marvel at two things how this convention of gentlemen could consent to use such gross terms and why the users were allowed to get out the place alive there is no way to understand this strange situation if every man in the house were a professional blackguard and had his home in a sailor boardinghouse one could still not understand it for although that sort do use such terms they never take them these men are not professional blackguards they are mainly gentlemen and educated yet they use the terms and take them too they really seem to attach no consequence to them one cannot say that they act like schoolboys for that is only almost true not entirely schoolboys blackguard each other fiercely and by the hour and one would think that nothing would ever come of it but noise but that would be a mistake up to a certain limit the result would be noise only but that limit overstepped trouble would follow right away there are certain phrasesphrases of a peculiar characterphrases of the nature of that reference to schonerers grandmother for instancewhich not even the most spiritless schoolboy in the englishspeaking world would allow to pass unavenged one difference between schoolboys and the lawmakers of the reichsrath seems to be that the lawmakers have no limit no dangerline apparently they may call each other what they please and go home unmutilated  now in fact they did have a scuffle on two occasions but it was not on account of names called there has been no scuffle where that was the cause  it is not to be inferred that the house lacks a sense of honour because it lacks delicacy that would be an error iro was caught in a lie and it profoundly disgraced him the house cut him turned its back upon him he resigned his seat otherwise he would have been expelled but it was lenient with gregorig who had called iro a cowardly blatherskite in debate it merely went through the form of mildly censuring him that did not trouble gregorig  the viennese say of themselves that they are an easygoing pleasureloving community making the best of life and not taking it very seriously nevertheless they are grieved about the ways of their parliament and say quite frankly that they are ashamed they claim that the low condition of the parliaments manners is new not old a gentleman who was at the head of the government twenty years ago confirms this and says that in his time the parliament was orderly and wellbehaved an english gentleman of long residence here endorses this and says that a low order of politicians originated the present forms of questionable speech on the stump some years ago and imported them into the parliament2 however some day there will be a minister of etiquette and a sergeantatarms and then things will go better i mean if parliament and the constitution survive the present storm   ivthe historic climax  during the whole of november things went from bad to worse the allimportant ausgleich remained hard aground and could not be sparred off badenis government could not withdraw the language ordinance and keep its majority and the opposition could not be placated on easier terms one night while the customary pandemonium was crashing and thundering along at its best a fight broke out it was a surging struggling shouldertoshoulder scramble a great many blows were struck twice schonerer lifted one of the heavy ministerial fauteuilssome say with one handand threatened members of the majority with it but it was wrenched away from him a member hammered wolf over the head with the presidents bell and another member choked him a professor was flung down and belaboured with fists and choked he held up an open penknife as a defence against the blows it was snatched from him and flung to a distance it hit a peaceful christian socialist who wasnt doing anything and brought blood from his hand this was the only blood drawn the men who got hammered and choked looked sound and well next day the fists and the bell were not properly handled or better results would have been apparent i am quite sure that the fighters were not in earnest  on thanksgiving day the sitting was a historymaking one on that day the harried bedevilled and despairing government went insane in order to free itself from the thraldom of the opposition it committed this curiously juvenile crime it moved an important change of the rules of the house forbade debate upon the motion put it to a standup vote instead of ayes and noes and then gravely claimed that it had been adopted whereas to even the dullest witnessif i without immodesty may pretend to that placeit was plain that nothing legitimately to be called a vote had been taken at all  i think that saltpeter never uttered a truer thing than when he said whom the gods would destroy they first make mad evidently the governments mind was tottering when this bald insults to the house was the best way it could contrive for getting out of the fryingpan  the episode would have been funny if the matter at stake had been a trifle but in the circumstances it was pathetic the usual storm was raging in the house as usual many of the majority and the most of the minority were standing upto have a better chance to exchange epithets and make other noises into this storm count falkenhayn entered with his paper in his hand and at once there was a rush to get near him and hear him read his motion in a moment he was walled in by listeners the several clauses of his motion were loudly applauded by these allies and as loudly disapplaudedif i may invent a wordby such of the opposition as could hear his voice when he took his seat the president promptly put the motionpersons desiring to vote in the affirmative stand up the house was already standing up had been standing for an hour and before a third of it had found out what the president had been saying he had proclaimed the adoption of the motion and only a few heard that in fact when that house is legislating you cant tell it from artillery practice  you will realise what a happy idea it was to sidetrack the lawful ayes and noes and substitute a standup vote by this fact that a little later when a deputation of deputies waited upon the president and asked him if he was actually willing to claim that that measure had been passed he answered yesand unanimously it shows that in effect the whole house was on its feet when that trick was sprung  the lex falkenhayn thus strangely born gave the president power to suspend for three days any deputy who should continue to be disorderly after being called to order twice and it also placed at his disposal such force as might be necessary to make the suspension effective so the house had a sergeantatarms at last and a more formidable one as to power than any other legislature in christendom had ever possessed the lex falkenhayn also gave the house itself authority to suspend members for thirty days  on these terms the ausgleich could be put through in an hourapparently the opposition would have to sit meek and quiet and stop obstructing or be turned into the street deputy after deputy leaving the majority an unvexed field for its work  certainly the thing looked well the government was out of the fryingpan at last it congratulated itself and was almost girlishly happy its stock rose suddenly from less than nothing to a premium it confessed to itself with pride that its lex falkenhayn was a masterstrokea work of genius  however there were doubtersmen who were troubled and believed that a grave mistake had been made it might be that the opposition was crushed and profitably for the country too but the manner of itthe manner of it that was the serious part it could have farreaching results results whose gravity might transcend all guessing it might be the initial step toward a return to government by force a restoration of the irresponsible methods of obsolete times  there were no vacant seats in the galleries next day in fact standingroom outside the building was at a premium there were crowds there and a glittering array of helmeted and brassbuttoned police on foot and on horseback to keep them from getting too much excited no one could guess what was going to happen but every one felt that something was going to happen and hoped he might have a chance to see it or at least get the news of it while it was fresh  at noon the house was emptyfor i do not count myself half an hour later the two galleries were solidly packed the floor still empty another halfhour later wolf entered and passed to his place then other deputies began to stream in among them many forms and faces grown familiar of late by one oclock the membership was present in full force a band of socialists stood grouped against the ministerial desks in the shadow of the presidential tribune it was observable that these official strongholds were now protected against rushes by bolted gates and that these were in ward of servants wearing the houses livery also the removable deskboards had been taken away and nothing left for disorderly members to slat with  there was a pervading anxious hushat least what stood very well for a hush in that house it was believed by many that the opposition was cowed and that there would be no more obstruction no more noise that was an error  presently the president entered by the distant door to the right followed by vicepresident fuchs and the two took their way down past the polish benches toward the tribune instantly the customary storm of noises burst out and rose higher and higher and wilder and wilder and really seemed to surpass anything that had gone before it in that place the president took his seat and begged for order but no one could hear him his lips movedone could see that he bowed his body forward appealingly and spread his great hand eloquently over his breastone could see that but as concerned his uttered words he probably could not hear them himself below him was that crowd of two dozen socialists glaring up at him shaking their fists at him roaring imprecations and insulting epithets at him this went on for some time suddenly the socialists burst through the gates and stormed up through the ministerial benches and a man in a red cravat reached up and snatched the documents that lay on the presidents desk and flung them abroad the next moment he and his allies were struggling and fighting with the halfdozen uniformed servants who were there to protect the new gates meantime a detail of socialists had swarmed up the side steps and overflowed the president and the vice and were crowding and shouldering and shoving them out of the place they crowded them out and down the steps and across the house past the polish benches and all about them swarmed hostile poles and czechs who resisted them one could see fists go up and come down with other signs and shows of a heady fight then the president and the vice disappeared through the door of entrance and the victorious socialists turned and marched back mounted the tribune flung the presidents bell and his remaining papers abroad and then stood there in a compact little crowd eleven strong and held the place as if it were a fortress their friends on the floor were in a frenzy of triumph and manifested it in their deafening way the whole house was on its feet amazed and wondering  it was an astonishing situation and imposingly dramatic nobody had looked for this the unexpected had happened what next but there can be no next the play is over the grand climax is reached the possibilities are exhausted ring down the curtain  not yet that distant door opens again and now we see what history will be talking of five centuries hence a uniformed and helmeted battalion of bronzed and stalwart men marching in double file down the floor of the housea free parliament profaned by an invasion of brute force  it was an odious spectacleodious and awful for one moment it was an unbelievable thinga thing beyond all credibility it must be a delusion a dream a nightmare but no it was realpitifully real shamefully real hideously real these sixty policemen had been soldiers and they went at their work with the cold unsentimentality of their trade they ascended the steps of the tribune laid their hands upon the inviolable persons of the representatives of a nation and dragged and tugged and hauled them down the steps and out at the door then ranged themselves in stately military array in front of the ministerial estrade and so stood  it was a tremendous episode the memory of it will outlast all the thrones that exist today in the whole history of free parliaments the like of it had been seen but three times before it takes its imposing place among the worlds unforgettable things it think that in my lifetime i have not twice seen abiding history made before my eyes but i know that i have seen it once  some of the results of this wild freak followed instantly the badeni government came down with a crash there was a popular outbreak or two in vienna there were three or four days of furious rioting in prague followed by the establishing there of martial law the jews and germans were harried and plundered and their houses destroyed in other bohemian towns there was riotingin some cases the germans being the rioters in others the czechsand in all cases the jew had to roast no matter which side he was on we are well along in december now3 the next new ministerpresident has not been able to patch up a peace among the warring factions of the parliament therefore there is no use in calling it together again for the present public opinion believes that parliamentary government and the constitution are actually threatened with extinction and that the permanency of the monarchy itself is a not absolutely certain thing  yes the lex falkenhayn was a great invention and did what was claimed for itit got the government out of the fryingpan  1 that is revolution  2 in that gracious bygone time when a mild and goodtempered spirit was the atmosphere of our house when the manner of our speakers was studiously formal and academic and the storms and explosions of today were wholly unknown etctranslation of the opening remark of a leading article in this mornings neue freie presse december 11  3 it is the 9thmt       private history of the jumping frog story  five or six years ago a lady from finland asked me to tell her a story in our negro dialect so that she could get an idea of what that variety of speech was like i told her one of hopkinson smiths negro stories and gave her a copy of harpers monthly containing it she translated it for a swedish newspaper but by an oversight named me as the author of it instead of smith i was very sorry for that because i got a good lashing in the swedish press which would have fallen to his share but for that mistake for it was shown that boccaccio had told that very story in his curt and meagre fashion five hundred years before smith took hold of it and made a good and tellable thing out of it  i have always been sorry for smith but my own turn has come now a few weeks ago professor van dyke of princeton asked this question  do you know how old your jumping frog story is  and i answered  yesfortyfive years the thing happened in calaveras county in the spring of 1849  no it happened earliera couple of thousand years earlier it is a greek story  i was astonishedand hurt i said  i am willing to be a literary thief if it has been so ordained i am even willing to be caught robbing the ancient dead alongside of hopkinson smith for he is my friend and a good fellow and i think would be as honest as any one if he could do it without occasioning remark but i am not willing to antedate his crimes by fifteen hundred years i must ask you to knock off part of that  but the professor was not chaffing he was in earnest and could not abate a century he offered to get the book and send it to me and the cambridge textbook containing the english translation also i thought i would like the translation best because greek makes me tired january 30th he sent me the english version and i will presently insert it in this article it is my jumping frog tale in every essential it is not strung out as i have strung it out but it is all there  to me this is very curious and interesting curious for several reasons for instance  i heard the story told by a man who was not telling it to his hearers as a thing new to them but as a thing which they had witnessed and would remember he was a dull person and ignorant he had no gift as a storyteller and no invention in his mouth this episode was merely historyhistory and statistics and the gravest sort of history too he was entirely serious for he was dealing with what to him were austere facts and they interested him solely because they were facts he was drawing on his memory not his mind he saw no humour in his tale neither did his listeners neither he nor they ever smiled or laughed in my time i have not attended a more solemn conference to him and to his fellow goldminers there were just two things in the story that were worth considering one was the smartness of its hero jim smiley in taking the stranger in with a loaded frog and the other was smileys deep knowledge of a frogs naturefor he knew as the narrator asserted and the listeners conceded that a frog likes shot and is already ready to eat it those men discussed those two points and those only they were hearty in their admiration of them and none of the party was aware that a firstrate story had been told in a firstrate way and that it brimful of a quality whose presence they never suspectedhumour  now then the interesting question is did the frog episode happen in angels camp in the spring of 49 as told in my hearing that day in the fall of 1865 i am perfectly sure that it did i am also sure that its duplicate happened in boeotia a couple of thousand years ago i think it must be a case of history actually repeating itself and not a case of a good story floating down the ages and surviving because too good to be allowed to perish  i would now like to have the reader examine the greek story and the story told by the dull and solemn californian and observe how exactly alike they are in essentials     translation   the athenian and the frog1  an athenian once fell in with a boeotian who was sitting by the roadside looking at a frog seeing the other approach the boeotian said his was a remarkable frog and asked if he would agree to start a contest of frogs on condition that he whose frog jumped farthest should receive a large sum of money the athenian replied that he would if the other would fetch him a frog for the lake was near to this he agreed and when he was gone the athenian took the frog and opening its mouth poured some stones into its stomach so that it did not indeed seem larger than before but could not jump the boeotian soon returned with the other frog and the contest began the second frog first was pinched and jumped moderately then they pinched the boeotian frog and he gathered himself for a leap and used the utmost effort but he could not move his body the least so the athenian departed with the money when he was gone the boeotian wondering what was the matter with the frog lifted him up and examined him and being turned upside down he opened his mouth and vomited out the stones   and here is the way it happened in california  from the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county  well thishyer smiley had rattarriers and chicken cocks and tomcats and all of them kind of things till you couldnt rest and you couldnt fetch nothing for him to bet on but hed match you he ketched a frog one day and took him home and said he callated to educate him and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump and you bet you he did learn him too hed give him a little punch behind and the next minute youd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnutsee him turn one summerset or maybe a couple if he got a good start and come down flatfooted and all right like a cat he got him up so in the matter of ketching flies and kephim in practice so constant that hed nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him smiley said all a frog wanted was education and he could do most anythingand i believe him why ive seen him set danl webster down here on this flordanl webster was the name of the frogand sing out flies danl flies and quickern you could wink hed spring straight up and snake a fly offn the counter there and flop down on the floor agin as solid as a gob of mud and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadnt no idea hed been doin any moren any frog might do you never see a frog so modest and straightforard as he was for all he was so gifted and when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see jumping on a dead level was his strong suit you understand and when it came to that smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red smiley was monstrous proud of his frog and well he might be for fellers that had travelled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see  well smiley kep the beast in a little lattice box and he used to fetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet one day a fellera stranger in the camp he wascome acrost him with his box and says  what might it be that youve got in the box  and smiley says sorter indifferentlike it might be a parrot or it might be a canary maybe but its aintits only just a frog  and the feller took it and looked at it careful and turned it round this way and that and says hmso tis well whats he good for  well smiley says easy and careless hes good enough for one thing i should judgehe can outjump any frog in calaveras county  the feller took the box again and took another long particular look and give it back to smiley and says very deliberate well he says i dont see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog  maybe you dont smiley says maybe you understand frogs and maybe you dont understand em maybe youve had experience and maybe you aint only a amature as it were anyways ive got my opinion and ill resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in calaveras county  and the feller studies a minute and then says kinder sad like well im only a stranger here and i aint got no frog but if i had a frog id bet you  and then smiley says thats all rightthats all right if youll hold my box a minute ill go and get you a frog and so the feller took the box and put up his forty dollars along with smileys and set down to wait  so he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shotfilled him pretty near up to his chinand set him on the floor smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time and finally he ketched a frog and fetched him in and give him to this feller and says  now if youre ready set him alongside of danl with his forepaws just even with danls and ill give the word then he says onetwothreegit and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind and the new frog hopped off lively but danl give a heave and hysted up his shoulderssolike a frenchman but it warnt no usehe couldnt budge he was planted as solid as a church and he couldnt no more stir than if he was anchored out smiley was a good deal surprised and he was disgusted too but he didnt have no idea what the matter was of course  the feller took the money and started away and when he was going out at the door he sorter jerked his thumb over his shouldersoat danl and says again very deliberate well he says i dont see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog  smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at danl a long time and at last he says i do wonder what in the nation that frog throwd off fori wonder if there aint something the matter with himhe pears to look mighty baggy somehow and he ketched danl by the nape of the neck and hefted him and says why blame my cats if he dont weigh five pound and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot and then he see how it was and he was the maddest manhe set the frog down and took out after that feeler but he never ketched him   the resemblances are deliciously exact there you have the wily boeotain and the wily jim smiley waitingtwo thousand years apartand waiting each equipped with his frog and laying for the stranger a contest is proposedfor money the athenian would take a chance if the other would fetch him a frog the yankee says im only a stranger here and i aint got a frog but if i had a frog id bet you the wily boeotian and the wily californian with that vast gulf of two thousand years between retire eagerly and go frogging in the marsh the athenian and the yankee remain behind and work a best advantage the one with pebbles the other with shot presently the contest began in the one case they pinched the boeotian frog in the other him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind the boeotian frog gathered himself for a leap you can just see him but could not move his body in the least the californian frog give a heave but it warnt no usehe couldnt budge in both the ancient and the modern cases the strangers departed with the money the boeotian and the californian wonder what is the matter with their frogs they lift them and examine they turn them upside down and out spills the informing ballast  yes the resemblances are curiously exact i used to tell the story of the jumping frog in san francisco and presently artemus ward came along and wanted it to help fill out a little book which he was about to publish so i wrote it out and sent it to his publisher carleton but carleton thought the book had enough matter in it so he gave the story to henry clapp as a present and clapp put it in his saturday press and it killed that paper with a suddenness that was beyond praise at least the paper died with that issue and none but envious people have ever tried to rob me of the honour and credit of killing it the jumping frog was the first piece of writing of mine that spread itself through the newspapers and brought me into public notice consequently the saturday press was a cocoon and i the worm in it also i was the gaycoloured literary moth which its death set free this simile has been used before  early in 66 the jumping frog was issued in book form with other sketches of mine a year or two later madame blanc translated it into french and published it in the revue des deux mondes but the result was not what should have been expected for the revue struggled along and pulled through and is alive yet i think the fault must have been in the translation i ought to have translated it myself i think so because i examined into the matter and finally retranslated the sketch from the french back into english to see what the trouble was that is to see just what sort of a focus the french people got upon it then the mystery was explained in french the story is too confused and chaotic and unreposeful and ungrammatical and insane consequently it could only cause grief and sicknessit could not kill a glance at my retranslation will show the reader that this must be true     my retranslation  the frog jumping of the county of calaveras  eh bien this smiley nourished some terriers a rats and some cocks of combat and some cats and all sorts of things and with his rage of betting one no had more of repose he trapped one day a frog and him imported with him et lemporta chez lui saying that he pretended to make his education you me believe if you will but during three months he not has nothing done but to him apprehend to jump apprendre a sauter in a court retired of her mansion de sa maison and i you respond that he have succeeded he him gives a small blow by behind and the instant after you shall see the frog turn in the air like a greasebiscuit make one summersault sometimes two when she was well started and refall upon his feet like a cat he him had accomplished in the art of to gobble the flies gober des mouches and him there exercised continuallyso well that a fly at the most far that she appeared was a fly lost smiley had custom to say that all which lacked to a frog it was the education but with the education she could do nearly alland i him believe tenez i him have seen pose daniel webster there upon this plankdaniel webster was the name of the frogand to him sing some flies daniel some fliesin a fash of the eye daniel had bounded and seized a fly here upon the counter then jumped anew at the earth where he rested truly to himself scratch the head with his behindfoot as if he no had not the least idea of his superiority never you not have seen frog as modest as natural sweet as she was and when he himself agitated to jump purely and simply upon plain earth she does more ground in one jump than any beast of his species than you can know  to jump plainthis was his strong when he himself agitated for that smiley multiplied the bests upon her as long as there to him remained a red it must to know smiley was monstrously proud of his frog and he of it was right for some men who were travelled who had all seen said that they to him would be injurious to him compare to another frog smiley guarded daniel in a little box latticed which he carried bytimes to the village for some bet  one day an individual stranger at the camp him arrested with his box and him said  what is this that you have then shut up there within  smiley said with an air indifferent  that could be a paroquet or a syringe ou un serin but this no is nothing of such it not is but a frog  the individual it took it regarded with care it turned from one side and from the other then he said  tiens in effectat what is she good  my god responded smiley always with an air disengaged she is good for one thing to my notice a mon avis she can better in jumping elle peut batter en sautant all frogs of the county of calaveras  the individual retook the box it examined of new longly and it rendered to smiley in saying with an air deliberate  eh bien i no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each frog je ne vois pas que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux quaucune grenouille if that isnt grammar gone to seed then i count myself no judgemt  possible that you not it saw not said smiley possible that youyou comprehend frogs possible that you not you there comprehend nothing possible that you had of the experience and possible that you not be but an amateur of all manner de toute maniere i bet forty dollars that she batter in jumping no matter which frog of the country of calaveras  the individual reflected a second and said like sad  i not am but a stranger here i no have not a frog but if i of it had one i would embrace the bet  strong well respond smiley nothing of more facility if you will hold my box a minute i go you to search a frog jirai vous chercher  behold then the individual who guards the box who puts his forty dollars upon those of smiley and who attends et qui attendre he attended enough longtimes reflecting all solely and figure you that he takes daniel him opens the mouth by force and with a teaspoon him fills with shot of the hunt even him fills just to the chin then he him puts by the earth smiley during these times was at slopping in a swamp finally he trapped attrape a frog him carried to that individual and said  now if you be ready put him all against daniel with their beforefeet upon the same line and i give the signalthen he added one two threeadvance  him and the individual touched their frogs by behind and the frog new put to jump smartly but daniel himself lifted ponderously exhalted the shoulders thus like a frenchmanto what good he could not budge he is planted solid like a church he not advance no more than if one him had put at the anchor  smiley was surprised and disgusted but he not himself doubted not of the turn being intended mais il ne se doutait pas du tour bien entendre the indidivual empocketed the silver himself with it went and of it himself in going is that he no gives not a jerk of thumb over the shoulderlike thatat the poor daniel in saying with his air deliberatelindividu empoche largent sen va et en sen allant estce quil ne donne pas un coup de pouce pasdessus lepaule comme ca au pauvre daniel en disant de son air delibere  eh bien i no see not that that frog has nothing of better than another  smiley himself scratched longtimes the head the eyes fixed upon daniel until that which at last he said  i me demand how the devil it makes itself that this beast has refused is it that she had something one would believe that she is stuffed  he grasped daniel by the skin of the neck him lifted and said  the wolf me bite if he no weigh not five pounds  he him reversed and the unhappy belched two handfuls of shot et le malheureux etc when smiley recognised how it was he was like mad he deposited his frog by the earth and ran after that individual but he not him caught never   it may be that there are people who can translate better than i can but i am not acquainted with them  so ends the private and public history of the jumping frog of calaveras county an incident which has this unique feature about itthat it is both old and new a chestnut and not a chestnut for it was original when it happened two thousand years ago and was again original when it happened in california in our own time  ps  london july 1900twice recently i have been asked this question  have you seen the greek version of the jumping frog  and twice i have answeredno  has professor van dyke seen it  i suppose so  then you supposition is at fault  why  because there isnt any such version  do you mean to intimate that the tale is modern and not borrowed from some ancient greek book  yes it is not permissible for any but the very young and innocent to be so easily beguiled as you and van dyke have been  do you mean that we have fallen a prey to our ignorance and simplicity  yes is van dyke a greek scholar  i believe so  then he knew where to find the ancient greek version if one existed why didnt he look why did he jump to conclusions  i dont know and was it worth the trouble anyway  as it turns out now it was not claimed that the story had been translated from the greek it had its place among other uncredited stories and was there to be turned into greek by students of that language greek prose compositionthat title is what made the confusion it seemed to mean that the originals were greek it was not well chosen for it was pretty sure to mislead  thus vanishes the greek frog and i am sorry for he loomed fine and grand across the sweep of the ages and i took a great pride in him  mt  1 sidgwick greek prose composition page 116        my military campaign  you have heard from a great many people who did something in the war is it not fair and right that you listen a little moment to one who started out to do something in it but didnt thousands entered the war got just a taste of it and then stepped out again permanently these by their very numbers are respectable and are therefore entitled to a sort of voicenot a loud one but a modest one not a boastful one but an apologetic one they ought not to be allowed much space among better peoplepeople who did somethingi grant that but they ought at least to be allowed to state why they didnt do anything and also to explain the process by which they didnt do anything surely this kind of light must have a sort of value  out west there was a good deal of confusion in mens minds during the first months of the great troublea good deal of unsettledness of leaning first this way then that then the other way it was hard for us to get our bearings i call to mind an instance of this i was piloting on the mississippi when the news came that south carolina had gone out of the union on december 20 1860 my pilotmate was a new yorker he was strong for the union so was i but he would not listen to me with any patience my loyalty was smirched to his eye because my father had owned slaves i said in palliation of this dark fact that i had heard my father say some years before he died that slavery was a great wrong and that he would free the solitary negro he then owned if he could think it right to give away the property of the family when he was so straitened in means my mate retorted that a mere impulse was nothinganybody could pretend to a good impulse and went on decrying my unionism and libelling my ancestry a month later the secession atmosphere had considerably thickened on the lower mississippi and i became a rebel so did he we were together in new orleans january 26 when louisiana went out of the union he did his full share of the rebel shouting but was bitterly opposed to letting me do mine he said that i came of bad stockof a father who had been willing to set slaves free in the following summer he was piloting a federal gunboat and shouting for the union again and i was in the confederate army i held his note for some borrowed money he was one of the most upright men i ever knew but he repudiated that note without hesitation because i was a rebel and the son of a man who had owned slaves  in that summerof 1861the first wash of the wave of war broke upon the shores of missouri our state was invaded by the union forces they took possession of st louis jefferson barracks and some other points the governor claib jackson issued his proclamation calling out fifty thousand militia to repel the invader  i was visiting in the small town where my boyhood had been spenthannibal marion county several of us got together in a secret place by night and formed ourselves into a military company one tom lyman a young fellow of a good deal of spirit but of no military experience was made captain i was made second lieutenant we had no first lieutenant i do not know why it was long ago there were fifteen of us by the advice of an innocent connected with the organisation we called ourselves the marion rangers i do not remember that any one found fault with the name i did not i thought it sounded quite well the young fellow who proposed this title was perhaps a fair sample of the kind of stuff we were made of he was young ignorant goodnatured wellmeaning trivial full of romance and given to reading chivalric novels and singing forlorn loveditties he had some pathetic little nickelplated aristocratic instincts and detested his name which was dunlap detested it partly because it was nearly as common in that region as smith but mainly because it had a plebeian sound to his ear so he tried to ennoble it by writing it in this way dunlap that contented his eye but left his ear unsatisfied for people gave the new name the same old pronunciationemphasis on the front end of it he then did the bravest thing that can be imagineda thing to make one shiver when one remembers how the world is given to resenting shams and affectations he began to write his name so dun lap and he waited patiently through the long storm of mud that was flung at this work of art and he had his reward at last for he lived to see that name accepted and the emphasis put where he wanted it by people who had known him all his life and to whom the tribe of dunlaps had been as familiar as the rain and the sunshine for forty years so sure of victory at last is the courage that can wait he said he had found by consulting some ancient french chronicles that the name was rightly and originally written dun lap and said that if it were translated into english it would mean peterson lap latin or greek he said for stone or rock same as the french pierre that is to say peter d of or from un a or one hence dun lap of or from a stone or a peter that is to say one who is the son of a stone the son of a peterpeterson our militia company were not learned and the explanation confused them so they called him peterson dunlap he proved useful to us in his way he named our camps for us and he generally struck a name that was no slouch as the boys said  that is one sample of us another was ed stevens son of the town jewellertrimbuilt handsome graceful neat as a cat bright educated but given over entirely to fun there was nothing serious in life to him as far as he was concerned this military expedition of ours was simply a holiday i should say that about half of us looked upon it in the same way not consciously perhaps but unconsciously we did not think we were not capable of it as for myself i was full of unreasoning joy to be done with turning out of bed at midnight and four in the morning for a while grateful to have a change new scenes new occupations a new interest in my thoughts that was as far as i went i did not go into the details as a rule one doesnt at twentyfive  another sample was smith the blacksmiths apprentice this vast donkey had some pluck of a slow and sluggish nature but a soft heart at one time he would knock a horse down for some impropriety and at another he would get homesick and cry however he had one ultimate credit to his account which some of us hadnt he stuck to the war and was killed in battle at last  jo bowers another sample was a huge goodnatured flaxheaded lubber lazy sentimental full of harmless brag a grumbler by nature an experienced industrious ambitious and often quite picturesque liar and yet not a successful one for he had had no intelligent training but was allowed to come up just any way this life was serious enough to him and seldom satisfactory but he was a good fellow anyway and the boys all liked him he was made orderly sergeant stevens was made corporal  these samples will answerand they are quite fair ones well this herd of cattle started for the war what could you expect of them they did as well as they knew how but really what was justly to be expected of them nothing i should say that is what they did  we waited for a dark night for caution and secrecy were necessary then toward midnight we stole in couples and from various directions to the griffith place beyond the town from that point we set out together on foot hannibal lies at the extreme southeastern corner of marion county on the mississippi river our objective point was the hamlet of new london ten miles away in ralls county  the first hour was all fun all idle nonsense and laughter but that could not be kept up the steady trudging came to be like work the play had somehow oozed out of it the stillness of the woods and the sombreness of the night began to throw a depressing influence over the spirits of the boys and presently the talking died out and each person shut himself up in his own thoughts during the last half of the second hour nobody said a word  now we approached a log farmhouse where according to report there was a guard of five union soldiers lyman called a halt and there in the deep gloom of the overhanging branches he began to whisper a plan of assault upon that house which made the gloom more depressing than it was before it was a crucial moment we realised with a cold suddenness that here was no jestwe were standing face to face with actual war we were equal to the occasion in our response there was no hesitation no indecision we said that if lyman wanted to meddle with those soldiers he could go ahead and do it but if he waited for us to follow him he would wait a long time  lyman urged pleaded tried to shame us but it had no effect our course was plain our minds were made up we would flank the farmhousego out around and that is what we did we turned the position  we struck into the woods and entered upon a rough time stumbling over roots getting tangled in vines and torn by briers at last we reached an open place in a safe region and sat down blown and hot to cool off and nurse our scratches and bruises lyman was annoyed but the rest of us were cheerful we had flanked the farmhouse we had made our first military movement and it was a success we had nothing to fret about we were feeling just the other way horseplay and laughing began again the expedition was become a holiday frolic once more  then we had two more hours of dull trudging and ultimate silence and depression then about dawn we straggled into new london soiled heelblistered fagged with our little march and all of us except stevens in a sour and raspy humour and privately down on the war we stacked our shabby old shotguns in colonel rallss barn and then went in a body and breakfasted with that veteran of the mexican war afterwards he took us to a distant meadow and there in the shade of a tree we listened to an oldfashioned speech from him full of gunpowder and glory full of that adjectivepiling mixed metaphor and windy declamation which was regarded as eloquence in that ancient time and that remote region and then he swore us on the bible to be faithful to the state of missouri and drive all invaders from her soil no matter whence they might come or under what flag they might march this mixed us considerably and we could not make out just what service we were embarked in but colonel ralls the practised politician and phrasejuggler was not similarly in doubt he knew quite clearly that he had invested us in the cause of the southern confederacy he closed the solemnities by belting around me the sword which his neighbour colonel brown had worn at buena vista and molino del rey and he accompanied this act with another impressive blast  then we formed in line of battle and marched four miles to a shady and pleasant piece of woods on the border of the farreached expanses of a flowery prairie it was an enchanting region for warour kind of war  we pierced the forest about half a mile and took up a strong position with some low rocky and wooded hills behind us and a purling limpid creek in front straightway half the command were in swimming and the other half fishing the ass with the french name gave this position a romantic title but it was too long so the boys shortened and simplified it to camp ralls  we occupied an old maplesugar camp whose halfrotted troughs were still propped against the trees a long corncrib served for sleeping quarters for the battalion on our left half a mile away was masons farm and house and he was a friend to the cause shortly after noon the farmers began to arrive from several directions with mules and horses for our use and these they lent us for as long as the war might last which they judged would be about three months the animals were of all sizes all colours and all breeds they were mainly young and frisky and nobody in the command could stay on them long at a time for we were town boys and ignorant of horsemanship the creature that fell to my share was a very small mule and yet so quick and active that it could throw me without difficulty and it did this whenever i got on it then it would braystretching its neck out laying its ears back and spreading its jaws till you could see down to its works it was a disagreeable animal in every way if i took it by the bridle and tried to lead it off the grounds it would sit down and brace back and no one could budge it however i was not entirely destitute of military resources and i did presently manage to spoil this game for i had seen many a steamboat aground in my time and knew a trick or two which even a grounded mule would be obliged to respect there was a well by the corncrib so i substituted thirty fathom of rope for the bridle and fetched him home with the windlass  i will anticipate here sufficiently to say that we did learn to ride after some days practice but never well we could not learn to like our animals they were not choice ones and most of them had annoying peculiarities of one kind or another stevenss horse would carry him when he was not noticing under the huge excrescences which form on the trunks of oaktrees and wipe him out of the saddle in this way stevens got several bad hurts sergeant bowerss horse was very large and tall with slim long legs and looked like a railroad bridge his size enabled him to reach all about and as far as he wanted to with his head so he was always biting bowerss legs on the march in the sun bowers slept a good deal and as soon as the horse recognised that he was asleep he would reach around and bite him on the leg his legs were black and blue with bites this was the only thing that could ever make him swear but this always did whenever the horse bit him he always swore and of course stevens who laughed at everything laughed at this and would even get into such convulsions over it as to lose his balance and fall off his horse and then bowers already irritated by the pain of the horsebite would resent the laughter with hard language and there would be a quarrel so that horse made no end of trouble and bad blood in the command  however i will get back to where i wasour first afternoon in the sugarcamp the sugartroughs came very handy as horsetroughs and we had plenty of corn to fill them with i ordered sergeant bowers to feed my mule but he said that if i reckoned he went to war to be drynurse to a mule it wouldnt take me very long to find out my mistake i believed that this was insubordination but i was full of uncertainties about everything military and so i let the thing pass and went and ordered smith the blacksmiths apprentice to feed the mule but he merely gave me a large cold sarcastic grin such as an ostensibly sevenyearold horse gives you when you lift his lip and find he is fourteen and turned his back on me i then went to the captain and asked if it was not right and proper and military for me to have an orderly he said it was but as there was only one orderly in the corps it was but right that he himself should have bowers on his staff bowers said he wouldnt serve on anybodys staff and if anybody thought he could make him let him try it so of course the thing had to be dropped there was no other way  next nobody would cook it was considered a degradation so we had no dinner we lazied the rest of the pleasant afternoon away some dozing under the trees some smoking cobpipes and talking sweethearts and war some playing games by late suppertime all hands were famished and to meet the difficulty all hands turned to on an equal footing and gathered wood built fires and cooked the meal afterward everything was smooth for a while then trouble broke out between the corporal and the sergeant each claiming to rank the other nobody knew which was the higher office so lyman had to settle the matter by making the rank of both officers equal the commander of an ignorant crew like that has many troubles and vexations which probably do not occur in the regular army at all however with the songsinging and yarnspinning around the campfire everything presently became serene again and byandby we raked the corn down level in one end of the crib and all went to bed on it tying a horse to the door so that he would neigh if any one tried to get in1  we had some horsemanship drill every forenoon then afternoons we rode off here and there in squads a few miles and visited the farmers girls and had a youthful good time and got an honest good dinner or supper and then home again to camp happy and content  for a time life was idly delicious it was perfect there was nothing to mar it then came some farmers with an alarm one day they said it was rumoured that the enemy were advancing in our direction from over hydes prairie the result was a sharp stir among us and general consternation it was a rude awakening from our pleasant trance the rumour was but a rumournothing definite about it so in the confusion we did not know which way to retreat lyman was for not retreating at all in these uncertain circumstances but he found that if he tried to maintain that attitude he would fare badly for the command were in no humour to put up with insubordination so he yielded the point and called a council of warto consist of himself and the three other officers but the privates made such a fuss about being left out that we had to allow them to remain for they were already present and doing the most of the talking too the question was which way to retreat but all were so flurried that nobody seemed to have even a guess to offer except lyman he explained in a few calm words that inasmuch as the enemy were approaching from over hydes prairie our course was simple all we had to do was not to retreat toward him any other direction would answer our needs perfectly everybody saw in a moment how true this was and how wise so lyman got a great many compliments it was now decided that we should fall back upon masons farm  it was after dark by this time and as we could not know how soon the enemy might arrive it did not seem best to try to take the horses and things with us so we only took the guns and ammunition and started at once the route was very rough and hilly and rocky and presently the night grew very black and rain began to fall so we had a troublesome time of it struggling and stumbling along in the dark and soon some person slipped and fell and then the next person behind stumbled over him and fell and so did the rest one after the other and then bowers came with the keg of powder in his arms whilst the command were all mixed together arms and legs on the muddy slope and so he fell of course with the keg and this started the whole detachment down the hill in a body and they landed in the brook at the bottom in a pile and each that was undermost pulling the hair and scratching and biting those that were on top of him and those that were being scratched and bitten scratching and biting the rest in their turn and all saying they would die before they would ever go to war again if they ever got out of this brook this time and the invader might rot for all they cared and the country along with themand all such talk as that which was dismal to hear and take part in in such smothered low voices and such a grisly dark place and so wet and the enemy maybe coming any moment  the keg of powder was lost and the guns too so the growling and complaining continued straight along whilst the brigade pawed around the pasty hillside and slopped around in the brook hunting for these things consequently we lost considerable time at this and then we heard a sound and held our breath and listened and it seemed to be the enemy coming though it could have been a cow for it had a cough like a cow but we did not wait but left a couple of guns behind and struck out for masons again as briskly as we could scramble along in the dark but we got lost presently among the rugged little ravines and wasted a deal of time finding the way again so it was after nine when we reached masons stile at last and then before we could open our mouths to give the countersign several dogs came bounding over the fence with great riot and noise and each of them took a soldier by the slack of his trousers and began to back away with him we could not shoot the dogs without endangering the persons they were attached to so we had to look on helpless at what was perhaps the most mortifying spectacle of the civil war there was light enough and to spare for the masons had now run out on the porch with candles in their hands the old man and his son came and undid the dogs without difficulty all but bowerss but they couldnt undo his dog they didnt know his combination he was of the bull kind and seemed to be set with a yale timelock but they got him loose at last with some scalding water of which bowers got his share and returned thanks peterson dunlap afterwards made up a fine name for this engagement and also for the night march which preceded it but both have long ago faded out of my memory  we now went into the house and they began to ask us a world of questions whereby it presently came out that we did not know anything concerning who or what we were running from so the old gentleman made himself very frank and said we were a curious breed of soldiers and guessed we could be depended on to end up the war in time because no government could stand the expense of the shoeleather we should cost it trying to follow us around marion rangers good name bgosh said he and wanted to know why we hadnt had a picketguard at the place where the road entered the prairie and why we hadnt sent out a scouting party to spy out the enemy and bring us an account of his strength and so on before jumping up and stampeding out of a strong position upon a mere vague rumourand so on and so forth till he made us all fell shabbier than the dogs had done and not half so enthusiastically welcome so we went to bed shamed and lowspirited except stevens soon stevens began to devise a garment for bowers which could be made to automatically display his battlescars to the grateful or conceal them from the envious according to his occasions but bowers was in no humour for this so there was a fight and when it was over stevens had some battlescars of his own to think about  then we got a little sleep but after all we had gone through our activities were not over for the night for about two oclock in the morning we heard a shout of warning from down the lane accompanied by a chorus from all the dogs and in a moment everybody was up and flying around to find out what the alarm was about the alarmist was a horseman who gave notice that a detachment of union soldiers was on its way from hannibal with orders to capture and hang any bands like ours which it could find and said we had no time to lose farmer mason was in a flurry this time himself he hurried us out of the house with all haste and sent one of his negroes with us to show us where to hide ourselves and our telltale guns among the ravines half a mile away it was raining heavily  we struck down the lane then across some rocky pastureland which offered good advantages for stumbling consequently we were down in the mud most of the time and every time a man went down he blackguarded the war and the people who started it and everybody connected with it and gave himself the master dose of all for being so foolish as to go into it at last we reached the wooded mouth of a ravine and there we huddled ourselves under the streaming trees and sent the negro back home it was a dismal and heartbreaking time we were like to be drowned with the rain deafened with the howling wind and the booming thunder and blinded by the lightning it was indeed a wild night the drenching we were getting was misery enough but a deeper misery still was the reflection that the halter might end us before we were a day older a death of this shameful sort had not occurred to us as being among the possibilities of war it took the romance all out of the campaign and turned our dreams of glory into a repulsive nightmare as for doubting that so barbarous an order had been given not one of us did that  the long night wore itself out at last and then the negro came to us with the news that the alarm had manifestly been a false one and that breakfast would soon be ready straightway we were lighthearted again and the world was bright and life as full of hope and promise as everfor we were young then how long ago that was twentyfour years  the mongrel child of philology named the nights refuse camp devastation and no soul objected the masons gave us a missouri country breakfast in missourian abundance and we needed it hot biscuits hot wheat bread prettily crisscrossed in a lattice pattern on top hot corn pone fried chicken bacon coffee eggs milk buttermilk etcand the world may be confidently challenged to furnish the equal to such a breakfast as it is cooked in the south  we stayed several days at masons and after all these years the memory of the dullness the stillness and lifelessness of that slumberous farmhouse still oppresses my spirit as with a sense of the presence of death and mourning there was nothing to do nothing to think about there was no interest in life the male part of the household were away in the fields all day the women were busy and out of our sight there was no sound but the plaintive wailing of a spinningwheel forever moaning out from some distant roomthe most lonesome sound in nature a sound steeped and sodden with homesickness and the emptiness of life the family went to bed about dark every night and as we were not invited to intrude any new customs we naturally followed theirs those nights were a hundred years long to youths accustomed to being up till twelve we lay awake and miserable till that hour every time and grew old and decrepit waiting through the still eternities for the clockstrikes this was no place for town boys so at last it was with something very like joy that we received news that the enemy were on our track again with a new birth of the old warrior spirit we sprang to our places in line of battle and fell back on camp ralls  captain lyman had taken a hint from masons talk and he now gave ordered that our camp should be guarded against surprise by the posting of pickets i was ordered to place a picket at the forks of the road in hydes prairie night shut down black and threatening i told sergeant bowers to go out to that place and stay till midnight and just as i was expecting he said he wouldnt do it i tried to get others to go but all refused some excused themselves on account of the weather but the rest were frank enough to say they wouldnt go in any kind of weather this kind of thing sounds odd now and impossible but it seemed a perfectly natural thing to do there were scores of little camps scattered over missouri where the same thing was happening these camps were composed of young men who had been born and reared to a sturdy independence and who did not know what it meant to be ordered around by tom dick and harry whom they had known familiarly all their lives in the village or on the farm it is quite within the probabilities that this same thing was happening all over the south james redpath recognised the justice of this assumption and furnished the following instance in support of it during a short stay in east tennessee he was in a citizen colonels tent one day talking when a big private appeared at the door and without salute or other circumlocution said to the colonel  say jim im agoin home for a few days  what for  well i haint ben there for a right smart while and id like to see how things is comin on  how long are you going to be gone  bout two weeks  well dont be gone longer than that and get back sooner if you can  that was all and the citizen officer resumed his conversation where the private had broken it off this was in the first months of the war of course the camps in our part of missouri were under brigadiergeneral thomas h harris he was a townsman of ours a firstrate fellow and well liked but we had all familiarly known him as the sole and modestsalaried operator in our telegraph office where he had to send about one dispatch a week in ordinary times and two when there was a rush of business consequently when he appeared in our midst one day on the wing and delivered a military command of some sort in a large military fashion nobody was surprised at the response which he got from the assembled soldiery  oh now whatll you take to dont tom harris  it was quite the natural thing one might justly imagine that we were hopeless material for war and so we seemed in our ignorant state but there were those among us who afterward learned the grim trade learned to obey like machines became valuable soldiers fought all through the war and came out at the end with excellent records one of the very boys who refused to go out on picket duty that night and called me an ass for thinking he would expose himself to danger in such a foolhardy way had become distinguished for intrepidity before he was a year older  i did secure my picket that nightnot by authority but by diplomacy i got bowers to go by agreeing to exchange ranks with him for the time being and go along and stand the watch with him as his subordinate we stayed out there a couple of dreary hours in the pitchy darkness and the rain with nothing to modify the dreariness but bowerss monotonous growlings at the war and the weather then we began to nod and presently found it next to impossible to stay in the saddle so we gave up the tedious job and went back to the camp without waiting for the relief guard we rode into camp without interruption or objection from anybody and the enemy could have done the same for there were no sentries everybody was asleep at midnight there was nobody to send out another picket so none was sent we never tried to establish a watch at night again as far as i remember but we generally kept a picket out in the daytime  in that camp the whole command slept on the corn in the big corncrib and there was usually a general row before morning for the place was full of rats and they would scramble over the boys bodies and faces annoying and irritating everybody and now and then they would bite some ones toe and the person who owned the toe would start up and magnify his english and begin to throw corn in the dark the ears were half as heavy as bricks and when they struck they hurt the persons struck would respond and inside of five minutes every man would be locked in a deathgrip with his neighbour there was a grievous deal of blood shed in the corncrib but this was all that was spilt while i was in the war no that is not quite true but for one circumstance it would have been all i will come to that now  our scares were frequent every few days rumours would come that the enemy were approaching in these cases we always fell back on some other camp of ours we never stayed where we were but the rumours always turned out to be false so at last even we began to grow indifferent to them one night a negro was sent to our corncrib with the same old warning the enemy was hovering in our neighbourhood we all said let him hover we resolved to stay still and be comfortable it was a fine warlike resolution and no doubt we all felt the stir of it in our veinsfor a moment we had been having a very jolly time that was full of horseplay and schoolboy hilarity but that cooled down now and presently the fastwaning fire of forced jokes and forced laughs died out altogether and the company became silent silent and nervous and soon uneasyworriedapprehensive we had said we would stay and we were committed we could have been persuaded to go but there was nobody brave enough to suggest it an almost noiseless movement presently began in the dark by a general and unvoiced impulse when the movement was completed each man knew that he was not the only person who had crept to the front wall and had his eye at a crack between the logs no we were all there all there with our hearts in our throats and staring out toward the sugartroughs where the forest footpath came through it was late and there was a deep woodsy stillness everywhere there was a veiled moonlight which was only just strong enough to enable us to mark the general shape of objects presently a muffled sound caught our ears and we recognised it as the hoofbeats of a horse or horses and right away a figure appeared in the forest path it could have been made of smoke its mass had so little sharpness of outline it was a man on horseback and it seemed to me that there were others behind him i got hold of a gun in the dark and pushed it through a crack between the logs hardly knowing what i was doing i was so dazed with fright somebody said fire i pulled the trigger i seemed to see a hundred flashes and hear a hundred reports then i saw the man fall down out of the saddle my first feeling was of surprised gratification my first impulse was an apprenticesportsmans impulse to run and pick up his game somebody said hardly audibly goodweve got himwait for the rest but the rest did not come there was not a sound not the whisper of a leaf just perfect stillness an uncanny kind of stillness which was all the more uncanny on account of the damp earthy latenight smells now rising and pervading it then wondering we crept stealthily out and approached the man when we got to him the moon revealed him distinctly he was lying on his back with his arms abroad his mouth was open and his chest heaving with long gasps and his white shirtfront was all splashed with blood the thought shot through me that i was a murderer that i had killed a mana man who had never done me any harm that was the coldest sensation that ever went through my marrow i was down by him in a moment helplessly stroking his forehead and i would have given anything thenmy own life freelyto make him again what he had been five minutes before and all the boys seemed to be feeling in the same way they hung over him full of pitying interest and tried all they could to help him and said all sorts of regretful things they had forgotten all about the enemy they thought only of this one forlorn unit of the foe once my imagination persuaded me that the dying man gave me a reproachful look out of his shadowy eyes and it seemed to me that i would rather he had stabbed me than done that he muttered and mumbled like a dreamer in his sleep about his wife and child and i thought with a new despair this thing that i have done does not end with him it falls upon them too and they never did me any harm any more than he  in a little while the man was dead he was killed in war killed in fair and legitimate war killed in battle as you might say and yet he was as sincerely mourned by the opposing force as if he had been their brother the boys stood there a half hour sorrowing over him and recalling the details of the tragedy and wondering who he might be and if he were a spy and saying that if it were to do over again they would not hurt him unless he attacked them first it soon came out that mine was not the only shot fired there were five othersa division of the guilt which was a grateful relief to me since it in some degree lightened and diminished the burden i was carrying there were six shots fired at once but i was not in my right mind at the time and my heated imagination had magnified my one shot into a volley  the man was not in uniform and was not armed he was a stranger in the country that was all we ever found out about him the thought of him got to preying upon me every night i could not get rid of it i could not drive it away the taking of that unoffending life seemed such a wanton thing and it seemed an epitome of war that all war must be just thatthe killing of strangers against whom you feel no personal animosity strangers whom in other circumstances you would help if you found them in trouble and who would help you if you needed it my campaign was spoiled it seemed to me that i was not rightly equipped for this awful business that war was intended for men and i for a childs nurse i resolved to retire from this avocation of sham soldiership while i could save some remnant of my selfrespect these morbid thoughts clung to me against reason for at bottom i did not believe i had touched that man the law of probabilities decreed me guiltless of his blood for in all my small experience with guns i had never hit anything i had tried to hit and i knew i had done my best to hit him yet there was no solace in the thought against a diseased imagination demonstration goes for nothing  the rest of my war experience was of a piece with what i have already told of it we kept monotonously falling back upon one camp or another and eating up the countryi marvel now at the patience of the farmers and their families they ought to have shot us on the contrary they were as hospitably kind and courteous to us as if we had deserved it in one of these camps we found ab grimes an upper mississippi pilot who afterwards became famous as a daredevil rebel spy whose career bristled with desperate adventures the look and style of his comrades suggested that they had not come into the war to play and their deeds made good the conjecture later they were fine horsemen and good revolvershots but their favourite arm was the lasso each had one at his pommel and could snatch a man out of the saddle with it every time on a full gallop at any reasonable distance  in another camp the chief was a fierce and profane old blacksmith of sixty and he had furnished his twenty recruits with gigantic homemade bowieknives to be swung with the two hands like the machetes of the isthmus it was a grisly spectacle to see that earnest band practising their murderous cuts and slashes under the eye of that remorseless old fanatic  the last camp which we fell back upon was in a hollow near the village of florida where i was bornin monroe county here we were warned one day that a union colonel was sweeping down on us with a whole regiment at his heels this looked decidedly serious our boys went apart and consulted then we went back and told the other companies present that the war was a disappointment to us and we were going to disband they were getting ready themselves to fall back on some place or other and were only waiting for general tom harris who was expected to arrive at any moment so they tried to persuade us to wait a little while but the majority of us said no we were accustomed to falling back and didnt need any of tom harriss help we could get along perfectly well without him and save time too so about half of our fifteen including myself mounted and left on the instant the others yielded to persuasion and stayedstayed through the war  an hour later we met general harris on the road with two or three people in his companyhis staff probably but we could not tell none of them was in uniform uniforms had not come into vogue among us yet harris ordered us back but we told him there was a union colonel coming with a whole regiment in his wake and it looked as if there was going to be a disturbance so we had concluded to go home he raged a little but it was of no use our minds were made up we had done our share had killed one man exterminated one army such as it was let him go and kill the rest and that would end the war i did not see that brisk young general again until last year then he was wearing white hair and whiskers  in time i came to know that union colonel whose coming frightened me out of the war and crippled the southern cause to that extentgeneral grant i came within a few hours of seeing him when he was as unknown as i was myself at a time when anybody could have said grantulysses s grant i do not remember hearing the name before it seems difficult to realise that there was once a time when such a remark could be rationally made but there was and i was within a few miles of the place and the occasion too though proceeding in the other direction  the thoughtful will not throw this warpaper of mine lightly aside as being valueless it has this value it is a not unfair picture of what went on in many and many a militia camp in the first months of the rebellion when the green recruits were without discipline without the steadying and heartening influence or trained leaders when all their circumstances were new and strange and charged with exaggerated terrors and before the invaluable experience of actual collision in the field had turned them from rabbits into soldiers if this side of the picture of that early day has not before been put into history then history has been to that degree incomplete for it had and has its rightful place there there was more bull run material scattered through the early camps of this country than exhibited itself at bull run and yet it learned its trade presently and helped to fight the great battles later i could have become a soldier myself if i had waited i had got part of it learned i knew more about retreating than the man that invented retreating  1 it was always my impression that that was what the horse was there for and i know that it was also the impression of at least one other of the command for we talked about it at the time and admired the military ingenuity of the device but when i was out west three years ago i was told by mr a g fuqua a member of our company that the horse was his that the leaving him tied at the door was a matter of mere forgetfulness and that to attribute it to intelligent invention was to give him quite too much credit in support of his position he called my attention to the suggestive fact that the artifice was not employed again i

abscheulich heres only three weeks of the three months gone and it seems like three years i dont believe i can live through it and im sure annie cant refers to her book and rattles through several times like one memorising entschuldigen sie mein herr konnen sie mir vielleicht sagen um wie viel uhr der erste zug nach dresden abgeht makes mistakes and corrects them i just hate meisterschaft we may see people we can have society yes on condition that the conversation shall be in german and in german onlyevery single word of it very kindoh very when neither annie nor i can put two words together except as they are put together for us in meisterschaft or that idiotic ollendorff refers to book and memorises mein bruder hat ihren herrn vater nicht gesehen als er gestern in dem laden des deutschen kaufmannes war yes we can have society provided we talk german what would conversation be like if you should stick to meisterschaft it would change the subject every two minutes and if you stuck to ollendorff it would be all about your sisters mothers good stocking of thread or your grandfathers aunts good hammer of the carpenter and whos got it and there an end you couldnt keep up your interest in such topics memorising wenn irgend moglichmochte ich noch heute vormittag geschaftsfreunde zu treffen my mind is made up to one thing i will be an exile in spirit and in truth i will see

first he just couldnt abide cats but now why now hes just all for cats he fairly welters in cats i never saw such a reform and its just so with all his principles he hasnt got one that he had before ah if all men were like him this world wouldmemorising im gegentheil mein herr dieser stoff ist sehr billig bitte sehen sie sich nur die qualitat an yes and what did they go to studying german for if

injured surprise  s reflectively i think ive heard that before somewhere  wirthin aside why the very cats in germany know it  curtain   1 explanatory i regard the idea of this play as a valuable invention i call it the patent universallyapplicable automatically adjustable language drama this indicates that it is adjustable to any tongue and performable in any tongue the english portions of the play are to remain just as they are permanently but you change the foreign portions to any language you please at will do you see you at once have the same old play in a new tongue and you can keep changing it from language to language until your private theatrical pupils have become glib and at home in the speech of all nations zum beispiel suppose we wish to adjust the play to the french tongue first we give mrs blumenthal and gretchen french names next we knock the german meisterschaft sentences out of the first scene and replace them with sentences from the french meisterschaftlike this for instance je voudrais faire des emplettes ce matin voulezvous avoir lobligeance de venir avec moi chez le tailleur francais and so on wherever you find german replace it with french leaving the english parts undisturbed when you come to the long conversation in the second act turn to any pamphlet of your french meisterschaft and shovel in as much french talk on any subject as will fill up the gaps left by the expunged german examplepage 423 french meisterschaft on dirait quil va faire chaud jai chaud jai extremement chaud ah quil fait chaud il fait une chaleur etouffante lair est brulant je meurs de chaleur il est presque impossible de supporter la chaleur cela vous fait transpirer mettonsnous a lombre il fait du vent il fait un vent froid il fait un tres agreable pour se promener aujourdhui and so on all the way through it is very easy to adjust the play to any desired language anybody can do it       my boyhood dreams  the dreams of my boyhood no they have not been realised for all who are old there is something infinitely pathetic about the subject which you have chosen for in no greyheads case can it suggest any but one thingdisappointment disappointment is its own reason for its pain the quality or dignity of the hope that failed is a matter aside the dreamers valuation of the thing lostnot another mansis the only standard to measure it by and his grief for it makes it large and great and fine and is worthy of our reverence in all cases we should carefully remember that there are sixteen hundred million people in the world of these there is but a trifling numberin fact only thirtyeight millionswho can understand why a person should have an ambition to belong to the french army and why belonging to it he should be proud of that and why having got down that far he should want to go on down down down till he struck the bottom and got on the general staff and why being stripped of this livery or set free and reinvested with his selfrespect by any other quick and thorough process let it be what it might he should wish to return to his strange serfage but no matter the estimate put upon these things by the fifteen hundred and sixty millions is no proper measure of their value the proper measure the just measure is that which is put upon them by dreyfus and is cipherable merely upon the littleness or the vastness of the disappointment which their loss cost him there you have it the measure of the magnitude of a dreamfailure is the measure of the disappointment the failure cost the dreamer the value in others eyes of the thing lost has nothing to do with the matter with this straightening out and classification of the dreamers position to help us perhaps we can put ourselves in his place and respect his dreamdreyfuss and the dreams our friends have cherished and reveal to us some that i call to mind some that have been revealed to me are curious enough but we may not smile at them for they were precious to the dreamers and their failure has left scars which give them dignity and pathos with this theme in my mind dear heads that were brown when they and mine were young together rise old and white before me now beseeching me to speak for them and most lovingly will i do it howells hay aldrich matthews stockton cable remushow their young hopes and ambitions come flooding back to my memory now out of the vague far past the beautiful past the lamented past i remember it so wellthat night we met togetherit was in boston and mr fiends was there and mr osgood ralph keeler and boyle oreilly lost to us now these many yearsand under the seal of confidence revealed to each other what our boyhood dreams had been reams which had not as yet been blighted but over which was stealing the grey of the night that was to comea night which we prophetically felt and this feeling oppressed us and made us sad i remember that howellss voice broke twice and it was only with great difficulty that he was able to go on in the end he wept for he had hoped to be an auctioneer he told of his early struggles to climb to his goal and how at last he attained to within a single step of the coveted summit but there misfortune after misfortune assailed him and he went down and down and down until now at last weary and disheartened he had for the present given up the struggle and become the editor of the atlantic monthly this was in 1830 seventy years are gone since and where now is his dream it will never be fulfilled and it is best so he is no longer fitted for the position no one would take him now even if he got it he would not be able to do himself credit in it on account of his deliberateness of speech and lack of trained professional vivacity he would be put on real estate and would have the pain of seeing younger and abler men intrusted with the furniture and other such goodsgoods which draw a mixed and intellectually low order of customers who must be beguiled of their bids by a vulgar and specialised humour and sparkle accompanied with antics but it is not the thing lost that counts but only the disappointment the loss brings to the dreamer that had coveted that thing and had set his heart of hearts upon it and when we remember this a great wave of sorrow for howells rises in our breasts and we wish for his sake that his fate could have been different at that time hays boyhood dream was not yet past hope of realisation but it was fading dimming wasting away and the wind of a growing apprehension was blowing cold over the perishing summer of his life in the pride of his young ambition he had aspired to be a steamboat mate and in fancy saw himself dominating a forecastle some day on the mississippi and dictating terms to roustabouts in high and wounding terms i look back now from this far distance of seventy years and note with sorrow the stages of that dreams destruction hays history is but howellss with differences of detail hay climbed high toward his ideal when success seemed almost sure his foot upon the very gangplank his eye upon the capstan misfortune came and his fall began downdowndownever down private secretary to the president colonel in the field charge daffaires in paris charge daffaires in vienna poet editor of the tribune biographer of lincoln ambassador to england and now at last there he liessecretary of state head of foreign affairs and he has fallen like lucifer never to rise again and his dreamwhere now is his dream gone down in blood and tears with the dream of the auctioneer and the young dream of aldrichwhere is that i remember yet how he sat there that night fondling it petting it seeing it recede and ever recede trying to be reconciled and give it up but not able yet to bear the thought for it had been his hope to be a horsedoctor he also climbed high but like the others fell then fell again and yet again and again and again and now at last he can fall no further he is old now he has ceased to struggle and is only a poet no one would risk a horse with him now his dream is over has any boyhood dream ever been fulfilled i must doubt it look at brander matthews he wanted to be a cowboy what is he today nothing but a professor in a university will he ever be a cowboy it is hardly conceivable look at stockton what was stocktons young dream he hoped to be a barkeeper see where he has landed is it better with cable what was cables young dream to be ringmaster in the circus and swell around and crack the whip what is he today nothing but a theologian and novelist and uncle remuswhat was his young dream to be a buccaneer look at him now ah the dreams of our youth how beautiful they are and how perishable the ruins of these mighthavebeens how pathetic the heartsecrets that were revealed that night now so long vanished how they touch me as i give them voice those sweet privacies how they endeared us to each other we were under oath never to tell any of these things and i have always kept that oath inviolate when speaking with persons whom i thought not worthy to hear them oh our lost youthgod keep its memory green in our hearts for age is upon us with the indignity of its infirmities and death beckons       to the above old people       sleep for the sun that scores another day     against the tale allotted you to stay     reminding you is risen and now     serves noticeah ignore it while you stay      the chill wind blew and those who stood before     the tavern murmured having drunk his score     why tarries he with empty cup behold     the wine of youth once poured is poured no more      come leave the cup and on the winters snow     your summer garment of enjoyment throw     your tide of life is ebbing fast and it     exhausted once for you no more shall flow      while yet the phantom of false youth was mine     i heard a voice from out the darkness whine     o youth o whither gone return     and bathe my age in thy reviving wine      in this subduing draught of tender green     and kindly absinth with its wimpling sheen     of dusky halflights let me drown     the haunting pathos of the mighthavebeen      for every nickeled joy marred and brief     we pay some day its weight in golden grief     mined from our hearts ah murmur not     from this onesided bargain dream of no relief      the joy of life that streaming through their veins     tumultuous swept falls slackand wanes     the glory in the eyeand one by one     lifes pleasures perish and make place for pains      whether one hide in some secluded nook     whether at liverpool or sandy hook    tis one old age will

might be some mistake we submitted a proof of this article to the american gentlemen named in it and asked them to correct any errors of detail that might have crept in among the facts they reply with some asperity that errors cannot creep in among facts where there are no facts for them to creep in among and that none are discoverable in this article but only baseless aberrations of a disordered mind they have no recollection of any such night in boston nor elsewhere and in their opinion there was never any such night they have met mr twain but have had the prudence not to intrust any privacies to himparticularly under oath and they think they now see that this prudence was justified since he has been untrustworthy enough to even betray privacies which had no existence further they think it a strange thing that mr twain who was never invited to meddle with anybodys boyhood dreams but his own has been so gratuitously anxious to see that other peoples are placed before the world that he has quite lost his head in his zeal and forgotten to make any mention of his own at all provided we insert this explanation they are willing to let his article pass otherwise they must require its suppression in the interest of truth  psthese replies having left us in some perplexity and also in some fear lest they distress mr twain if published without his privity we judged it but fair to submit them to him and give him an opportunity to defend himself but he does not seem to be troubled or even aware that he is in a delicate situation he merely says do not worry about those former

 where all the broad expanse was clothed in vines   and fruitful fields and meadows starred with flowers   and clear streams wandered at their idle will   and still lakes slept their burnished surfaces   a dream of painted clouds and soft airs   went whispering with odorous breath   and all was peacein that fair vale   shut from the troubled world a nameless hamlet drowsed    hard by apart a temple stood   and strangers from the outer world   passing noted it with tired eyes   and seeing saw it not   a glimpse of its fair forman answering momentary thrill   and they passed on careless and unaware    they could not know the cunning of its make   they could not know the secret shut up in its heart   only the dwellers of the hamlet knew   they knew that what seemed brass was gold   what marble seemed was ivory   the glories that enriched the milky surfaces   the trailing vines and interwoven flowers   and tropic birds awing clothed all in tinted fires   they knew for what they were not what they seemed   encrustings all of gems not perishable splendours of the brush   they knew the secret spot where one must stand   they knew the surest hour the proper slant of sun   to gather in unmarred undimmed   the vision of the fane in all its fairy grace   a fainting dream against the opal sky    and more than this they knew   that in the temples inmost place a spirit dwelt   made all of light   for glimpses of it they had caught   beyond the curtains when the priests   that served the altar came and went    all loved that light and held it dear   that had this partial grace   but the adoring priests alone who lived   by day and night submerged in its immortal glow   knew all its power and depth and could appraise the loss   if it should fade and fail and come no more    all this was long agoso long ago    the light burned on and they that worshipped it   and they that caught its flash at intervals and held it dear   contented lived in its secure possession ah   how long ago it was    and then when they   were nothing fearing and gods peace was in the air   and none was prophesying harm   the vast disaster fell   where stood the temple when the sun went down   was vacant desert when it rose again    ah yes tis ages since it chanced   so long ago it was   that from the memory of the hamletfolk the light has passed   they scarce believing now that once it was   or if believing yet not missing it   and reconciled to have it gone    not so the priests oh not so   the stricken ones that served it day and night   adoring it abiding in the healing of its peace   they stand yet where erst they stood   speechless in that dim morning long ago   and still they gaze as then they gazed   and murmur it will come again   it knows our painit knowsit knows   ah surely it will come again    slc    lake lucerne august 18 1897
