author     publishers note    in 1882 it was felt to be desirable that mr hartes scattered work should be brought together in convenient form and the result was a compact edition of five volumes after that date as before he continued to produce poems tales sketches and romances in steady succession and in 1897 his publishers undertook a uniform and orderly presentation of the results of more than thirty years of his literary activity the fourteen volumes that embodied those results were enriched by introductions and a glossary prepared by mr harte himself  the present riverside edition is based on the collection made in 1897 but is enlarged by the inclusion of later work  boston 4 park street autumn 1902     contents    general introduction  the luck of roaring camp and other sketches

general introduction    the opportunity here offered footnote by the appearance in england several  years ago of an edition of the authors writings as then collected to give some  account of the genesis of these californian sketches and the conditions under which they were conceived is peculiarly tempting to an author who has been obliged to retain a decent professional reticence under a cloud of ingenious surmise theory and misinterpretation he very gladly seizes this opportunity to establish the chronology of the sketches and incidentally to show that what are considered the happy accidents of literature are very apt to be the results of quite logical and often prosaic processes  the authors first volume was published in 1865 in a thin book of verse containing besides the titular poem the lost galleon various patriotic contributions to the lyrics of the civil war then raging and certain better known humorous pieces which have been hitherto interspersed with his later poems in separate volumes but are now restored to their former companionship this was followed in 1867 by the condensed novels originally contributed to the san francisco californian a journal then edited by the author and a number of local sketches entitled bohemian papers making a single not very plethoric volume the authors first book of prose but he deems it worthy of consideration that during this period ie from 1862 to 1866 he produced the society upon the stanislaus and the story of mlissthe first a dialectical poem the second a californian romancehis first efforts toward indicating a peculiarly characteristic western american literature he would like to offer these facts as evidence of his very early halfboyish but very enthusiastic belief in such a possibilitya belief which never deserted him and which a few years later from the betterknown pages of the overland monthly he was able to demonstrate to a larger and more cosmopolitan audience in the story of the luck of roaring camp and the poem of the heathen chinee but it was one of the anomalies of the very condition of life that he worked amidst and endeavored to portray that these first efforts were rewarded by very little success and as he will presently show even the luck of roaring camp depended for its recognition  in california upon its success elsewhere hence the critical reader will observe that the bulk of these earlier efforts as shown in the first two volumes were marked by very little flavor of the soil but were addressed to an audience half foreign in their sympathies and still imbued with eastern or new england habits and literary traditions home was still potent with these voluntary exiles in their moments of relaxation eastern magazines and current eastern literature formed their literary recreation and the sale of the better class of periodicals was singularly great nor was the taste confined to american literature the illustrated and satirical english journals were as frequently seen in california as in massachusetts and the author records that he has experienced more difficulty in procuring a copy of punch in an english provincial town than was his fortune at red dog or onehorse gulch an audience thus liberally equipped and familiar with the best modern writers was naturally critical and exacting and no one appreciates more than he does the salutary effects of this severe discipline upon his earlier efforts  when the first number of the overland monthly appeared the author then its editor called the publishers attention to the lack of any distinctive californian romance in its pages and averred that should no other contribution come in he himself would supply the omission in the next number no other contribution was offered and the author having the plot and general idea already in his mind in a few days sent the manuscript of the luck of roaring camp to the printer he had not yet received the proofsheets when he was suddenly summoned to the office of the publisher whom he found standing the picture of dismay and anxiety with the proof before him the indignation and stupefaction of the author can be well understood when he was told that the printer instead of returning the proofs to him submitted them to the publisher with the emphatic declaration that the matter thereof was so indecent irreligious and improper that his proof readera young ladyhad with difficulty been induced to continue its perusal and that he as a friend of the publisher and a wellwisher of the magazine was impelled to present to him personally this shameless evidence of the manner in which the editor was imperilling the future of that enterprise it should be premised that the critic was a man of character and standing the head of a large printing establishment a church member and the author thinks a deacon in which circumstances the publisher frankly admitted to the author that while he could not agree with all of the printers criticisms he thought the story open to grave objection and its publication of doubtful expediency  believing only that he was the victim of some extraordinary typographical blunder the author at once sat down and read the proof in its new dress with the metamorphosis of typethat metamorphosis which every writer so well knows changes his relations to it and makes it no longer seem a part of himselfhe was able to read it with something of the freshness of an untold tale as he read on he found himself affected even as he had been affected in the conception and writing of ita feeling so incompatible with the charges against it that he could only lay it down and declare emphatically albeit hopelessly that he could really see nothing objectionable in it other opinions were sought and given to the authors surprise he found himself in the minority finally the story was submitted to three gentlemen of culture and experience friends of publisher and authorwho were unable however to come to any clear decision it was however suggested to the author that assuming the natural hypothesis that his editorial reasoning might be warped by his literary predilections in a consideration of one of his own productions a personal sacrifice would at this juncture be in the last degree heroic this last suggestion had the effect of ending all further discussion for he at once informed the publisher that the question of the propriety of the story was no longer at issue the only question was of his capacity to exercise the proper editorial judgment and that unless he was permitted to test that capacity by the publication of the story and abide squarely by the result he must resign his editorial position the publisher possibly struck with the authors confidence possibly from kindliness of disposition to a younger man yielded and the luck of roaring camp was published in the current number of the magazine for which it was written as it was written without emendation omission alteration or apology a not inconsiderable part of the grotesqueness of the situation was the feeling which the author retained throughout the whole affair of the perfect sincerity good faith and seriousness of his friendsthe printersobjection and for many days thereafter he was haunted by a consideration of the sufferings of this conscientious man obliged to assist materially in disseminating the dangerous and subversive doctrines contained in this baleful fiction what solemn protests must have been laid with the ink on the rollers and impressed upon those wicked sheets what pious warnings must have been secretly folded and stitched in that number of the overland monthly across the chasm of years and distance the author stretches forth the hand of sympathy and forgiveness not forgetting the gentle proofreader that chaste and unknown nymph whose mantling cheeks and downcast eyes gave the first indications of warning  but the troubles of the luck were far from ended it had secured an entrance into the world but like its own hero it was born with an evil reputation and to a community that had yet to learn to love it the secular press with one or two exceptions received it coolly and referred to its singularity the religious press frantically excommunicated it and anathematized it as the offspring of evil the high promise of the overland monthly was said to have been ruined by its birth christians were cautioned against pollution by its contact practical business men were gravely urged to condemn and frown upon this picture of californian society that was not conducive to eastern immigration its hapless author was held up to obloquy as a man who had abused a sacred trust if its life and reputation had depended on its reception in california this edition and explanation would alike have been needless but fortunately the young overland monthly had in its first number secured a hearing and position throughout the american union and the author waited the larger verdict the publisher albeit his worst fears were confirmed was not a man to weakly regret a position he had once taken and waited also the return mail from the east brought a letter addressed to the editor of the overland monthly enclosing a letter from fields osgood  co the publishers of the atlantic monthly addressed to theto them unknown author of the luck of roaring camp this the author opened and found to be a request upon the most flattering terms for a story for the atlantic similar to the luck the same mail brought newspapers and reviews welcoming the little foundling of californian literature with an enthusiasm that half frightened its author but with the placing of that letter in the hands of the publisher who chanced to be standing by his side and who during those dark days had without the authors faith sustained the authors position he felt that his compensation was full and complete  thus encouraged the luck of roaring camp was followed by the outcasts of poker flat miggles tennessees partner and those various other characters who had impressed the author when a mere truant schoolboy he had lived among them it is hardly necessary to say to any observer of human nature that at this time he was advised by kind and wellmeaning friends to content himself with the success of the luck and not tempt criticism again or that from that moment ever after he was in receipt of that equally sincere contemporaneous criticism which assured him gravely that each successive story was a falling off from the last howbeit by reinvigorated confidence in himself and some conscientious industry he managed to get together in a year six or eight of these sketches which in a volume called the luck of roaring camp and other sketches gave him that encouragement in america and england that has since seemed to justify him in swelling these records of a picturesque passing civilization into the compass of the present edition  a few words regarding the peculiar conditions of life and society that are here rudely sketched and often but barely outlined the author is aware that partly from  a habit of thought and expression partly from the exigencies of brevity in his narratives and partly from the habit of addressing an audience familar with the local scenery he often assumes as premises already granted by the reader the existence of a peculiar and romantic state of civilization the like of which few english readers are inclined to accept without corroborative facts and figures these he could only give by referring to the ephemeral records of californian journals of that date and the testimony of  farscattered witnesses survivors of the exodus of 1849 he must beg the reader to bear in mind that this emigration was either across a continent almost unexplored or by the way of a long and dangerous voyage around cape horn and that the promised land itself presented the singular spectacle of a patriarchal latin race who had been left to themselves forgotten by the world for nearly three hundred years the faith courage vigor youth and capacity for adventure necessary to this emigration produced a body of men as strongly distinctive as the companions of jason unlike most pioneers the majority were men of profession and education all were young and all had staked their future in the enterprise critics who have taken large and exhaustive views of mankind and society from club windows in pall mall or the fifth avenue can only accept for granted the turbulent chivalry that thronged the streets of san francisco in the gala days of her youth and must read the blazon of their deeds like the doubtful quarterings of the shield of amadis de gaul the author has been frequently asked if such and such incidents were realif he had ever met such and such characters to this he must return the one answer that in only a single instance was he conscious of drawing purely from his imagination and fancy for a character and a logical succession of incidents drawn therefrom a few weeks after his story was published he received a letter authentically signed correcting some of the  minor details of his facts  and enclosing as corroborative evidence a slip from an old newspaper wherein the main incident of his supposed fanciful creation was recorded with a largeness of statement that far transcended his powers of imagination  he has been repeatedly cautioned kindly and unkindly intelligently and unintelligently against his alleged tendency to confuse recognized standards of morality by extenuating lives of recklessness and often criminality with a single solitary virtue he might easily show that he has never written a sermon that he has never moralized or commented upon the actions of his heroes that he has never voiced a creed or obtrusively demonstrated an ethical opinion he might easily allege that this merciful effect of his art arose from the readers weak human sympathies and hold  himself irresponsible but he would be conscious of a more miserable weakness in thus divorcing himself from his fellowmen who in the domain of art must ever walk hand in hand with him so he prefers to say that of all the various forms in which cant presents itself to suffering humanity he knows of none so outrageous so illogical so undemonstrable so marvelously absurd as the cant of too much mercy when it shall be proven to him that communities are degraded and brought to guilt and crime suffering or destitution from a predominance of this quality when he shall see pardoned ticketofleave men elbowing men of austere lives out of situation and position and the repentant magdalen supplanting the blameless virgin in societythen he will lay aside his pen and extend his hand to the new draconian discipline in fiction but until then he will without claiming to be a religious man or a moralist but simply as an artist reverently and humbly conform to the rules laid down by a great poet who created the parable of the prodigal son and the good samaritan whose works  have lasted eighteen hundred years and will remain when the present writer and his generation are forgotten and he is conscious of uttering no original doctrine in this but of only voicing the beliefs of a few of his literary brethren happily living and one gloriously dead who never made proclamation of this from the housetops                                                the luck of roaring camp and         other stories and sketches                                           the luck of roaring camp   there was commotion in roaring camp it could not have been a fight for in 1850 that was not novel enough to have called together the entire settlement the ditches and claims were not only deserted but tuttles grocery had contributed its gamblers who it will be remembered calmly continued their game the day that french pete and kanaka joe shot each other to death over the bar in the front room the whole camp was collected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing conversation was carried on in a low tone but the name of a woman was frequently repeated it was  a name familiar enough in the campcherokee sal  perhaps the less said of her the better she was a coarse and it is to be feared a very sinful woman but at that time she was the only woman in roaring camp and was just then lying in sore extremity when she most needed the ministration of her own sex dissolute abandoned and irreclaimable she was yet suffering a martyrdom hard enough to bear even when veiled by sympathizing womanhood but now terrible in her loneliness the primal curse had come to her in that original isolation which must have made the punishment of the first transgression so dreadful it was perhaps part of the expiation of her sin  that at a moment when she most lacked her sexs intuitive tenderness and care she met only the halfcontemptuous faces of her masculine associates yet a few of the spectators were i think touched by her sufferings sandy tipton thought it was rough on sal and in the contemplation of her condition for a moment rose superior to the fact that he had an ace and two bowers in his sleeve  it will be seen also that the situation was novel deaths were by no means uncommon in roaring camp but a birth was a new thing people had been dismissed the camp effectively finally and with no possibility of return but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced ab initio hence the excitement  you go in there stumpy said a prominent citizen known as kentuck addressing one of the loungers go in there and see what you kin do youve had experience in them things  perhaps there was a fitness in the selection stumpy in other climes had been the putative head of two families in fact it was owing to some legal informality in these proceedings that roaring campa city of refugewas indebted to his company the crowd approved the choice and stumpy was wise enough to bow to the majority the door closed on the extempore surgeon and midwife and roaring camp sat down outside smoked its pipe and awaited the issue  the assemblage numbered about a hundred men one or two of these were actual fugitives from justice some were criminal and all were reckless physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives and character the greatest scamp had a raphael face with a profusion of blonde hair oakhurst a gambler had the melancholy air and intellectual abstraction of a hamlet the coolest and most courageous man was scarcely over five feet in height with a soft voice and an embarrassed timid manner the  term roughs applied to them was a distinction rather than a definition perhaps in the minor details of fingers toes ears etc the camp may have been deficient but these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force the strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand the best shot had but one eye  such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed around the cabin the camp lay in a triangular valley between two hills and a river the only outlet was a steep trail over the summit of a hill that faced the cabin now illuminated by the rising moon the suffering woman might have seen it from the rude bunk whereon she layseen it winding like a silver thread until it was lost in the stars above  a fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gathering by degrees the natural levity of roaring camp returned bets were freely offered and taken regarding the result three to five that sal would get through with it even that the child would survive side bets as to the sex and complexion of the coming stranger in the midst of an excited discussion an exclamation came from those nearest the door and the camp stopped to listen above the swaying and moaning of the pines the swift rush of the river and the crackling of the fire rose a sharp querulous crya cry unlike anything heard before in the camp the pines stopped moaning the river ceased to rush and the fire to crackle it seemed as if nature had stopped to listen too  the camp rose to its feet as one man it was proposed to explode a barrel of gunpowder but in consideration of the situation of the mother better counsels prevailed and only a few revolvers were discharged for whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp or some other reason cherokee sal was sinking fast within an hour she had climbed as it were that rugged road that led to the stars and so passed out of roaring camp its sin and shame forever i do not think that the announcement disturbed them much except in speculation as to the fate of the child can he live now was asked of stumpy the answer was doubtful the only other being of cherokee sals sex and maternal condition in the settlement was an ass there was some conjecture as  to fitness but the experiment was tried it was less problematical than the ancient treatment of romulus and remus and apparently as successful  when these details were completed which exhausted another hour the door was opened and the anxious crowd of men who had already formed themselves into a queue entered in single file beside the low bunk or shelf on which the figure of the mother was starkly outlined below the blankets stood a pine table on this a candlebox was placed and within it swathed in staring red flannel lay the last arrival at roaring camp beside the candlebox was placed a hat its use was soon indicated gentlemen said stumpy with a singular mixture of authority and ex officio complacencygentlemen will please pass in at the front door round the table and out at the back door them as wishes to contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy the first man entered with his hat on he uncovered however as he looked about him and so unconsciously set an example to the next in such communities good and bad actions are catching as the procession filed in comments were audiblecriticisms addressed perhaps rather to stumpy in the character of showman is that him mighty small specimen hasnt moren  got the color aint bigger nor a derringer the contributions were as characteristic a silver tobacco box a doubloon a navy revolver silver mounted a gold specimen a very beautifully embroidered ladys handkerchief from oakhurst the gambler a diamond breastpin a diamond  ring suggested by the pin with the remark from the giver that he saw that pin and went two diamonds better a slungshot a bible contributor not detected a golden spur a silver teaspoon the initials i regret to say were not the givers a pair of surgeons shears a lancet a bank of england note for l5 and about 200 in loose gold and silver coin during these proceedings stumpy maintained a silence as impassive as the dead on his left a gravity as inscrutable as that of the newly born on his right only one incident occurred to break the monotony of the curious procession as kentuck bent over the candle box half curiously the child turned and in a spasm of pain caught at his groping finger and held it fast for a moment kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed something like a blush tried to assert itself in his weatherbeaten cheek the dd little cuss he said as he extricated his finger with perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed capable of showing he held that finger a little apart from its fellows as he went out and examined it curiously the examination provoked the same original remark in regard to the child in fact he seemed to enjoy repeating it he rastled with my finger he remarked to tipton holding up the member the dd little cuss  it was four oclock before the camp sought repose a light burnt in the cabin where the watchers sat for stumpy did not go to bed that night nor did kentuck he drank quite freely and related with great gusto his experience invariably ending with his characteristic condemnation of the newcomer it seemed to relieve him of any unjust implication of sentiment and kentuck had the weaknesses of the nobler sex when everybody else had gone to bed he walked down to the river and whistled reflectingly then he walked up the gulch past the cabin still whistling with demonstrative unconcern at a large redwoodtree he  paused and retraced his steps and again passed the cabin halfway down to the rivers bank he again paused and then returned and knocked at the door it was opened by stumpy how goes it said kentuck looking past stumpy toward the candlebox all serene replied stumpy anything up nothing there was a pausean embarrassing onestumpy still holding the door then kentuck had recourse to his finger which he held up to stumpy rastled with itthe dd little cuss he said and retired  the next day cherokee sal had such rude sepulture as roaring camp afforded after her body had been committed to the hillside there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her infant a resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic but an animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at once sprang up it was remarkable that the argument partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were usually conducted at roaring camp tipton proposed that they should send the child to red doga distance of forty mileswhere female attention could be procured but the unlucky suggestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition it was evident that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained besides said tom ryder them fellows at red dog would swap it and ring in somebody else on us a disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed at roaring camp as in other places  the introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with objection it was argued that no decent woman could be prevailed to accept roaring camp as her home and the speaker urged that they didnt want any more of the other kind this unkind allusion to the defunct mother harsh as it may seem was the first spasm of proprietythe first symptom of the camps regeneration stumpy advanced nothing perhaps he felt a certain delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible successor in office but when questioned he averred stoutly that he and jinnythe mammal before alluded tocould manage to rear the child there was something original independent and heroic about the plan that pleased the camp stumpy was retained certain articles were sent for to sacramento mind said the treasurer as he pressed a bag of gold dust into the expressmans hand the best that can be gotlace you know and filigreework and frillsdn the cost strange to say the child thrived perhaps the invigorating climate of the mountain camp was compensation for material deficiencies nature took the foundling to her broader breast in that rare atmosphere of the sierra foothillsthat air pungent with balsamic odor that ethereal cordial at once bracing and exhilaratinghe may have found food and nourishment or a subtle chemistry that transmuted asss milk to lime and phosphorus stumpy inclined to the belief that it was the latter and good nursing me and that ass he would say has been father and mother to him dont you he would add apostrophizing the helpless bundle before him never go back on us  by the time he was a month old the necessity of giving him a name became apparent he had generally been known as the kid stumpys boy the coyote an allusion to his vocal powers and even by kentucks endearing diminutive of the dd little cuss but these were felt to be vague and unsatisfactory and were at last dismissed under another influence gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious and oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought the luck to roaring camp it was certain that of late they had been successful luck was the name  agreed upon with the prefix of tommy for greater convenience no allusion was made to the mother and the father was unknown its better said the philosophical oakhurst to take a fresh deal all round call him luck and start him fair a day was accordingly set apart for the christening what was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine who has already gathered some idea of the reckless irreverence of roaring camp the master of ceremonies was one boston a noted wag and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest facetiousness this ingenious satirist had spent two days in preparing a burlesque of the church service with pointed local allusions the choir was properly trained and sandy tipton was to stand godfather but after the procession had marched to the grove with music and banners and the child had been deposited before a mock altar stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd it aint my style to spoil fun boys said the little man stoutly eying the faces around him but it strikes me that this thing aint exactly on the squar its playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that he aint goin to understand and ef theres goin to be any godfathers round id like to see whos got any better rights than me a silence followed stumpys speech to the credit of all humorists be it said that the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped of his fun but said stumpy quickly following up his advantage were here for a christening and well have it i proclaim you thomas luck according to the laws of the united states and the state of california so help me god it was the first time that the name of the deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp the form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had conceived but strangely enough nobody saw it and nobody laughed tommy was christened as seriously as he would have  been under a christian roof and cried and was comforted in as orthodox fashion  and so the work of regeneration began in roaring camp almost imperceptibly a change came over the settlement the cabin assigned to tommy luckor the luck as he was more frequently calledfirst showed signs of improvement it was kept scrupulously clean and whitewashed then it was boarded clothed and papered the rosewood cradle packed eighty miles by mule had in stumpys way of putting it sorter killed the rest of the furniture so the rehabilitation of the cabin became a necessity the men who were in the habit of lounging in at stumpys to see how the luck got on seemed to appreciate the change and in selfdefense the rival establishment of tuttles grocery bestirred itself and imported a carpet and mirrors the reflections of the latter on the appearance of roaring camp tended to produce stricter habits of personal cleanliness again stumpy imposed a kind of quarantine upon those who aspired to the honor and privilege of holding the luck it was a cruel mortification to kentuckwho in the carelessness of a large nature and the habits of frontier life had begun to regard all garments as a second cuticle which like a snakes only sloughed off through decayto be debarred this privilege from certain prudential reasons yet such was the subtle influence of innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon in a clean shirt and face still shining from his ablutions nor were moral and social sanitary laws neglected tommy who was supposed to spend his whole existence in a persistent attempt to repose must not be disturbed by noise the shouting and yelling which had gained the camp its infelicitous title were not permitted within hearing distance of stumpys the men conversed in whispers or smoked with indian gravity profanity was tacitly given up in these sacred precincts and throughout the camp a popular form of expletive known as dn the luck and curse the luck was abandoned as having a new personal bearing vocal music was not interdicted being supposed to have a soothing tranquilizing quality and one song sung by manowar jack an english sailor from her majestys australian colonies was quite popular as a lullaby it was a lugubrious recital of the exploits of the arethusa seventyfour in a muffled minor ending with a prolonged dying fall at the burden of each verse on b oooard of the arethusa it was a fine sight to see jack holding the luck rocking from side to side as if with the motion of a ship and crooning forth this naval ditty either through the peculiar rocking of jack or the length of his songit contained ninety stanzas and was continued with conscientious deliberation to the bitter endthe lullaby generally had the desired effect at such times the men would lie at full length under the trees in the soft summer twilight smoking their pipes and drinking in the melodious utterances an indistinct idea that this was pastoral happiness pervaded the camp this ere kind o think said the cockney simmons meditatively reclining on his elbow is evingly it reminded him of greenwich  on the long summer days the luck was usually carried to the gulch from whence the golden store of roaring camp was taken there on a blanket spread over pine boughs he would lie while the men were working in the ditches below latterly there was a rude attempt to decorate this bower with flowers and sweetsmelling shrubs and generally some one would bring him a cluster of wild honeysuckles  azaleas or the painted blossoms of las mariposas the men had suddenly awakened to the fact that there were beauty and significance in these trifles which they had so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet a flake of glittering mica a fragment of variegated quartz a bright  pebble from the bed of the creek became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and strengthened and were invariably put aside for the luck it was wonderful how many treasures the woods and hillsides yielded that would do for tommy surrounded by playthings such as never child out of fairyland had before it is to be hoped that tommy was content he appeared to be serenely happy albeit there was an infantine gravity about him a contemplative light in his round gray eyes that sometimes worried stumpy he was always tractable and quiet and it is recorded that once having crept beyond his corrala hedge of tessellated pine boughs which surrounded his bedhe dropped over the bank on his head in the soft earth and remained with his mottled legs in the air in that position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity he was extricated without a murmur i hesitate to record the many other instances of his sagacity which rest unfortunately upon the statements of prejudiced friends some of them were not without a tinge of superstition i crep up the bank just now said kentuck one day in a breathless state of excitement and dern my skin if he wasnt atalking to a jaybird as was asittin on his lap there they was just as free and sociable as anything you please ajawin at each other just like two cherrybums howbeit whether creeping over the pine boughs or lying lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him to him the birds sang the squirrels chattered and the flowers bloomed nature was his nurse and playfellow for him she would let slip between the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within his grasp she would send wandering breezes to visit him with the balm of bay and resinous gum to him the tall redwoods nodded familiarly and sleepily the bumblebees buzzed and the rooks cawed a slumberous accompaniment  such was the golden summer of roaring camp they  were flush times and the luck was with them the claims had yielded enormously the camp was jealous of its privileges and looked suspiciously on strangers no encouragement was given to immigration and to make their seclusion more perfect the land on either side of the mountain wall that surrounded the camp they duly preempted this and a reputation for singular proficiency with the revolver kept the reserve of roaring camp inviolate the expressmantheir only connecting link with the surrounding worldsometimes told wonderful stories of the camp he would say theyve a street up there in roaring that would lay over any street in red dog theyve got vines and flowers round their houses and they wash themselves twice a day but theyre mighty rough on strangers and they worship an ingin baby  with the prosperity of the camp came a desire for further improvement it was  proposed to build a hotel in the following spring and to invite one or two decent families to reside there for the sake of the luck who might perhaps profit by female companionship the sacrifice that this concession to the sex cost these men who were fiercely skeptical in regard to its general virtue and usefulness can only be accounted for by their affection for tommy a few still held out but the resolve could not be carried into effect for three months and the minority meekly yielded in the hope that something might turn up to prevent it and it did  the winter of 1851 will long be remembered in the foothills the snow lay deep on the sierras and every mountain creek became a river and every river a lake each gorge and gulch was transformed into a tumultuous watercourse that descended the hillsides tearing down giant trees and scattering its drift and debris along the plain red dog had been twice under water and roaring camp had been forewarned water put the gold into them gulches  said stumpy its been here once and will be here again and that night the north fork suddenly leaped over its banks and swept up the triangular valley of roaring camp  in the confusion of rushing water crashing trees and crackling timber and the darkness which seemed to flow with the water and blot out the fair valley but little could be done to collect the scattered camp when the morning broke the cabin of stumpy nearest the river bank was gone higher up the gulch they found the body of its unlucky owner but the pride the hope the joy the luck of roaring camp had disappeared they were returning with sad hearts when a shout from the bank recalled them  it was a reliefboat from down the river they had picked up they said a man and an infant nearly exhausted about two miles below did anybody know them and did they belong here  it needed but a glance to show them kentuck lying there cruelly crushed and bruised but still holding the luck of roaring camp in his arms as they bent over the strangely assorted pair they saw that the child was cold and pulseless he is dead said one kentuck opened his eyes dead he repeated feebly yes my man and you are dying too a smile lit the eyes of the expiring kentuck dying he repeated hes ataking me with him tell the boys ive got the luck with me now and the strong man clinging to the frail babe as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw drifted away into the shadowy river that flows forever to the unknown sea     the outcasts of poker flat   as mr john oakhurst gambler stepped into the main street of poker flat on the morning of the 23d of november 1850 he was conscious of a change in its moral atmosphere since the preceding night two or three men conversing earnestly together ceased as he approached and exchanged significant glances there was a sabbath lull in the air which in a settlement unused to sabbath influences looked ominous  mr oakhursts calm handsome face betrayed small concern in these indications whether he was conscious of any predisposing cause was another question i reckon theyre after somebody he reflected likely its me he returned to his pocket the handkerchief with which he had been whipping away the red dust of poker flat from his neat boots and quietly discharged his mind of any further conjecture  in point of fact poker flat was after somebody it had lately suffered the loss of several thousand dollars two valuable horses and a prominent citizen it was experiencing a spasm of virtuous reaction quite as lawless and ungovernable as any of the acts that had provoked it a secret committee had determined to rid the town of all improper persons this was done permanently in regard of two men who were then hanging from the boughs of a sycamore in the gulch and temporarily in the banishment of certain other objectionable characters i regret to say that some of these were ladies it is but due to the sex however to state that their impropriety was professional and it was only in such easily established standards of evil that poker flat ventured to sit in judgment  mr oakhurst was right in supposing that he was included in this category a few of the committee had urged hanging him as a possible example and a sure method of reimbursing themselves from his pockets of the sums he had won from them its agin justice said jim wheeler to let this yer young man from roaring campan entire strangercarry away our money but a crude sentiment of equity residing in the breasts of those who had been fortunate enough to win from mr oakhurst overruled this narrower local prejudice  mr oakhurst received his sentence with philosophic calmness none the less coolly that he was aware of the hesitation of his judges he was too much of a gambler not to accept fate with him life was at best an uncertain game and he recognized the usual percentage in favor of the dealer  a body of armed men accompanied the deported wickedness of poker flat to the outskirts of the settlement besides mr oakhurst who was known to be a coolly desperate man and for whose intimidation the armed escort was intended the expatriated party consisted of a young woman familiarly known as the duchess another who had won the title of mother shipton and uncle billy a suspected sluicerobber and confirmed drunkard the cavalcade provoked no comments from the spectators nor was any word uttered by the escort only when the gulch which marked the uttermost limit of poker flat was reached the leader spoke briefly and to the point the exiles were forbidden to return at the peril of their lives  as the escort disappeared their pentup feelings found vent in a few hysterical tears from the duchess some bad language from mother shipton and a parthian volley of expletives from uncle billy the philosophic oakhurst  alone remained silent he listened calmly to mother shiptons desire to cut somebodys heart out to the repeated statements of the duchess that she would die in the road and to the alarming oaths that seemed to be bumped out of uncle billy as he rode forward with the easy good humor  characteristic of his class he insisted upon exchanging his own ridinghorse fivespot for the sorry mule which the duchess rode but even this act did not draw the party into any closer sympathy the young woman readjusted her somewhat draggled plumes with a feeble faded coquetry mother shipton eyed the possessor of fivespot with malevolence and uncle billy included the whole party in one sweeping anathema  the road to sandy bara camp that not having as yet experienced the regenerating influences of poker flat consequently seemed to offer some invitation to the emigrantslay over a steep mountain range it was distant a days severe travel in that advanced season the party soon passed out of the moist temperate regions of the foothills into the dry cold bracing air of the sierras the trail was narrow and difficult at noon the duchess rolling out of her saddle upon the ground declared her intention of going no farther and the party halted  the spot was singularly wild and impressive a wooded amphitheatre surrounded on three sides by precipitous cliffs of naked granite sloped gently toward the crest of another precipice that overlooked the valley it was undoubtedly the most suitable spot for a camp had camping been advisable but mr oakhurst knew that scarcely half the journey to sandy bar was accomplished and the party were not equipped or provisioned for delay this fact he pointed out to his companions curtly with a philosophic commentary on the folly of throwing up their hand before the game was played out but they were furnished with liquor which in this emergency stood them in place of food  fuel rest and prescience in spite of his remonstrances it was not long before they were more or less under its influence uncle billy passed rapidly from a bellicose state into one of stupor the duchess became maudlin and mother shipton snored mr oakhurst alone remained erect leaning against a rock calmly surveying them  mr oakhurst did not drink it interfered with a profession which required coolness impassiveness and presence of mind and in his own language he couldnt afford it as he gazed at his recumbent fellow exiles the loneliness begotten of his pariah trade his habits of life his very vices for the first time seriously oppressed him he bestirred himself in dusting his black clothes washing his hands and face and other acts characteristic of his studiously neat habits and for a moment forgot his annoyance the thought of deserting his weaker and more pitiable companions never perhaps occurred to him yet he could not help feeling the want of that excitement which singularly enough was most conducive to that calm equanimity for which he was notorious he looked at the gloomy walls that rose a thousand feet sheer above the circling pines around him at the sky ominously clouded at the valley below already deepening into shadow and doing so suddenly he heard his own name called  a horseman slowly ascended the trail in the fresh open face of the newcomer mr oakhurst recognized tom simson otherwise known as the innocent of sandy bar he had met him some months before over a little game and had with perfect equanimity won the entire fortuneamounting to some forty dollarsof that guileless youth after the game was finished mr oakhurst drew the youthful speculator behind the door and thus addressed him tommy youre a good little man but you cant gamble worth a cent dont try it over again he then handed him his money hack pushed him gently from the room and so made a devoted slave of tom simson  there was a remembrance of this in his boyish and enthusiastic greeting of mr oakhurst he had started he said to go to poker flat to seek his fortune alone no not exactly alone in fact a giggle he had run away with piney woods didnt mr oakhurst remember piney she that used to wait on the table at the temperance house they had been engaged a long time but old jake woods had objected and so they had run away and were going to poker flat to be married and here they were and they were tired out and how lucky it was they had found a place to camp and company all this the innocent delivered rapidly while piney a stout comely damsel of fifteen emerged from behind the pinetree where she had been blushing unseen and rode to the side of her lover  mr oakhurst seldom troubled himself with sentiment still less with propriety but he had a vague idea that the situation was not fortunate he retained however his presence of mind sufficiently to kick uncle billy who was about to say something and uncle billy was sober enough to recognize in mr oakhursts kick a superior power that would not bear trifling he then endeavored to dissuade tom simson from delaying further but in vain he even pointed out the fact that there was no provision nor means of making a camp but unluckily the innocent met this objection by assuring the party that he was provided with an extra mule loaded with provisions and by the discovery of a rude attempt at a log house near the trail piney can stay with mrs oakhurst said the innocent pointing to the duchess and i can shift for myself  nothing but mr oakhursts admonishing foot saved uncle billy from bursting into a roar of laughter as it  was he felt compelled to retire up the canon until he could recover his gravity there he confided the joke to the tall pinetrees with many slaps of his leg contortions of his face and the usual profanity but when he returned to the party he found them seated by a firefor the air had grown strangely chill and the sky overcastin apparently amicable conversation piney was actually talking in an impulsive girlish fashion  to the duchess who was listening with an interest and animation she had not shown for many days the innocent was holding forth apparently with equal effect to mr oakhurst and mother shipton who was actually relaxing into amiability is this yer a d d picnic said uncle billy with inward scorn as he surveyed the sylvan group the glancing firelight and the tethered animals in the foreground suddenly an idea mingled with the alcoholic fumes that disturbed his brain it was apparently of a jocular nature for he felt impelled to slap his leg again and cram his fist into his mouth  as the shadows crept slowly up the mountain a slight breeze rocked the tops of the pinetrees and moaned through their long and gloomy aisles the ruined cabin patched and covered with pine boughs was set apart for the ladies as the lovers parted they unaffectedly exchanged a kiss so honest and sincere that it might have been heard above the swaying pines the frail duchess and the malevolent mother shipton were probably too stunned to remark upon this last evidence of simplicity and so turned without a word to the hut the fire was replenished the men lay down before the door and in a few minutes were asleep  mr oakhurst was a light sleeper toward morning he awoke benumbed and cold as he stirred the dying fire the wind which was now blowing strongly brought to his cheek that which caused the blood to leave itsnow  he started to his feet with the intention of awakening the sleepers for there was no time to lose but turning to where uncle billy had been lying he found him gone a suspicion leaped to his brain and a curse to his lips he ran to the spot where the mules had been tetheredthey were no longer there the tracks were already rapidly disappearing in the snow  the momentary excitement brought mr oakhurst back to the fire with his usual calm he did not waken the sleepers the innocent slumbered peacefully with a smile on his goodhumored freckled face the virgin piney slept beside her frailer sisters as sweetly as though attended by celestial guardians and mr oakhurst drawing his blanket over his shoulders stroked his mustaches and waited for the dawn it came slowly in a whirling mist of snowflakes that dazzled and confused the eye what could be seen of the landscape appeared magically changed he looked over the valley and summed up the present and future in two words snowed in  a careful inventory of the provisions which fortunately for the party had been stored within the hut and so escaped the felonious fingers of uncle billy disclosed the fact that with care and prudence they might last ten days longer that is said mr oakhurst sotto voce to the innocent if youre willing to board us if you aintand perhaps youd better notyou can wait till uncle billy gets back with provisions for some occult reason mr oakhurst could not bring himself to disclose uncle billys rascality and so offered the hypothesis that he had wandered from the camp and had accidentally stampeded the animals he dropped a warning to the duchess and mother shipton who of course knew the facts of their associates defection theyll find out the truth about us all when they find out anything he added significantly and theres no good frightening them now  tom simson not only put all his worldly store at the  disposal of mr oakhurst but seemed to enjoy the prospect of their enforced seclusion well have a good camp for a week and then the snowll melt and well all go back together the cheerful gayety of the young man and mr oakhursts calm infected the others the innocent with the aid of pine boughs extemporized a thatch for the roofless cabin and the duchess directed piney in the rearrangement of the interior with a taste and tact that opened the blue eyes of that provincial maiden to their fullest extent i reckon now youre used to fine things at poker flat said piney the duchess turned away sharply to conceal something that reddened her cheeks through their professional tint and mother shipton requested piney not to chatter but when mr oakhurst returned from a weary search for the trail he heard the sound of happy laughter echoed from the rocks he stopped in some alarm and his thoughts first naturally reverted to the whiskey which he had prudently cached and yet it dont somehow sound like whiskey said the gambler it was not until he caught sight of the blazing fire through the still blinding storm and the group around it that he settled to the conviction that it was square fun  whether mr oakhurst had cached his cards with the whiskey as something debarred the free access of the community i cannot say it was certain that in mother shiptons words he didnt say cards once during that evening haply the time was beguiled by an accordion produced somewhat ostentatiously by tom simson from his pack notwithstanding some difficulties attending the manipulation of this instrument piney woods managed to pluck several reluctant melodies from its keys to an accompaniment by the innocent on a pair of bone castanets but the crowning festivity of the evening was reached in a rude campmeeting hymn which the lovers joining hands sang with great earnestness and vociferation i fear that a  certain defiant tone and covenanters swing to its chorus rather than any devotional quality caused it speedily to infect the others who at last joined in the refrain    im proud to live in the service of the lord and im bound to die   in his army  the pines rocked the storm eddied and whirled above the miserable group and the flames of their altar leaped heavenward as if in token of the vow  at midnight the storm abated the rolling clouds parted and the stars glittered keenly above the sleeping camp mr oakhurst whose professional habits had enabled him to live on the smallest possible amount of sleep in dividing the watch with tom simson somehow managed to take upon himself the greater part of that duty he excused himself to the innocent by saying that he had often been a week without sleep doing what asked tom poker replied oakhurst sententiously when a man gets a streak of luckniggerluckhe dont get tired the luck gives in first luck continued the gambler reflectively is a mighty queer thing all you know about it for certain is that its bound to change and its finding out when its going to change that makes you weve had a streak of bad luck since we left poker flatyou come along and slap you get into it too if you can hold your cards right along youre all right for added the gambler with cheerful irrelevance    im proud to live in the service of the lord and im bound to die   in his army  the third day came and the sun looking through the whitecurtained valley saw the outcasts divide their slowly decreasing store of provisions for the morning meal it was one of the peculiarities of that mountain climate that its rays diffused a kindly warmth over the wintry landscape as if in regretful commiseration of the past but it revealed drift on drift of snow piled high around the huta hopeless uncharted  trackless sea of white lying below the rocky shores to which the castaways still clung through the marvelously clear air the smoke of the pastoral village of poker flat rose miles away mother shipton saw it and from a remote pinnacle of her rocky fastness hurled in that direction a final malediction it was her last vituperative attempt and perhaps for that reason was invested with a certain degree of sublimity it did her good she privately informed the duchess just you go out there and cuss and see she then set herself to the task of amusing the child as she and the duchess were pleased to call piney piney was no chicken but it was a soothing and original theory of the pair thus to account for the fact that she didnt swear and wasnt improper  when night crept up again through the gorges the reedy notes of the accordion rose and fell in fitful spasms and longdrawn gasps by the flickering campfire but music failed to fill entirely the aching void left by insufficient food and a new diversion was proposed by piney storytelling neither mr oakhurst nor his female companions caring to relate their personal experiences this plan would have failed too but for the innocent some months before he had chanced upon a stray copy of mr popes ingenious translation of the iliad he now proposed to narrate the principal incidents of that poemhaving thoroughly mastered the argument and fairly forgotten the wordsin the current vernacular of sandy bar and so for the rest of that night the homeric demigods again walked the earth trojan bully and wily greek wrestled in the winds and the great pines in the canon seemed to bow to the wrath of the son of peleus mr oakhurst listened with quiet satisfaction most especially was he interested in the fate of ash heels as the innocent persisted in denominating the swiftfooted achilles  so with small food and much of homer and the accordion a week passed over the  heads of the outcasts the sun again forsook them and again from leaden skies the snowflakes were sifted over the land day by day closer around them drew the  snowy circle until at last they looked from their prison over drifted walls of dazzling white that towered twenty feet above their heads it became more and more difficult to replenish their fires even from the fallen trees beside them now half hidden in the drifts and yet no one complained the lovers turned from the dreary prospect and looked into each others eyes and were happy mr oakhurst settled himself coolly to the losing game before him the duchess more cheerful than she had been assumed the care of piney only mother shiptononce the strongest of the party seemed to sicken and fade at midnight on the tenth day she called oakhurst to her side im going she said in a voice of querulous weakness but dont say anything about it dont waken the kids take the bundle from under my head and open it mr oakhurst did so it contained mother shiptons rations for the last week untouched give em to the child she said pointing to the sleeping piney youve starved yourself said the gambler thats what they call it said the woman querulously as she lay down again and turning her face to the wall passed quietly away  the accordion and the bones were put aside that day and homer was forgotten when the body of mother shipton had been committed to the snow mr oakhurst took the innocent aside and showed him a pair of snowshoes which he had fashioned from the old packsaddle  theres one chance in a hundred to save her yet he said pointing to piney but its there he added pointing toward poker flat if you can reach there in two days shes safe and you asked tom simson ill stay here was the curt reply    the lovers parted with a long embrace you are not going too said the duchess as she saw mr oakhurst apparently waiting to accompany him as far as the canon he replied he turned suddenly and kissed the duchess leaving her pallid face aflame and her trembling limbs rigid with amazement  night came but not mr oakhurst it brought the storm again and the whirling snow then the duchess feeding the fire found that some one had quietly piled beside the hut enough fuel to last a few days longer the tears rose to her eyes but she hid them from piney  the women slept but little in the morning looking into each others faces they read their fate neither spoke but piney accepting the position of the stronger drew near and placed her arm around the duchesss waist they kept this attitude for the rest of the day that night the storm reached its greatest fury and rending asunder the protecting vines invaded the very hut  toward morning they found themselves unable to feed the fire which gradually died away as the embers slowly blackened the duchess crept closer to piney and broke the silence of many hours piney can you pray no dear said piney simply the duchess without knowing exactly why felt relieved and putting her head upon pineys shoulder spoke no more and so reclining the younger and purer pillowing the head of her soiled sister upon her virgin breast they fell asleep  the wind lulled as if it feared to waken them feathery drifts of snow shaken from the long pine boughs flew like white winged birds and settled about them as they slept the moon through the rifted clouds looked down upon what had been the camp but all human stain all trace of earthly travail was hidden beneath the spotless mantle mercifully flung from above  they slept all that day and the next nor did they waken  when voices and footsteps broke the silence of the camp and when pitying fingers brushed the snow from their wan faces you could scarcely have told from the equal peace that dwelt upon them which was she that had sinned even the law of poker flat recognized this and turned away leaving them still locked in each others arms  but at the head of the gulch on one of the largest pinetrees they found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a bowieknife it bore the following written in pencil in a firm hand    beneath this tree lies the body of john oakhurst who struck a   streak of bad luck on the 23d of november 1850 and handed in his   checks on the 7th december 1850  and pulseless and cold with a derringer by his side and a bullet in his heart though still calm as in life beneath the snow lay he who was at once the strongest and yet the weakest of the outcasts of poker flat     miggles   we were eight including the driver we had not spoken during the passage of the last six miles since the jolting of the heavy vehicle over the roughening road had spoiled the judges last poetical quotation the tall man beside the judge was asleep his arm passed through the swaying strap and his head resting upon italtogether a limp helpless looking object as if he had hanged himself and been cut down too late the french lady on the back seat was asleep too yet in a halfconscious propriety of attitude shown even in the disposition of the handkerchief which she held to her forehead and which partially veiled her face the lady from virginia city traveling with her husband had long since lost all individuality in a wild confusion of ribbons veils furs and shawls there was no sound but the rattling of wheels and the dash of rain upon the roof suddenly the stage stopped and we became dimly aware of voices the driver was evidently in the midst of an exciting colloquy with some one in the roada colloquy of which such fragments as bridge gone twenty feet of water cant pass were occasionally distinguishable above the storm then came a lull and a mysterious voice from the road shouted the parting adjuration  try miggless  we caught a glimpse of our leaders as the vehicle slowly turned of a horseman vanishing through the rain and we were evidently on our way to miggless  who and where was miggles the judge our authority did not remember the name  and he knew the country thoroughly the washoe traveler thought miggles must keep a hotel we only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear and that miggles was our rock of refuge a ten minutes splashing through a tangled byroad scarcely wide enough for the stage and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high evidently miggless and evidently miggles did not keep a hotel  the driver got down and tried the gate it was securely locked  miggles o miggles  no answer  miggells you miggles continued the driver with rising wrath  migglesy joined in the expressman persuasively o miggy mig  but no reply came from the apparently insensate miggles the judge who had finally got the window down put his head out and propounded a series of questions which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery but which the driver evaded by replying that if we didnt want to sit in the coach all night we had better rise up and sing out for miggles  so we rose up and called on miggles in chorus then separately and when we had finished a hibernian fellow passenger from the roof called for maygells whereat we all laughed while we were laughing the driver cried shoo  we listened to our infinite amazement the chorus of miggles was repeated from the other side of the wall even to the final and supplemental maygells  extraordinary echo said the judge  extraordinary dd skunk roared the driver  contemptuously come out of that miggles and show yourself be a man miggles dont hide in the dark i wouldnt if i were you miggles continued yuba bill now dancing about in an excess of fury  miggles continued the voice o miggles  my good man mr myghail said the judge softening the asperities of the name as much as possible consider the inhospitality of refusing shelter from the inclemency of the weather to helpless females really my dear sirbut a succession of miggles ending in a burst of laughter drowned his voice  yuba bill hesitated no longer taking a heavy stone from the road he battered down the gate and with the expressman entered the inclosure we followed nobody was to be seen in the gathering darkness all that we could distinguish was that we were in a gardenfrom the rose bushes that scattered over us a minute spray from  their dripping leavesand before a long rambling wooden building  do you know this miggles asked the judge of yuba  bill  no nor dont want to said bill shortly who felt the pioneer stage company insulted in his person by the  contumacious miggles  but my dear sir expostulated the judge as he thought of the barred gate  lookee here said yuba bill with fine irony hadnt you better go back and sit in the coach till yer introduced im going in and he pushed open the door of the building  a long room lighted only by the embers of a fire that  was dying on the large hearth at its farther extremity the walls curiously papered and the flickering firelight bringing out its grotesque pattern someone sitting in a large armchair by the fireplace all this we saw as we crowded together into the room after the driver and expressman   hello be you miggles said yuba bill to the solitary occupant  the figure neither spoke nor stirred yuba bill walked wrathfully toward it and turned the eye of his coachlantern upon its face it was a mans face prematurely old and wrinkled with very large eyes in which there was that expression of perfectly gratuitous solemnity which i had sometimes seen in an owls the large eyes wandered from bills face to the lantern and finally fixed their gaze on that luminous object without further recognition  bill restrained himself with an effort  miggles be you deaf you aint dumb anyhow you know and yuba bill shook the insensate figure by the shoulder  to our great dismay as bill removed his hand the venerable stranger apparently collapsed sinking into half his size and an undistinguishable heap of clothing  well dern my skin said bill looking appealingly at us and hopelessly retiring from the contest  the judge now stepped forward and we lifted the mysterious invertebrate back into his original position bill was dismissed with the lantern to reconnoitre outside for it was evident that from the helplessness of this solitary man there must be attendants near at hand and we all drew around the fire the judge who had regained his authority and had never lost his conversational amiabilitystanding before us with his back to the hearthcharged us as an imaginary jury as follows  it is evident that either our distinguished friend here has reached that condition described by shakespeare as the sere and yellow leaf or has suffered some premature abatement of his mental and physical faculties whether he is really the miggles  here he was interrupted by miggles o miggles migglesy mig and in fact the whole chorus of miggles in very much the same  key as it had once before been delivered unto us  we gazed at each other for a moment in some alarm the judge in particular vacated his position quickly as the voice seemed to come directly over his shoulder the cause however was soon discovered in a large magpie who was perched upon a shelf over the fireplace and who immediately relapsed into a sepulchral silence which contrasted singularly with his previous volubility it was undoubtedly his voice which we had heard in the road and our friend in the chair was not responsible for the discourtesy yuba bill who reentered the room after an unsuccessful search was both to accept the explanation and still eyed the helpless sitter with suspicion he had found a shed in which he had put up his horses but he came back dripping and skeptical thar aint nobody but him within ten mile of the shanty and that ar dd old skeesicks knows it  but the faith of the majority proved to be securely based bill had scarcely ceased growling before we heard a quick step upon the porch the trailing of a wet skirt the door was flung open and with a flash of white teeth a sparkle of dark eyes and an utter absence of ceremony or diffidence a young woman entered shut the door and panting leaned back against it  oh if you please im miggles  and this was miggles this brighteyed fullthroated young woman whose wet gown of coarse blue stuff could not hide the beauty of the feminine curves to which it clung from the chestnut crown of whose head topped by a mans oilskin souwester to the little feet and ankles hidden somewhere in the recesses of her boys brogans all was gracethis was miggles laughing at us too in the most airy frank offhand manner imaginable  you see boys said she quite out of breath and holding one little hand against her side quite unheeding  the speechless discomfiture of our party or the complete demoralization of yuba bill whose features had relaxed into an expression of gratuitous and imbecile cheerfulnessyou see boys i was morn two miles away when you passed down the road i thought you might pull up here and so i ran the whole way knowing nobody was home but jimandandim out of breathandthat lets me out and here miggles caught her dripping oilskin hat from her head with a mischievous swirl that scattered a shower of raindrops over us attempted to put back her hair dropped two hairpins in the attempt laughed and sat down beside yuba bill with her hands crossed lightly on her lap  the judge recovered himself first and essayed an extravagant compliment  ill trouble you for that harpin said miggles gravely half a dozen hands were eagerly stretched forward the missing hairpin was restored to its fair owner and miggles crossing the room looked keenly in the face of the invalid the solemn eyes looked back at hers with an expression we had never seen before life and intelligence seemed to struggle back into the rugged face miggles laughed again it was a singularly eloquent laughand turned her black eyes and white teeth once more towards us  this afflicted person ishesitated the judge  jim said miggles  your father  no  brother  no  husband  miggles darted a quick halfdefiant glance at the two lady passengers who i had noticed did not participate in the general masculine admiration of miggles and said gravely no its jim there was an awkward pause the lady passengers moved closer to each other the washoe husband looked abstractedly at the fire and the tall man apparently turned his eyes inward for selfsupport at this emergency but miggless laugh which was very infectious broke the silence  come she said briskly you must be hungry wholl bear a hand to help me get tea  she had no lack of volunteers in a few moments yuba bill was engaged like caliban in bearing logs for this miranda  the expressman was grinding coffee on the veranda to myself the arduous duty of slicing bacon was assigned and the judge lent each man his goodhumored and voluble counsel and when miggles assisted by the judge and our hibernian deckpassenger set the table with all the available crockery we had become quite joyous in spite of the rain that beat against the windows the wind that whirled down the chimney the two ladies who whispered together in the corner or the magpie who uttered a satirical and croaking commentary on their conversation from his perch above in the now bright blazing fire we could see that the walls were papered with illustrated journals arranged with feminine taste and discrimination the furniture was extemporized and adapted from candleboxes and packingcases and covered with gay calico or the skin of some animal the armchair of the helpless jim was an ingenious variation of a flourbarrel there was neatness and even a taste for the picturesque to be seen in the few details of the long low room  the meal was a culinary success but more it was a social triumph chiefly i think owing to the rare tact of miggles in guiding the conversation asking all the questions herself yet bearing throughout a frankness that rejected the idea of any concealment on her own part so that we talked of ourselves of our prospects of the journey of the weather of each otherof everything but our host and hostess it must be confessed that miggless conversation was never elegant rarely grammatical and that at times she employed expletives the use of which had generally been yielded to our sex but they were delivered with such a lighting up of teeth and eyes and  were usually followed by a laugha laugh peculiar to migglesso frank and honest that it seemed to clear the moral atmosphere  once during the meal we heard a noise like the rubbing of a heavy body against the outer walls of the house this was shortly followed by a scratching and sniffling at the door thats joaquin said miggles in reply to our questioning glances would you like to see him before we could answer she had opened the door and disclosed a half grown grizzly who instantly raised himself on his haunches with his fore paws hanging down in the popular attitude of mendicancy and looked admiringly at miggles with a very singular resemblance in his manner to yuba bill thats my watchdog said miggles in explanation oh he dont bite she added as the two lady passengers fluttered into a corner does he old toppy the latter remark being addressed directly to the sagacious joaquin i tell you what boys continued miggles after she had fed and closed the door on ursa minor you were in big luck that joaquin wasnt hanging round when you dropped in tonight  where was he asked the judge  with me said miggles lord love you he trots round with me nights like as if he was a man  we were silent for a few moments and listened to the wind perhaps we all had the same picture before usof miggles walking through the rainy woods with her savage guardian at her side the judge i remember said something about una and her lion but miggles received it as she did other compliments with quiet gravity whether she was altogether unconscious of the admiration  she excitedshe could hardly have been oblivious of yuba bills adorationi know not but her very frankness suggested a perfect sexual equality that was cruelly humiliating to the younger members of our party  the incident of the bear did not add anything in miggless favor to the opinions of those of her own sex who were present in fact the repast over a chillness radiated from the two lady passengers that no pine boughs brought in by yuba bill and cast as a sacrifice upon the hearth could wholly overcome miggles felt it and suddenly declaring that it was time to turn in offered to show the ladies to their bed in an adjoining room you boys will have to camp out here by the fire as well as you can she added for thar aint but the one room  our sexby which my dear sir i allude of course to the stronger portion of humanityhas been generally relieved from the imputation of curiosity or a fondness for gossip yet i am constrained to say that hardly had the door closed on miggles than we crowded together whispering snickering smiling and exchanging suspicions surmises and a thousand speculations in regard to our pretty hostess and her singular companion i fear that we even hustled that imbecile paralytic who sat like a voiceless memnon in our midst gazing with the serene indifference of the past in his passionless eyes upon our wordy counsels in the midst of an exciting discussion the door opened again and miggles reentered  but not apparently the same miggles who a few hours before had flashed upon us her eyes were downcast and as she hesitated for a moment on the threshold with a blanket on her arm she seemed to have left behind her the frank fearlessness which had charmed us a moment before coming into the room she drew a low stool beside the paralytics chair sat down drew the blanket over her shoulders and saying if its all the same to you boys  as were rather crowded ill stop here tonight took the invalids withered hand in her own and turned her eyes upon the dying fire an instinctive feeling that this was only premonitory to more confidential relations and perhaps some shame at our previous curiosity kept us silent the rain still heat upon the roof wandering gusts of wind stirred the embers into momentary brightness until in a lull of the elements miggles suddenly lifted up her head and throwing her hair over her shoulder turned her face upon the group and asked  is there any of you that knows me  there was no reply  think again i lived at marysville in 53 everybody knew me there and everybody had the right to know me i kept the polka saloon until i came to live with jim thats six years ago perhaps ive changed some  the absence of recognition may have disconcerted her she turned her head to the fire again and it was some seconds before she again spoke and then more rapidly  well you see i thought some of you must have known me theres no great harm done anyway what i was going to say was this jim here she took his hand in both of hers as she spokeused to know me if you didnt and spent a heap of money upon me i reckon he spent all he had and one dayits six years ago this winterjim came into my back room sat down on my sofy like as you see him in that chair and never moved again without help he was struck all of a heap and never seemed to know what ailed him the doctors came and said as how it was caused all along of his way of lifefor jim was mighty free and wildlikeand that he would never get better and couldnt last long anyway they advised me to send him to frisco to the hospital for he was no good to any one and would be a baby all his  life perhaps it was something in jims eye perhaps it was that i never had a baby but i said no i was rich then for i was popular with everybody gentlemen like yourself sir came to see meand i sold out my business and bought this yer place because it was sort of out of the way of travel you see and i brought my baby here  with a womans intuitive tact and poetry she had as she spoke slowly shifted her position so as to bring the mute figure of the ruined man between her and her audience hiding in the shadow behind it as if she offered it as a tacit apology for her actions silent and expressionless it yet spoke for her helpless crushed and smitten with the divine thunderbolt it still stretched an invisible arm around her  hidden in the darkness but still holding his hand she went on  it was a long time before i could get the hang of things about yer for i was used to company and excitement i couldnt get any woman to help me and a man i dursnt trust but what with the indians hereabout whod do odd jobs for me and having everything sent from the north fork jim and i managed to worry through the doctor would run up from sacramento once in a while hed ask to see miggless baby as he called jim and when hed go away hed say miggles youre a trumpgod bless you and it didnt seem so lonely after that but the last time he was here he said as he opened the door to go do you know miggles your baby will grow up to be a man yet and an honor to his mother but not here miggles not here and i thought he went away sadandandand here miggless voice and head were somehow both lost completely in the shadow  the folks about here are very kind said miggles after a pause coming a little into the light again the men from the fork used to hang around here until they found  they wasnt wanted and the women are kind and dont call i was pretty lonely until i picked up joaquin in the woods yonder one day when he wasnt so high and taught him to beg for his dinner and then thars pollythats the magpieshe knows no end of tricks and makes it quite sociable of evenings with her talk and so i dont feel like as i was the only living being about the ranch and jim here said miggles with her old laugh again and coming out quite into the firelightjimwhy boys you would admire to see how much he knows for a man like him sometimes i bring him flowers and he looks at em just as natural as if he knew em and times when were sitting alone i read him those things on the wall why lord said miggles with her frank laugh ive read him that whole side of the house this winter there never was such a man for reading as jim  why asked the judge do you not marry this man to whom you have devoted your youthful life  well you see said miggles it would be playing it rather low down on jim to take advantage of his being so helpless and then too if we were man and wife now wed both know that i was bound to do what i do now of my own accord  but you are young yet and attractive  its getting late said miggles gravely and youd better all turn in goodnight boys and throwing the blanket over her head miggles laid herself down beside jims chair her head pillowed on the low stool that held his feet and spoke no more the fire slowly faded from the hearth we each sought our blankets in silence and presently there was no sound in the long room but the  pattering of the rain upon the roof and the heavy breathing of the sleepers  it was nearly morning when i awoke from a troubled dream the storm had passed the stars were shining and through the shutterless window the full moon lifting itself over the solemn pines without looked into the room it touched the lonely figure in the chair with an infinite  compassion and seemed to baptize with a shining flood the lowly head of the woman whose hair as in the sweet old story bathed the feet of him she loved it even lent a kindly poetry to the rugged outline of yuba bill half reclining on his elbow between them and his passengers with savagely patient eyes keeping watch and ward and then i fell asleep and only woke at broad day with yuba bill standing over me and all aboard ringing in my ears  coffee was waiting for us on the table but miggles was gone we wandered about the house and lingered long after the horses were harnessed but she did not return it was evident that she wished to avoid a formal leavetaking and had so left us to depart as we had come after we had helped the ladies into the coach we returned to the house and solemnly shook hands with the paralytic jim as solemnly setting him back into position after each  handshake then we looked for the last time around the long low room at the stool where miggles had sat and slowly took our seats in the waiting coach the whip cracked and we were off  but as we reached the highroad bills dexterous hand laid the six horses back on their haunches and the stage stopped with a jerk for there on a little eminence beside the road stood miggles her hair flying her eyes sparkling her white handkerchief waving and her white teeth flashing a last goodby we waved our hats in return and then yuba bill as if fearful of further fascination madly lashed his horses forward and we sank back in our seats  we exchanged not a word until we reached the north fork and the stage drew up at the independence house then  the judge leading we walked into the barroom and took our places gravely at the bar  are your glasses charged gentlemen said the judge solemnly taking off his  white hat  they were  well then heres to migglesgod bless her  perhaps he had who knows     tennessees partner   i do not think that we ever knew his real name our ignorance of it certainly never gave us any social  inconvenience for at sandy bar in 1854 most men were christened anew sometimes these appellatives were derived from some distinctiveness of dress as in the case of dungaree jack or from some peculiarity of habit as shown in saleratus bill so called from an undue proportion of that chemical in his daily bread or from some unlucky slip as exhibited in the iron pirate a mild inoffensive man who earned that baleful title by his unfortunate  mispronunciation of the term iron pyrites perhaps this may have been the beginning of a rude heraldry but i am constrained to think that it was because a mans real name in that day rested solely upon his own unsupported statement call yourself clifford do you said boston addressing a timid newcomer with infinite scorn hell is full of such cliffords he then introduced the unfortunate man whose name happened to be really clifford as jaybird charleyan unhallowed inspiration of the moment that clung to him ever after  but to return to tennessees partner whom we never knew by any other than this relative title that he had ever existed as a separate and distinct individuality we only learned later it seems that in 1853 he left poker flat to go to san francisco ostensibly to procure a wife he never got any farther than stockton at that place he was attracted by a young person who waited upon the table at the hotel where he took his meals one morning he said  something to her which caused her to smile not unkindly to somewhat coquettishly break a plate of toast over his upturned serious simple face and to retreat to the kitchen he followed her and emerged a few moments later covered with more toast and victory that day week they were married by a justice of the peace and returned to poker flat i am aware that something more might be made of this episode but i prefer to tell it as it was current at sandy barin the gulches and barroomswhere all sentiment was modified by a strong sense of humor  of their married felicity but little is known perhaps for the reason that tennessee then living with his partner one day took occasion to say something to the bride on his own account at which it is said she smiled not unkindly and chastely retreatedthis time as far as marysville where tennessee followed her and where they went to housekeeping without the aid of a justice of the peace tennessees partner took the loss of his wife simply and seriously as was his fashion but to everybodys surprise when tennessee one day returned from marysville without his partners wifeshe having smiled and retreated with somebody elsetennessees partner was the first man to shake his hand and greet him with affection the boys who had gathered in the canon to see the shooting were naturally indignant their indignation might have found vent in sarcasm but for a certain look in tennessees partners eye that indicated a lack of humorous appreciation in fact he was a grave man with a steady application to practical detail which was unpleasant in a difficulty  meanwhile a popular feeling against tennessee had grown up on the bar he was known to be a gambler he was suspected to be a thief in these suspicions tennessees partner was equally compromised his continued intimacy with tennessee after the affair above quoted could only be accounted for on the hypothesis of a copartnership  of crime at last tennessees guilt became flagrant one day he overtook a stranger on his way to red dog the stranger afterward related that tennessee beguiled the time with interesting anecdote and reminiscence but illogically concluded the interview in the following words and now young man ill trouble you for your knife your pistols and your money you see your weppings might get you into trouble at red dog and your moneys a temptation to the evilly disposed i think you said your address was san francisco i shall endeavor to call it may be stated here that tennessee had a fine flow of humor which no business preoccupation could wholly subdue  this exploit was his last red dog and sandy bar made common cause against the highwayman tennessee was hunted in very much the same fashion as his prototype the grizzly as the toils closed around him he made a desperate dash through the bar emptying his revolver at the crowd before the arcade saloon and so on up grizzly canon but at its farther extremity he was stopped by a small man on a gray horse the men looked at each other a moment in silence both were fearless both selfpossessed and independent and both types of a civilization that in the seventeenth century would have been called heroic but in the nineteenth simply reckless  what have you got therei call said tennessee quietly  two bowers and an ace said the stranger as quietly showing two revolvers and a bowieknife  that takes me returned tennessee and with this gamblers epigram he threw away his useless pistol and rode back with his captor  it was a warm night the cool breeze which usually sprang up with the going down of the sun behind the chaparralcrested mountain was that evening withheld from    sandy bar the little canon was stifling with heated resinous odors and the decaying driftwood on the bar sent forth faint sickening exhalations the feverishness of day and its fierce passions still filled the camp lights moved restlessly along the bank of the river striking no answering reflection from its tawny current against the blackness of the pines the windows of the old loft above the expressoffice stood out staringly bright and through their curtainless panes the loungers below could see the forms of those who were even then deciding the fate of tennessee and above all this etched on the dark firmament rose the sierra remote and passionless crowned with remoter passionless stars  the trial of tennessee was conducted as fairly as was consistent with a judge and jury who felt themselves to some extent obliged to justify in their verdict the previous irregularities of arrest and indictment the law of sandy bar was implacable but not vengeful the excitement and personal feeling of the chase were over with tennessee safe in their hands they were ready to listen patiently to any defense which they were already satisfied was insufficient there being no doubt in their own minds they were willing to give the prisoner the benefit of any that might exist secure in the hypothesis that he ought to be hanged on general principles they indulged him with more latitude of defense than his reckless hardihood seemed to ask the judge appeared to be more anxious than the prisoner who otherwise unconcerned evidently took a grim pleasure in the responsibility he had created i dont take any hand in this yer game had been his invariable but goodhumored reply to all questions the judgewho was also his captorfor a moment vaguely regretted that he had not shot him on sight that morning but presently dismissed this human weakness as unworthy of the judicial mind nevertheless when there was a tap at  the door and it was said that tennessees partner was there on behalf of the prisoner he was admitted at once without question perhaps the younger members of the jury to whom the proceedings were becoming irksomely thoughtful hailed him as a relief  for he was not certainly an imposing figure short and stout with a square face sunburned into a preternatural redness clad in a loose duck jumper and trousers streaked and splashed with red soil his aspect under any circumstances would have been quaint and was now even ridiculous as he stooped to deposit at his feet a heavy carpetbag he was carrying it became obvious from partially developed legends and inscriptions that the material with which his trousers had been patched had been originally intended for a less ambitious covering yet he advanced with great gravity and after shaking the hand of each person in the room with labored cordiality he wiped his serious perplexed face on a red bandana handkerchief a shade lighter than his complexion laid his powerful hand upon the table to steady himself and thus addressed the judge  i was passin by he began by way of apology and i thought id just step in and see how things was gittin on with tennessee thar my pardner its a hot night i disremember any sich weather before on the bar  he paused a moment but nobody volunteering any other meteorological recollection he again had recourse to his pockethandkerchief and for some moments mopped his face diligently  have you anything to say on behalf of the prisoner said the judge finally  thets it said tennessees partner in a tone of relief i come yar as tennessees pardnerknowing him nigh on four year off and on wet and dry in luck and out o luck his ways aint aller my ways but thar aint any pints in that young man thar aint any liveliness as hes  been up to as i dont know and you sez to me sez youconfidentiallike and between man and mansez you do you know anything in his behalf and i sez to you sez i confidentiallike as between man and manwhat should a man know of his pardner  is this all you have to say asked the judge impatiently feeling perhaps that a dangerous sympathy of humor was beginning to humanize the court  thets so continued tennessees partner it aint for me to say anything agin him and now whats the case heres tennessee wants money wants it bad and doesnt like to ask it of his old pardner well what does tennessee do he lays for a stranger and he fetches that stranger and you lays for him and you fetches him and the honors is easy and i put it to you bein a farminded man and to you gentlemen all as farminded men ef this isnt so  prisoner said the judge interrupting have you any questions to ask this man  no no continued tennessees partner hastily i play this yer hand alone to come down to the bedrock its just this tennessee thar has played it pretty rough and expensivelike on a stranger and on this yer camp and now whats the fair thing some would say more some would say less heres seventeen hundred dollars in coarse gold and a watchits about all my pileand call it square and before a hand could be raised to prevent him he had emptied the contents of the carpetbag upon the table  for a moment his life was in jeopardy one or two men sprang to their feet several hands groped for hidden weapons and a suggestion to throw him from the window  was only overridden by a gesture from the judge tennessee laughed and apparently oblivious of the excitement tennessees partner improved the opportunity to mop his face again with his handkerchief   when order was restored and the man was made to understand by the use of forcible figures and rhetoric that tennessees offense could not be condoned by money his face took a more serious and sanguinary hue and those who were nearest to him noticed that his rough hand trembled slightly on the table he hesitated a moment as he slowly returned the gold to the carpetbag as if he had not yet entirely caught the elevated sense of justice which swayed the tribunal and was perplexed with the belief that he had not offered enough then he turned to the judge and saying this yer is a lone hand played alone and without my pardner he bowed to the jury and was about to withdraw when the judge called him back  if you have anything to say to tennessee you had better say it now  for the first time that evening the eyes of the prisoner and his strange advocate met tennessee smiled showed his white teeth and saying euchred old man held out his hand tennessees partner took it in his own and saying i just dropped in as i was passin to see how things was gettin on let the hand passively fall and adding that it was a warm night again mopped his face with his handkerchief and without another word withdrew  the two men never again met each other alive for the unparalleled insult of a bribe offered to judge lynchwho whether bigoted weak or narrow was at least incorruptiblefirmly fixed in the mind of that mythical personage any wavering determination of tennessees fate and at the break of day he was marched closely guarded to meet it at the top of marleys hill  how he met it how cool he was how he refused to say anything how perfect were the arrangements of the committee were all duly reported with the addition of a warning moral and example to all future evildoers in the red dog clarion by its editor who was present and to whose vigorous english i cheerfully refer the reader but the  beauty of that midsummer morning the blessed amity of earth and air and sky the awakened life of the free woods and hills the joyous renewal and promise of nature and above all the infinite serenity that thrilled through each was not reported as not being a part of the social lesson and yet when the weak and foolish deed was done and a life with its possibilities and responsibilities had passed out of the misshapen thing that dangled between earth and sky the birds sang the flowers bloomed the sun shone as cheerily as before and possibly the red dog clarion was right  tennessees partner was not in the group that surrounded the ominous tree but as they turned to disperse attention was drawn to the singular appearance of a motionless donkeycart halted at the side of the road as they approached they at once recognized the venerable jenny and the twowheeled cart as the property of tennessees partner used by him in carrying dirt from his claim and a few paces distant the owner of the equipage himself sitting under a buckeye tree wiping the perspiration from his glowing face in answer to an inquiry he said he had come for the body of the diseased if it was all the same to the committee he didnt wish to hurry anything  he could wait he was not working that day and when the gentlemen were done with the diseased he would take him ef thar is any present he added in his simple serious way as would care to jine in the funl they kin come perhaps it was from a sense of humor which i have already intimated was a feature of sandy bar perhaps it was from something even better than that but two thirds of the loungers accepted the invitation at once  it was noon when the body of tennessee was delivered into the hands of his partner as the cart drew up to the fatal tree we noticed that it contained a rough oblong boxapparently made from a section of sluicingand half filled with bark and the tassels of pine the cart was further decorated with slips of willow and made fragrant with buckeyeblossoms when the body was deposited in the box tennessees partner drew over it a piece of tarred canvas and gravely mounting the narrow seat in front with his feet upon the shafts urged the little donkey forward the equipage moved slowly on at that decorous pace which was habitual with jenny even under less solemn circumstances the menhalf curiously half jestingly but all good humoredlystrolled along beside the cart some in advance some a little in the rear of the homely catafalque but whether from the narrowing of the road or some present sense of decorum as the cart passed on the company fell to the rear in couples keeping step and otherwise assuming the external show of a formal procession jack folinsbee who had at the outset played a funeral march in dumb show upon an imaginary trombone desisted from a lack of sympathy and appreciationnot having perhaps your true humorists capacity to be content with the enjoyment of his own fun  the way led through grizzly canon by this time clothed in funereal drapery and shadows the redwoods burying their moccasined feet in the red soil stood in indian file along the track trailing an uncouth benediction from their bending boughs upon the passing bier a hare surprised into helpless inactivity sat upright and pulsating in the ferns by the roadside as the cortege went by squirrels hastened to gain a secure outlook from higher boughs and the bluejays spreading their wings fluttered before them like outriders until the outskirts of sandy bar were reached and the solitary cabin of tennessees partner  viewed under more favorable circumstances it would not have been a cheerful place the unpicturesque site the rude and unlovely outlines the unsavory details which  distinguish the nestbuilding of the california miner were all here with the dreariness of decay superadded a few paces from the cabin there was a rough inclosure which in the brief days of tennessees partners matrimonial felicity had been used as a garden but was now overgrown with fern as we approached it we were surprised to find that what we had taken for a recent attempt at cultivation was the broken soil about an open grave  the cart was halted before the inclosure and rejecting the offers of assistance with the same air of simple selfreliance he had displayed throughout tennessees partner lifted the rough coffin on his back and deposited it unaided within the shallow grave he then nailed down the board which served as a lid and mounting the little mound of earth beside it took off his hat and slowly mopped his face with his handkerchief this the crowd felt was a preliminary to speech and they disposed themselves variously on stumps and boulders and sat expectant  when a man began tennessees partner slowly has been running free all day whats the natural thing for him to do why to come home and if he aint in a condition to go home what can his best friend do why bring him home and heres tennessee has been running free and we brings him home from his wandering he paused and picked up a fragment of quartz rubbed it thoughtfully on his sleeve and went on it aint the first time that ive packed him on my back as you seed me now it aint the first time that i brought him to this yer cabin when he couldnt help himself it aint the first time that i and jinny have waited for him on yon hill and picked him up and so fetched him home when he couldnt speak and didnt know me and now that its the last time whyhe paused and rubbed the quartz gently on his sleeveyou see its sort of rough on his pardner and  now gentlemen he added abruptly picking up his longhandled shovel the funls over and my thanks and tennessees thanks to you for your trouble  resisting any proffers of assistance he began to fill in the grave turning his back upon the crowd that after a few moments hesitation gradually withdrew as they crossed the little ridge that hid sandy bar from view some looking back thought they could see tennessees partner his work done sitting upon the grave his shovel between his knees and his face buried in his red bandana handkerchief but it was argued by others that you couldnt tell his face from his handkerchief at that distance and this point remained undecided  in the reaction that followed the feverish excitement of that day tennessees partner was not forgotten a secret investigation had cleared him of any complicity in tennessees guilt and left only a suspicion of his general sanity sandy bar made a point of calling on him and proffering various uncouth but wellmeant kindnesses but from that day his rude health and great strength seemed visibly to decline and when the rainy season fairly set in and the tiny grass blades were beginning to peep from the rocky mound above tennessees grave he took to his bed  one night when the pines beside the cabin were swaying in the storm and trailing their slender fingers over the roof and the roar and rush of the swollen river were heard below tennessees partner lifted his head from the pillow saying it is time to go for tennessee i must put jinny in the cart and would have risen from his bed but for the restraint of his attendant struggling he still pursued his singular fancy there now steady jinnysteady old girl how dark it is look out for the rutsand look out for him too old gal sometimes you know when hes blind drunk he drops down right in the trail keep on  straight up to the pine on the top of the hill thar i told you sothar he iscoming this way tooall by himself sober and his face ashining tennessee pardner  and so they met     the idyl of bed gulch   sandy was very drunk he was lying under an azaleabush in pretty much the same attitude in which he had fallen some hours before how long he had been lying there he could not tell and didnt care how long he should lie there was a matter equally indefinite and unconsidered a tranquil philosophy born of his physical condition suffused and saturated his moral being  the spectacle of a drunken man and of this drunken man in particular was not i grieve to say of sufficient novelty in red gulch to attract attention earlier in the day some local satirist had erected a temporary tombstone at sandys head bearing the inscription effects of mccorkles whiskeykills at forty rods with a hand pointing to mccorkles saloon but this i imagine was like most local satire personal and was a reflection upon the unfairness of the process rather than a commentary upon the impropriety of the result with this facetious exception sandy had been undisturbed a wandering mule released from his pack had cropped the scant herbage beside him and sniffed curiously at the prostrate man a vagabond dog with that deep sympathy which the species have for drunken men had licked his dusty boots and curled himself up at his feet and lay there blinking one eye in the sunlight with a simulation of dissipation that was ingenious and doglike in its implied flattery of the unconscious man beside him  meanwhile the shadows of the pinetrees had slowly swung around until they crossed the road and their trunks  barred the open meadow with gigantic parallels of black and yellow little puffs of red dust lifted by the plunging hoofs of passing teams dispersed in a grimy shower upon the recumbent man the sun sank lower and lower and still sandy stirred not and then the repose of this philosopher was disturbed as other philosophers have been by the intrusion of an unphilosophical sex  miss mary as she was known to the little flock that she had just dismissed from the log schoolhouse beyond the pines was taking her afternoon walk observing an unusually fine cluster of blossoms on the azaleabush opposite she crossed the road to pluck it picking her way through the red dust not without certain fierce little shivers of disgust and some feline circumlocution and then she came suddenly upon sandy  of course she uttered the little staccato cry of her sex but when she had paid that tribute to her physical weakness she became overbold and halted for a momentat least six feet from this prostrate monster with her white skirts gathered in her hand ready for flight but neither sound nor motion came from the bush with one little foot she then overturned the satirical headboard and muttered beastsan epithet which probably at that moment conveniently classified in her mind the entire male population of red gulch for miss mary being possessed of certain rigid notions of her own had not perhaps properly appreciated the demonstrative gallantry for which the californian has been so justly celebrated by his brother californians and had as a newcomer perhaps fairly earned the reputation of being stuck up  as she stood there she noticed also that the slant sunbeams were heating sandys head to what she judged to be an unhealthy temperature and that his hat was lying uselessly at his side to pick it up and to place it over his face was a work requiring some courage particularly as  his eyes were open yet she did it and made good her retreat but she was somewhat concerned on looking back to see that the hat was removed and that sandy was sitting up and saying something  the truth was that in the calm depths of sandys mind he was satisfied that the rays of the sun were beneficial and healthful that from childhood he had objected to lying down in a hat that no people but condemned fools past redemption ever wore hats and that his right to dispense with them when he pleased was inalienable this was the statement of his inner consciousness unfortunately its outward expression was vague being limited to a repetition of the following formula sushine all ri wasser maar eh wass up sushine  miss mary stopped and taking fresh courage from her vantage of distance asked him if there was anything that he wanted  wass up wasser maar continued sandy in a very high key  get up you horrid man said miss mary now thoroughly incensed get up and go home  sandy staggered to his feet he was six feet high and miss mary trembled he started forward a few paces and then stopped  wass i go home for he suddenly asked with great gravity  go and take a bath replied miss mary eying his grimy person with great disfavor  to her infinite dismay sandy suddenly pulled off his coat and vest threw them on the ground kicked off his boots and plunging wildly forward darted headlong over the hill in the direction of the river  goodness heavens the man will be drowned said miss mary and then with feminine inconsistency she ran back to the schoolhouse and locked herself in    that night while seated at supper with her hostess the blacksmiths wife it came to miss mary to ask demurely if her husband ever got drunk abner responded mrs stidger reflectivelylets see abner hasnt been tight since last lection miss mary would have liked to ask if he preferred lying in the sun on these occasions and if a cold bath would have hurt him but this would have involved an explanation which she did not then care to give so she contented herself with opening her gray eyes widely at the redcheeked mrs stidgera fine specimen of southwestern efflorescenceand then dismissed the subject altogether the next day she wrote to her dearest friend in boston i think i find the intoxicated portion of this community the least objectionable i refer my dear to the men of course i do not know anything that could make the women tolerable  in less than a week miss mary had forgotten this episode except that her afternoon walks took thereafter almost  unconsciously another direction she noticed however that every morning a fresh cluster of azalea blossoms appeared among the flowers on her desk this was not strange as her little flock were aware of her fondness for flowers and invariably kept her desk bright with anemones syringas and lupines but on questioning them they one and all professed ignorance of the azaleas a few days later master johnny stidger whose desk was nearest to the window was suddenly taken with spasms of apparently gratuitous laughter that threatened the discipline of the school all that miss mary could get from him was that some one had been looking in the winder irate and indignant she sallied from her hive to do battle with the intruder as she turned the corner of the schoolhouse she came plump upon the quondam drunkard now perfectly sober and inexpressibly sheepish and guiltylooking  these facts miss mary was not slow to take a feminine  advantage of in her present humor but it was somewhat confusing to observe also that the beast despite some faint signs of past dissipation was amiablelookingin fact a kind of blond samson whose corncolored silken beard apparently had never yet known the touch of barbers razor or delilahs shears so that the cutting speech which quivered on her ready tongue died upon her lips and she contented herself with receiving his stammering apology with supercilious eyelids and the gathered skirts of uncontamination when she reentered the schoolroom her eyes fell upon the azaleas with a new sense of revelation and then she laughed and the little people all laughed and they were all unconsciously very happy  it was a hot day and not long after this that two shortlegged boys came to grief on the threshold of the school with a pail of water which they had laboriously brought from the spring and that miss mary compassionately seized the pail and started for the spring herself at the foot of the hill a shadow crossed her path and a blueshirted arm dexterously but gently relieved her of her burden miss mary was both embarrassed and angry if you carried more of that for yourself she said spitefully to the blue arm without deigning to raise her lashes to its owner youd do better in the submissive silence that followed she regretted the speech and thanked him so sweetly at the door that he stumbled which caused the children to laugh againa laugh in which miss mary joined until the color came faintly into her pale cheek the next day a barrel was mysteriously placed beside the door and as mysteriously filled with fresh springwater every morning  nor was this superior young person without other quiet attentions profane bill driver of the slumgullion stage widely known in the newspapers for his gallantry  in invariably offering the boxseat to the fair sex had  excepted miss mary from this attention on the ground that he had a habit of cussin on up grades and gave her half the coach to herself jack hamlin a gambler having once silently ridden with her in the same coach afterward threw a decanter at the head of a confederate for mentioning her name in a barroom the overdressed mother of a pupil whose paternity was doubtful had often lingered near this astute vestals temple never daring to enter its sacred precincts but content to worship the priestess from afar  with such unconscious intervals the monotonous procession of blue skies glittering sunshine brief twilights and starlit nights passed over red gulch miss mary grew fond of walking in the sedate and proper woods perhaps she believed with mrs stidger that the balsamic odors of the firs did her chest good for certainly her slight cough was less frequent and her step was firmer perhaps she had learned the unending lesson which the patient pines are never weary of repeating to heedful or listless ears and so one day she planned a picnic on buckeye hill and took the children with her away from the dusty road the straggling shanties the yellow ditches the clamor of restless engines the cheap finery of shopwindows the deeper glitter of paint and colored glass and the thin veneering which barbarism takes upon itself in such localities what infinite relief was theirs the last heap of ragged rock and clay passed the last unsightly chasm crossedhow the waiting woods opened their long files to receive them how the childrenperhaps because they had not yet grown quite away from the breast of the bounteous motherthrew themselves face downward on her brown bosom with uncouth caresses filling the air with their laughter and how miss mary herself felinely fastidious and intrenched as she was in the purity of spotless skirts collar and cuffsforgot all and ran like a crested quail at the  head of her brood until romping laughing and panting with a loosened braid of brown hair a hat hanging by a knotted ribbon from her throat she came suddenly and violently in the heart of the forest upon the luckless sandy  the explanations apologies and not overwise conversation that ensued need not be indicated here it would seem however that miss mary had already established some acquaintance with this exdrunkard enough that he was soon accepted as one of the party that the children with that quick intelligence which providence gives the helpless recognized a friend and played with his blond beard and long silken mustache and took other libertiesas the helpless are apt to do and when he had built a fire against a tree and had shown them other mysteries of woodcraft their admiration knew no bounds at the close of two such foolish idle happy hours he found himself lying at the feet of the schoolmistress gazing dreamily in her face as she sat upon the sloping hillside weaving wreaths of laurel and syringa in very much the same attitude as he had lain when first they met nor was the  similitude greatly forced the weakness of an easy sensuous nature that had found a dreamy exaltation in liquor it is to be feared was now finding an equal intoxication in love  i think that sandy was dimly conscious of this himself i know that he longed to be doing somethingslaying a grizzly scalping a savage or sacrificing himself in some way for the sake of this sallowfaced grayeyed schoolmistress as i should like to present him in an heroic attitude i stay my hand with great difficulty at this moment being only withheld from introducing such an episode by a strong conviction that it does not usually occur at such times and i trust that my fairest reader  who remembers that in a real crisis it is always some uninteresting stranger or  unromantic policeman and not adolphus who rescues will forgive the omission  so they sat there undisturbedthe woodpeckers chattering overhead and the voices of the children coming pleasantly from the hollow below what they said matters little what they thoughtwhich might have been interestingdid not transpire the woodpeckers only learned how miss mary was an orphan how she left her uncles house to come to california for the sake of health and independence how sandy was an orphan too how he came to california for excitement how he had lived a wild life and how he was trying to reform and other details which from a woodpeckers viewpoint undoubtedly must have seemed stupid and a waste of time but even in such trifles was the afternoon spent and when the children were again gathered and sandy with a delicacy which the schoolmistress well understood took leave of them quietly at the outskirts of the settlement it had seemed the shortest day of her weary life  as the long dry summer withered to its roots the school term of red gulchto use a local euphuismdried up also in another day miss mary would be free and for a season at least red gulch would know her no more she was seated alone in the schoolhouse her cheek resting on her hand her eyes half closed in one of those daydreams in which miss mary i fear to the danger of school discipline was lately in the habit of indulging her lap was full of mosses ferns and other woodland memories she was so preoccupied with these and her own thoughts that a gentle tapping at the door passed unheard or translated itself into the remembrance of faroff woodpeckers when at last it asserted itself more distinctly she started up with a flushed cheek and opened the door on the threshold stood a woman the self assertion and audacity of whose dress were in singular contrast to her timid irresolute bearing    miss mary recognized at a glance the dubious mother of her anonymous pupil perhaps she was disappointed perhaps she was only fastidious but as she coldly invited her to enter she half unconsciously settled her white cuffs and collar and gathered closer her own chaste skirts it was perhaps for this reason that the embarrassed stranger after a moments hesitation left her gorgeous parasol open and sticking in the dust beside the door and then sat down at the farther end of a long bench her voice was husky as she began  i heerd tell that you were goin down to the bay tomorrow and i couldnt let you go until i came to thank you for your kindness to my tommy tommy miss mary said was a good boy and deserved more than the poor attention she could give him  thank you miss thank ye cried the stranger brightening even through the color which red gulch knew facetiously as her war paint and striving in her embarrassment to drag the long bench nearer the schoolmistress i thank you miss for that and if i am his mother there aint a sweeter dearer better boy lives than him and if i aint much as says it thar aint a sweeter dearer angeler teacher lives than hes got  miss mary sitting primly behind her desk with a ruler over her shoulder opened her gray eyes widely at this but said nothing  it aint for you to be complimented by the like of me i know she went on hurriedly it aint for me to be comin here in broad day to do it either but i come to ask a favornot for me missnot for me but for the darling boy  encouraged by a look in the young schoolmistresss eye and putting her lilacgloved hands together the fingers downward between her knees she went on in a low voice  you see miss theres no one the boy has any claim on but me and i aint the proper person to bring him up i thought some last year of sending him away to frisco to school but when they talked of bringing a schoolmaam here i waited till i saw you and then i knew it was all right and i could keep my boy a little longer and oh miss he loves you so much and if you could hear him talk about you in his pretty way and if he could ask you what i ask you now you couldnt refuse him  it is natural she went on rapidly in a voice that trembled strangely between pride and humilityits natural that he should take to you miss for his father when i first knew him was a gentlemanand the boy must forget me sooner or laterand so i aint agoin to cry about that for i come to ask you to take my tommygod bless him for the bestest sweetest boy that livesto totake him with you  she had risen and caught the young girls hand in her own and had fallen on her knees beside her  ive money plenty and its all yours and his put him in some good school where you can go and see him and help him tototo forget his mother do with him what you like the worst you can do will be kindness to what he will learn with me only take him out of this wicked life this cruel place this home of shame and sorrow you will i know you willwont you you willyou must not you cannot say no you will make him as pure as gentle as yourself and when he has grownup you will tell him his fathers namethe name that hasnt passed my lips for yearsthe name of alexander morton whom they call here sandy miss marydo not take your hand away miss mary speak to me you will take my boy do not put your face from me i know it ought not to look on such as me miss marymy god be mercifulshe is leaving me   miss mary had risen and in the gathering twilight had felt her way to the open window she stood there leaning against the casement her eyes fixed on the last rosy tints that were fading from the western sky there was still some of its light on her pure young forehead on her white collar on her clasped white hands but all fading slowly away the suppliant had dragged herself still on her knees beside her  i know it takes time to consider i will wait here all night but i cannot go until you speak do not deny me now you willi see it in your sweet facesuch a face as i have seen in my dreams i see it in your eyes miss maryyou will take my boy  the last red beam crept higher suffused miss marys eyes with something of its glory flickered and faded and went out the sun had set on red gulch in the twilight and silence miss marys voice sounded pleasantly  i will take the boy send him to me tonight  the happy mother raised the hem of miss marys skirts to her lips she would have buried her hot face in its virgin folds but she dared not she rose to her feet  doesthis manknow of your intention asked miss mary suddenly  no nor cares he has never even seen the child to know it  go to him at oncetonightnow tell him what you have done tell him i have taken his child and tell himhe must never seeseethe child again wherever it may be he must not come wherever i may take it he must not follow there go now pleaseim weary andhave much yet to do  they walked together to the door on the threshold the woman turned  goodnight  she would have fallen at miss marys feet but at the  same moment the young girl reached out her arms caught the sinful woman to her own pure breast for one brief moment and then closed and locked the door  it was with a sudden sense of great responsibility that profane bill took the reins of the slumgullion stage the next morning for the schoolmistress was one of his passengers as he entered the highroad in obedience to a pleasant voice from the inside he suddenly reined up his horses and respectfully waited as tommy hopped out at the command of miss mary  not that bush tommythe next  tommy whipped out his new pocketknife and cutting a branch from a tall azaleabush returned with it to miss mary all right now  all right  and the stagedoor closed on the idyl of red gulch     brown of calaveras   a subdued tone of conversation and the absence of cigarsmoke and bootheels at the windows of the wingdam stagecoach made it evident that one of the inside passengers was a woman a disposition on the part of loungers at the stations to congregate before the window and some concern in regard to the appearance of coats hats and collars further indicated that she was lovely all of which mr jack hamlin on the boxseat noted with the smile of cynical philosophy not that he depreciated the sex but that he recognized therein a deceitful element the pursuit of which sometimes drew mankind away from the equally uncertain blandishments of pokerof which it may be remarked that mr hamlin was a professional exponent  so that when he placed his narrow boot on the wheel and leaped down he did not even glance at the window from which a green veil was fluttering but lounged up and down with that listless and grave indifference of his class which was perhaps the next thing to good breeding with his closely buttoned figure and selfcontained air he was a marked contrast to the other passengers with their feverish restlessness and boisterous emotion and even bill masters a graduate of harvard with his slovenly dress his overflowing vitality his intense appreciation of lawlessness and barbarism and his mouth filled with crackers and cheese i fear cut but an unromantic figure beside this lonely  calculator of chances with his pale greek face and homeric gravity  the driver called all aboard and mr hamlin  returned to the coach his foot was upon the wheel and his face raised to the level of the open window when at the same moment what appeared to him to be the finest eyes in the world suddenly met his he quietly dropped down again addressed a few words to one of the inside passengers effected an exchange of seats and as quietly took his place inside mr hamlin never allowed his philosophy to interfere with decisive and prompt action  i fear that this irruption of jack cast some restraint upon the other passengers particularly those who were making themselves most agreeable to the lady one of them leaned forward and apparently conveyed to her information regarding mr hamlins profession in a single epithet whether mr hamlin heard it or whether he recognized in the informant a distinguished jurist from whom but a few evenings before he had won several thousand dollars i cannot say his colorless face betrayed no sign his black eyes quietly observant glanced indifferently past the legal gentleman and rested on the much more pleasing features of his neighbor an indian stoicismsaid to be an inheritance from his maternal ancestorstood him in good service until the rolling wheels rattled upon the river gravel at scotts ferry and the stage drew up at the international hotel for dinner the legal gentleman and a member of congress leaped out and stood ready to assist the descending goddess while colonel starbottle of siskiyou took charge of her parasol and shawl in this multiplicity of attention there was a momentary confusion and delay jack hamlin quietly opened the opposite door of the coach took the ladys hand with that decision and positiveness which a hesitating and undecided sex know how to admire and in an instant had dexterously and gracefully swung her to the ground and again lifted her to the platform an audible chuckle on the box i fear came from that other cynic yuba bill the driver look keerfully  arter that baggage kernel said the expressman with affected concern as he looked after colonel starbottle gloomily bringing up the rear of the triumphant procession to the waitingroom  mr hamlin did not stay for dinner his horse was already saddled and awaiting him he dashed over the ford up the gravelly hill and out into the dusty perspective of the wingdam road like one leaving an unpleasant fancy behind him the inmates uf dusty cabins by the roadside shaded their eyes with their hands and looked after him recognizing the man by his horse and speculating what was up with comanche jack yet much of this interest centred in the horse in a community where the time made by french petes mare in his run from the sheriff of calaveras eclipsed all concern in the ultimate fate of that worthy  the sweating flanks of his gray at length recalled him to himself he checked his speed and turning into a byroad sometimes used as a cut off trotted leisurely along the reins hanging listlessly from his fingers as he rode on the character of the landscape changed and became more pastoral openings in groves of pine and sycamore disclosed some rude attempts at cultivationa flowering vine trailed over the porch of one cabin and a woman rocked her cradled babe under the roses of another a little farther on mr hamlin came upon some barelegged children wading in the willowy creek and so wrought upon them with a badinage peculiar to himself that they were emboldened to climb up his horses legs and over his saddle until he was fain to develop an exaggerated ferocity of demeanor and to escape leaving behind some kisses and coin and then advancing deeper into the woods where all signs of habitation failed he began to sing uplifting a tenor so singularly sweet and shaded by a pathos so subdued and tender that i wot the robins and linnets stopped to listen mr hamlins voice was not  cultivated the subject of his song was some sentimental lunacy borrowed from the negro minstrels but there thrilled through all some occult quality of tone and expression that was unspeakably touching indeed it was a wonderful sight to see this sentimental blackleg with a pack of cards in his pocket and a revolver at his back sending his voice before him through the dim woods with a plaint about his nellys grave in a way that overflowed the eyes of the listener a sparrowhawk fresh from his sixth victim possibly recognizing in mr hamlin a kindred spirit stared at him in surprise and was fain to confess the superiority of man with a superior predatory capacity he couldnt sing  but mr hamlin presently found himself again on the highroad and at his former pace ditches and banks of gravel denuded hillsides stumps and decayed trunks of trees took the place of woodland and ravine and indicated his approach to civilization then a church steeple came in sight and he knew that he had reached home in a few moments he was clattering down the single narrow street that lost itself in a chaotic ruin of races ditches and tailings at the foot of the hill and dismounted before the gilded windows of the magnolia saloon passing through the long barroom he pushed open a green baize door entered a dark passage opened another door with a passkey and found himself in a dimly lighted room whose furniture though elegant and costly for the locality showed signs of abuse the inlaid centretable was overlaid with stained disks that were not contemplated in the original design the embroidered armchairs were discolored and the green velvet lounge on which mr hamlin threw himself was soiled at the foot with the red soil of wingdam  mr hamlin did not sing in his cage he lay still looking at a highly colored painting above him representing a young creature of opulent charms it occurred to him  then for the first time that he had never seen exactly that kind of a woman and that if he should he would not probably fall in love with her perhaps he was thinking of another style of beauty but just then some one knocked at the door without rising he pulled a cord that apparently shot back a bolt for the door swung open and a man entered  the newcomer was broadshouldered and robusta vigor not borne out in the face which though handsome was singularly weak and disfigured by dissipation he appeared to be also under the influence of liquor for he started on seeing mr hamlin and said i thought kate was here stammered and seemed confused and embarrassed  mr hamlin smiled the smile which he had before worn on the wingdam coach and sat up quite refreshed and ready for business  you didnt come up on the stage continued the newcomer did you  no replied hamlin i left it at scotts ferry it isnt due for half an hour yet but hows luck brown  dd bad said brown his face suddenly assuming an expression of weak despair im cleaned out again jack he continued in a whining tone that formed a pitiable contrast to his bulky figure cant you help me with a hundred till tomorrows cleanup you see ive got to send money home to the old woman andyouve won twenty times that amount from me  the conclusion was perhaps not entirely logical but jack overlooked it and handed the sum to his visitor the oldwoman business is about played out brown he added by way of commentary why dont you say you want to buck agin faro you know you aint married  fact sir said brown with a sudden gravity as if the mere contact of the gold with the palm of the hand had  imparted some dignity to his frame ive got a wifea dd good one too if i do say itin the states its three years since ive seen her and a year since ive writ to her when things is about straight and we get down to the lead im going to send for her  and kate queried mr hamlin with his previous smile  mr brown of calaveras essayed an archness of glance to cover his confusion which his weak face and whiskeymuddled intellect but poorly carried out and said  dn it jack a man must have a little liberty you know but come what do you say to a little game give us a show to double this hundred  jack hamlin looked curiously at his fatuous friend perhaps he knew that the man was predestined to lose the money and preferred that it should flow back into his own coffers rather than any other he nodded his head and drew his chair toward the table at the same moment there came a rap upon the door  its kate said mr brown  mr hamlin shot back the bolt and the door opened but for the first time in his life he staggered to his feet utterly unnerved and abashed and for the first time in his life the hot blood crimsoned his colorless cheeks to his forehead for before him stood the lady he had lifted from the wingdam coach whom brown dropping his cards with a hysterical laugh greeted as  my old woman by thunder  they say that mrs brown burst into tears and reproaches of her husband i saw her in 1857 at marysville and disbelieve the story and the wingdam chronicle of the next week under the head of touching reunion said one of those beautiful and touching incidents peculiar to california life occurred last week in our city the wife of one of wingdams eminent pioneers tired of  the effete civilization of the east and its inhospitable climate resolved to join her noble husband upon these golden shores without informing him of her intention she undertook the long journey and arrived last week the joy of the husband may be easier imagined than described the meeting is said to have been indescribably affecting we trust her example may be followed                                       whether owing to mrs browns influence or to some more successful speculations mr browns financial fortune from that day steadily improved he bought out his partners in the nip and tuck lead with money which was said to have been won at poker a week or two after his wifes arrival but which rumor adopting mrs browns theory that brown had forsworn the gamingtable declared to have been furnished by mr jack hamlin he built and furnished the wingdam house which pretty mrs browns great popularity kept overflowing with guests he was elected to the assembly and gave largess to churches a street in wingdam was named in his honor  yet it was noted that in proportion as he waxed wealthy and fortunate he grew pale thin and anxious as his wifes popularity increased he became fretful and impatient the most uxorious of husbands he was absurdly jealous if he did not interfere with his wifes social liberty it was because it was maliciously whispered that his first and only attempt was met by an outburst from mrs brown that terrified him into silence much of this kind of gossip came from those of her own sex whom she had supplanted in the chivalrous attentions of wingdam which like most popular chivalry was devoted to an admiration of power whether of masculine force or feminine beauty it should be remembered too in her extenuation that since her arrival she had been the unconscious priestess of a mythological worship perhaps not more ennobling to her womanhood  than that which distinguished an older greek democracy i think that brown was dimly conscious of this but his only confidant was jack hamlin whose infelix reputation naturally precluded any open intimacy with the family and whose visits were infrequent  it was midsummer and a moonlit night and mrs brown very rosy largeeyed and pretty sat upon the piazza enjoying the fresh incense of the mountain breeze and it is to be feared another incense which was not so fresh nor quite as innocent beside her sat colonel starbottle and judge boompointer and a later addition to her court in the shape of a foreign tourist she was in good spirits  what do you see down the road inquired the gallant colonel who had been conscious for the last few minutes that mrs browns attention was diverted  dust said mrs brown with a sigh only sister annes flock of sheep  the colonel whose literary recollections did not extend farther back than last weeks paper took a more practical view it aint sheep he continued its a horseman judge aint that jack hamlins gray  but the judge didnt know and as mrs brown suggested the air was growing too cold for further investigations they retired to the parlor  mr brown was in the stable where he generally retired after dinner perhaps it was to show his contempt for his wifes companions perhaps like other weak natures he found pleasure in the exercise of absolute power over inferior animals he had a certain gratification in the training of a chestnut mare whom he could beat or caress as pleased him which he couldnt do with mrs brown it was here that he recognized a certain gray horse which had just come in and looking a little farther on found his rider browns greeting was cordial and hearty mr hamlins somewhat restrained but at browns urgent request he followed  him up the back stairs to a narrow corridor and thence to a small room looking out upon the stableyard it was plainly furnished with a bed a table a few chairs and a rack for guns and whips  this yers my home jack said brown with a sigh as he threw himself upon the bed and motioned his companion to a chair her rooms t other end of the hall its moren six months since weve lived together or met except at meals its mighty rough papers on the head of the house aint it he said with a forced laugh but im glad to see you jack dd glad and he reached from the bed and again shook the unresponsive hand of jack hamlin  i brought ye up here for i didnt want to talk in the stable though for the matter of that its all round town dont strike a light we can talk here in the moonshine put up your feet on that winder and sit here beside me thars whiskey in that jug  mr hamlin did not avail himself of the information brown of calaveras turned his face to the wall and continued  if i didnt love the woman jack i wouldnt mind but its loving her and seeing her day arter day goin on at this rate and no one to put down the brake thats what gits me but im glad to see ye jack dd glad  in the darkness he groped about until he had found and wrung his companions hand again he would have detained it but jack slipped it into the buttoned breast of his coat and asked listlessly how long has this been going on  ever since she came here ever since the day she walked into the magnolia i was a fool then jack im a fool now but i didnt know how much i loved her till then and she hasnt been the same woman since  but that aint all jack and its what i wanted to see you about and im glad youve come it aint that she  doesnt love me any more it aint that she fools with every chap that comes along for perhaps i staked her love and lost it as i did everything else at the magnolia and perhaps foolin is nateral to some women and thar aint no great harm done cept to the fools but jack i thinki think she loves somebody else dont move jack dont move if your pistol hurts ye take it off  its been moren six months now that shes seemed unhappy and lonesome and kinder nervous and scaredlike and sometimes ive ketched her lookin at me sort of timid and pitying and she writes to somebody and for the last week shes been gathering her own things trinkets and furbelows and jewlryand jack i think shes goin off i could stand all but that to have her steal away like a thief he put his face downward to the pillow and for a few moments there was no sound but the ticking of a clock on the mantel mr hamlin lit a cigar and moved to the open window the moon no longer shone into the room and the bed and its occupant were in shadow what shall i do jack said the voice from the darkness  the answer came promptly and clearly from the windowside spot the man and kill him on sight  but jack  hes took the risk  but will that bring her back  jack did not reply but moved from the window towards the door  dont go yet jack light the candle and sit by the table its a comfort to see ye if nothin else  jack hesitated and then complied he drew a pack of cards from his pocket and shuffled them glancing at the bed but browns face was turned to the wall when mr hamlin had shuffled the cards he cut them and dealt one card on the opposite side of the table towards the bed  and another on his side of the table for himself the first was a deuce his own card a king he then shuffled and cut again this time dummy had a queen and himself a fourspot jack brightened up for the third deal it brought his adversary a deuce and himself a king again two out of three said jack audibly  whats that jack said brown  nothing  then jack tried his hand with dice but he always threw sixes and his imaginary opponent aces the force of habit is sometimes confusing  meanwhile some magnetic influence in mr hamlins presence or the anodyne of liquor or both brought surcease of sorrow and brown slept mr hamlin moved his chair to the window and looked out on the town of wingdam now sleeping peacefully its harsh outlines softened and subdued its glaring colors mellowed and sobered in the moonlight that flowed over all in the hush he could hear the gurgling of water in the ditches and the sighing of the pines beyond the hill then he looked up at the firmament and as he did so a star shot across the twinkling field presently another and then another the phenomenon suggested to mr hamlin a fresh augury if in another fifteen minutes another star should fallhe sat there watch in hand for twice that time but the phenomenon was not repeated  the clock struck two and brown still slept mr hamlin approached the table and took from his pocket a letter which he read by the flickering candlelight it contained only a single line written in pencil in a womans hand  be at the corral with the buggy at three  the sleeper moved uneasily and then awoke are you there jack  yes  dont go yet i dreamed just now jackdreamed  of old times i thought that sue and me was being married agin and that the parson jack waswho do you thinkyou  the gambler laughed and seated himself on the bed the paper still in his hand  its a good sign aint it queried brown  i reckon say old man hadnt you better get up  the old man thus affectionately appealed to rose with the assistance of hamlins outstretched hand  smoke  brown mechanically took the proffered cigar  light  jack had twisted the letter into a spiral lit it and held it for his companion he continued to hold it until it was consumed and dropped the fragmenta fiery starfrom the open window he watched it as it fell and then returned to his friend  old man he said placing his hands upon browns shoulders in ten minutes ill be on the road and gone like that spark we wont see each other agin but before i go take a fools advice sell out all youve got take your wife with you and quit the country it aint no place for you nor her tell her she must go make her go if she wont dont whine because you cant be a saint and she aint an angel be a man and treat her like a woman dont be a dd fool goodby  he tore himself from browns grasp and leaped down the stairs like a deer at the stabledoor he collared the halfsleeping hostler and backed him against the wall saddle my horse in two minutes or illthe ellipsis was frightfully suggestive  the missis said you was to have the buggy stammered the man  dn the buggy    the horse was saddled as fast as the nervous hands of the astounded hostler could manipulate buckle and strap  is anything up mr hamlin said the man who like all his class admired the elan of his fiery patron and was really concerned in his welfare  stand aside  the man fell back with an oath a bound and clatter jack was into the road in another moment to the mans halfawakened eyes he was but a moving cloud of dust in the distance towards which a star just loosed from its brethren was trailing a stream of fire  but early that morning the dwellers by the wingdam turnpike miles aways heard a voice pure as a skylarks singing afield they who were asleep turned over on their rude couches to dream of youth and love and olden days hardfaced men and anxious goldseekers already at work ceased their labors and leaned upon their picks to listen to a romantic vagabond ambling away against the rosy sunrise                                                condensed novels                                           muckamuck  a modern indian novel  after cooper     chapter i   it was toward the close of a bright october day the last rays of the setting sun were reflected from one of those sylvan lakes peculiar to the sierras of california on the right the curling smoke of an indian village rose between the columns of the lofty pines while to the left the log cottage of judge tompkins embowered in buckeyes completed the enchanting picture  although the exterior of the cottage was humble and unpretentious and in keeping with the wildness of the landscape its interior gave evidence of the cultivation and refinement of its inmates an aquarium containing goldfishes stood on a marble centretable at one end of the apartment while a magnificent grand piano occupied the other the floor was covered with a yielding tapestry carpet and the walls were adorned with paintings from the pencils of van dyke rubens tintoretto michael angelo and the productions of the more modern turner kensett church and bierstadt although judge tompkins had chosen the frontiers of civilization as his home it was impossible for him to entirely forego the habits and tastes of his former life he was seated in a luxurious armchair writing at a mahogany escritoire while his daughter a lovely young girl of seventeen summers plied her crotchetneedle on an ottoman beside him a bright fire of pine logs flickered and flamed on the ample hearth  genevra octavia tompkins was judge tompkinss only child her mother had long since died on the plains reared in affluence no pains had been spared with the daughters education she was a graduate of one of the principal seminaries and spoke french with a perfect benicia accent peerlessly beautiful she was dressed in a white moire antique robe trimmed with tulle that simple rosebud with which most heroines exclusively decorate their hair was all she wore in her raven locks  the judge was the first to break the silence  genevra the logs which compose yonder fire seem to have been incautiously chosen the sibilation produced by the sap which exudes copiously therefrom is not conducive to composition  true father but i thought it would be preferable to the constant crepitation which is apt to attend the combustion of more seasoned ligneous fragments  the judge looked admiringly at the intellectual features of the graceful girl and half forgot the slight annoyances of the green wood in the musical accents of his daughter he was smoothing her hair tenderly when the shadow of a tall figure which suddenly darkened the doorway caused him to look up     chapter ii   it needed but a glance at the newcomer to detect at once the form and features of the haughty aboriginethe untaught and untrammeled son of the forest over one  shoulder a blanket negligently but gracefully thrown disclosed a bare and powerful breast decorated with a quantity of threecent postagestamps which he had despoiled from an overland mail stage a few weeks previous a castoff beaver of judge tompkinss adorned by a simple feather covered his erect head from beneath which his straight locks descended his right hand hung lightly by his side while his left was engaged in holding on a pair of pantaloons which the lawless grace and freedom of his lower limbs evidently could not brook  why said the indian in a low sweet tonewhy does the pale face still follow the track of the red man why does he pursue him even as okee chow the wild cat chases kaka the skunk why are the feet of sorreltop the white chief among the acorns of muckamuck the mountain forest why he repeated quietly but firmly abstracting a silver spoon from the tablewhy do you seek to drive him from the wigwams of his fathers his brothers are already gone to the happy huntinggrounds will the pale face seek him there and averting his face from the judge he hastily slipped a silver cakebasket beneath his blanket to conceal his emotion  muckamuck has spoken said genevra softly let him now listen are the acorns of the mountain sweeter than the esculent and nutritious bean of the pale face miner does my brother prize the edible qualities of the snail above that of the crisp and oleaginous bacon delicious are the grasshoppers that sport on the hillsideare they better than the dried apples of the pale faces pleasant is the gurgle of the torrent kishkish but is it better than the cluck cluck of old bourbon from the old stone bottle  ugh said the indianugh good the white rabbit is wise her words fall as the snow on tootoonolo and the rocky heart of mucka muck is hidden what says my brother the gray gopher of dutch flat  she has spoken muckamuck said the judge gazing fondly on his daughter it is well our treaty is concluded no thank youyou need not dance the dance of snowshoes or the moccasin dance the dance of green corn or the treaty dance i would be alone a strange sadness overpowers me   i go said the indian tell your great chief in washington the sachem andy that the red man is retiring before the footsteps of the adventurous pioneer inform him if you please that westward the star of empire takes its way that the chiefs of the piute nation are for reconstruction to a man and that klamath will poll a heavy republican vote in the fall  and folding his blanket more tightly around him muckamuck withdrew     chapter iii   genevra tompkins stood at the door of the logcabin looking after the retreating overland mail stage which conveyed her father to virginia city he may never return again sighed the young girl as she glanced at the frightfully rolling vehicle and wildly careering horsesat least with unbroken bones should he meet with an accident i mind me now a fearful legend familiar to my childhood can it be that the drivers on this line are privately instructed to dispatch all passengers maimed by accident to prevent tedious litigation no no but why this weight upon my heart  she seated herself at the piano and lightly passed her hand over the keys then in a clear mezzosoprano voice she sang the first verse of one of the most popular irish ballads    o arrah ma dheelish the distant dudheen    lies soft in the moonlight ma bouchal vourneen    the springing gossoons on the heather are still    and the caubeens and colleens are heard on the hill  but as the ravishing notes of her sweet voice died upon the air her hands sank listlessly to her side music could not chase away the mysterious shadow from her heart again she rose putting on a white crape bonnet and carefully drawing a pair of lemoncolored gloves over her taper fingers she seized her parasol and plunged into the depths of the pine forest     chapter iv   genevra had not proceeded many miles before a weariness seized upon her fragile limbs and she would fain seat herself upon the trunk of a prostrate pine which she  previously dusted with her handkerchief the sun was just sinking below the horizon and the scene was one of gorgeous and sylvan beauty how beautiful is nature murmured the innocent girl as reclining gracefully against the root of the tree she gathered up her skirts and tied a handkerchief around her throat but a low growl interrupted her meditation starting to her feet her eyes met a sight which froze her blood with terror  the only outlet to the forest was the narrow path barely wide enough for a single person hemmed in by trees and rocks which she had just traversed down this path in indian file came a monstrous grizzly closely followed by a california lion a wild cat and a buffalo the rear being brought up by a wild spanish bull the mouths of the three first animals were distended with frightful significance the horns of the last were lowered as ominously as genevra was preparing to faint she heard a low voice behind her  eternally doggone my skin ef this aint the puttiest chance yet at the same moment a long shining barrel dropped lightly from behind her and rested over her shoulder  genevra shuddered  dern yedont move  genevra became motionless  the crack of a rifle rang through the woods three frightful yells were heard and two sullen roars five animals bounded into the air and five lifeless bodies lay upon the plain the wellaimed bullet had done its work entering the open throat of the grizzly it had traversed his body only to enter the throat of the california lion and in like manner the catamount until it passed through into the respective foreheads of the bull and the buffalo and finally fell flattened from the rocky hillside  genevra turned quickly my preserver she shrieked and fell into the arms of natty bumpo the celebrated pike ranger of donner lake     chapter v   the moon rose cheerfully above donner lake on its placid bosom a dug out canoe glided rapidly containing natty bumpo and genevra tompkins  both were silent the same thought possessed each and perhaps there was sweet companionship even in the unbroken quiet genevra bit the handle of her parasol and blushed natty bumpo took a fresh chew of tobacco at length genevra said as if in halfspoken reverie  the soft shining of the moon and the peaceful ripple of the waves seem to say to us various things of an instructive and moral tendency  you may bet yer pile on that miss said her companion gravely its all the preachin and psalmsingin ive heern since i was a boy noble being said miss tompkins to herself glancing  at the stately pike as he bent over his paddle to conceal his emotion reared in this wild seclusion yet he has become penetrated with visible consciousness of a great first cause then collecting herself she said aloud methinks t were pleasant to glide ever thus down the stream of life hand in hand with the one being whom the soul claims as its affinity but what am i sayingand the delicate minded girl hid her face in her hands  a long silence ensued which was at length broken by her companion  ef you mean youre on the marry he said thoughtfully i aint in no wise partikler  my husband faltered the blushing girl and she fell into his arms   in ten minutes more the loving couple had landed at judge tompkinss     chapter vi   a year has passed away natty bumpo was returning from gold hill where he had been to purchase provisions on his way to donner lake rumors of an indian uprising met his ears dern their pesky skins ef they dare to touch my jenny he muttered between his clenched teeth  it was dark when he reached the borders of the lake around a glittering fire he dimly discerned dusky figures dancing they were in war paint conspicuous among them was the renowned muckamuck but why did the fingers of natty bumpo tighten convulsively around his rifle  the chief held in his hand long tufts of raven hair the heart of the pioneer sickened as he recognized the clustering curls of genevra in a moment his rifle was at his shoulder and with a sharp ping muck amuck leaped into the air a corpse to knock out the brains of the remaining  savages tear the tresses from the stiffening hand of muck amuck and dash rapidly forward to the cottage of judge tompkins was the work of a moment  he burst open the door why did he stand transfixed with open mouth and distended eyeballs was the sight too horrible to be borne on the contrary before him in her peerless beauty stood genevra tompkins leaning on her fathers arm  yer not scalped then gasped her lover  no i have no hesitation in saying that i am not but why this abruptness responded genevra  bumpo could not speak but frantically produced the silken tresses genevra turned her face aside  why thats her waterfall said the judge  bumpo sank fainting to the floor  the famous pike chieftain never recovered from the deceit and refused to marry genevra who died twenty years afterwards of a broken heart judge tompkins lost his fortune in wild cat the stage passes twice a week the deserted cottage at donner lake thus was the death of muckamuck avenged     selina sedilia  by miss m e bddn and mrs hny wd   chapter i   the sun was setting over sloperton grange and reddened the window of the lonely chamber in the western tower supposed to be haunted by sir edward sedilia the founder of the grange in the dreamy distance arose the gilded mausoleum of lady felicia sedilia who haunted that portion of sedilia manor known as stiffuns acre a little to the left of the grange might have been seen a mouldering ruin known as guys keep haunted by the spirit of sir guy sedilia who was found one morning crushed by one of the fallen battlements yet as the setting sun gilded these objects a beautiful and almost holy calm seemed diffused about the grange  the lady selina sat by an oriel window overlooking the park the sun sank gently in the bosom of the german ocean and yet the lady did not lift her beautiful head from the finely curved arm and diminutive hand which supported it when darkness finally shrouded the landscape she started for the sound of horsehoofs clattered over the stones of the avenue she had scarcely risen before an aristocratic young man fell on his knees before her  my selina  edgardo you here  yes dearest  andyouyouhaveseen nothing said the  lady in an agitated voice and nervous manner turning her face aside to conceal her emotion  nothingthat is nothing of any account said edgardo i passed the ghost of your aunt in the park noticed the spectre of your uncle in the ruined keep and observed the familiar features of the spirit of your greatgrandfather at his usual post but nothing beyond these trifles my selina nothing more love absolutely nothing  the young man turned his dark liquid orbs fondly upon the ingenuous face of his betrothed  my own edgardoand you still love me you still would marry me in spite of this dark mystery which surrounds me in spite of the fatal history of my race in spite of the ominous predictions of my aged nurse  i would selina and the young man passed his arm around her yielding waist the two lovers gazed at each others faces in unspeakable bliss suddenly selina started  leave me edgardo leave me a mysterious somethinga fatal misgivinga dark ambiguityan equivocal mistrust oppresses me i would be alone  the young man arose and cast a loving glance on the lady then we will be married on the seventeenth  the seventeenth repeated selina with a mysterious shudder  they embraced and parted as the clatter of hoofs in the courtyard died away the lady selina sank into the chair she had just quitted  the seventeenth she repeated slowly with the same fateful shudder ahwhat if he should know that i have another husband living dare i reveal to him that i have two legitimate and three natural children dare i repeat to him the history of my youth dare i confess that at the age of seven i poisoned my sister by putting verdigris in her creamtartsthat i threw my cousin from a swing at the age of twelve that the ladys maid who  incurred the displeasure of my girlhood now lies at the bottom of the horsepond no no he is too puretoo goodtoo innocentto hear such improper conversation and her whole body writhed as she rocked to and fro in a paroxysm of grief  but she was soon calm rising to her feet she opened a secret panel in the wall and revealed a slowmatch ready for lighting  this match said the lady selina is connected with a mine beneath the western tower where my three children are confined another branch of it lies under the parish church where the record of my first marriage is kept i have only to light this match and the whole of my past life is swept away she approached the match with a lighted candle  but a hand was laid upon her arm and with a shriek the lady selina fell on her knees before the spectre of sir guy     chapter ii   forbear selina said the phantom in a hollow voice  why should i forbear responded selina haughtily as she recovered her courage you know the secret of our race  i do understand mei do not object to the eccentricities of your youth i know the fearful destiny which pursuing you led you to poison your sister and drown your ladys maid i know the awful doom which i have brought upon this house but if you make away with these children  well said the lady selina hastily  they will haunt you  well i fear them not said selina drawing her superb figure to its full height  yes but my dear child what place are they to haunt the ruin is sacred to your uncles spirit your aunt monopolizes the park and i must be allowed to state not unfrequently trespasses upon the grounds of others the horsepond is frequented by the spirit of your maid and your murdered sister walks these corridors to be plain there is no room at sloperton grange for another ghost i cannot have them in my roomfor you know i dont like children think of this rash girl and forbear would you selina said the phantom mournfully would you force your greatgrandfathers spirit to take lodgings elsewhere  lady selinas hand trembled the lighted candle fell from her nerveless fingers  no she cried passionately never and fell fainting to the floor     chapter iii   edgardo galloped rapidly towards sloperton when the outline of the grange had faded away in the darkness he reined his magnificent steed beside the ruins of guys keep  it wants but a few minutes of the hour he said consulting his watch by the light of the moon he dare not break his word he will come he paused and peered anxiously into the darkness but come what may she is mine he continued as his thoughts reverted fondly to the fair lady he had quitted yet if she knew all if she knew that i am a disgraced and ruined mana felon and an outcast if she knew that at the age of fourteen i murdered my latin tutor and forged my uncles will if she knew that i had three wives already and that the fourth victim of misplaced confidence and my unfortunate peculiarity is expected to be at sloperton by tonights train with her baby but no she must not know it constance must not arrive burke the slogger must attend to that  ha here he is well  these words were addressed to a ruffian in a slouched hat who suddenly appeared from guys keep  i hes here measter said the villain with a disgracefully low accent and complete disregard of grammatical rules  it is well listen im in possession of facts that will send you to the gallows i know of the murder of bill smithers the robbery of the tollgatekeeper and the making away of the youngest daughter of sir reginald de walton a word from me and the officers of justice are on your track  burke the slogger trembled  hark ye serve my purpose and i may yet save you the 530 train from clapham will be due at sloperton at 925 it must not arrive  the villains eyes sparkled as he nodded at edgardo  enoughyou understand leave me     chapter iv   about half a mile from sloperton station the south clapham and medway line crossed a bridge over slopertonontrent as the shades of evening were closing a man in a slouched hat might have been seen carrying a saw and axe under his arm hanging about the bridge from time to time he disappeared in the shadow of its abutments but the sound of a saw and axe still betrayed his vicinity at exactly nine oclock he reappeared and crossing to the sloperton side rested his shoulder against the abutment and gave a shove the bridge swayed a moment and then fell with a splash into the water leaving a space of one hundred feet between the two banks this done burke the slogger for it was hewith a fiendish chuckle  seated himself on the divided railway track and awaited the coming of the train  a shriek from the woods announced its approach for an instant burke the slogger saw the glaring of a red lamp the ground trembled the train was going with fearful rapidity another second and it had reached the bank burke the slogger uttered a fiendish laugh but the next moment the train leaped across the chasm striking the rails exactly even and dashing out the life of burke the slogger sped away to sloperton  the first object that greeted edgardo as he rode up to the station on the arrival of the train was the body of burke the slogger hanging on the cowcatcher the second was the face of his deserted wife looking from the window of a secondclass carriage     chapter v   a nameless terror seemed to have taken possession of clarissa lady selinas maid as she rushed into the presence of her mistress  oh my lady such news  explain yourself said her mistress rising  an accident has happened on the railway and a man has been killed  whatnot edgardo almost screamed selina  no burke the slogger your ladyship  my first husband said lady selina sinking on her knees just heaven i thank thee     chapter vi   the morning of the seventeenth dawned brightly over sloperton a fine day for the wedding said the sexton to swipes the butler of sloperton grange the aged retainer shook his head sadly alas theres no trusting in signs he continued seventyfive years ago on a day like this my young mistressbut he was cut short by the appearance of a stranger  i would see sir edgardo said the newcomer impatiently  the bridegroom who with the rest of the weddingtrain was about stepping into the carriage to proceed to the parish church drew the stranger aside  is done said the stranger in a hoarse whisper  ah and you buried her  with the others  enough no more at present meet me after the ceremony and you shall have your reward  the stranger shuffled away and edgardo returned to his bride a trifling matter of business i had forgotten my dear selina let us proceed and the young man pressed the timid hand of his blushing bride as he handed her into the carriage the cavalcade rode out of the courtyard at the same moment the deep bell on guys keep tolled ominously     chapter vii   scarcely had the weddingtrain left the grange than alice sedilia youngest daughter of lady selina made her escape from the western tower owing to a lack of watchfulness on the part of clarissa the innocent child freed from restraint rambled through the lonely corridors and  finally opening a door found herself in her mothers boudoir for some time she amused herself by examining the various ornaments and elegant trifles with which it was filled then in pursuance of a childish freak she dressed herself in her mothers laces and ribbons in this occupation she chanced to touch a peg which proved to be a spring that opened a secret panel in the wall alice uttered a cry of delight as she noticed what to her childish fancy appeared to be the slowmatch of a firework taking a lucifer match in her hand she approached the fuse she hesitated a moment what would her mother and her nurse say  suddenly the ringing of the chimes of sloperton parish church met her ear alice knew that the sound signified that the marriageparty had entered the church and that she was secure from interruption with a childish smile upon her lips alice sedilia touched off the slow match     chapter viii   at exactly two oclock on the seventeenth rupert sedilia who had just returned from india was thoughtfully descending the hill toward sloperton manor if i can prove that my aunt lady selina was married before my father died i can establish my claim to sloperton grange he uttered half aloud he paused for a sudden trembling of the earth beneath his feet and a terrific explosion as of a park of artillery arrested his progress at the same moment he beheld a dense cloud of smoke envelop the churchyard of sloperton and the western tower of the grange seemed to be lifted bodily from its foundation the air seemed filled with falling fragments and two dark objects struck the earth close at his feet rupert picked them up one seemed to be a heavy volume bound in brass    a cry burst from his lips  the parish records he opened the volume hastily it contained the marriage of lady selina to burke the slogger  the second object proved to be a piece of parchment he tore it open with trembling fingers it was the missing will of sir james sedilia     chapter ix   when the bells again rang on the new parish church of sloperton it was for the marriage of sir rupert sedilia and his cousin the only remaining members of the family  five more ghosts were added to the supernatural population of sloperton grange perhaps this was the reason why sir rupert sold the property shortly afterward and that for many years a dark shadow seemed to hang over the ruins of sloperton grange     the ninetynine guardsmen  by alxdr dms   chapter i  showing the quality of the customers of the innkeeper of provins   twenty years after the gigantic innkeeper of provins stood looking at a cloud of dust on the highway  this cloud of dust betokened the approach of a traveler travelers had been rare that season on the highway between paris and provins  the heart of the innkeeper rejoiced turning to dame perigord his wife he said stroking his white apron  st denis make haste and spread the cloth add a bottle of charlevoix to the table this traveler who rides so fast by his pace must be a monseigneur  truly the traveler clad in the uniform of a musketeer as he drew up to the door of the hostelry did not seem to have spared his horse throwing his reins to the landlord he leaped lightly to the ground he was a young man of four and twenty and spoke with a slight gascon accent  i am hungry morbleu i wish to dine  the gigantic innkeeper bowed and led the way to a neat apartment where a table stood covered with tempting viands the musketeer at once set to work fowls fish and pates disappeared before him perigord sighed as he witnessed the devastations only once the stranger paused  wine perigord brought wine the stranger drank a dozen bottles finally he rose to depart turning to the expectant landlord he said  charge it  to whom your highness said perigord anxiously  to his eminence  mazarin ejaculated the innkeeper  the same bring me my horse and the musketeer remounting his favorite animal rode away  the innkeeper slowly turned back into the inn scarcely had he reached the courtyard before the clatter of hoofs again called him to the doorway a young musketeer of a light and graceful figure rode up  parbleu my dear perigord i am famishing what have you got for dinner  venison capons larks and pigeons your excellency replied the obsequious landlord bowing to the ground  enough the young musketeer dismounted and entered the inn seating himself at the table replenished by the careful perigord he speedily swept it as clean as the first comer  some wine my brave perigord said the graceful young musketeer as soon as he could find utterance  perigord brought three dozen of charlevoix the young man emptied them almost at a draught  byby perigord he said lightly waving his hand as preceding the astonished landlord he slowly withdrew  but your highnessthe bill said the astounded perigord  ah the bill charge it  to whom  the queen  what madame  the same adieu my good perigord and the graceful stranger rode away an interval of quiet succeeded    in which the innkeeper gazed woefully at his wife suddenly he was startled by a clatter of hoofs and an aristocratic figure stood in the doorway  ah said the courtier goodnaturedly what do my eyes deceive me no it is the festive and luxurious perigord perigord listen i famish i languish i would dine  the innkeeper again covered the table with viands again it was swept clean as the fields of egypt before the miraculous swarm of locusts the stranger looked up  bring me another fowl my perigord  impossible your excellency the larder is stripped clean  another flitch of bacon then  impossible your highness there is no more  well then wine  the landlord brought one hundred and fortyfour bottles the courtier drank them all  one may drink if one cannot eat said the aristocratic stranger goodhumoredly  the innkeeper shuddered  the guest rose to depart the innkeeper came slowly forward with his bill to which he had covertly added the losses which he had suffered from the previous strangers  ah the bill charge it  charge it to whom  to the king said the guest  what his majesty  certainly farewell perigord  the innkeeper groaned then he went out and took down his sign then remarked to his wife  i am a plain man and dont understand politics it seems however that the country is in a troubled state between his eminence the cardinal his majesty the king and her majesty the queen i am a ruined man  stay said dame perigord i have an idea  and that is  become yourself a musketeer     chapter ii  the combat   on leaving provins the first musketeer proceeded to nangis where he was reinforced by thirtythree followers the second musketeer arriving at nangis at the same moment placed himself at the head of thirtythree more the third guest of the landlord of provins arrived at nangis in time to assemble together thirtythree other musketeers  the first stranger led the troops of his eminence  the second led the troops of the queen  the third led the troops of the king  the fight commenced it raged terribly for seven hours the first musketeer killed thirty of the queens troops the second musketeer killed thirty of the kings troops the third musketeer killed thirty of his eminences troops  by this time it will be perceived the number of musketeers had been narrowed down to four on each side  naturally the three principal warriors approached each other  they simultaneously uttered a cry  aramis  athos  dartagnan  they fell into each others arms  and it seems that we are fighting against each other my children said the count de la fere mournfully  how singular exclaimed aramis and dartagnan  let us stop this fratricidal warfare said athos  we will they exclaimed together  but how to disband our followers queried dartagnan  aramis winked they understood each other let us cut em down  they cut em down aramis killed three dartagnan three athos three  the friends again embraced how like old times said aramis how touching exclaimed the serious and philosophic count de la fere  the galloping of hoofs caused them to withdraw from each others embraces a gigantic figure rapidly approached  the innkeeper of provins they cried drawing their swords  perigord down with him shouted dartagnan  stay said athos  the gigantic figure was beside them he uttered a cry  athos aramis dartagnan  porthos exclaimed the astonished trio  the same they all fell in each others arms  the count de la fere slowly raised his hands to heaven bless you bless us my children however different our opinion may be in regard to politics we have but one opinion in regard to  our own merits where can you find a better man than aramis  than porthos said aramis  than dartagnan said porthos  than athos said dartagnan     chapter iii  showing how the king of france went up a ladder   the king descended into the garden proceeding cautiously along the terraced walk he came to the wall immediately below the windows of madame to the left were two windows concealed by vines they opened into the apartments of la valliere  the king sighed  it is about nineteen feet to that window said the king if i had a ladder about nineteen feet long it would reach to that window this is logic  suddenly the king stumbled over something st denis he exclaimed looking down it was a ladder just nineteen feet long  the king placed it against the wall in so doing he fixed the lower end upon the abdomen of a man who lay concealed by the wall the man did not utter a cry or wince the king suspected nothing he ascended the ladder  the ladder was too short louis the grand was not a tall man he was still two feet below the window  dear me said the king  suddenly the ladder was lifted two feet from below this enabled the king to leap in the window at the farther end of the apartment stood a young girl with red hair and a lame leg she was trembling with emotion  louise  the king  ah my god mademoiselle   ah my god sire  but a low knock at the door interrupted the lovers the king uttered a cry of rage louise one of despair    the door opened and dartagnan entered  goodevening sire said the musketeer  the king touched a bell porthos appeared in the doorway  goodevening sire  arrest m dartagnan  porthos looked at dartagnan and did not move  the king almost turned purple with rage he again touched the hell athos entered count arrest porthos and dartagnan  the count de la fere glanced at porthos and dartagnan and smiled sweetly  sacre where is aramis said the king violently  here sire and aramis entered  arrest athos porthos and dartagnan  aramis bowed and folded his arms  arrest yourself  aramis did not move  the king shuddered and turned pale am i not king of france  assuredly sire but we are also severally porthos aramis dartagnan and athos  ah said the king  yes sire  what does this mean  it means your majesty said aramis stepping forward that your conduct as a married man is highly improper i am an abbe and i object to these improprieties my friends here dartagnan athos and porthos pureminded young men are also terribly shocked observe sire how they blush  athos porthos and dartagnan blushed  ah said the king thoughtfully you teach me a lesson you are devoted and noble young gentlemen but your only weakness is your excessive modesty from this    moment i make you all marshals and dukes with the exception of aramis  and me sire said aramis  you shall be an archbishop  the four friends looked up and then rushed into each others arms the king embraced louise de la valliere by way of keeping them company a pause ensued at last athos spoke  swear my children that next to yourselves you will respectthe king of france and remember that forty years after we will meet again      miss mix  by chltte brnte   chapter i   my earliest impressions are of a huge misshapen rock against which the hoarse waves beat unceasingly on this rock three pelicans are standing in a defiant attitude a dark sky lowers in the background while two seagulls and a gigantic cormorant eye with extreme disfavor the floating corpse of a drowned woman in the foreground a few bracelets coral necklaces and other articles of jewelry scattered around loosely complete this remarkable picture  it is one which in some vague unconscious way symbolizes to my fancy the character of a man i have never been able to explain exactly why i think i must have seen the picture in some illustrated volume when a baby or my mother may have dreamed it before i was born  as a child i was not handsome when i consulted the triangular bit of lookingglass which i always carried with me it showed a pale sandy and freckled face shaded by locks like the color of seaweed when the sun strikes it in deep water my eyes were said to be indistinctive they were a faint ashen gray but above them rosemy only beautya high massive domelike forehead with polished temples like door knobs of the purest porcelain  our family was a family of governesses my mother had been one and my sisters had the same occupation consequently when at the age of thirteen my eldest sister  handed me the advertisement of mr rawjester clipped from that days times i accepted it as my destiny nevertheless a mysterious presentiment of an indefinite future haunted me in my dreams that night as i lay upon my little snowwhite bed the next morning with two bandboxes tied up in silk handkerchiefs and a hair trunk i turned my back upon minerva cottage forever     chapter ii   blunderbore hall the seat of james rawjester esq was encompassed by dark pines and funereal hemlocks on all sides the wind sang weirdly in the turrets and moaned through the longdrawn avenues of the park as i approached the house i saw several mysterious figures flit before the windows and a yell of demoniac laughter answered my summons at the bell while i strove to repress my gloomy forebodings the housekeeper a timid scaredlooking old woman showed me into the library  i entered overcome with conflicting emotions i was dressed in a narrow gown of dark serge trimmed with black bugles a thick green shawl was pinned across my breast my hands were encased with black halfmittens worked with steel beads on my feet were large pattens originally the property of my deceased grandmother i carried a blue cotton umbrella as i passed before a mirror i could not help glancing at it nor could i disguise from myself the fact that i was not handsome  drawing a chair into a recess i sat down with folded hands calmly awaiting the arrival of my master once or twice a fearful yell rang through the house or the rattling of chains and curses uttered in a deep manly voice broke upon the oppressive stillness i began to feel my soul rising with the emergency of the moment   you look alarmed miss you dont hear anything my dear do you asked the housekeeper nervously  nothing whatever i remarked calmly as a terrific scream followed by the dragging of chairs and tables in the room above drowned for a moment my reply it is the silence on the contrary which has made me foolishly nervous  the housekeeper looked at me approvingly and instantly made some tea for me  i drank seven cups as i was beginning the eighth i heard a crash and the next moment a man leaped into the room through the broken window     chapter iii   the crash startled me from my selfcontrol the housekeeper bent toward me and whispered  dont be excited its mr rawjesterhe prefers to come in sometimes in this way its his playfulness ha ha ha  i perceive i said calmly its the unfettered impulse of a lofty soul breaking the tyrannizing bonds of custom and i turned toward him  he had never once looked at me he stood with his back to the fire which set off the herculean breadth of his shoulders his face was dark and expressive his under jaw squarely formed and remarkably heavy i was struck with his remarkable likeness to a gorilla  as he absently tied the poker into hard knots with his nervous fingers i watched him with some interest suddenly he turned toward me  do you think im handsome young woman  not classically beautiful i returned calmly but you have if i may so express myself an abstract manlinessa sincere and wholesome barbarity which involving as it does the naturalnessbut i stopped for he yawned at that momentan action which singularly developed the immense breadth of his lower jawand i saw he had forgotten me presently he turned to the houskeeper  leave us  the old woman withdrew with a curtsey  mr rawjester deliberately turned his back upon me and remained silent for twenty minutes i drew my shawl the more closely around my shoulders and closed my eyes  you are the governess at length he said  i am sir  a creature who teaches geography arithmetic and the use of the globeshaa wretched remnant of femininitya skimp pattern of girlhood with a premature flavor of tealeaves and morality ugh  i bowed my head silently  listen to me girl he said sternly this child you have come to teachmy wardis not legitimate she is the offspring of my mistressa common harlot ah miss mix what do you think of me now  i admire i replied calmly your sincerity a mawkish regard for delicacy might have kept this disclosure to yourself i only recognize in your frankness that perfect community of thought and sentiment which should exist between original natures  i looked up he had already forgotten my presence and was engaged in pulling off his boots and coat this done he sank down in an armchair before the fire and ran the poker wearily through his hair i could not help pitying him  the wind howled dismally without and the rain beat furiously against the windows i crept toward him and seated myself on a low stool beside his chair  presently he turned without seeing me and placed his  foot absently in my lap i affected not to notice it but he started and looked down  you here yetcarrothead ah i forgot do you speak french  oui monsier  taisezvous he said sharply with singular purity of accent i complied the wind moaned fearfully in the chimney and the light burned dimly i shuddered in spite of myself ah you tremble girl  it is a fearful night  fearful call you this fearful ha ha ha look you wretched little atom look and he dashed forward and leaping out of the window stood like a statue in the pelting storm with folded arms he did not stay long but in a few minutes returned by way of the hall chimney i saw from the way that he wiped his feet on my dress that he had again forgotten my presence  you are a governess what can you teach he asked suddenly and fiercely thrusting his face in mine  manners i replied calmly  ha teach me  you mistake yourself i said adjusting my mittens your manners require not the artificial restraint of society you are radically polite this impetuosity and ferociousness is simply the sincerity which is the basis of a proper deportment your instincts are moral your better nature i see is religious as st paul justly remarks see chap 6 8 9 and 10   he seized a heavy candlestick and threw it at me i dodged it submissively but firmly  excuse me he remarked as his under jaw slowly relaxed excuse me miss mixbut i cant stand st paul enoughyou are engaged     chapter iv   i followed the housekeeper as she led the way timidly to my room as we passed into a dark hall in the wing i noticed that it was closed by an iron gate with a grating three of the doors on the corridor were likewise grated a strange noise as of shuffling feet and the howling of infuriated animals rang through the hall bidding the housekeeper goodnight and taking the candle i entered my bedchamber  i took off my dress and putting on a yellow flannel nightgown which i could not help feeling did not agree with my complexion i composed myself to rest by reading blairs rhetoric and paleys moral philosophy i had just put out the light when i heard voices in the corridor i listened attentively i recognized mr rawjesters stern tones  have you fed no one he asked  yes sir said a gruff voice apparently belonging to a domestic  hows no two  shes a little off her feed just now but will pick up in a day or two  and no three  perfectly furious sir her tantrums are ungovernable  hush  the voices died away and i sank into a fitful slumber  i dreamed that i was wandering through a tropical forest suddenly i saw the figure of a gorilla approaching me as it neared me i recognized the features of mr rawjester he held his hand to his side as if in pain i saw that he had been wounded he recognized me and called me by name but at the same moment the vision changed to an ashantee village where around the fire a group of negroes were dancing and participating in some wild obi festival i awoke with the strain still ringing in my ears  hokeepokee wokee fum  good heavens could i be dreaming i heard the voice distinctly on the floor below and smelt something burning i arose with an indistinct presentiment of evil and hastily putting some cotton in my ears and tying a towel about my head i wrapped myself in a shawl and rushed downstairs the door of mr rawjesters room was open i entered  mr rawjester lay apparently in a deep slumber from which even the clouds of smoke that came from the burning curtains of his bed could not rouse him around the room a large and powerful negress scantily attired with her head adorned with feathers was dancing wildly accompanying herself with bone castanets it looked like some terrible fetich  i did not lose my calmness after firmly emptying the pitcher basin and slopjar on the burning bed i proceeded cautiously to the garden and returning with the garden engine i directed a small stream at mr rawjester  at my entrance the gigantic negress fled mr rawjester yawned and woke i explained to him as he rose dripping from the bed the reason of my presence he did not seem to be excited alarmed or discomposed he gazed at me curiously  so you risked your life to save mine eh you canarycolored teacher of infants  i blushed modestly and drew my shawl tightly over my yellow flannel nightgown  you love me mary janedont deny it this trembling shows it he drew me closely toward him and said with his deep voice tenderly modulatedhows her pooty tootensdid she get her ittle tootens wetbess her  i understood his allusion to my feet i glanced down and saw that in my hurry i had put on a pair of his old indiarubbers my feet were not small or pretty and the addition did not add to their beauty  let me go sir i remarked quietly this is entirely improper it sets a bad example for your child and i firmly but gently extricated myself from his grasp i approached the door he seemed for a moment buried in deep thought  you say this was a negress  yes sir  humph number one i suppose  who is number one sir  my first he remarked with a significant and sarcastic smile then relapsing into his old manner he threw his boots at my head and bade me begone i withdrew calmly     chapter v   my pupil was a bright little girl who spoke french with a perfect accent her mother had been a french balletdancer which probably accounted for it although she was only six years old it was easy to perceive that she had been several times in love she once said to me  miss mix did you ever have the grande passion did you ever feel a fluttering here and she placed her hand upon her small chest and sighed quaintly a kind of distaste for bonbons and caramels when the world seemed as tasteless and hollow as a broken cordial drop  then you have felt it nina i said quietly  oh dear yes there was buttonsthat was our page you knowi loved him dearly but papa sent him away then there was dick the groom but he laughed at me and i suffered misery and she struck a tragic  french attitude there is to be company here tomorrow she added rattling on with childish naivete and papas sweetheart blanche maraboutis to be here you know they say she is to be my mamma  what thrill was this shot through me but i rose calmly and administering a slight correction to the child left the apartment  blunderbore house for the next week was the scene of gayety and merriment that portion of the mansion closed with a grating was walled up and the midnight shrieks no longer troubled me  but i felt more keenly the degradation of my situation i was obliged to help lady blanche at her toilet and help her to look beautiful for what to captivate him ohno nobut why this sudden thrill and faintness did he really love her i had seen him pinch and swear at her but i reflected that he had thrown a candlestick at my head and my foolish heart was reassured  it was a night of festivity when a sudden message obliged mr rawjester to leave his guests for a few hours make yourselves merry idiots he added under his breath as he passed me the door closed and he was gone  a halfhour passed in the midst of the dancing a shriek was heard and out of the swaying crowd of fainting women and excited men a wild figure strode into the room one glance showed it to be a highwayman heavily armed holding a pistol in each hand  let no one pass out of this room he said in a voice of thunder the house is surrounded and you cannot escape the first one who crosses yonder threshold will be shot like a dog gentlemen ill trouble you to approach in single file and hand me your purses and watches  finding resistance useless the order was ungraciously obeyed  now ladies please to pass up your jewelry and trinkets  this order was still more ungraciously complied with as blanche handed to the bandit captain her bracelet she endeavored to conceal a diamond necklace the gift of mr rawjester in her bosom but with a demoniac grin the powerful brute tore it from its concealment and administering a hearty box on the ear of the young girl flung her aside  it was now my turn with a beating heart i made my way to the robber chieftain and sank at his feet oh sir i am nothing but a poor governess pray let me go  oho a governess give me your last months wages then give me what you have stolen from your master and he laughed fiendishly  i gazed at him quietly and said in a low voice i have stolen nothing from you mr rawjester  ah discovered hush listen girl he hissed in a fierce whisper utter a syllable to frustrate my plans and you die aid me and but he was gone  in a few moments the party with the exception of myself were gagged and locked in the cellar the next moment torches were applied to the rich hangings and the house was in flames i felt a strong hand seize me and bear me out in the open air and place me up on the hillside where i could overlook the burning mansion it was mr rawjester burn he said as he shook his fist at the flames then sinking on his knees before me he said hurriedly  mary jane i love you the obstacles to our union are or will be soon removed in yonder mansion were confined my three crazy wives one of them as you know attempted to kill me ha this is vengeance but will you be mine  i fell without a word upon his neck      mr midshipman beeezy  a naval officer  by captain mrryt r n   chapter i   my father was a northcountry surgeon he had retired a widower from her majestys navy many years before and had a small practice in his native village when i was seven years old he employed me to carry medicines to his patients being of a lively disposition i sometimes amused myself during my daily rounds by mixing the contents of the different phials although i had no reason to doubt that the general result of this practice was beneficial yet as the death of a consumptive curate followed the addition of a strong mercurial lotion to his expectorant my father concluded to withdraw me from the profession and send me to school   grubbins the schoolmaster was a tyrant and it was not long before my impetuous and selfwilled nature rebelled against his authority i soon began to form plans of revenge in this i was assisted by tom snafflea schoolfellow one day tom suggested  suppose we blow him up ive got two pounds of powder  no thats too noisy i replied  tom was silent for a minute and again spoke  you remember how you flattened out the curate pills couldnt you give grubbins somethingsomething to make him leathery sickeh a flash of inspiration crossed my mind i went to the shop of the village apothecary he knew me i had often purchased vitriol which i poured into grubbinss inkstand to corrode his pens and hum up his coattail on which he was in the habit of wiping them i boldly asked for an ounce of chloroform the young apothecary winked and handed me the bottle  it was grubbinss custom to throw his handkerchief over his head recline in his chair and take a short nap during recess watching my opportunity as he dozed i managed to slip his handkerchief from his face and substitute my own moistened with chloroform in a few minutes he was insensible tom and i then quickly shaved his head beard and eyebrows blackened his face with a mixture of vitriol and burnt cork and fled there was a row and scandal the next day my father always excused me by asserting that grubbins had got drunk but somehow found it convenient to procure me an appointment in her majestys navy at an early day     chapter ii   an official letter with the admiralty seal informed me that i was expected to join h m ship belcher captain boltrope at portsmouth without delay in a few days i presented myself to a tall stern visaged man who was slowly pacing the leeward side of the quarter deck as i touched my hat he eyed me sternly  so ho another young suckling the service is going to the devil nothing but babes in the cockpit and grannies in the board boatswains mate pass the word for mr cheek  mr cheek the steward appeared and touched his hat  introduce mr breezy to the young gentlemen stop wheres mr swizzle   at the masthead sir  wheres mr lankey  at the masthead sir   mr briggs  masthead too sir  and the rest of the young gentlemen roared the enraged officer  all masthead sir  ah said captain boltrope as he smiled grimly under the circumstances mr breezy you had better go to the masthead too     chapter iii   at the masthead i made the acquaintance of two youngsters of about my own age one of whom informed me that he had been there three hundred and thirtytwo days out of the year  in rough weather when the old cock is out of sorts you know we never come down added a young gentleman of nine years with a dirk nearly as long as himself who had been introduced to me as mr briggs by the way pills he continued how did you come to omit giving the captain a naval salute  why i touched my hat i said innocently  yes but that isnt enough you know that will do very well at other times he expects the naval salute when you first come on board greeny  i began to feel alarmed and begged him to explain  why you see after touching your hat you should have touched him lightly with your forefinger in his waistcoat so and asked hows his nibsyou see  hows his nibs i repeated  exactly he would have drawn back a little and  then you should have repeated the salute remarking hows his royal nibs asking cautiously after his wife and family and requesting to be introduced to the gunners daughter  the gunners daughter  the same you know she takes care of us young gentlemen now dont forget pillsy  when we were called down to the deck i thought it a good chance to profit by this instruction i approached captain boltrope and repeated the salute without conscientiously omitting a single detail he remained for a moment livid and speechless at length he gasped out  boatswains mate  if you please sir i asked tremulously i should like to be introduced to the gunners daughter  oh very good sir screamed captain boltrope rubbing his hands and absolutely capering about the deck with rage oh dn you of course you shall oh ho the gunners daughter oh hll this is too much boatswains mate before i well knew where i was i was seized borne to an eightpounder tied upon it and flogged     chapter iv   as we sat together in the cockpit picking the weevils out of our biscuit briggs consoled me for my late mishap adding that the naval salute as a custom seemed just then to be honored more in the breach than the observance i joined in the hilarity occasioned by the witticism and in a few moments we were all friends presently swizzle turned to me  we have just been planning how to confiscate a keg of claret which nips the purser keeps under his bunk the old nipcheese lies there drunk half the day and theres no getting at it  lets get beneath the stateroom and bore through the deck and so tap it said lankey  the proposition was received with a shout of applause a long half inch auger and bit was procured from chips the carpenters mate and swizzle after a careful examination of the timbers beneath the wardroom commenced operations the auger at last disappeared when suddenly there was a slight disturbance on the deck above swizzle withdrew the auger hurriedly from its point a few bright red drops trickled  huzza send her up again cried lankey  the auger was again applied this time a shriek was heard from the pursers cabin instantly the light was doused and the party retreated hurriedly to the cockpit a sound of snoring was heard as the sentry stuck his head into the door all right sir he replied in answer to the voice of the officer of the deck  the next morning we heard that nips was in the surgeons hands with a bad wound in the fleshy part of his leg and that the auger had not struck claret     chapter v   now pills youll have a chance to smell powder said briggs as he entered the cockpit and buckled around his waist an enormous cutlass we have just sighted a french ship  we went on deck captain boltrope grinned as we touched our hats he hated the purser come young gentlemen if youre boring for french claret yonders a good quality mind your con sir he added turning to the quartermaster who was grinning  the ship was already cleared for action the men in their eagerness had started the coffee from the tubs and  filled them with shot presently the frenchman yawed and a shot from a long thirtytwo came skipping over the water it killed the quartermaster and took off both of lankeys legs tell the purser our account is squared said the dying boy with a feeble smile  the fight raged fiercely for two hours i remember killing the french admiral as we boarded but on looking around for briggs after the smoke had cleared away i was intensely amused at witnessing the following novel sight  briggs had pinned the french captain against the mast with his cutlass and was now engaged with all the hilarity of youth in pulling the captains coattails between his legs in imitation of a dancingjack as the frenchman lifted his legs and arms at each jerk of briggss i could not help participating in the general mirth  you young devil what are you doing said a stifled voice behind me i looked up and beheld captain boltrope endeavoring to calm his stern features but the twitching around his mouth betrayed his intense enjoyment of the scene go to the mastheadup with you sir he repeated sternly to briggs  very good sir said the boy coolly preparing to mount the shrouds goodby johnny crapaud humph he added in a tone intended for my ear a pretty way to treat a hero the service is going to the devil  i thought so too     chapter vi   we were ordered to the west indies although captain boltropes manner toward me was still severe and even harsh i understood that my name had been favorably mentioned in the dispatches  reader were you ever at jamaica if so you remember the negresses the  oranges port royal tomthe yellow fever after being two weeks at the station i was taken sick of the fever in a month i was delirious during my paroxysms i had a wild distempered dream of a stern face bending anxiously over my pillow a rough hand smoothing my hair and a kind voice saying  bess his ittle heart did he have the naughty fever this face seemed again changed to the wellknown stern features of captain boltrope  when i was convalescent a packet edged in black was put in my hand it contained the news of my fathers death and a sealed letter which he had requested to be given to me on his decease i opened it tremblingly it read thus  my dear boyi regret to inform you that in all probability you are not my son your mother i am grieved to say was a highly improper person who your father may be i really cannot say but perhaps the honorable henry boltrope captain r n may be able to inform you circumstances over which i have no control have deferred this important disclosure  your stricken parent  and so captain boltrope was my father heavens was it a dream i recalled his stern manner his observant eye his illconcealed uneasiness when in my presence i longed to embrace him staggering to my feet i rushed in my scanty apparel to the deck where captain boltrope was just then engaged in receiving the governors wife and daughter the ladies shrieked the youngest a beautiful girl blushed deeply heeding them not i sank at his feet and embracing them cried  my father  chuck him overboard roared captain boltrope  stay pleaded the soft voice of clara maitland the governors daughter  shave his head hes a wretched lunatic continued captain boltrope while his voice trembled with excitement  no let me nurse and take care of him said the lovely girl blushing as she spoke mamma cant we take him home  the daughters pleading was not without effect in the meantime i had fainted when i recovered my senses i found myself in governor maitlands mansion     chapter vii   the reader will guess what followed i fell deeply in love with clara maitland to whom i confided the secret of my birth the generous girl asserted that she had detected the superiority of my manner at once we plighted our troth and resolved to wait upon events  briggs called to see me a few days afterward he said that the purser had insulted the whole cockpit and all the midshipmen had called him out but he added thoughtfully i dont see how we can arrange the duel you see there are six of us to fight him  very easily i replied let your fellows all stand in a row and take his fire that you see gives him six chances to one and he must be a bad shot if he cant hit one of you while on the other hand you see he gets a volley from you six and one of you ll be certain to fetch him  exactly and away briggs went but soon returned to say that the purser had declinedlike a dd coward he added  but the news of the sudden and serious illness of captain boltrope put off the  duel i hastened to his bedside but too latean hour previous he had given up the ghost  i resolved to return to england i made known the secret of my birth and exhibited my adopted fathers letter to lady maitland who at once suggested my marriage with her daughter before i returned to claim the property we were married and took our departure next day  i made no delay in posting at once in company with my wife and my friend briggs to my native village judge of my horror and surprise when my late adopted father came out of his shop to welcome me  then you are not dead i gasped  no my dear boy  and this letter  my fatheras i must still call himglanced on the paper and pronounced it a forgery briggs roared with laughter i turned to him and demanded an explanation  why dont you see greeny its all a jokea midshipmans joke  buti asked  dont be a fool youve got a good wifebe satisfied  i turned to clara and was satisfied although mrs maitland never forgave me the jolly old governor laughed heartily over the joke and so well used his influence that i soon became dear reader admiral breezy k c b      guy heavystone or entire  a muscular novel  by the author of sword and gun   chapter i  nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus   a dingy swashy splashy afternoon in october a schoolyard filled with a mob of riotous boys a lot of us standing outside  suddenly came a dull crashing sound from the schoolroom at the ominous interruption i shuddered involuntarily and called to smithsye  whats up smithums  guys cleaning out the fourth form he replied  at the same moment george de coverly passed me holding his nose from whence the bright norman blood streamed redly to him the plebeian smithsye laughingly  cully hows his nibs  i pushed the door of the schoolroom open there are some spectacles which a man never forgets the burning of troy probably seemed a largesized conflagration to the pious aeneas and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble anchises  in the centre of the room lightly brandishing the pistonrod of a steamengine stood guy heavystone alone  i say alone for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company  i will try and sketch him for the reader guy heavystone was then only fifteen his broad deep chest his sinewy and quivering flank his straight pastern showed him to be a thoroughbred perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock but he held his head haughtily erect his eyes were glittering but pitiless there was a sternness about the lower part of his facethe old heavystone looka sternness heightened perhaps by the snafflebit which in one of his strange freaks he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity his dress was well adapted to his squareset and herculean frame a striped knit undershirt closefitting striped tights and a few spangles set off his figure a neat glengarry cap adorned his head on it was displayed the heavystone crest a cock regardant on a dunghill or and the motto devil a better  i thought of horatius on the bridge of hector before the walls i always make it a point to think of something classical at such times  he saw me and his sternness partly relaxed something like a smile struggled through his grim lineaments it was like looking on the jungfrau after having seen mont blanca trifle only a trifle less sublime and awful resting his hand lightly on the shoulder of the headmaster who shuddered and collapsed under his touch he strode toward me  his walk was peculiar you could not call it a stride it was like the cresttossing bellerophona kind of prancing gait guy heavystone pranced toward me     chapter ii     lord lovel he stood at the garden gate   acombing his milkwhite steed  it was the winter of 186 when i next met guy heavystone he had left the university and had entered the 79th heavies i have exchanged the gown for the sword you see he said grasping my hand and fracturing the bones of my little finger as he shook it  i gazed at him with unmixed admiration he was squarer sterner and in every way smarter and more remarkable than ever i began to feel toward this man as phalaster felt towards phyrgino as somebody must have felt toward archididasculus as boswell felt toward johnson  come into my den he said and lifting me gently by the seat of my pantaloons he carried me upstairs and deposited me before i could apologize on the sofa i looked around the room it was a bachelors apartment characteristically furnished in the taste of the proprietor a few claymores and battleaxes were ranged against the wall and a culverin captured by sir ralph heavystone occupied the corner the other end of the room being taken up by a light battery foils boxinggloves saddles and fishingpoles lay around carelessly a small pile of billetsdoux lay upon a silver salver the man was not an anchorite nor yet a sir galahad  i never could tell what guy thought of women poor little beasts he would often say when the conversation turned on any of his fresh conquests then passing his hand over his marble brow the old look of stern fixedness of purpose and unflinching severity would straighten the lines of his mouth and he would mutter half to himself sdeath  come with me to heavystone grange the exmoor hounds throw off to morrow ill give you a mount he said as he amused himself by rolling up a silver candlestick between his fingers you shall have cleopatra but stay he added thoughtfully now i remember i ordered cleopatra to be shot this morning  and why i queried  she threw her rider yesterday and fell on him  and killed him  no thats the reason why i have ordered her to be shot i keep no animals that are not dangerousi should adddeadly he hissed the last sentence between his teeth and a gloomy frown descended over his calm brow  i affected to turn over the tradesmens bills that lay on the table for like all of the heavystone race guy seldom paid cash and said  you remind me of the time when leonidas  oh bother leonidas and your classical allusions come  we descended to dinner     chapter iii     he carries weight he rides a race    tis for a thousand pound  there is flora billingsgate the greatest coquette and hardest rider in the country said my companion ralph mortmain as we stood upon dingleby common before the meet  i looked up and beheld guy heavystone bending haughtily over the saddle as he addressed a beautiful brunette she was indeed a splendidly groomed and highspirited woman we were near enough to overhear the following  conversation which any hightoned reader will recognize as the common and natural expression of the higher classes  when diana takes the field the chase is not wholly confined to objects ferae nature said guy darting a significant glance at his companion flora did not shrink either from the glance or the meaning implied in the sarcasm  if i were looking for an endymion nowshe said archly as she playfully cantered over a few hounds and leaped a fivebarred gate  guy whispered a few words inaudible to the rest of the party and curveting slightly cleverly cleared two of the huntsmen in a flying leap galloped up the front steps of the mansion and dashing at full speed through the hall leaped through the drawingroom window and rejoined me languidly on the lawn  be careful of flora billingsgate he said to me in low stern tones while his pitiless eye shot a baleful fire gardezvous  gnothi seauton i replied calmly not wishing to appear to be behind him in perception or verbal felicity  guy started off in high spirits he was well carried he and the first whip a tenstone man were head and head at the last fence while the hounds were rolling over their fox a hundred yards farther in the open  but an unexpected circumstance occurred coming back his chestnut mare refused a tenfoot wall she reared and fell backward again he led her up to it lightly again she refused falling heavily from the coping guy started to his feet the old pitiless fire shone in his eyes the old stern look settled around his mouth seizing the mare by the tail and mane he threw her over the wall she landed twenty feet on the other side erect and trembling lightly leaping the same obstacle himself he remounted her she did not refuse the wall the next time     chapter iv   he holds him by his glittering eye  guy was in the north of ireland cockshooting so ralph mortmain told me and also that the match between mary brandagee and guy had been broken off by flora billingsgate i dont like those billingsgates said ralph theyre a bad stock her father smithfield de billingsgate had an unpleasant way of turning up the knave from the bottom of the pack but nous varrons let us go and see guy  the next morning we started for finmacouls crossing when i reached the shootingbox where guy was entertaining a select company of friends flora billingsgate greeted me with a saucy smile  guy was even squarer and sterner than ever his gusts of passion were more frequent and it was with difficulty that he could keep an ablebodied servant in his family his present retainers were more or less maimed from exposure to the fury of their master there was a strange cynicism a cutting sarcasm in his address piercing through his polished manner i thought of timon etc etc  one evening we were sitting over our chambertin after a hard days work and guy was listlessly turning over some letters when suddenly he uttered a cry did you ever hear the trumpeting of a wounded elephant it was like that  i looked at him with consternation he was glancing at a letter which he held at arms length and snorting as it were at it as he gazed the lower part of his face was stern but not as rigid as usual he was slowly grinding between his teeth the fragments of the glass he had just been drinking from  suddenly he seized one of his servants and forcing  the wretch upon his knees exclaimed with the roar of a tiger  dog why was this kept from me  why please sir miss flora said as how it was a reconciliation from miss brandagee and it was to be kept from you where you would not be likely to see itandand  speak dog and you  i put it among your bills sir  with a groan like distant thunder guy fell swooning to the floor  he soon recovered for the next moment a servant came rushing into the room with the information that a number of the ingenuous peasantry of the neighborhood were about to indulge that evening in the national pastime of burning a farmhouse and shooting a landlord guy smiled a fearful smile without however altering his stern and pitiless expression  let them come he said calmly i feel like entertaining company  we barricaded the doors and windows and then chose our arms from the armory guys choice was a singular one it was a landingnet with a long handle and a sharp cavalry sabre  we were not destined to remain long in ignorance of its use a howl was heard from without and a party of fifty or sixty armed men precipitated themselves against the door  suddenly the window opened with the rapidity of lightning guy heavystone cast the net over the head of the ringleader ejaculated habet and with a backstroke of his cavalry sabre severed the member from its trunk and drawing the net back again cast the gory head upon the floor saying quietly  one  again the net was cast the steel flashed the net was withdrawn and an ominous two accompanied the head as it rolled on the floor  do you remember what pliny says of the gladiator said guy calmly wiping his sabre how graphic is that passage commencing inter nos etc the sport continued until the heads of twenty desperadoes had been gathered in the rest seemed inclined to disperse guy incautiously showed himself at the door a ringing shot was heard and he staggered back pierced through the heart grasping the doorpost in the last unconscious throes of his mighty frame the whole side of the house yielded to that earthquake tremor and we had barely time to escape before the whole building fell in ruins i thought of samson the giant judge etc etc but all was over  guy heavystone had died as he had livedhard     john jenkins  or  the smoker reformed  by t s athr   chapter i   one cigar a day said judge boompointer  one cigar a day repeated john jenkins as with trepidation he dropped his halfconsumed cigar under his workbench  one cigar a day is three cents a day remarked judge boompointer gravely and do you know sir what one cigar a day or three cents a day amounts to in the course of four years  john jenkins in his boyhood had attended the village school and possessed considerable arithmetical ability taking up a shingle which lay upon his workbench and producing a piece of chalk with a feeling of conscious pride he made an exhaustive calculation  exactly fortythree dollars and eighty cents he replied wiping the perspiration from his heated brow while his face flushed with honest enthusiasm  well sir if you saved three cents a day instead of wasting it you would now be the possessor of a new suit of clothes an illustrated family bible a pew in the church a complete set of patent office reports a hymnbook and a paid subscription to arthurs home magazine which could be purchased  for exactly fortythree dollars and eighty cents and added the judge with increasing sternness if you calculate leapyear which you seem to have strangely omitted you have three cents more sirthree cents more what would that buy you sir  a cigar suggested john jenkins but coloring again deeply he hid his face  no sir said the judge with a sweet smile of benevolence stealing over his stern features properly invested it would buy you that which passeth all price dropped into the missionarybox who can tell what heathen now idly and joyously wantoning in nakedness and sin might be brought to a sense of his miserable condition and made through that three cents to feel the torments of the wicked  with these words the judge retired leaving john jenkins buried in profound thought three cents a day he muttered in forty years i might be worth four hundred and thirtyeight dollars and ten cents and then i might marry mary ah mary the young carpenter sighed and drawing a twentyfive cent daguerreotype from his vestpocket gazed long and fervidly upon the features of a young girl in book muslin and a coral necklace then with a resolute expression he carefully locked the door of his workshop and departed  alas his good resolutions were too late we trifle with the tide of fortune which too often nips us in the bud and casts the dark shadow of misfortune over the bright lexicon of youth that night the half consumed fragment of john jenkinss cigar set fire to his workshop and burned it up together with all his tools and materials there was no insurance     chapter ii  the downward path   then you still persist in marrying john jenkins queried judge boompointer as he playfully with paternal familiarity lifted the golden curls of the village belle mary jones  i do replied the fair young girl in a low voice that resembled rock candy in its saccharine firmnessi do he has promised to reform since he lost all his property by fire  the result of his pernicious habit though he illogically persists in charging it to me interrupted the judge  since then continued the young girl he has endeavored to break himself of the habit he tells me that he has substituted the stalks of the indian rattan the outer part of a leguminous plant called the smokingbean and the fragmentary and unconsumed remainder of cigars which occur at rare and uncertain intervals along the road which as he informs me though deficient in quality and strength are comparatively inexpensive and blushing at her own eloquence the young girl hid her curls on the judges arm  poor thing muttered judge boompointer dare i tell her all yet i must  i shall cling to him continued the young girl rising with her theme as the young vine clings to some hoary ruin nay nay chide me not judge boompointer i will marry john jenkins  the judge was evidently affected seating himself at the table he wrote a few lines hurriedly upon a piece of paper which he folded and placed in the fingers of the destined bride of john jenkins  mary jones said the judge with impressive earnestness take this trifle as a wedding gift from one who respects your fidelity and truthfulness at the altar let it be a reminder of me and covering his face hastily with a handkerchief the stern and ironwilled man left the room as the door closed mary unfolded the paper it was an order on the corner grocery for three yards of flannel a paper of needles four pounds of soap one pound of starch and two boxes of matches  noble and thoughtful man was all mary jones could exclaim as she hid her face in her hands and burst into a flood of tears  the bells of cloverdale are ringing merrily it is a wedding how beautiful they look is the exclamation that passes from lip to lip as mary jones leaning timidly on the arm of john jenkins enters the church but the bride is agitated and the bridegroom betrays a feverish nervousness as they stand in the vestibule john jenkins fumbles earnestly in his vestpocket can it be the ring he is anxious about no he draws a small brown substance from his pocket and biting off a piece hastily replaces the fragment and gazes furtively around surely no one saw him alas the eyes of two of that wedding party saw the fatal act judge boompointer shook his head sternly mary jones sighed and breathed a silent prayer her husband chewed     chapter iii and last   what more bread said john jenkins gruffly youre always asking for money for bread dnation do you want to ruin me by your extravagance and as he uttered these words he drew from his pocket a bottle of  whiskey a pipe  and a paper of tobacco emptying the first at a draught he threw the empty bottle at the head of his eldest boy a youth of twelve summers the missile struck the child full in the temple and stretched him a lifeless corpse mrs jenkins whom the reader will hardly recognize as the once gay and beautiful mary jones raised the dead body of her son in her arms and carefully placing the unfortunate youth beside the pump in the back yard returned with saddened step to the house at another time and in brighter days she might have wept at the occurrence she was past tears now  father your conduct is reprehensible said little harrison jenkins the youngest boy where do you expect to go when you die  ah said john jenkins fiercely this comes of giving children a liberal education this is the result of sabbathschools down viper  a tumbler thrown from the same parental fist laid out the youthful harrison cold the four other children had in the mean time gathered around the table with anxious expectancy with a chuckle the now changed and brutal john jenkins produced four pipes and filling them with tobacco handed one to each of his offspring and bade them smoke its better than bread laughed the wretch hoarsely  mary jenkins though of a patient nature felt it her duty now to speak i have borne much john jenkins she said but i prefer that the children should not smoke it is an unclean habit and soils their clothes i ask this as a special favor  john jenkins hesitatedthe pangs of remorse began to seize him  promise me this john urged mary upon her knees  i promise reluctantly answered john  and you will put the money in a savingsbank  i will repeated her husband and ill give up smoking too  tis well john jenkins said judge boompointer appearing suddenly from behind the door where he had been concealed during this interview nobly said my man cheer up i will see that the children are decently buried the husband and wife fell into each others arms and judge boompointer gazing upon the affecting spectacle burst into tears  from that day john jenkins was an altered man      fantine  after the french of victor hugo   prologue     as long as there shall exist three paradoxes a moral frenchman a   religious   atheist and a believing skeptic so long in fact as   booksellers shall waitsay twentylive yearsfor a new gospel   so long

is clearly not your fault i recognize in this insult and irreverence only the fault of your immediate progenitors let us pray for your immediate progenitors  they knelt down and prayed for their immediate progenitors  the effect was touching  the bishop looked calmly around  on reflection said he gravely i was mistaken this is clearly the fault of society let us pray for society  they knelt down and prayed for society  the effect was sublimer yet what do you think of that you i mean  everybody remembers the story of the bishop and mother nez retrousse old mother nez retrousse sold asparagus she was poor theres a great deal of meaning in that word my friend some people say poor but honest i say bah  bishop myriel bought six bunches of asparagus this good man had one charming failing he was fond of asparagus he gave her a franc and received three sous change  the sous were badcounterfeit what did this good bishop do he said i should not have taken change from a poor woman  then afterwards to his housekeeper never take change from a poor woman  then he added to himself for the sous will probably be bad     ii   when a man commits a crime society claps him in prison a prison is one of the  worst hotels imaginable  the people there are low and vulgar the butter is bad the coffee is green ah it is horrible  in prison as in a bad hotel a man soon loses not only his morals but what is much worse to a frenchman his sense of refinement and delicacy  jean valjean came from prison with confused notions of society he forgot the modern peculiarities of hospitality so he walked off with the bishops candlesticks  let us consider candlesticks were stolen that was evident society put jean valjean in prison that was evident too in prison society took away his refinement that is evident likewise  who is society  you and i are society  my friend you and i stole those candlesticks     iii   the bishop thought so too he meditated profoundly for six days on the morning of the seventh he went to the prefecture of police  he said monsieur have me arrested i have stolen candlesticks  the official was governed by the law of society and refused  what did this bishop do  he had a charming ball and chain made affixed to his leg and wore it the rest of his life this is a fact     iv   love is a mystery  a little friend of mine down in the country at auvergne said to me one day victor love is the worldit contains everything  she was only sixteen this sharpwitted little girl and a beautiful blonde she thought everything of me  fantine was one of those women who do wrong in the most virtuous and touching manner this is a peculiarity of french grisettes   you are an englishman and you dont understand learn my friend learn come to paris and improve your morals  fantine was the soul of modesty she always wore highneck dresses highneck dresses are a sign of modesty  fantine loved tholmoyes why my god what are you to do it was the fault of her parents and she hadnt any how shall you teach her you must teach the parent if you wish to educate the child how would you become virtuous  teach your grandmother     v   when tholmoyes ran away from fantinewhich was done in a charming gentlemanly mannerfantine became convinced that a rigid sense of propriety might look upon her conduct as immoral she was a creature of sensitivenessand her eyes were opened  she was virtuous still and resolved to break off the liaison at once  so she put up her wardrobe and baby in a bundle child as she was she loved them boththen left paris     vi   fantines native place had changed  m madelinean angel and inventor of jetworkhad been teaching the villagers how to make spurious jet  this is a progressive age those americanschildren of the west they make nutmegs out of wood  i myself have seen hams made of pine in the wigwams of those children of the forest  but civilization has acquired deception too society is made up of deception even the best french society  still there was one sincere episode  eh  the french revolution     vii   m madeline was if anything better than myriel  m myriel was a saint m madeline a good man  m myriel was dead m madeline was living  that made all the difference  m madeline made virtue profitable i have seen it written  be virtuous and you will be happy  where did i see this written in the modern bible no in the koran no in rousseau no diderot no where then  in a copybook     viii   m madeline was m le maire  this is how it came about  for a long time he refused the honor one day an old woman standing on the steps said  bah a good mayor is a good thing  you are a good thing  be a good mayor  this woman was a rhetorician she understood inductive ratiocination     ix   when this good m madeline who the reader will perceive must have been a former convict and a very bad man gave himself up to justice as the real jean valjean about this same time fantine was turned away from the manufactory and met with a number of losses from society society attacked her and this is what she lost  first her lover  then her child  then her place  then her hair  then her teeth  then her liberty  then her life  what do you think of society after that i tell you the present social system is a humbug     x   this is necessarily the end of fantine  there are other things that will be stated in other volumes to follow dont be alarmed there are plenty of miserable people left  au revoirmy friend      la femme  after the french of m michelet   i  women as an institution   if it were not for women few of us would at present be in existence this is the remark of a cautious and discreet writer he was also sagacious and intelligent  woman look upon her and admire her gaze upon her and love her if she wishes to embrace you permit her remember she is weak and you are strong  but dont treat her unkindly dont make love to another woman before her face even if she be your wife dont do it always be polite even should she fancy somebody better than you  if your mother my dear amadis had not fancied your father better than somebody you might have been that somebodys son consider this always be a philosopher even about women  few men understand women frenchmen perhaps better than any one else i am a frenchman     ii  the infant   she is a childa little thingan infant  she has a mother and father let us suppose for example they are married let us be moral if we cannot be  happy and freethey are marriedperhapsthey love one anotherwho knows  but she knows nothing of this she is an infanta small thinga trifle  she is not lovely at first it is cruel perhaps but she is red and positively ugly she feels this keenly and cries she weeps ah my god how she weeps her cries and lamentations now are really distressing  tears stream from her in floods she feels deeply and copiously like m alphonse de lamartine in his confessions  if you are her mother madame you will fancy worms you will examine her linen for pins and what not ah hypocrite you even you misunderstand her  yet she has charming natural impulses see how she tosses her dimpled arms she looks longingly at her mother she has a language of her own she says goo goo and ga ga she demands somethingthis infant  she is faint poor thing she famishes she wishes to be restored restore her mother  it is the first duty of a mother to restore her child     iii  the doll   she is hardly able to walk she already totters under the weight of a doll  it is a charming and elegant affair it has pink cheeks and purple black hair she prefers brunettes for she has already with the quick knowledge of a french infant perceived she is a blonde and that her doll cannot rival her mon dieu how touching happy child she spends hours in preparing its toilet she begins to show her taste  in the exquisite details of its dress she loves it madly devotedly she will prefer it to bonbons she already anticipates the wealth of love she will hereafter pour out on her lover her mother her father and finally perhaps her husband  this is the time the anxious parent will guide these first outpourings she will read her extracts from michelets lamour rousseaus heloise and the revue des deux mondes     iv  the mud pie   she was in tears today  she had stolen away from her bonne and was with some rustic infants they had noses in the air and large coarse hands and feet  they had seated themselves around a pool in the road and were fashioning fantastic shapes in the clayey soil with their hands her throat swelled and her eyes sparkled with delight as for the first time her soft palms touched the plastic mud she made a graceful and lovely pie she stuffed it with stones for almonds and plums she forgot everything it was being baked in the solar rays when madame came and took her away  she weeps it is night and she is weeping still     v  the first love   she no longer doubts her beauty she is loved  she saw him secretly he is vivacious and sprightly he is famous he has already had an affair with finfin  the fille de chambre and poor finfin is desolate he is noble she knows he is the son of madame la baronne couturiere she adores him  she affects not to notice him poor little thing hippolyte is distractedannihilatedinconsolable and charming  she admires his boots his cravat his little gloveshis exquisite pantaloonshis coat and cane  she offers to run away with him he is transported but magnanimous he is wearied perhaps she sees him the next day offering flowers to the daughter of madame la comtesse blanchisseuse  she is again in tears  she reads paul et virginie she is secretly transported when she reads how the exemplary young woman laid down her life rather than appear en deshabille to her lover she weeps again tasteful and virtuous bernardin de saintpierrethe daughters of france admire you  all this time her doll is headless in the cabinet the mud pie is broken on the road     vi  the wife   she is tired of loving and she marries  her mother thinks it on the whole the best thing as the day approaches she is found frequently in tears her mother will not permit the affianced one to see her and he makes several attempts to commit suicide  but something happens perhaps it is winter and the water is cold perhaps there are not enough people present to witness his  heroism  in this way her future husband is spared to her the ways of providence are indeed mysterious at this time  her mother will talk with her she will offer philosophy she will tell her she was married herself  but what is this new and ravishing light that breaks upon her the toilet and wedding clothes she is in a new sphere   she makes out her list in her own charming writing here it is let every mother heed it footnote the  delicate reader will appreciate the omission of certain  articles for which english synonyms are forbidden                                       she is married on the day after she meets her old lover hippolyte he is again transported     vii  her old age   a frenchwoman never grows old      the dweller of the threshold  by sir edd lttn blwr   book i  the promptings of the ideal   it was noon sir edward had stepped from his brougham and was proceeding on foot down the strand he was dressed with his usual faultless taste but in alighting from his vehicle his foot had slipped and a small round disk of conglomerated soil which instantly appeared on his high arched instep marred the harmonious glitter of his boots sir edward was fastidious casting his eyes around at a little distance he perceived the stand of a youthful bootblack thither he sauntered and carelessly placing his foot on the low stool he waited the application of the polishers art tis true said sir edward to himself yet half aloud the contact of the foul and the disgusting mars the general effect of the shiny and the beautifuland yet why am i here i repeat it calmly and deliberatelywhy am i here ha boy  the boy looked uphis dark italian eyes glanced intelligently at the philosopher and as with one hand he tossed back his glossy curls from his marble brow and with the other he spread the equally glossy day  martin over the baronets boot he answered in deep rich tones the ideal is subjective to the real the exercise of apperception gives a distinctiveness to idiocracy which is however subject to the limits of me you are an admirer of the  beautiful sir you wish your boots blacked the beautiful is attainable by means of the coin  ah said sir edward thoughtfully gazing upon the almost supernal beauty of the child before him you speak well you have read kant  the boy blushed deeply he drew a copy of kant from his blouse but in his confusion several other volumes dropped from his bosom on the ground the baronet picked them up  ah said the philosopher whats this ciceros de sonertuteat your age too martials epigrams caesars commentaries what a classical scholar  e pluribus unum nux vomica nil desperandum nihil fit said the boy enthusiastically the philosopher gazed at the child a strange presence seemed to transfuse and possess him over the brow of the boy glittered the pale nimbus of the student  ah and schillers robbers too queried the philosopher  das ist ausgespielt said the boy modestly  then you have read my translation of schillers ballads continued the baronet with some show of interest  i have and infinitely prefer them to the original said the boy with intellectual warmth you have shown how in actual life we strive for a goal we cannot reach how in the ideal the goal is attainable and there effort is victory you have given us the antithesis which is a key to the remainder and constantly balances before us the conditions of the actual and the privileges of the ideal  my very words said the baronet wonderful wonderful and he gazed fondly at the italian boy who again resumed his menial employment alas the wings of the ideal were folded the student had been absorbed in the boy  but sir edwards boots were blacked and he turned to  depart placing his hand upon the clustering tendrils that surrounded the classic nob of the infant italian he said softly like a strain of distant music  boy you have done well love the good protect the innocent provide for the indigent respect the philosopher stay can you tell me what is the true the beautiful the innocent the virtuous  they are things that commence with a capital letter said the boy promptly  enough respect everything that commences with a capital letter respect me and dropping a halfpenny in the hand of the boy he departed  the boy gazed fixedly at the coin a frightful and instantaneous change overspread his features his noble brow was corrugated with baser lines of calculation his black eye serpentlike glittered with suppressed passion dropping upon his hands and feet he crawled to the curbstone and hissed after the retreating form of the baronet the single word  bilk     book ii  in the world   eleven years ago said sir edward to himself as his brougham slowly rolled him toward the committee room just eleven years ago my natural son disappeared mysteriously i have no doubt in the world but that this little bootblack is he his mother died in italy he resembles his mother very much perhaps i ought to provide for him shall i disclose myself no no better he should taste the sweets of labor penury ennobles the mind and kindles the love of the beautiful i will act to him not like a father not like a guardian not like a friendbut like a philosopher    with these words sir edward entered the committee room his secretary approached him sir edward there are fears of a division in the house and the prime minister has sent for you  i will be there said sir edward as he placed his hand on his chest and uttered a hollow cough  no one who heard the baronet that night in his sarcastic and withering speech on the drainage and sewerage bill would have recognized the lover of the ideal and the philosopher of the beautiful no one who listened to his eloquence would have dreamed of the spartan resolution this iron man had taken in regard to the lost boyhis own beloved lionel none  a fine speech from sir edward tonight said lord billingsgate as arm and arm with the premier he entered his carriage  yes but how dreadfully he coughs  exactly dr bolus says his lungs are entirely gone he breathes entirely by an effort of will and altogether independent of pulmonary assistance  how strange and the carriage rolled away     book iii  the dweller of the threshold   adon ai appear appear  and as the seer spoke the awful presence glided out of nothingness and sat sphinxlike at the feet of the alchemist  i am come said the thing  you should say i have comeits better grammar said the boy neophyte thoughtfully accenting the substituted expression  hush rash boy said the seer sternly would you  oppose your feeble knowledge to the infinite intelligence of the unmistakable a word and you are lost forever  the boy breathed a silent prayer and handing a sealed package to the seer begged him to hand it to his father in case of his premature decease  you have sent for me hissed the presence behold me apokatharticonthe unpronounceable in me all things exist that are not already coexistent i am the unattainable the intangible the cause and the effect in me observe the brahma of mr emerson not only brahma himself but also the sacred musical composition rehearsed by the faithful hindoo i am the real gyges none others are genuine  and the veiled son of the starbeam laid himself loosely about the room and permeated space generally  unfathomable mystery said the rosicrucian in a low sweet voice brave child with the vitreous optic thou who pervadest all things and rubbest against us without abrasion of the cuticle i command thee speak  and the misty intangible indefinite presence spoke     book iv  myself   after the events related in the last chapter the reader will perceive that nothing was easier than to reconcile sir edward to his son lionel nor to resuscitate the beautiful italian girl who it appears was not dead and to cause sir edward to marry his first and boyish love whom he had deserted they were married in st georges hanover square as the bridal party stood before the altar sir edward with a sweet sad smile said in quite his old manner  the sublime and beautiful are the real the only ideal  is the ridiculous and homely let us always remember this let us through life endeavor to personify the virtues and always begin em with a capital letter let us whenever we can find an opportunity deliver our sentiments in the form of roundhand copies respect the aged eschew vulgarity admire ourselves regard the novelist      n n  being a novel in the french paragraphic style   mademoiselle i swear to you that i love you  you who read these pages you who turn your burning eyes upon these wordswords that i traceah heaven the thought maddens me  i will be calm i will imitate the reserve of the festive englishman who wears a spotted handkerchief which he calls a belchio who eats biftek and caresses a bulldog i will subdue

passion in excessive expectoration  ho howake snakes and walk chalks  the world is divided into two great divisionsparis and the provinces there is but one paris there are several provinces among which may be numbered england america russia and italy  n n was a parisian  but n n did not live in paris drop a parisian in the provinces and you drop a part of paris with him drop him in senegambia and in three days he will give you an omelette soufflee or a pate de foie gras served by the neatest of senegambian filles whom he will call mademoiselle in three weeks he will give you an opera  n n was not dropped in senegambia but in san franciscoquite as awkward  they find gold in san francisco but they dont understand gilding  n n existed three years in this place he became bald on the top of his head as all parisians do look down from your box at the opera comique mademoiselle and count the bald crowns of the fast young men in the pit ahyou tremble they show where the arrows of love have struck and glanced off  n n was almost nearsighted as all parisians finally become this is a gallant provision of nature to spare them the mortification of observing that their lady friends grow old after a certain age every woman is handsome to a parisian  one day n n was walking down washington street suddenly he stopped  he was standing before the door of a mantuamaker beside the counter at the farther extremity of the shop stood a young and elegantly formed woman her face was turned from n n he entered with a plausible excuse and seeming indifference he gracefully opened conversation with the mantuamaker as only a parisian can but he had to deal with a parisian his attempts to view the features of the fair stranger by the counter were deftly combated by the shopwoman he was obliged to retire  n n went home and lost his appetite he was haunted by the elegant basque and graceful shoulders of the fair unknown during the whole night  the next day he sauntered by the mantuamaker ah heavens a thrill ran through his frame and his fingers tingled with a delicious electricity the fair inconnue was there he raised his hat gracefully he was not certain but he thought that a slight motion of her faultless bonnet betrayed recognition he would have wildly darted into  the shop but just then the figure of the mantuamaker appeared in the doorway  did monsieur wish anything  misfortune desperation n n purchased a bottle of prussic acid a sack of charcoal and a quire of pink notepaper and returned home he wrote a letter of farewell to the closely fitting basque and opened the bottle of prussic acid  some one knocked at his door it was a chinaman with his weekly linen  these chinese are docile but not intelligent they are ingenious but not creative they are cunning in expedients but deficient in tact in love they are simply barbarous they purchase their wives openly and not constructively by attorney by offering small sums for their sweethearts they degrade the value of the sex  nevertheless n n felt he was saved he explained all to the faithful mongolian and exhibited the letter he had written he implored him to deliver it  the mongolian assented the race are not cleanly or sweetsavored but n n fell upon his neck he embraced him with one hand and closed his nostrils with the other through him he felt he clasped the close fitting basque  the next day was one of agony and suspense evening came but no mercy n n lit the charcoal but to compose his nerves he closed his door and first walked mildly up and down montgomery street when he returned he found the faithful mongolian on the steps  all lity  these chinese are not accurate in their pronunciation they avoid the r like the english nobleman  n n gasped for breath he leaned heavily against the chinaman  then you have seen her ching long  yes all lity she cum top side of house  the docile barbarian pointed up the stairs and chuckled  she hereimpossible ah heaven do i dream  yes all litytop side of house goodby john  this is the familiar parting epithet of the mongolian it is equivalent to our au revoir  n n gazed with a stupefied air on the departing servant  he placed his hand on his throbbing heart she herealone beneath this roof oh heavenswhat happiness  but how torn from her home ruthlessly dragged perhaps from her evening devotions by the hands of a relentless barbarian could she forgive him  he dashed frantically up the stairs he opened the door  she was standing beside his couch with averted face  a strange giddiness overtook him he sank upon his knees at the threshold  pardon pardon my angel can you forgive me  a terrible nausea now seemed added to the fearful giddiness his utterance grew thick and sluggish  speak speak enchantress forgiveness is all i ask my love my life  she did not answer he staggered to his feet as he rose his eyes fell on the pan of burning charcoal a terrible suspicion flashed across his mind this giddinessthis nausea the ignorance of the barbarian this silence oh merciful heavens she was dying  he crawled toward her he touched her she fell forward with a lifeless sound upon the floor he uttered a piercing shriek and threw himself beside her                                       a file of gendarmes accompanied by the chef burke found him the next morning lying lifeless upon the floor they laughed brutallythese cruel minions of the lawand disengaged his arm from the waist of the wooden  dummy which they had come to reclaim from the mantuamaker  emptying a few bucketfuls of water over his form they finally succeeded in robbing him not only of his mistress but of that death he had coveted without her  ah we live in a strange world messieurs      no title  by wlke cllns   prologue   the following advertisement appeared in the times of the 17th of june 1845  wanteda few young men for a light genteel employment address j w p 0  in the same paper of same date in another column  to letthat commodious and elegant family mansion no 27 limehouse road pultneyville will be rented low to a respectable tenant  if applied for immediately the family being about to remove to the continent  under the local intelligence in another column  missingan unknown elderly gentleman a week ago left his lodgings in the kent road since which nothing has been heard of him he left no trace of his identity except a portmanteau containing a couple of shirts marked 209 ward  to find the connection between the mysterious disappearance of the elderly gentleman and the anonymous communication the relevancy of both these incidents to the letting of a commodious family mansion and the dead secret  involved in the three occurrences is the task of the writer of this history  a slim young man with spectacles a large hat drab gaiters and a notebook sat late that night with a copy of the times before him and a pencil which he rattled nervously between his teeth in the coffeeroom of the blue dragon     chapter i  mary joness narrative   i am upper housemaid to the family that live at no 27 limehouse road pultneyville i have been requested by mr wilkey collings which i takes the liberty of here stating is a gentleman born and bred and has some consideration for the feelings of servants and is not above rewarding them for their trouble which is more than you can say for some who ask questions and gets short answers enough gracious knows to tell what i know about them i have been requested to tell my story in my own langwidge though being no schollard mind cannot conceive i think my master is a brute do not know that he has ever attempted to poison my missuswhich is too good for him and how she ever came to marry him heart only can tellbut believe him to be capable of any such hatrosity have heard him swear dreadful because of not having his shavingwater at nine oclock precisely do not know whether he ever forged a will or tried to get my missuss property although not having confidence in the man should not be surprised if he had done so believe that there was always something mysterious in his conduct remember distinctly how the family left home to go abroad was putting up my back hair last saturday morning when i heard a ring says cook thats missuss bell and mind you hurry or the master ill know why says    i humbly thanking you mem but taking advice of them as is competent to give it ill take my time found missus dressing herself and master growling as usual says missus quite cairn and easylike mary we begin to pack today what for

bootjack why charles says missus how you talk affecting surprise do go mary says she slipping a halfcrown into my hand i left the room scorning to take notice of the odious wretchs conduct  cannot say whether my master and missus were ever legally married what with the dreadful state of morals nowadays and them stories in the circulating libraries innocent girls dont know into what society they might be obliged to take situations never saw missuss marriage certificate though i have quite accidentallike looked in her desk when open and would have seen it do not know of any lovers missus might have had believe she had a liking for john thomas footman for she was always spitefullikepoor ladywhen we were togetherthough there was nothing between us as cook well knows and dare not deny and missus neednt have been jealous have never seen arsenic or prussian acid in any of the private drawersbut have seen paregoric and camphor one of my masters friends was a count moscow a russian papistwhich i detested     chapter ii  the slim young mans story   i am by profession a reporter and writer for the press i live at pultneyville i have always had a passion for the marvelous and have been distinguished for my facility in tracing out mysteries and solving enigmatical occurrences on the night of the 17th june 1845 i left my office and walked homeward the night was bright and starlight i was revolving in my mind the words of a singular item i had just read in the times i had reached the darkest portion of the road and found myself mechanically repeating an elderly gentleman a week ago left his lodgings on the kent road when suddenly i heard a step behind me  i turned quickly with an expression of horror in my face and by the light of the newly risen moon beheld an elderly gentleman with green cotton umbrella approaching me his hair which was snow white was parted over a broad open forehead the expression of his face which was slightly flushed was that of amiability verging almost upon imbecility there was a strange inquiring look about the widely opened mild blue eyea look that might have been intensified to insanity or modified to idiocy as he passed me he paused and partly turned his face with a gesture of inquiry i see him still his white locks blowing in the evening breeze his hat a little on the back of his head and his figure painted in relief against the dark blue sky  suddenly he turned his mild eye full upon me a weak smile played about his thin lips in a voice which had something of the tremulousness of age and the selfsatisfied  chuckle of imbecility in it he asked pointing to the rising moon whyhush  he had dodged behind me and appeared to be looking anxiously down the road i could feel his aged frame shaking with terror as he laid his thin hands upon my shoulders and faced me in the direction of the supposed danger  hush did you not hear them coming  i listened there was no sound but the soughing of the roadside trees in the evening wind i endeavored to reassure him with such success that in a few moments the old weak smile appeared on his benevolent face  whybut the look of interrogation was succeeded by a hopeless blankness  why i repeated with assuring accents  why he said a gleam of intelligence flickering over his face is yonder moon as she sails in the blue empyrean casting a flood of light oer hill and dale likewhy he repeated with a feeble smile is yonder moon as she sails in the blue empyreanhe hesitatedstammeredand gazed at me hopelessly with the tears dripping from his moist and widely opened eyes  i took his hand kindly in my own casting a shadow oer hill and dale i repeated quietly leading him up to the subject likecome now  ah he said pressing my hand tremulously you know it  i do why is it liketheehthe commodious mansion on the limehouse road  a blank stare only followed he shook his head sadly  like the young men wanted for a light genteel employment  he wagged his feeble old head cunningly  or mr ward i said with bold confidence like the mysterious disappearance from the kent road    the moment was full of suspense he did not seem to hear me suddenly he turned  ha  i darted forward but he had vanished in the darkness     chapter iii  no 27 limehouse road   it was a hot midsummer evening limehouse road was deserted save by dust and a few rattling butchers carts and the bell of the muffin and crumpet man a commodious mansion which stood on the right of the road as you enter pultneyville surrounded by stately poplars and a high fence surmounted by a cheval de frise of broken glass looked to the passing and footsore pedestrian like the genius of seclusion and solitude a bill announcing in the usual terms that the house was to let hung from the bell at the servants entrance  as the shades of evening closed and the long shadows of the poplars stretched across the road a man carrying a small kettle stopped and gazed first at the bill and then at the house when he had reached the corner of the fence he again stopped and looked cautiously up and down the road apparently satisfied with the result of his scrutiny he deliberately sat himself down in the dark shadow of the fence and at once busied himself in some employment so well concealed as to be invisible to the gaze of passersby at the end of an hour he retired cautiously  but not altogether unseen a slim young man with spectacles and notebook stepped from behind a tree as the retreating figure of the intruder was lost in the twilight and transferred from the fence to his notebook the freshly stenciled inscription st1860x     chapter iv  count moscows narrative   i am a foreigner observe to be a foreigner in england is to be mysterious suspicious intriguing m collins has requested

hand like a mastiff  i began in that dexterous insinuating manner of which i am truly proud i thought madame was ill ah no a change then was all that was required i sat down at the piano and sang in a few minutes madame retired i was alone with my friend  seizing his hand i began with every demonstration of courteous sympathy i do not repeat my words for my  intention was conveyed more in accent emphasis and manner than speech i hinted to him that he had another wife living i suggested that this was balanced haby his wifes lover that possibly he wished to fly hence the letting of his delightful mansion that he regularly and systematically beat his wife in the english manner and that she repeatedly deceived him i talked of hope of consolation of remedy i carelessly produced a bottle of strychnine and a small vial of stramonium from my pocket and enlarged on the efficiency of drugs his face which had gradually become convulsed suddenly became fixed with a frightful expression he started to his feet and roared you dd frenchman  i instantly changed my tactics and endeavored to embrace him he kicked me twice violently i begged permission to kiss madames hand he replied by throwing me downstairs  i am in bed with my head bound up and beefsteaks upon my eyes but still confident and buoyant i have not lost faith in macchiavelli tralala as they sing in the opera

lodging on the kent road found him highly excited with strong febrile symptoms pulse 120 increasing repeated incoherently what i judged to be the popular form of a conundrum on closer examination found acute hydrocephalus and both lobes of the brain rapidly filling with water in consultation with an eminent phrenologist it was further discovered  that all the organs were more or less obliterated except that of comparison hence the patient was enabled to only distinguish the most common points of resemblance between objects without drawing upon other faculties such as ideality or

stoutly against two prejudices faraday was plainlooking and skeptical  handsome is as handsome does sweetheart pleaded jael interceding for the orphan with arms that were still beautiful dear knows it is not his fault if he does not look likehis father she added with a great gulp jael was a woman and vindicated her womanhood by never entirely forgiving a former rival  its not that alone madam screamed raby but dm it the little rascals a scientistan atheist a radical a scoffer disbelieves in the bible maam is full of this darwinian stuff about natural selection and descent descent forsooth in my day madam gentlemen were content to trace their ancestors back to gentlemen and not to monkeys  dear heart the boy is clever urged jael  clever roared raby what does a gentleman want with cleverness     chapter iii   young little was clever at seven he had constructed a telescope at nine a flyingmachine at ten he saved a valuable life  norwood park was the adjacent estatea lordly domain dotted with red deer and black trunks but scrupulously kept with graveled roads as hard and blue as steel there little was strolling one summer morning meditating on a new top with concealed springs at a little distance before him he saw the flutter of lace and ribbons a young lady a very young ladysay of seven summerstricked out in the crying abominations of the present fashion stood beside a low bush her nurserymaid was not present possibly owing to the fact that john the footman was also absent    suddenly little came towards her excuse me but do you know what   those berries are he was pointing to the low bush filled with dark   clusters of shiningsuspiciously shiningfruit  certainly they are blueberries  pardon me you are mistaken they belong to quite another family  miss impudence drew herself up to her full height exactly three feet nine and a half inches and curling an eighth of an inch of scarlet lip said scornfully your family perhaps  faraday little smiled in the superiority of boyhood over girlhood  i allude to the classification that plant is the belladonna or deadly nightshade its alkaloid is a narcotic poison  sauciness turned pale ihavejusteatensome and began to whimper oh dear what shall i do then did it i e wrung her small fingers and cried  pardon me one moment little passed his arm around her neck and with his thumb opened widely the patricianveined lids of her sweet blue eyes thank heaven there is yet no dilation of the pupil it is not too late he cast a rapid glance around the nozzle and about three feet of garden hose lay near him  open your mouth quick  it was a pretty kissable mouth but young little meant business he put the nozzle down her pink throat as far as it would go  now dont move  he wrapped his handkerchief around a hoopstick then he inserted both in the other end of the stiff hose it fitted snugly he shoved it in and then drew it back  nature abhors a vacuum the young patrician was as amenable to this law as the child of the lowest peasant    she succumbed it was all over in a minute then she burst into a small fury  you nasty badugly boy  young little winced but smiled  stimulants he whispered to the frightened nurserymaid who approached goodevening he was gone     chapter iv   the breach between young little and mr raby was slowly widening little found objectionable features in the hall this black oak ceiling and wainscoting is not as healthful as plaster besides it absorbs the light the bedroom ceiling is too low the elizabethan architects knew nothing of ventilation the color of that oak paneling which you admire is due to an excess of carbon and the exuvia from the pores of your skin  leave the house bellowed raby before the roof falls on your sacrilegious head  as little left the house lady caroline and a handsome boy of about littles age entered lady caroline recoiled and thenblushed little glared he instinctively felt the presence of a rival     chapter v   little worked hard he studied night and day in five years he became a lecturer then a professor  he soared as high as the clouds he dipped as low as the cellars of the london poor he analyzed the london fog and found it two parts smoke one disease one unmentionable abominations he published a pamphlet which was violently attacked then he knew he had done something  but he had not forgotten caroline he was walking one day in the zoological gardens and he came upon a pretty pictureflesh and blood too  lady caroline feeding buns to the bears an exquisite thrill passed through his veins she turned her sweet face and their eyes met they recollected their first meeting seven years before but it was his turn to be shy and timid wonderful power of age and sex she met him with perfect selfpossession  well meant but indigestible i fear he alluded to the buns  a clever person like yourself can easily correct that she the slyboots was thinking of something else  in a few moments they were chatting gayly little eagerly descanted upon the different animals she listened with delicious interest an hour glided delightfully away  after this sunshine clouds  to them suddenly entered mr raby and a handsome young man the gentlemen bowed stiffly and looked viciousas they felt the lady of this quartette smiled amiablyas she did not feel  looking at your ancestors i suppose said mr raby pointing to the monkeys we will not disturb you come and he led caroline away  little was heartsick he dared not follow them but an hour later he saw something which filled his heart with bliss unspeakable  lady caroline with a divine smile on her face feeding the monkeys     chapter vi   encouraged by love little worked hard upon his new flyingmachine his labors were lightened by talking of the beloved one with her french maid therese whom he  had discreetly bribed mademoiselle therese was venal like all her class but in this instance i fear she was not bribed by british gold strange as it may seem to the british mind it was british genius british eloquence british thought that brought her to the feet of this young savan  i believe said lady caroline one day interrupting her maid in a glowing eulogium upon the skill of m leetelli believe you are in love with this professor a quick flush crossed the olive cheek of therese which lady caroline afterward remembered  the eventful day of trial came the public were gathered impatient and scornful as the pigheaded public are apt to be in the open area a long cylindrical balloon in shape like a bologna sausage swayed above the machine from which like some enormous bird caught in a net it tried to free itself a heavy rope held it fast to the ground  little was waiting for the ballast when his eye caught lady carolines among the spectators the glance was appealing in a moment he was at her side  i should like so much to get into the machine said the arch hypocrite demurely  are you engaged to marry young raby said little bluntly  as you please she said with a curtsy do i take this as a refusal  little was a gentleman he lifted her and her lapdog into the car  how nice it wont go off  no the rope is strong and the ballast is not yet in  a report like a pistol a cry from the spectators a thousand hands stretched to grasp the parted rope and the balloon darted upward  only one hand of that thousand caught the ropelittles but in the same instant the horrorstricken spectators saw him whirled from his feet and borne upward still clinging to the rope into space     chapter vii footnote the right of dramatization of this and succeeding chapters is reserved by the writer   lady caroline fainted the cold watery nose of her dog on her cheek brought her to herself she dared not look over the edge of the car she dared not look up to the bellowing monster above her bearing her to death she threw herself on the bottom of the car and embraced the only living thing spared herthe poodle then she cried then a clear voice came apparently out of the circumambient air  may i trouble you to look at the barometer  she put her head over the car little was hanging at the end of a long rope she put her head back again  in another moment he saw her perplexed blushing face over the edge blissful sight  oh please dont think of coming up stay there do  little stayed of course she could make nothing out of the barometer and said so little smiled  will you kindly send it down to me  but she had no string or cord finally she said wait a moment little waited this time her face did not appear the barometer came slowly down at the end ofa staylace  the barometer showed a frightful elevation little looked up at the valve and said nothing presently he heard a sigh then a sob then rather sharply  why dont you do something     chapter viii   little came up the rope hand over hand lady caroline crouched in the farther side of the car fido the poodle whined  poor thing said lady caroline its hungry  do you wish to save the dog said little  yes  give me your parasol  she handed little a goodsized affair of lace and silk and whalebone none of your sunshades little examined its ribs carefully  give me the dog  lady caroline hurriedly slipped a note under the dogs collar and passed over her pet  little tied the dog to the handle of the parasol and launched them both into space the next moment they were slowly but tranquilly sailing to the earth  a parasol and a parachute are distinct but not different be not alarmed he will get his dinner at some farmhouse  where are we now  that opaque spot you see is london fog those twin clouds are north and south america jerusalem and madagascar are those specks to the right  lady caroline moved nearer she was becoming interested then she recalled herself and said freezingly how are we going to descend  by opening the valve  why dont you open it then  because the valvestring is broken     chapter ix   lady caroline fainted when she revived it was dark they were apparently cleaving their way through a solid block of black marble she moaned and shuddered  i wish we had a light  i have no lucifers said little i observe however that you wear a necklace of amber amber under certain conditions becomes highly electrical permit me  he took the amber necklace and rubbed it briskly then he asked her to present her knuckle to the gem abright spark was the  result this was repeated for some hours the light was not brilliant but it was enough for the purposes of propriety and satisfied the delicately minded girl  suddenly there was a tearing hissing noise and a smell of gas little looked up and turned pale the balloon at what i shall call the pointed end of the bologna sausage was evidently bursting from increased pressure the gas was escaping and already they were beginning to descend little was resigned but firm  if the silk gives way then we are lost unfortunately i have no rope nor material for binding it  the womans instinct had arrived at the same conclusion sooner than the mans reason but she was hesitating over a detail  will you go down the rope for a moment she said with a sweet smile  little went down presently she called to him she held something in her handa wonderful invention of the seventeenth century improved and perfected in this a pyramid of sixteen circular hoops of light yet strong steel attached to each other by cloth bands  with a cry of joy little seized them climbed to the  balloon and fitted the elastic hoops over its conical end then he returned to the car  we are saved lady caroline blushing gathered her slim but antique drapery against the other end of the car     chapter x   they were slowly descending presently lady caroline distinguished the outlines of raby hall  i think i will get out here she said  little anchored the balloon and prepared to follow her  not so my friend she said with an arch smile we must not be seen together people might talk farewell  little sprang again into the balloon and sped away to america he came down in california oddly enough in front of hardins door at dutch flat hardin was just examining a specimen of ore  you are a scientist can you tell me if that is worth anything he said handing it to little  little held it to the light it contains ninety per cent of silver  hardin embraced him can i do anything for you and why are you here  little told his story hardin asked to see the rope then he examined it carefully  ah this was cut not broken  with a knife asked little  no observe both sides are equally indented it was done with a scissors  just heaven gasped little therese     chapter xi   little returned to london passing through london one day he met a dogfancier  buy a nice poodle sir  something in the animal attracted his attention  fido he gasped  the dog yelped  little bought him on taking off his collar a piece of paper rustled to the floor he knew the handwriting and kissed it it ran  to the honorable augustus rabyi cannot marry you if i marry any one sly puss it will be the man who has twice saved my life professor little    caroline coventry  and she did      lothaw  or  the adventures of a young gentleman in search of a religion  by mr benjamins   chapter i   i remember him a little boy said the duchess his mother was a dear friend of mine you know she was one of my bridesmaids  and you have never seen him since mamma asked the oldest married daughter who did not look a day older than her mother  never he was an orphan shortly after i have often reproached myself but it is so difficult to see boys  this simple yet firstclass conversation existed in the morningroom of plusham where the mistress of the palatial mansion sat involved in the sacred privacy of a circle of her married daughters one dexterously applied golden knittingneedles to the fabrication of a purse of floss silk of the rarest texture which none who knew the almost fabulous wealth of the duke would believe was ever destined to hold in its silken meshes a less sum than 1000000 pounds another adorned a slipper exclusively with seed pearls a third emblazoned a page with rare pigments and the finest quality of gold leaf beautiful forms leaned over frames glowing with embroidery and beautiful frames leaned over forms inlaid with motherofpearl others more remote occasionally burst into melody as they tried the passages of  a new and exclusive air given to them in ms by some titled and devoted friend for the private use of the aristocracy alone and absolutely prohibited for publication  the duchess herself the superlative of beauty wealth and position was married to the highest noble in the three kingdoms those who talked about such matters said that their progeny were exactly like their parentsa peculiarity of the aristocratic and wealthy they all looked like brothers and sisters except their parents who such was their purity of blood the perfection of their manners and the opulence of their condition might have been taken for their own childrens elder son and daughter the daughters with one exception were all married to the highest nobles in the land that exception was the lady coriander who there being no vacancy above a marquis and a rental of 1000000 pounds waited gathered around the refined and sacred circle of their breakfasttable with their glittering coronets which in filial respect to their fathers tory instincts and their mothers ritualistic tastes they always wore on their regal brows the effect was dazzling as it was refined it was this peculiarity and their strong family resemblance which led their brotherinlaw the goodhumored st addlegourd to say that pon my soul you know the whole precious mob looked like a ghastly pack of court cards you know st addlegourd was a radical having a rentroll of 15000000 pounds and belonging to one of the oldest families in britain he could afford to be  mamma ive just dropped a pearl said the lady coriander bending over the persian hearthrug  from your lips sweet friend said lothaw who came of age and entered the room at the same moment  no from my work it was a very valuable pearl mamma papa gave isaacs sons 50000 pounds for the two  ah indeed said the duchess languidly rising let us go to luncheon  but your grace interposed lothaw who was still quite young and had dropped on all fours on the carpet in search of the missing gem consider the value  dear friend interposed the duchess with infinite tact gently lifting him by the tails of his dress coat i am waiting for your arm     chapter ii   lothaw was immensely rich the possessor of seventeen castles fifteen villas nine shootingboxes and seven town houses he had other estates of which he had not even heard  everybody at plusham played croquet and none badly next to their purity of blood and great wealth the family were famous for this accomplishment yet lothaw soon tired of the game and after seriously damaging his aristocratically large foot in an attempt to tight croquet the lady aniseeds ball he limped away to join the duchess  im going to the hennery she said   let me go with you i dearly love fowlsbroiled he added thoughtfully  the duke gave lady montairy some large cochins the other day continued the duchess changing the subject with delicate tact    lady montairy   quite contrairy how do your cochins grow  sang lothaw gayly  the duchess looked shocked after a prolonged silence lothaw abruptly and gravely said  if you please maam when i come into my property i should like to build some improved dwellings for the poor and marry lady coriander  you amaze me dear friend and yet both your aspirations are noble and eminently proper said the duchess  coriander is but a childand yet she added looking graciously upon her companion for the matter of that so  are you     chapter iii   mr putney giless was lothaws first grand dinnerparty yet by carefully watching the others he managed to acquit himself creditably and avoided drinking out of the fingerbowl by first secretly testing its contents with a spoon the conversation was peculiar and singularly interesting  then you think that monogamy is simply a question of the thermometer said mrs putney giles to her companion  i certainly think that polygamy should be limited by isothermal lines replied lothaw  i should say it was a matter of latitude observed a loud talkative man opposite he was an oxford professor with a taste for satire and had made himself very obnoxious to the company during dinner by speaking disparagingly of a former wellknown chancellor of the exchequera great statesman and brilliant novelistwhom he feared and hated  suddenly there was a sensation in the room among the females it absolutely amounted to a nervous thrill his eminence the cardinal was announced he entered with great suavity of manner and after shaking hands with everybody asking after their relatives and chucking the more delicate females under the chin with a highbred grace peculiar to his profession he sat down saying and how do we all find ourselves this evening my dears in several different languages which he spoke fluently  lothaws heart was touched his deeply religious convictions were impressed he instantly went up to this gifted being confessed and received absolution tomorrow he said to  himself i will partake of the communion and endow the church with my vast estates for the present ill let the improved cottages go     chapter iv   as lothaw turned to leave the cardinal he was struck by a beautiful face it was that of a matron slim but shapely as an ionic column her face was grecian with corinthian temples hellenic eyes that looked from jutting eyebrows like dormerwindows in an attic forehead completed her perfect athenian outline she wore a black frockcoat tightly buttoned over her bloomer trousers and a standing collar  your lordship is struck by that face said a social parasite  i am who is she  her name is mary ann she is married to an american and has lately invented a new religion  ah said lothaw eagerly with difficulty restraining himself from rushing toward her  yes shall i introduce you  lothaw thought of lady corianders high church proclivities of the cardinal and hesitated no i thank you not now     chapter v   lothaw was maturing he had attended two womens rights conventions three fenian meetings had dined at whites and had danced visavis to a prince of the blood and eaten off gold plates at crecy house  his stables were near oxford and occupied more ground than the university he was driving over there one day when he perceived some rustics and menials endeavoring  to stop a pair of runaway horses attached to a carriage in which a lady and gentleman were seated calmly awaiting the termination of the accident with highbred courtesy lothaw forbore to interfere until the carriage was overturned the occupants thrown out and the runaways secured by the servants when he advanced and offered the lady the exclusive use of his oxford stables  turning upon him a face whose perfect hellenic details he remembered she slowly dragged a gentleman from under the wheels into the light and presented him with ladylike dignity as her husband majorgeneral camperdown an american  ah said lothaw carelessly i believe i have some land there if i mistake  not my agent mr putney giles lately purchased the state ofillinoisi think you call it  exactly as a former resident of the city of chicago let me introduce myself as your tenant  lothaw bowed graciously to the gentleman who except that he seemed better dressed than most englishmen showed no other signs of inferiority and plebeian extraction  we have met before said lothaw to the lady as she leaned on his arm while they visited his stables the university and other places of interest in oxford pray tell me what is this new religion of yours  it is woman suffrage free love mutual affinity and communism embrace it and me  lothaw did not know exactly what to do she however soothed and sustained his agitated frame and sealed with an embrace his speechless form the general approached and coughed slightly with gentlemanly tact  my husband will be too happy to talk with you further on this subject she said with quiet dignity as she regained the generals side come with us to oneida brook farm is a thing of the past     chapter vi   as lothaw drove toward his countryseat the mural inclosure he observed a crowd apparently of the workingclass gathered around a singularlooking man in the picturesque garb of an ethiopian serenader what does he say inquired lothaw of his driver  the man touched his hat respectfully and said my mary ann  my mary ann lothaws heart beat rapidly who was this mysterious foreigner he had heard from lady coriander of a certain popish plot but could he connect mr camperdown with it  the spectacle of two hundred men at arms who advanced to meet him at the gates of the mural inclosure drove all else from the still youthful and impressible mind of lothaw immediately behind them on the steps of the baronial halls were ranged his retainers led by the chief cook and bottlewasher and head crumbremover on either side were two companies of laundrymaids preceded by the chief crimper and fluter supporting a long ancestral line on which depended the family linen and under which the youthful lord of the manor passed into the halls of his fathers twentyfour scullions carried the massive gold and silver plate of the family on their shoulders and deposited it at the feet of their master the spoons were then solemnly counted by the steward and the perfect ceremony ended  lothaw sighed he sought out the gorgeously gilded taj or sacred mausoleum erected to his grandfather in the secondstory front room and wept over the man he did not know  he wandered alone in his magnificent park and then throwing himself on a grassy bank pondered on the great first cause and the necessity of religion i will send mary ann a handsome present said lothaw thoughtfully     chapter vii   each of these pearls my lord is worth fifty thousand guineas said mr amethyst the fashionable jeweler as he lightly lifted a large shovelful from a convenient bin behind his counter  indeed said lothaw carelessly i should prefer to see some expensive ones  some number sixes i suppose said mr amethyst taking a couple from the apex of a small pyramid that lay piled on the shelf these are about the size of the duchess of billingsgates but they are in finer condition the fact is her grace permits her two children the marquis of smithfield and the duke of st gilestwo sweet pretty boys my lordto use them as marbles in their games pearls require some attention and i go down there regularly twice a week to clean them perhaps your lordship would like some ropes of pearls  about half a cables length said lothaw shortly and send them to my lodgings  mr amethyst became thoughtful i am afraid i have not the exact numberthat isexcuse me one moment i will run over to the tower and borrow a few from the crown jewels and before lothaw could prevent him he seized his hat and left lothaw alone  his position certainly was embarrassing he could not move without stepping on costly gems which had rolled from the counter the rarest diamonds lay scattered on the shelves untold fortunes in priceless emeralds lay within his grasp although such was the aristocratic purity of his blood and the strength of his religious convictions that he  probably would not have pocketed a single diamond still he could not help thinking that he might be accused of taking some you can search me if you like he said when mr amethyst returned but i assure you upon the honor of a gentleman that i have taken nothing  enough my lord said mr amethyst with a low bow we never search the aristocracy     chapter viii   as lothaw left mr amethysts he ran against general camperdown how is mary ann he asked hurriedly  i regret to state that she is dying said the general with a grave voice as he removed his cigar from his lips and lifted his hat to lothaw  dying said lothaw incredulously  alas too true replied the general the engagements of a long lecturing season exposure in traveling by railway during the winter and the imperfect nourishment afforded by the refreshments along the road have told on her delicate frame but she wants to see you before she dies here is the key of my lodging i will finish my cigar out here  lothaw hardly recognized those wasted hellenic outlines as he entered the dimly lighted room of the dying woman she was already a classic ruinas wrecked and yet as perfect as the parthenon he grasped her hand silently  openair speaking twice a week and saleratus bread in the rural districts have brought me to this she said feebly  but it is well the cause progresses the tyrant man succumbs  lothaw could only press her hand  promise me one thing dontwhatever you dobecome a catholic  why  the church does not recognize divorce and now embrace me i would prefer at this supreme moment to introduce myself to the next world through the medium of the best society in this goodby when i am dead be good enough to inform my husband of the fact     chapter ix   lothaw spent the next six months on an aryan island in an aryan climate and with an aryan race  this is an aryan landscape said his host and that is a mary ann statue it was in fact a fulllength figure in marble of mrs general camperdown  if you please i should like to become a pagan said lothaw one day after listening to an impassioned discourse on greek art from the lips of his host  but that night on consulting a wellknown spiritual medium lothaw received a message from the late mrs general camperdown advising him to return to england two days later he presented himself at plusham  the young ladies are in the garden said the duchess dont you want to go and pick a rose she added with a gracious smile and the nearest approach to a wink that was consistent with her patrician bearing and aquiline nose  lothaw went and presently returned with the blushing coriander upon his arm  bless you my children said the duchess then turning to lothaw she said you have simply fulfilled and accepted your inevitable destiny it was morally impossible for you to marry out of this family for the present the church of england is safe      the haunted man  by chrs dckns  a christmas story   part i  the first phantom   dont tell me that it wasnt a knocker i had seen it often enough and i ought to know so ought the threeoclock beer in dirty high lows swinging himself over the railing or executing a demoniacal jig upon the doorstep so ought the butcher although butchers as a general thing are scornful of such trifles so ought the postman to whom knockers of the most extravagant description were merely human weaknesses that were to be pitied and used and so ought for the matter of that etc etc etc  but then it was such a knocker a wild extravagant and utterly incomprehensible knocker a knocker so mysterious and suspicious that policeman x 37 first coming upon it felt inclined to take it instantly in custody but compromised with his professional instincts by sharply and sternly noting it with an eye that admitted of no nonsense but confidently expected to detect its secret yet an ugly knocker a knocker with a hard human face that was a type of the harder human face within a human face that held between its teeth a brazen rod so hereafter in the mysterious future should be held etc etc  but if the knocker had a fierce human aspect in the glare of day you should have seen it at night when it  peered out of the gathering shadows and suggested an ambushed figure when the light of the street lamps fell upon it and wrought a play of sinister expression in its hard outlines when it seemed to wink meaningly at a shrouded figure who as the night fell darkly crept up the steps and passed into the mysterious house when the swinging door disclosed a black passage into which the figure seemed to lose itself and become a part of the mysterious gloom when the night grew boisterous and the fierce wind made furious charges at the knocker as if to wrench it off and carry it away in triumph such a night as this  it was a wild and pitiless wind a wind that had commenced life as a gentle country zephyr but wandering through manufacturing towns had become demoralized and reaching the city had plunged into extravagant dissipation and wild excesses a roistering wind that indulged in bacchanalian shouts on the street corners that knocked off the hats from the heads of helpless passengers and then fulfilled its duties by speeding away like all young prodigalsto sea  he sat alone in a gloomy library listening to the wind that roared in the chimney around him novels and storybooks were strewn thickly in his lap he held one with its pages freshly cut and turned the leaves wearily until his eyes rested upon a portrait in its frontispiece and as the wind howled the more fiercely and the darkness without fell blacker a strange and fateful likeness to that portrait appeared above his chair and leaned upon his shoulder the haunted man gazed at the portrait and sighed the figure gazed at the portrait and sighed too  here again said the haunted man  here again it repeated in a low voice  another novel  another novel  the old story  the old story  i see a child said the haunted man gazing from the pages of the book into the firea most unnatural child a model infant it is prematurely old and philosophic it dies in poverty to slow music it dies surrounded by luxury to slow music it dies with an accompaniment of golden water and rattling carts to slow music previous to its decease it makes a will it repeats the lords prayer it kisses the boofer lady that child  is mine said the phantom  i see a good woman undersized i see several charming women but they are all undersized they are more or less imbecile and idiotic but always fascinating and undersized they wear coquettish caps and aprons i observe that feminine virtue is invariably below the medium height and that it is always simple and infantine these women  are mine  i see a haughty proud and wicked lady she is tall and queenly i remark that all proud and wicked women are tall and queenly that woman  is mine said the phantom wringing his hands  i see several things continually impending i observe that whenever an accident a murder or death is about to happen there is something in the furniture in the locality in the atmosphere that foreshadows and suggests it years in advance i cannot say that in real life i have noticed itthe perception of this surprising fact belongs  to me said the phantom the haunted man continued in a despairing tone  i see the influence of this in the magazines and daily papers i see weak imitators rise up and enfeeble the world with senseless formula i am getting tired of it it wont do charles it wont do and the haunted man buried  his head in his hands and groaned the figure looked down upon him sternly the portrait in the frontispiece frowned as he gazed  wretched man said the phantom and how have these things affected you  once i laughed and cried but then i was younger now i would forget them if i could  have then your wish and take this with you man whom i renounce from this day henceforth you shall live with those whom i displace without forgetting me twill be your lot to walk through life as if we had not met but first you shall survey these scenes that henceforth must be yours at one tonight prepare to meet the phantom i have raised farewell  the sound of its voice seemed to fade away with the dying wind and the haunted man was alone but the firelight flickered gayly and the light danced on the walls making grotesque figures of the furniture  ha ha said the haunted man rubbing his hands gleefully now for a whiskey punch and a cigar     part ii  the second phantom   one the stroke of the faroff bell had hardly died before the front door closed with a reverberating clang steps were heard along the passage the library door swung open of itself and the knockeryes the knockerslowly strode into the room the haunted man rubbed his eyesno there could be no mistake about itit was the knockers face mounted on a misty almost imperceptible body the brazen rod was transferred from its mouth to its right hand where it was held like a ghostly truncheon  its a cold evening said the haunted man  it is said the goblin in a hard metallic voice  it must be pretty cold out there said the haunted man with vague politeness do you everwill youtake some hot water and brandy  no said the goblin  perhaps youd like it cold by way of change continued the haunted man correcting himself as he remembered the peculiar temperature with which the goblin was probably familiar  time flies said the goblin coldly we have no leisure for idle talk come he moved his ghostly truncheon toward the window and laid his hand upon the others arm at his touch the body of the haunted man seemed to become as thin and incorporeal as that of the goblin himself and together they glided out of the window into the black and blowy night  in the rapidity of their flight the senses of the haunted man seemed to leave him at length they stopped suddenly  what do you see asked the goblin  i see a battlemented mediaeval castle gallant men in mail ride over the drawbridge and kiss their gauntleted fingers to fair ladies who wave their lily hands in return i see fight and fray and tournament i hear roaring heralds bawling the charms of delicate women and shamelessly proclaiming their lovers stay i see a jewess about to leap from a battlement i see knightly deeds violence rapine and a good deal of blood ive seen pretty much the same at astleys  look again  i see purple moors glens masculine women barelegged men priggish bookworms more violence physical excellence and blood always bloodand the superiority of physical attainments   and how do you feel now said the goblin  the haunted man shrugged his shoulders none the better for being carried back and asked to sympathize with a barbarous age  the goblin smiled and clutched his arm they again sped rapidly away through the black night and again halted  what do you see said the goblin  i see a barrackroom with a messtable and a group of intoxicated celtic officers telling funny stories and giving challenges to duel i see a young irish gentleman capable of performing prodigies of valor i learn incidentally that the acme of all heroism is the cornetcy of a dragoon regiment i hear a good deal of french no thank you said the haunted man hurriedly as he stayed the waving hand of the goblin i would rather not go to the peninsula and dont care to have a private interview with napoleon  again the goblin flew away with the unfortunate man and from a strange roaring below them he judged they were above the ocean a ship hove in sight and the goblin stayed its flight look he said squeezing his companions arm  the haunted man yawned dont you think charles youre rather running this thing into the ground of course its very moral and instructive and all that but aint there a little too much pantomime about it come now  look repeated the goblin pinching his arm malevolently the haunted man groaned  oh of course i see her majestys ship arethusa of course i am familiar with her stern first lieutenant her eccentric captain her one fascinating and several mischievous midshipmen of course i know its a splendid thing to see all this and not to be seasick oh there the young gentlemen are going to play a trick on the purser for gods sake let us go and the unhappy man absolutely dragged the goblin away with him  when they next halted it was at the edge of a broad and boundless prairie in the middle of an oak opening  i see said the haunted man without waiting for his cue but mechanically and as if he were repeating a lesson which the goblin had taught himi see the noble savage he is very fine to look at but i observe under his warpaint feathers and picturesque blanket dirt disease and an unsymmetrical contour i observe beneath his inflated rhetoric deceit and hypocrisy beneath his physical hardihood cruelty malice and revenge the noble savage is a humbug i remarked the same to mr catlin  come said the phantom  the haunted man sighed and took out his watch couldnt we do the rest of this another time  my hour is almost spent irreverent being but there is yet a chance for your reformation come  again they sped through the night and again halted the sound of delicious but melancholy music fell upon their ears  i see said the haunted man with something of interest in his manneri see an old mosscovered manse beside a sluggish flowing river i see weird shapes witches puritans clergymen little children judges mesmerized maidens moving to the sound of melody that thrills me with its sweetness and purity but although carried along its calm and evenly flowing current the shapes are strange and frightful an eating lichen gnaws at the heart of each not only the clergymen but witch maiden judge and puritan all wear scarlet letters of some kind burned upon their hearts i am fascinated and thrilled but i feel a morbid sensitiveness creeping over me ii beg your pardon the goblin was yawning frightfully well perhaps we had better go   one more and the last said the goblin  they were moving home streaks of red were beginning to appear in the eastern sky along the banks of the blackly flowing river by moorland and stagnant fens by low houses clustering close to the waters edge like strange mollusks crawled upon the beach to dry by misty black barges the more misty and indistinct seen through its mysterious veil the river fog was slowly rising so rolled away and rose from the heart of the haunted man etc etc  they stopped before a quaint mansion of red brick the goblin waved his hand without speaking  i see said the haunted man a gay drawingroom i see my old friends of the club of the college of society even as they lived and moved i see the gallant and unselfish men whom i have loved and the snobs whom i have hated i see strangely mingling with them and now and then blending with their forms our old friends dick steele addison and congreve i observe though that these gentlemen have a habit of getting too much in the way the royal standard of queen anne not in itself a beautiful ornament is rather too prominent in the picture the long galleries of black oak the formal furniture the old portraits are picturesque but depressing the house is damp i enjoy myself better here on the lawn where they are getting up a vanity fair see the bell rings the curtain is rising the puppets are brought out for a new play let me see  the haunted man was pressing forward in his eagerness but the hand of the goblin stayed him and pointing to his feet he saw between him and the rising curtain a new made grave and bending above the grave in passionate grief the haunted man beheld the phantom of the previous night    the haunted man started andwoke the bright sunshine streamed into the room the air was sparkling with frost he ran joyously to the window and opened it a small boy saluted him with merry christmas the haunted man instantly gave him a bank of england note how much like tiny tim tom and bobby that boy lookedbless my soul what a genius this dickens has  a knock at the door and boots entered  consider your salary doubled instantly have you read david copperfield  yezzur  your salary is quadrupled what do you think of the old curiosity shop  the man instantly burst into a torrent of tears and then into a roar of laughter  enough here are five thousand pounds open a porterhouse and call it our mutual friend huzza i feel so happy and the haunted man danced about the room  and so bathed in the light of that blessed sun and yet glowing with the warmth of a good action the haunted man haunted no longer save by those shapes which make the dreams of children beautiful reseated himself in his chair and finished our mutual friend      terence denville  by chls lvr   chapter i  my home   the little village of pilwiddle is one of the smallest and obscurest hamlets on the western coast of ireland on a lofty crag overlooking the hoarse atlantic stands denvilles shot tower a corruption by the peasantry of denvilles chateau so called from my great grandfather phelim st remy denville who assumed the name and title of a french heiress with whom he ran away to this fact my familiar knowledge and excellent pronunciation of the french language may be attributed as well as many of the events which covered my after life  the denvilles were always passionately fond of field sports at the age of four i was already the boldest rider and the best shot in the country when only eight i won the st remy cup at the pilwiddle racesriding my favorite bloodmare hellfire as i approached the stand amidst the plaudits of the assembled multitude and cries of thrue for ye mashter terence and oh but its a dinville there was a slight stir among the gentry who surrounded the lord lieutenant and other titled personages whom the race had attracted thither how young he isa mere child and yet how noblelooking said a sweet low voice which thrilled my soul  i looked up and met the full liquid orbs of the hon  blanche fitzroy sackville youngest daughter of the lord lieutenant she blushed deeply i turned pale and almost fainted but the cold sneering tones of a masculine voice sent the blood back again into my youthful cheek  very likely the ragged scion of one of these banditti irish gentry who has taken naturally to the road he should be at schoolthough i warrant me his knowledge of terence will not extend beyond his own name said lord henry somerset aiddecamp to the lord lieutenant  a moment and i was perfectly calm though cold as ice dismounting and stepping to the side of the speaker i said in a low firm voice  had your lordship read terence more carefully you would have learned that banditti are sometimes proficient in other arts beside horsemanship and i touched his holster significantly with my hand i had not read terence myself but with the skillful audacity of my race i calculated that a vague allusion coupled with a threat would embarrass him it did  ahwhat mean you he said white with rage  enough we are observed i replied father tom will wait on you this evening and tomorrow morning my lord in the glen below pilwiddle we will meet again  father tomglen ejaculated the englishman with genuine surprise what do priests carry challenges and act as seconds in your infernal country  yes i answered scornfully why should they not their services are more often necessary than those of a surgeon i added significantly turning away  the party slowly rode off with the exception of the hon blanche sackville who lingered for a moment behind in an instant i was at her side bending her blushing face over the neck of her white filly she said hurriedly  words have passed between lord somerset and yourself you are about to fight  dont deny itbut hear me you will meet himi know your skill of weapons he will be at your mercy i entreat you to spare his life  i hesitated never i cried passionately he has insulted a denville  terence she whispered terencefor my sake  the blood rushed to my cheeks and her eyes sought the ground in bashful confusion  you love him then i cried bitterly  no no she said agitatedlyno you do me wrong iicannot explain myself my fatherthe lady dowager sackvillethe estate of sackvillethe boroughmy uncle eitzroy somerset ah what am i saying forgive me oh terence she said as her beautiful head sank on my shoulder you know not what i suffer  i seized her hand and covered it with passionate kisses  but the highbred english girl recovering something of her former hauteur said hastily leave me leave me but promise  i promise i replied enthusiastically i will spare his life  thanks terencethanks and disengaging her hand from my lips she rode rapidly away  the next morning the hon captain henry somerset and myself exchanged nineteen shots in the glen and at each fire i shot away a  button from his uniform as my last bullet shot off the last button from his sleeve i remarked quietly you seem now my lord to be almost as ragged as the gentry you sneered at and rode haughtily away     chapter ii  the fighting fiftysixth   when i was nineteen years old my father sold the chateau d enville and purchased my commission in the fiftysixth with the proceeds i say denville said young mcspadden a boyfaced ensign who had just joined youll represent the estate in the army if you wont in the house poor fellow he paid for his meaningless joke with his life for i shot him through the heart the next morning youre a good fellow denville said the poor boy faintly as i knelt beside him goodby for the first time since my grandfathers death i wept i could not help thinking that i would have been a better man if blanchebut why proceed was she not now in florencethe belle of the english embassy  but napoleon had returned from elba europe was in a blaze of excitement the allies were preparing to resist the man of destiny we were ordered from gibraltar home and were soon again en route for brussels i did not regret that i was to be placed in active service i was ambitious and longed for an opportunity to distinguish myself my garrison life in gibraltar had been monotonous and dull i had killed five men in duel and had an affair with the colonel of my regiment who handsomely apologized before the matter assumed a serious aspect i had been twice in love yet these were but boyish freaks and follies i wished to be a man  the time soon camethe morning of waterloo but why describe that momentous battle on which the fate of the entire world was hanging twice were the fiftysixth surrounded by french cuirassiers and twice did we mow them down by our fire i had seven horses shot under me and was mounting the eighth when an orderly rode up hastily touched his cap and handing me a dispatch galloped rapidly away  i opened it hurriedly and read  let plcton advance immediately on the right  i saw it all at a glance i had been mistaken for a general officer but what was to be done pictons division was two miles away only accessible through a heavy crossfire of artillery and musketry but my mind was made up  in an instant i was engaged with an entire squadron of cavalry who endeavored to surround me cutting my way through them i advanced boldly upon a battery and sabred the gunners before they could bring their pieces to bear looking around i saw that i had in fact penetrated the french centre before i was well aware of the locality i was hailed by a sharp voice in french  come here sir  i obeyed and advanced to the side of a little man in a cocked hat  has grouchy come  not yet sire i repliedfor it was the emperor  ha he said suddenly bending his piercing eyes on my uniform a prisoner  no sire i said proudly  a spy  i placed my hand upon my sword but a gesture from the emperor bade me forbear  you are a brave man he said  i took my snuffbox from my pocket and taking a pinch replied by handing it with a bow to the emperor  his quick eye caught the cipher on the lid  what a denville ha this accounts for the purity of your accent any relation to roderick denville  my father sire  he was my schoolfellow at the ecole polytechnique embrace me and the emperor fell upon my neck in the presence of his entire staff then recovering himself he gently placed in my hand his own magnificent snuffbox in exchange for mine and hanging upon my breast the cross of the legion of honor which he took from his own he bade one of his marshals conduct me back to my regiment  i was so intoxicated with the honor of which i had been the recipient that on reaching our lines i uttered a shout of joy and put spurs to my horse the intelligent animal seemed to sympathize with my feelings and fairly flew over the ground on a rising eminence a few yards before me stood a grayhaired officer surrounded by his staff i dont know what possessed me but putting spurs to my horse i rode at him boldly and with one bound cleared him horse and all a shout of indignation arose from the assembled staff i wheeled suddenly with the intention of apologizing but my mare misunderstood me and again dashing forward once more vaulted over the head of the officer this time unfortunately uncovering him by a vicious kick of her hoof seize him roared the entire army i was seized as the soldiers led me away i asked the name of the grayhaired officer thatwhy thats the duke of wellington  i fainted                                       for six months i had brain fever during my illness ten grapeshot were extracted from my body which i had unconsciously received during the battle when i opened my eyes i met the sweet glance of a sister of charity  blanche i stammered feebly  the same she replied  you here  yes dear but hush its a long story you see  dear terence your grandfather married my greataunts sister and your father again married my grandmothers niece who dying without a will was according to the french law   but i do not comprehend i said  of course not said blanche with her old sweet smile youve had brain fever so go to sleep  i understood however that blanche loved me and i am now dear reader sir terence sackville k c b and lady blanche is lady sackville      mary mcgillup  a southern novel  after belle boyd  with an introduction by g a sla   introduction   will you write me up  the scene was near temple bar the speaker was the famous rebel mary mcgillupa young girl of fragile frame and long lustrous black hair i must confess that the question was a peculiar one and under the circumstances somewhat puzzling it was true i had been kindly treated by the northerners and though prejudiced against them was to some extent under obligations to them it was true that i knew little or nothing of american politics history or geography but when did an english writer ever weigh such trifles turning to the speaker i inquired with some caution the amount of pecuniary compensation offered for the work  sir she said drawing her fragile form to its full height you insult meyou insult the south  but look ye here dye seethe tinthe bluntthe readythe stiff you know dont ye see we cant do without that you know  it shall be contingent on the success of the story she answered haughtily in the mean time take this precious gem and drawing a diamond ring from her finger she placed it with a roll of mss in my hands and vanished  although unable to procure more than 1 pound 2s 6d from an intelligent pawnbroker to whom i stated the circumstances and with whom i pledged the ring my sympathies with the cause of a downtrodden and chivalrous people were at once enlisted i could not help wondering that in rich england the home of the oppressed and the free a young and lovely woman like the fair author of those pages should be obliged to thus pawn her jewelsher marriage giftfor the means to procure her bread with the exception of the english aristocracywho much resemble themi do not know of a class of people that i so much admire as the southern planters may i become better acquainted with both  since writing the above the news of mr lincolns assassination has reached me it is enough for me to say that i am dissatisfied with the result i do not attempt to excuse the assassin yet there will be men who will charge this act upon the chivalrous south this leads me to repeat a remark once before made by me in this connection which has become justly celebrated it is this  it is usual in cases of murder to look for the criminal among those who expect to be benefited by the crime in the death of lincoln his immediate successor in office alone receives the benefit of his dying  if her majesty queen victoria were assassinated which heaven forbid the one most benefited by her decease would of course be his royal highness the prince of wales her immediate successor it would be unnecessary to state that suspicion would at once point to the real culprit which would of course be his royal highness this is logic  but i have done after having thus stated my opinion in favor of the south i would merely remark that there is one who judgeth all thingswho weigheth the cause between brother and brotherand awardeth the perfect  retribution and whose ultimate decision i as a british subject have only anticipated  g a s     chapter i   every reader of belle boyds narrative will remember an allusion to a lovely fragilelooking girl of nineteen who rivaled belle boyd in devotion to the southern cause and who like her earned the enviable distinction of being a rebel spy  i am that fragile young creature although on friendly terms with the late miss boyd now mrs hardinge candor compels me to state that nothing but our common politics prevents me from exposing the ungenerous spirit she has displayed in this allusion to be dismissed in a single paragraph after years ofbut i anticipate to put up with this feeble and forced acknowledgment of services rendered would be a confession of a craven spirit which thank god though fragile and only nineteen i do not possess i may not have the blood of a howard in my veins as some people whom i shall not disgrace myself by naming claim to have but i have yet to learn that the race of mcgillup ever yet brooked slight or insult i shall not say that attention in certain quarters seems to have turned some peoples heads nor that it would have been more delicate if certain folks had kept quiet on the subject of their courtship and the rejection of certain offers when it is known that their forward conduct was all that procured them a husband thank heaven the south has some daughters who are above such base considerations while nothing shall tempt me to reveal the promises to share equally the fame of certain enterprises which were made by one who shall now be nameless i have deemed it only just to myself to put my own adventures upon record if they are not equal to those of another individual it is because though fragile my education has taught me to have some consideration for the truth i am done     chapter ii   i was born in missouri my dislike for the northern scum was inherent this was shown at an early age in the extreme distaste i exhibited for websters spellingbookthe work of a wellknown eastern abolitionist i cannot be too grateful for the consideration shown by my chivalrous fathera gentleman of the old schoolwho resisted to the last an attempt to introduce mitchells astronomy and geography into the public school of our district when i state that this same mitchell became afterward a hireling helot in the yankee army every intelligent reader will appreciate the prophetic discrimination of this true son of the south  i was eight years old when i struck the first blow for southern freedom against the northern tyrant it is hardly necessary to state that in this instance the oppressor was a pale overworked new england schoolmarm the principle for which i was contending i felt however to be the same resenting an affront put upon me i one day heaved a rock footnote note by g a sin the southwest any stone  larger than a pea is termed a rock at the head of the vandal schoolmistress  i was seized and overpowered my pen falters as i reach the climax english readers will not give credit to this sickening storythe civilized world will avert its headbut i mary mcgillup was publicly spanked     chapter iii   but the chaotic vortex of civil war approached and fell destruction often procrastinated brooded in storm footnote i make no pretension to fine writing but perhaps mrs hardinge can lay over that oh of course m mcg as the english people may like to know what was really the origin of the rebellion i have no hesitation in giving them the true and only cause slavery had nothing to do with it although the violation of the declaration of independence in the disregard by the north of the fugitive slave law footnote the declaration of independence grants to each subject the  pursuit of life liberty and happiness a fugitive slave may be said to personify life liberty and happiness hence his pursuit is really legal this is logic gas might have provoked a less fiery people than the southrons at the inception of the struggle a large amount of southern indebtedness was held by the people of the north to force payment from the generous but insolvent debtorto obtain liquidation from the southern planterwas really the soulless and mercenary object of the craven northerners let the common people of england look to this let the improvident literary hack the starved impecunious grub street debtor the newspaper frequenter of sponging houses remember this in their criticisms of the vile and slavish yankee     chapter iv   the roasting of an abolitionist by a greatly infuriated community was my first taste of the horrors of civil war heavens why will the north persist in this fratricidal warfare the expulsion of several union refugees which soon followed now fairly plunged my beloved state into the seething vortex  i was sitting at the piano one afternoon singing that stirring refrain so justly celebrated but which a craven spirit unworthy of england has excluded from some of her principal restaurants and was dwelling with some enthusiasm on the following line    huzza she spurns the northern scum  when a fragment of that scum clothed in that detestable blue uniform which is the symbol of oppression entered the apartment  i have the honor of addressing the celebrated rebel spy miss mcgillup said the vandal officer  in a moment i was perfectly calm with the exception of slightly expectorating twice in the face of the minion i did not betray my agitation haughtily yet firmly i replied  i am  you looked as if you might be the brute replied as he turned on his heel to leave the apartment  in an instant i threw myself before him you shall not leave here thus i shrieked grappling him with an energy which no one seeing my frail figure would have believed i know the reputation of your hireling crew i read your dreadful purpose in your eye tell me not that your designs are not sinister you came here to insult meto kiss me perhaps you shantyou naughty man go away  the blush of conscious degradation rose to the cheek of the lincoln hireling as he turned his face away from mine  in an instant i drew my pistol from my belt which in anticipation of some such  outrage i always carried and shot him     chapter v     thy forte was less to act than speak maryland thy politics were   changed each week maryland with northern vandals thou wast meek   with sympathizers thou wouldst shriek i know theeohtwas like   thy cheek maryland my maryland  after committing the act described in the preceding chapter which every english reader will pardon i went upstairs put on a clean pair of stockings and placing a rose in my lustrous black hair proceeded at once to the camp of generals price and mosby to put them in possession of information which would lead to the destruction of a portion of the federal army during a great part of my flight i was exposed to a running fire from the federal pickets of such coarse expressions as go it sally reb dust it my confederate beauty but i succeeded in reaching the glorious southern camp uninjured  in a week afterwards i was arrested by a lettre de cachet of mr stanton and placed in the bastile british readers of my story will express surprise at these terms but i assure them that not only these articles but tumbrils guillotines and conciergeries were in active use among the federals if substantiation be required i refer to the charleston mercury the only reliable organ next to the new york daily news published in the country at the bastile i made the acquaintance of the accomplished and elegant author of guy livingstone footnote the recent conduct of mr  livingstone renders him unworthy of my notice his disgusting praise of belle boyd and complete  ignoring of my claims show the artfulness of some females and puppyism of some  men m mcg to whom i presented a curiously carved thighbone of a  union officer and   from whom i received the following beautiful acknowledgment  demoiselleshould i ever win hame to my ain countrie i make mine avow to enshrine in my reliquaire this elegant bijouterie and offering of la belle rebelle nay methinks this fraction of mans anatomy were some compensation for the rib lost by the grand old gardener adam     chapter vi   released at last from durance vile and placed on board of an erie canalboat on my way to canada i for a moment breathed the sweets of liberty perhaps the interval gave me opportunity to indulge in certain reveries which i had hitherto sternly dismissed henry breckinridge folair a consistent copperhead captain of the canal boat again and again pressed that suit i had so often rejected  it was a lovely moonlight night we sat on the deck of the gliding craft the moonbeam and the lash of the driver fell softly on the flanks of the off horse and only the surging of the towrope broke the silence folairs arm clasped my waist i suffered it to remain placing in my lap a small but not ungrateful roll of checkerberry lozenges he took the occasion to repeat softly in my ear the words of a motto he had just unwrappedwith its graceful covering of the tissue paperfrom a sugar almond the heart of the wicked little rebel mary mcgillup was won   the story of mary mcgillup is done i might have added the journal of my husband henry breckinridge folair but as it refers chiefly to his freights and a schedule of his passengers i have been obliged reluctantly to suppress it  it is due to my friends to say that i have been requested not to write this book expressions have reached my ears the reverse of complimentary i have been told that its publication will probably insure my banishment for life be it so if the cause for which i labored have been subserved i am content      the hoodlum band  or  the boy chief the infant politician and the pirate prodigy   chapter i   it was a quiet new england village nowhere in the valley of the connecticut the autumn sun shone upon a more peaceful pastoral manufacturing community the wooden nutmegs were slowly ripening on the trees and the whitepine hams for western consumption were gradually rounding into form under the deft manipulation of the hardy american artisan the honest connecticut farmer was quietly gathering from his threshingfloor the shoepegs which when intermixed with a fair proportion of oats offered a pleasing substitute for fodder to the effete civilizations of europe an almost sabbathlike stillness prevailed doemville was only seven miles from hartford and the surrounding landscape smiled with the conviction of being fully insured  few would have thought that this peaceful village was the home of the three young heroes whose exploits would hereafterbut we anticipate  doemville academy was the principal seat of learning in the county under the grave and gentle administration of the venerable doctor context it had attained just popularity yet the increasing infirmities of age obliged the doctor to relinquish much of his trust to his assistants who  it is needless to say abused his confidence before long their brutal tyranny and deeplaid malevolence became apparent boys were absolutely forced to study their lessons the sickening fact will hardly be believed but during schoolhours they were obliged to remain in their seats with the appearance at least of discipline it is stated by good authority that the rolling of croquetballs across the floor during recitation was objected to under the fiendish excuse of its interfering with their studies the breaking of windows by baseballs and the beating of small scholars with bats was declared against at last bloated and arrogant with success the underteachers threw aside all disguise and revealed themselves in their true colors a cigar was actually taken out of a dayscholars mouth during prayers a flask of whiskey was dragged from anothers desk and then thrown out of the window and finally profanity hazing theft and lying were almost discouraged  could the youth of america conscious of their power and a literature of their own tamely submit to this tyranny never we repeat it firmly never we repeat it to parents and guardians never but the fiendish tutors chuckling in their glee little knew what was passing through the cold haughty intellect of charles francis adams golightly aged ten what curled the lip of benjamin franklin jenkins aged seven or what shone in the bold blue eyes of bromley chitterlings aged six and a half as they sat in the corner of the playground at recess their only other companion and confidant was the negro porter and janitor of the school known as pirate jim  fitly indeed was he named as the secrets of his early wild career confessed freely to his noble young friendsplainly showed a slaver at the age of seventeen the ringleader of a mutiny on the african coast at the age of twenty a privateersman during the last war with england  the commander of a fireship and its sole survivor at twentyfive with a wild intermediate career of unmixed piracy until the rebellion called him to civil service again as a blockade runner and peace and a desire for rural repose led him to seek the janitorship of the doemville academy where no questions were asked and references not exchangedhe was indeed a fit mentor for our daring youth although a man whose days had exceeded the usual space allotted to humanity the various episodes of his career footing his age up to nearly one hundred and fiftynine years he scarcely looked it and was still hale and vigorous  yes continued pirate jim critically i dont think he was any bigger nor you master chitterlings if as big when he stood on the forkstle of my ship and shot the captain o that east injyman dead we used to call him little weevils he was so younglike but bless your hearts boys he want anything to little sammy barlow ez once crep up inter the captains stateroom on a rooshin frigate stabbed him to the heart with a jackknife then put on the captains uniform and his cocked hat took command of the ship and fout her hisself  wasnt the captains clothes big for him asked b franklin jenkins anxiously  the janitor eyed young jenkins with pained dignity  didnt i say the rooshin captain was a small a very small man rooshins is small likewise greeks  a noble enthusiasm beamed in the faces of the youthful heroes  was barlow as large as me asked c f adams golightly lifting his curls from his jovelike brow  yes but then he hed hed so to speak experiences it was allowed that he had pizened his schoolmaster afore he went to sea but its dry talking boys  golightly drew a flask from his jacket and handed it to the janitor it was his fathers best brandy the heart of the honest old seaman was touched  bless ye my own pirate boy he said in a voice suffocating with emotion  ive got some tobacco said the youthful jenkins but its fine cut i use only that now  i kin buy some plug at the corner grocery said pirate jim only i left my portmoney at home  take this watch said young golightly tis my fathers since he became a tyrant and usurper and forced me to join a corsairs band ive begun by dividing the property  this is idle trifling said young chitterlings wildly every moment is precious is this an hour to give to wine and wassail ha we want actionaction we must strike the blow for freedom tonightay this very night the scow is already anchored in the milldam freighted with provisions for a three months voyage i have a black flag in my pocket why then this cowardly delay  the two elder youths turned with a slight feeling of awe and shame to gaze on the glowing cheeks and high haughty crest of their youngest comradethe bright the beautiful bromley chitterlings alas that very moment of forgetfulness and mutual admiration was fraught with danger a thin dyspeptic halfstarved tutor approached  it is time to resume your studies young gentlemen he said with fiendish politeness  they were his last words on earth  down tyrant screamed chitterlings  sic himi mean sic semper tyrannis said the classical golightly  a heavy blow on the head from a baseball bat and the rapid projection of a baseball against his empty stomach brought the tutor a limp and lifeless mass to the ground golightly shuddered let not my young readers blame him too rashly it was his first homicide   search his pockets said the practical jenkins  they did so and found nothing hut a harvard triennial catalogue  let us fly said jenkins  forward to the boats cried the enthusiastic chitterlings  but c f adams golightly stood gazing thoughtfully at the prostrate tutor  this he said calmly is the result of a too free government and the commonschool system what the country needs is reform i cannot go with you boys  traitor screamed the others  c f a golightly smiled sadly  you know me not i shall not become a piratebut a congressman  jenkins and chitterlings turned pale  i have already organized two caucuses in a baseball club and bribed the delegates of another nay turn not away let us be friends pursuing through various ways one common end farewell they shook hands  but where is pirate jim asked jenkins  he left us but for a moment to raise money on the watch to purchase armament for the scow farewell  and so the gallant youthful spirits parted bright with the sunrise of hope  that night a conflagration raged in doemville the doemville academy mysteriously fired first fell a victim to the devouring element the candyshop and cigarstore both holding heavy liabilities against the academy quickly followed by the lurid gleams of the flames a long low slooprigged scow with every mast gone except one slowly worked her way out of the milldam towards the sound the next day three boys were missingc f adams golightly b f jenkins and bromley chitterlings had they perished in the flames who shall say enough  that never more under these names did they again appear in the homes of their ancestors  happy indeed would it have been for doemville had the mystery ended here but a darker interest and scandal rested upon the peaceful village during that awful night the boardingschool of madame brimborion was visited stealthily and two of the fairest heiresses of connecticutdaughters of the president of a savings bank and insurance directorwere the next morning found to have eloped with them also disappeared the entire contents of the savings bank and on the following day the flamingo fire insurance company failed     chapter ii   let my young readers now sail with me to warmer and more hospitable climes off the coast of patagonia a long low black schooner proudly rides the seas that break softly upon the vineclad shores of that luxuriant land who is this that wrapped in persian rugs and dressed in the most expensive manner calmly reclines on the quarterdeck of the schooner toying lightly ever and anon with the luscious fruits of the vicinity held in baskets of solid gold by nubian slaves or at intervals with daring grace guides an ebony velocipede over the polished black walnut decks and in and out the intricacies of the rigging who is it well may be asked what name is it that blanches with terror the cheeks of the patagonian navy who but the pirate prodigythe relentless boy scourer of patagonian seas voyagers slowly drifting by the silurian beach coasters along the devonian shore still shudder at the name of bromley chitterlingsthe boy avenger late of hartford connecticut  it has been often asked by the idly curious why avenger and of what let us not seek to disclose the  awful secret hidden under that youthful jacket enough that there may have been that of bitterness in his past life that they whose soul would sicken oer the heaving wave or whose soul would heave above the sickening wave did not understand only one knew him perhaps too wella queen of the amazons taken prisoner off terra del fuego a week previous she loved the boy avenger but in vain his youthful heart seemed obdurate  hear me at last he said when she had for the seventh time wildly proffered her hand and her kingdom in marriage and know once and forever why i must decline your flattering proposal i love another  with a wild despairing cry she leaped into the sea but was instantly rescued by the pirate prodigy yet even in that supreme moment such was his coolness that on his way to the surface he captured a mermaid and placing her in charge of his steward with directions to give her a stateroom with hot and cold water calmly resumed his place by the amazons side when the cabin door closed on his faithful servant bringing champagne and ices to the interesting stranger chitterlings resumed his narrative with a choking voice  when i first fled from the roof of a tyrannical parent i loved the beautiful and accomplished eliza j sniffen her father was president of the workingmens savings bank and it was perfectly understood that in the course of time the entire deposits would be his but like a vain fool i wished to anticipate the future and in a wild moment persuaded miss sniffen to elope with me and with the entire cash assets of the bank we fled together he paused overcome with emotion but fate decreed it otherwise in my feverish haste i had forgotten to place among the stores of my pirate craft that peculiar kind of chocolate  caramel to which eliza jane was most partial we were obliged to put into new rochelle on the second day out to enable miss sniffen to procure that delicacy at the nearest confectioners and match some zephyr worsteds at the first fancy shop fatal mistake she wentshe never returned in a moment he resumed in a choking voice after a weeks weary waiting i was obliged to put to sea again bearing a broken heart and the broken bank of her father i have never seen her since  and you still love her asked the amazon queen excitedly  ay forever  noble youth here take the reward of thy fidelity for know bromley chitterlings that i am eliza jane wearied with waiting i embarked on a peruvian guano shipits a long story dear  and altogether too thin said the boy avenger fiercely releasing himself from her encircling arms eliza janes age a year ago was only thirteen and you are forty if a day  true she returned sadly but i have suffered much and time passes rapidly and ive grown you would scarcely believe that this is my own hair  i know not he replied in gloomy abstraction  forgive my deceit she returned if you are affianced to another let me at least bea mother to you  the pirate prodigy started and tears came to his eyes the scene was affecting in the extreme several of the oldest seamenmen who had gone through scenes of suffering with tearless eyes and unblanched cheeksnow retired to the spirit room to conceal their emotion a few went into caucus in the forecastle and returned with the request that the amazonian queen should hereafter be known as the queen of the pirates isle  mother gasped the pirate prodigy  my son screamed the amazonian queen  they embraced at the same moment a loud flop was heard on the quarterdeck it was the forgotten mermaid who emerging from her stateroom and ascending the companionway at that moment had fainted at the spectacle the pirate prodigy rushed to her side with a bottle of smellingsalts  she recovered slowly permit me she said rising with dignity to leave the ship i am unaccustomed to such conduct  hear meshe is my mother  she certainly is old enough to be replied the mermaid and to speak of that being her own hair she said as she rearranged with characteristic grace a comb and a small handmirror her own luxuriant tresses  if i couldnt afford any other clothes i might wear a switch too hissed the amazonian queen i suppose you dont dye it on account of the salt water but perhaps you prefer green dear  a little salt water might improve your own complexion love  fishwoman screamed the amazonian queen  bloomerite shrieked the mermaid  in another instant they had seized each other  mutiny overboard with them cried the pirate prodigy rising to the occasion and casting aside all human affection in the peril of the moment  a plank was brought and the two women placed upon it  after you dear said the mermaid significantly to the amazonian queen youre the oldest  thank you said the amazonian queen stepping back fish is always served first  stung by the insult with a wild scream of rage the mermaid grappled her in her arms and leaped into the sea  as the waters closed over them forever the pirate prodigy sprung to his feet  up with the black flag and bear  away for new london he shouted in trumpetlike tones  ha ha once more the rover is free  indeed it was too true in that fatal moment he had  again loosed himself from the trammels of human feeling and was once more the boy avenger     chapter iii   again i must ask my young readers to mount my hippogriff and hie with me to the almost inaccessible heights of the rocky mountains there for years a band of wild and untamable savages known as the pigeon feet had resisted the blankets and bibles of civilization for years the trails leading to their camp were marked by the bones of teamsters and broken wagons and the trees were decked with the dying scalp locks of women and children the boldest of military leaders hesitated to attack them in their fortresses and prudently left the scalping knives rifles powder and shot provided by a paternal government for their welfare lying on the ground a few miles from their encampment with the request that they were not to be used until the military had safely retired hitherto save an occasional incursion into the territory of the knockknees a rival tribe they had limited their depredations to the vicinity  but lately a baleful change had come over them acting under some evil influence they now pushed their warfare into the white settlements carrying fire and destruction with them again and again had the government offered them a free pass to washington and the privilege of being photographed but under the same evil guidance they refused there was a singular mystery in their mode of aggression schoolhouses were always burned the schoolmasters taken into captivity and never again heard from    a palace car on the union pacific railway containing an excursion party of teachers en route to san francisco was surrounded its inmates captured andtheir vacancies in the school catalogue never again filled even a hoard of educational examiners proceeding to cheyenne were taken prisoners and obliged to answer questions they themselves had proposed amidst horrible tortures by degrees these atrocities were traced to the malign influence of a new chief of the tribe as yet little was known of him but through his baleful appellations young man who goes for his teacher and he lifts the hair of the schoolmarm he was said to be small and exceedingly youthful in appearance indeed his earlier appellative he wipes his nose on his sleeve was said to have been given to him to indicate his still boylike habits  it was night in the encampment and among the lodges of the pigeon toes dusky maidens flitted in and out among the campfires like brown moths cooking the toothsome buffalohump frying the fragrant bears meat and stewing the esculent bean for the braves for a few favored ones sput grasshoppers were reserved as a rare delicacy although the proud spartan soul of their chief scorned all such luxuries  he was seated alone in his wigwam attended only by the gentle mushymush fairest of the pigeon feet maidens nowhere were the characteristics of her great tribe more plainly shown than in the little feet that lapped over each other in walking a single glance at the chief was sufficient to show the truth of the wild rumors respecting his youth he was scarcely twelve of proud and lofty bearing and clad completely in wrappings of variouscolored scalloped cloths which gave him the appearance of a somewhat extrasized penwiper an enormous eagles feather torn from the wing of a bald eagle who once attempted to carry him away completed his attire it was also the  memento of one of his most superhuman feats of courage he would undoubtedly have scalped the eagle but that nature had anticipated him  why is the great chief sad said mushymush softly does his soul still yearn for the blood of the palefaced teachers did not the scalping of two professors of geology in the yale exploring party satisfy his warriors heart yesterday has he forgotten that gardener and king are still to follow shall his own mushymush bring him a botanist tomorrow speak for the silence of my brother lies on my heart like the snow on the mountain and checks the flow of my speech  still the proud boy chief sat silent suddenly he said hiss and rose to his feet taking a long rifle from the ground he adjusted its sight exactly seven miles away on the slope of the mountain the figure of a man was seen walking the boy chief raised the rifle to his unerring eye and fired the man fell  a scout was dispatched to scalp and search the body he presently returned  who was the paleface eagerly asked the chief  a life insurance agent  a dark scowl settled on the face of the chief  i thought it was a book peddler  why is my brothers heart sore against the book peddler asked mushymush  because said the boy chief fiercely i am again without my regular dime noveland i thought he might have one in his pack hear me mushymush the united states mails no longer bring me my young america or my boys and girls weekly i find it impossible even with my fastest scouts to keep up with the rear of general howard and replenish my literature from the sutlers wagon without a dime novel or a young america how am i to keep up this injin business  mushymush remained in meditation a single moment then she looked up proudly  my brother has spoken it is well he shall have his dime novel he shall know the kind of hairpin his sister mushymush is  and she arose and gamboled lightly as the fawn out of his presence  in two hours she returned in one hand she held three small flaxen scalps in the other the boy marauder complete in one volume price ten cents  three palefaced children she gasped were reading it in the tail end of an emigrant wagon i crept up to them softly their parents are still unaware of the accident and she sank helpless at his feet   noble girl said the boy chief gazing proudly on her prostrate form and these are the people that a military despotism expects to subdue     chapter iv   but the capture of several wagonloads of commissary whiskey and the destruction of two tons of stationery intended for the general commanding which interfered with his regular correspondence with the war department at last awakened the united states military authorities to active exertion a quantity of troops were massed before the pigeon feet encampment and an attack was hourly imminent  shine your boots sir  it was the voice of a youth in humble attire standing before the flap of the commanding generals tent  the general raised his head from his correspondence  ah he said looking down on the humble boy i see i shall write that the appliances of civilization move steadily forward with the army yes he added you  may shine my military boots you understand however that to get your pay you must first  make a requisition on the commissarygeneral have it certified to by the quartermaster countersigned by the postadjutant and submitted by you to the war department   and charged as stationery added the general gently you are i see an intelligent and thoughtful boy i trust you neither use whiskey tobacco nor are ever profane  i promised my sainted mother  enough go on with your blacking i have to lead the attack on the pigeon feet at eight precisely it is now half past seven said the general consulting a large kitchen clock that stood in the corner of his tent  the little bootblack looked upthe general was absorbed in his correspondence the bootblack drew a tin puttyblower from his pocket took unerring aim and nailed in a single shot the minute hand to the dial going on with his blacking yet stopping ever and anon to glance over the generals plan of campaign spread on the table before him he was at last interrupted by the entrance of an officer  everything is ready for the attack general it is now eight oclock  impossible it is only half past seven  but my watch and the watches of the staff  are regulated by my kitchen clock that has been in my family for years enough it is only half past seven  the officer retired the bootblack had finished one boot another officer appeared  instead of attacking the enemy general we are attacked ourselves our pickets are already driven in  military pickets should not differ from other pickets said the bootblack modestly to stand firmly they should be well driven in ha there is something in that said the general thoughtfully but who are you who speak thus  rising to his full height the bootblack threw off his outer rags and revealed the figure of the boy chief of the pigeon feet  treason shrieked the general order an advance along the whole line  but in vain the next moment he fell beneath the tomahawk of the boy chief and within the next quarter of an hour the united states army was dispersed thus ended the battle of bootblack creek     chapter v   and yet the boy chief was not entirely happy indeed at times he seriously thought of accepting the invitation extended by the great chief at washington immediately after the massacre of his soldiers and once more revisiting the haunts of civilization his soul sickened in feverish inactivity schoolmasters palled on his taste he had introduced baseball blind hooky marbles and pegtop among his indian subjects but only with indifferent success the squaws persisted in boring holes through the china alleys and wearing them as necklaces his warriors stuck pipes in their baseball bats and made warclubs of them he could not but feel too that the gentle mushymush although devoted to her paleface brother was deficient in culinary education her mincepies were abominable her jam far inferior to that made by his aunt sally of doemville only an unexpected incident kept him equally from the extreme of listless sybaritic indulgence or of morbid cynicism indeed at the age of twelve he already had become disgusted with existence  he had returned to his wigwam after an exhausting buffalo hunt in which he had slain two hundred and seventyfive buffaloes with  his own hand not counting the individual buffalo on which he had leaped so as to join the herd and which he afterward led into the camp a captive and a present to the lovely mushymush he had scalped two express riders and a correspondent of the new york herald had despoiled the overland mail stage of a quantity of vouchers which enabled him to draw double rations from the government and was reclining on a bearskin smoking and thinking of the vanity of human endeavor when a scout entered saying that a paleface youth had demanded access to his person  is he a commissioner if so say that the red man is rapidly passing to the happy huntinggrounds of his fathers and now desires only peace blankets and ammunition obtain the latter and then scalp the commissioner  but it is only a youth who asks an interview  does he look like an insurance agent if so say that i have already policies in three hartford companies meanwhile prepare the stake and see that the squaws are ready with their implements of torture  the youth was admitted he was evidently only half the age of the boy chief as he entered the wigwam and stood revealed to his host they both started in another moment they were locked in each others arms jenky old boy  bromley old fel  b f jenkins for such was the name of the boy chief was the first to recover his calmness turning to his warriors he said proudly  let my children retire while i speak to the agent of our great father in washington hereafter no latchkeys will be provided for the wigwams of the warriors the practice of late hours must be discouraged  how said the warriors and instantly retired  whisper said jenkins drawing his friend aside   i am known here only as the boy chief of the pigeon toes  and i said bromley chitterlings proudly am known everywhere as the pirate prodigythe boy avenger of the patagonian coast  but how came you here  listen my pirate brig the lively mermaid now lies at meiggss wharf in san francisco disguised as a mendocino lumber vessel my pirate crew accompanied me here in a palace car from san francisco  it must have been expensive said the prudent jenkins it was hut they defrayed it by a collection from the other passengers you understand the papers will be full of it tomorrow do you take in the new york sun  no i dislike their indian policy but why are you here  hear me jenk t is a long and a sad story the lovely eliza j sniffen who fled with me from doemville was seized by her parents and torn from my arms at new rochelle reduced to poverty by the breaking of the savings bank of which he was presidenta failure to which i largely contributed and the profits of which i enjoyedi have since ascertained that eliza jane sniffen was forced to become a schoolmistress departed to take charge of a seminary in colorado and since then has never been heard from  why did the boy chief turn pale and clutch at the tentpole for support why indeed  eliza jane sniffen gasped jenkinsaged fourteen redhaired with a slight tendency to strabismus  the same  heaven help me she died by my mandate  traitor shrieked chitterlings rushing at jenkins with a drawn poniard  but a figure interposed the slight girlish form of mushymush with outstretched hands stood between the exasperated pirate prodigy and the boy chief  forbear she said sternly to chitterlings you know not what you do  the two youths paused  hear me she said rapidly when captured in a confectioners shop at new  rochelle e j sniffen was taken back to poverty she resolved to become a schoolmistress hearing of an opening in the west she proceeded to colorado to take exclusive charge of the pensionnat of mdme choflie late of paris on the way thither she was captured by the emissaries of the boy chief  in consummation of a fatal vow i made never to spare educational instructors interrupted jenkins  but in her captivity continued mushymush she managed to stain her face with pokeberry juice and mingling with the indian maidens was enabled to pass for one of the tribe once undetected she boldly ingratiated herself with the boy chiefhow honestly and devotedly he best can tellfor i mushymush the little sister of the boy chief am eliza jane sniffen  the pirate prodigy clasped her in his arms the boy chief raising his hand ejaculated  bless you my children  there is but one thing wanting to complete this reunion said chitterlings after a pause but the hurried entrance of a scout stopped his utterance  a commissioner from the great father in washington  scalp him shrieked the boy chief this is no time for diplomatic trifling  we have but he still insists upon seeing you and has sent in his card  the boy chief took it and read aloud in agonized accents  charles francis adams golightly late page in united states senate and acting commissioner of united states  in another moment golightly pale bleeding and as it were prematurely bald but still cold and intellectual entered the wigwam they fell upon his neck and begged his forgiveness  dont mention it he said quietly these things must and will happen under our present system of government my story is brief obtaining political influence through caucuses i became at last page in the senate through the exertions of political friends i was appointed clerk to the commissioner whose functions i now represent knowing through political spies in your own camp who you were i acted upon the physical fears of the commissioner who was an exclergyman and easily induced him to deputize me to consult with you in doing so i have lost my scalp but as the hirsute signs of juvenility have worked against my political progress i do not regret it as a partially bald young man i shall have more power the terms that i have to offer are simply this you can do everything you want go anywhere you choose if you will only leave this place i have a hundredthousanddollar draft on the united states treasury in my pocket at your immediate disposal  but whats to become of me asked chitterlings  your case has already been under advisement the secretary of state who is an intelligent man has determined to recognize you as de jure and de facto the only loyal representative of the patagonian government you may safely proceed to washington as its envoy extraordinary i dine with the secretary next week  and yourself old fellow  i only wish that twenty years from now you will recognize by your influence and votes the rights of c f a golightly to the presidency  and here ends our story trusting that my dear young friends may take whatever example or moral their respective parents and guardians may deem fittest from these pages i hope in future years to portray further the career of those three young heroes i have already introduced in the springtime of life to their charitable consideration                                                earlier sketches                                           mliss  an idyl of red mountain   pagenote there are two forms of this tale the earlier one is that printed originally in the golden era and afterward and until this time included in mr hartes collected writings it is comprised in four chapters and occupies about thirty pages when the present edition was under consideration mr harte called his publishers attention to the fact that the editor of the same paper proposed to him some time later to continue it as a serial in order to do this he found himself obliged to make some changes in the earlier incidents accordingly he republished the story in its first form but with some interpolations and alterations and then proceeded with other chapters making ten in all concluding it he says rather abruptly when i found it was inartistically prolonged this was in 1863 but even thus the story was not to be let alone ten years later in 1873 another writer took the tale up at the end of the tenth chapter added fifty more and issued the whole in the golden era when the continuation had been running some time mr harte discovered the fraud and inserted a card in the same paper advising the public that he had nothing whatever to do with this further amplification of his story afterward when the whole was published in book form he instituted legal proceedings and suppressed the sale  the present form is mr hartes revision and extension of his first and is reprinted from the golden era with his consent editor     chapter i  smiths pocket   just where the sierra nevada begins to subside in gentle undulations and the rivers grow less rapid and yellow on the side of a great red mountain stands smiths pocket seen from the red road at sunset in the red light and the red dust its white houses look like the outcroppings of quartz on the mountain side the red stage topped with redshirted passengers is lost to view half a dozen times in the tortuous descent turning up unexpectedly in outoftheway places and vanishing altogether within a hundred yards of the town it is probably owing to this sudden twist in the road that the advent of a stranger at smiths pocket is usually attended with a peculiar circumstance dismounting from the vehicle at the stage office the tooconfident traveler is apt to walk straight out of town under the impression that it lies in quite another direction it is related that one of the tunnel men two miles from town met one of these self reliant passengers with a carpetbag umbrella harpers magazine and other evidences of civilization and refinement plodding along over the road he had just ridden vainly endeavoring to find the settlement of smiths pocket  had he been an observant traveler he might have found some compensation for his disappointment in the weird aspect of that vicinity there were huge fissures on the hillside and displacements of the red soil resembling more the chaos of some primary elementary upheaval than the work of man while halfway down a long flume straddled its narrow body and disproportionate legs over the chasm like an enormous fossil of some forgotten antediluvian at every step smaller ditches crossed the road hiding in  their shallow depths unlovely streams that crept away to a clandestine union with the great yellow torrent below here and there the ruins of some cabin with the chimney alone left intact and the hearthstone open to the skies gave such a flat contradiction to the poetic delusion of lares and penates that the heart of the traveler must have collapsed as he gazed and even the barroom of the national hotel have afterward seemed festive and invested with preternatural comfort and domesticity  the settlement of smiths pocket owed its origin to the finding of a pocket on its site by a veritable smith five thousand dollars were taken out of it in one halfhour by smith three thousand dollars were expended by smith and others in erecting a flume and in tunneling and then smiths pocket was found to be only a pocket and subject like other pockets to depletion although smith pierced the bowels of the great red mountain that five thousand dollars was the first and the last return of his labor the mountain grew reticent of its golden secrets and the flume steadily ebbed away the remainder of smiths fortune then smith went into quartz mining then into quartz milling then into hydraulics and ditching and then by easy degrees into saloon keeping presently it was whispered that smith was drinking a good deal then it was known that smith was an habitual drunkard and then people began to think as they are apt to that he had never been anything else but the settlement of smiths pocket like that of most discoveries was happily not dependent on the fortune of its pioneer and other parties projected tunnels and found pockets so smiths pocket became a settlement with its two fancy stores its two hotels its one express office and its two first families occasionally its one long straggling street was overawed by the assumption of the latest san francisco fashions imported per express exclusively to the first families making outraged nature in the  ragged outline of her furrowed surface look still more homely and putting personal insult on that greater portion of the population to whom the sabbath with a change of linen brought merely the necessity of cleanliness without the luxury of adornment then there was a methodist church and hard by a monte bank and a little beyond on the mountain side a graveyard and then a little schoolhouse  the master as he was known to his little flock sat alone one night in the schoolhouse with some open copybooks before him carefully making those bold and full characters which are supposed to combine the extremes of chirographical and moral excellence and had got as far as riches are deceitful and was elaborating the noun with an insincerity of flourish that was quite in the spirit of his text when he heard a gentle tapping the woodpeckers had been busy about the roof during the day and the noise did not disturb his work but the opening of the door and the tapping continuing from the inside caused him to look up he was slightly startled by the figure of a young girl dirty and shabbily clad still her great black eyes her coarse uncombed lusterless black hair falling over her sunburned face her red arms and feet streaked with the red soil were all familiar to him it was melissa smithsmiths motherless child  what can she want here thought the master everybody knew mliss as she was called throughout the length and height of red mountain everybody knew her as an incorrigible girl her fierce ungovernable disposition her mad freaks and lawless character were in their way as proverbial as the story of her fathers weakness and as philosophically accepted by the townsfolk she wrangled with and fought the schoolboys with keener invective and quite as powerful arm she followed the trails with woodmans craft and the master had met her before miles away  shoeless stockingless and bareheaded on the mountain road the miners camps along the stream supplied her with subsistence during these voluntary pilgrimages in freely offered alms not but that a larger protection had been previously extended to mliss the rev joshua mcsnagley stated preacher had placed her in the hotel as servant by way of preliminary refinement and had introduced her to his scholars at sundayschool but she threw plates occasionally at the landlord and quickly retorted to the cheap witticisms of the guests and created in the sabbathschool a sensation that was so inimical to the orthodox dullness and placidity of that institution that with a decent regard for the starched frocks and unblemished morals of the two pinkandwhitefaced children of the first families the reverend gentleman had her ignominiously expelled such were the antecedents and such the character of mliss as she stood before the master it was shown in the ragged dress the unkempt hair and bleeding feet and asked his pity it flashed from her black fearless eyes and commanded his respect  i come here tonight she said rapidly and boldly keeping her hard glance on his because i knew you was alone i wouldnt come here when them gals was here i hate em and they hates me thats why you keep schooldont you i want to be teached  if to the shabbiness of her apparel and uncomeliness of her tangled hair and dirty face she had added the humility of tears the master would have extended to her the usual moiety of pity and nothing more but with the natural though illogical instincts of his species her boldness awakened in him something of that respect which all original natures pay unconsciously to one another in any grade and he gazed at her the more fixedly as she went on still rapidly her hand on the doorlatch and her eyes on his  my name is mlissmliss smith you can bet your  life on that my fathers old smithold bummer smiththats whats the matter with him mliss smithand im comin to school  well said the master  accustomed to be thwarted and opposed often wantonly and cruelly for no other purpose than to excite the violent impulses of her nature the masters phlegm evidently took her by surprise she  stopped she began to twist a lock of her hair between her fingers and the rigid line of upper lip drawn over the wicked little teeth relaxed and quivered slightly then her eyes dropped and something like a blush struggled up to her cheek and tried to assert itself through the splashes of redder soil and the sunburn of years suddenly she threw herself forward calling on god to strike her dead and fell quite weak and helpless with her face on the masters desk crying and sobbing as if her heart would break  the master lifted her gently and waited for the paroxysm to pass when with face still averted she was repeating between her sobs the mea culpa of childish penitencethat shed be good she didnt mean to etc it came to him to ask her why she had left sabbathschool  why had she left sabbathschool why oh yes what did he mcsnagley want to tell her she was wicked for what did he tell her that god hated her for if god hated her what did she want to go to sabbath school for she didnt want to be beholden to anybody who hated her  had she told mcsnagley this  yes she had  the master laughed it was a hearty laugh and echoed so oddly in the little schoolhouse and seemed so inconsistent and discordant with the sighing of the pines without that he shortly corrected himself with a sigh the sigh was quite as sincere in its way however and after a moment of serious silence he asked about her father  her father what father whose father what had he ever done for her why did the girls hate her come now what made the folks say old bummer smiths mliss when she passed yes oh yes she wished he was deadshe was deadeverybody was dead and her sobs broke forth anew  the master then leaning over her told her as well as he could what you or i might have said after hearing such unnatural theories from childish lips only bearing in mind perhaps better than you or i the unnatural facts of her ragged dress her bleeding feet and the omnipresent shadow of her drunken father then raising her to her feet he wrapped his shawl around her and bidding her come early in the morning he walked with her down the road then he bade her good night the moon shone brightly on the narrow path before them he stood and watched the bent little figure as it staggered down the road and waited until it had passed the little graveyard and reached the curve of the hill where it turned and stood for a moment a mere atom of suffering outlined against the faroff patient stars then he went back to his work but the lines of the copybook thereafter faded into long parallels of neverending road over which childish figures seemed to pass sobbing and crying to the night then the little schoolhouse seeming lonelier than before he shut the door and went home  the next morning mliss came to school her face had been washed and her coarse black hair bore evidence of recent struggles with the comb in which both had evidently suffered the old defiant look shone occasionally in her eyes but her manner was tamer and more subdued then began a series of little trials and selfsacrifices in which master and pupil bore an equal part and which increased the confidence and sympathy between them although obedient under the masters eye at times during recess if  thwarted or stung by a fancied slight mliss would rage in ungovernable fury and many a palpitating young savage finding himself matched with his own weapons of torment would seek the master with torn jacket and scratched face and complaints of the dreadful mliss there was a serious division among the townspeople on the subject some threatening to withdraw their children from such evil companionship and others as warmly upholding the course of the master in his work of reclamation meanwhile with a steady persistence that seemed quite astonishing to him on looking back afterward the master drew mliss gradually out of the shadow of her past life as though it were but her natural progress down the narrow path on which he had set her feet the moonlight night of their first meeting remembering the experience of the evangelical mcsnagley he carefully avoided that rock of ages on which that unskillful pilot had shipwrecked her young faith but if in the course of her reading she chanced to stumble upon those few words which have lifted such as she above the level of the older the wiser and the more prudentif she learned something of a faith that is symbolized by suffering and the old light softened in her eyes it did not take the shape of a lesson a few of the plainer people had made up a little sum by which the ragged mliss was enabled to assume the garments of respect and civilization and often a rough shake of the hand and words of commendation from a redshirted and burly figure sent a glow to the cheek of the young master and set him to thinking if it was altogether deserved  three months had passed from the time of their first meeting and the master was sitting late one evening over the moral and sententious copies when there came a tap at the door and again mliss stood before him she was neatly clad and cleanfaced and there was nothing perhaps but the long black hair and bright black eyes to remind him  of his former apparition are you busy she asked can you come with me and on his signifying his readiness in her old willful way she said come then quick  they passed out of the door together and into the dark road as they entered the town the master asked her whither she was going she replied to see her father  it was the first time he had heard her use that filial expression or indeed allude to him in any other way than old smith or the old man it was the first time in many weeks that she had spoken of him at all he had been missed from the settlement for the past fortnight and the master had credited the rumors of the townsfolk that smith had struck something rich on the north fork about ten miles from the village as they neared the settlement the master gathered from mliss that the rumor was untrue and that she had seen her father that day as she grew reticent to further questioning and as the master was satisfied from her manner that she had some definite purpose beyond her usual willfulness he passively resigned himself and followed her  through remote groggeries restaurants and saloons in gamblinghells and dancehouses the master preceded by mliss passed and repassed in the reeking smoke and blasphemous outcries of noisome dens the child holding the masters hand pursued her search with a strange familiarity perfect selfpossession and implied protection of himself that even in his anxiety seemed ludicrous some of the revelers recognizing mliss called to her to sing and dance for them and would have forced liquor upon her but for the masters interference others mutely made way for them so an hour slipped by and as yet their search was fruitless the master had yawned once or twice and whistledtwo fatal signs of failing interestand finally came to a full stop  its half past eleven melissa said he consulting his  watch by a broad pencil of light from an open shutterhalf past eleven and it strikes me that our old friends the woodpeckers must have gone to bed some hours ago unless they are waiting up for us im much obliged to you for the evenings entertainment but im afraid that even the pretext of looking for a parent wont excuse further dissipation wed better put this off till tomorrow what do you say melissa why what ails the child whats that noise why a pistol youre not afraid of that  few children brought up in the primeval seclusion of smiths pocket were unfamiliar with those quick and sharp notes which usually rendered the evening zephyrs of that locality vocal certainly not mliss to have started when that report rang on the clear night air the echoes caught it as usual and carried it round and round red mountain and set the dogs to barking all along the streams the lights seemed to dance and move quickly on the outskirts of the town for a few moments afterward the stream suddenly rippled quite audibly behind them a few stones loosened themselves from the hillside and splashed into the stream a heavy wind seemed to suage the branches of the funereal pines and then the silence fell again heavier deadlier than ever  when the last echo had died away the master felt his companions hand relax its grasp taking advantage of this outward expression of tractability he drew her gently with him until they reached the hotel whichin her newer aspect of a guest whose board was secured by responsible partieshad forgivingly opened its hospitable doors to the vagrant child here the master lingered a moment to assure her that she might count upon his assistance tomorrow and having satisfied his conscience by this anticipated duty bade her good night in the darkness of the roadgoing astray several times on his way home and narrowly escaping the yawning ditches in the trailhe had  reason to commend his foresight in dissuading mliss from a further search that night and in this pleasant reflection went to hed and slept soundly  for some hours after a darkness thick and heavy brooded over the settlement the sombre pines encompassing the village seemed to close threateningly about it as if to reclaim the wilderness that had been wrested from them a low rustling as of dead leaves and the damp breath of forest odors filled the lonely street emboldened by the darkness other shadows slipped by leaving strange footprints in the moist ditches for people to point at next day until the moon round and full was lifted above the crest of the opposite hill and all was magically changed  the shadows shrank away leaving the straggling street sleeping in a beauty it never knew by day all that was unlovely harsh and repulsive in its jagged outlines was subdued and softened by that uncertain light it smoothed the rough furrows and unsightly chasms of the mountain with an ineffable love and tenderness it fell upon the face of the sleeping mliss and left a tear glittering on her black lashes and a smile on her lip which would have been rare to her at any other time and fell also on the white upturned face of old smith with a pistol in his hand and a bullet in his heart lying dead beside his empty pocket     chapter ii  which contains a dream of the just aristides   the opinion which mcsnagley expressed in reference to a change of heart as experienced by mliss was more forcibly described in the gulches and tunnels it was thought there that mliss had struck a good lead and when there was a new grave added to the little inclosure andat the  expense of the mastera little board and inscription put above it the red mountain banner came out quite handsomely and did the correct thing for the memory of one of our oldest pioneers alluding gracefully to that bane of noble intellects touching slightly on the vicissitudes of fortune and otherwise assisting our dear brother into genteel obscurity he leaves an only child to mourn his loss said the banner who is now an exemplary scholar thanks to the efforts of the rev j mcsnagley that reverend gentleman in fact made a strong point of mlisss conversion and indirectly attributing to her former bad conduct the suicide of her father made affecting allusions in sunday school to the beneficial effects of the silent tomb and in that cheerful contemplation froze most of the children into speechless horror and caused the faircomplexioned scions of the first families to howl dismally and refuse to be comforted  of the homes that were offered to mliss when her conversion became known the master had preferred that of mrs morpher a womanly and kindhearted specimen of southwestern efflorescence known in her maidenhood as the perrarie rose by a steady system of struggle and selfsacrifice she had at last subjugated her naturally careless disposition to principles of order which as a pious woman she considered with pope as heavens first law but she could not entirely govern the orbits of her satellites however regular her own movements and her old nature asserted itself in her children lycurgus dipped in the cupboard between meals and aristides came home from school without shoes leaving those important articles at the threshold for the delights of a barefooted walk down the ditches octavia and cassandra were keerless of their clothes so that with but one exception however the prairie rose might have trimmed pruned and trained her own natural luxuriance  the little shoots came up defiantly wild and straggling that one exception was clytemnestra morpher aged fifteen she was the realization of her mothers most extravagant dream i stay my hand with difficulty at this moment for i long to describe this model of deportment but the progress of my story just at present supplants clytemnestra in the larger prominence it gives to another member of the familythe just aristides  the long dry summer had come as each fierce day seemed to burn itself out in little whiffs of pearl gray smoke on the mountain summits and as the upspringing breeze scattered what might have been its red embers over the landscape the green wave which in early spring had upheaved above smiths grave grew sere and dry and hard in those days the master strolling in the little churchyard of a sabbath afternoon was sometimes surprised to find a few wild flowers plucked from the damp pine forest scattered there and oftener rude wreaths hung upon the little pine cross most of these wreaths were formed of a sweetscented grass which the children loved to keep in their desks entwined with the pomponlike plumes of the buckeye and syringa the wood anemone and here and there the master noticed the dark blue cowl of the monkshood or deadly aconite one day during a walk in crossing a wooded ridge he came upon mliss in the heart of the forest perched upon a prostrate pine on a fantastic throne formed by the hanging plumes of lifeless branches her lap full of grasses and pine burrs and crooning to the just aristides who sat humbly at her feet one of the negro melodies of her younger life it was perhaps the influence of the season or the memory of this sylvan enjoyment which caused aristides one midsummer day to have a singular vision  the just aristides had begun that morning with a serious error loitering on his way to school occasionally  stopping to inspect the footprints of probable bears or indulging in cheerful badinage with the tunnel mento whom the apparition of a shortlegged boy weighed down by a preternaturally large satchel was an object of boisterous solicitudearistides suddenly found that he was an hour and a half too late for school whether this circumstance was purely accidental or not is a question of some uncertainty for aristides on finding himself occupying this criminal position at once resolved to play truant i shall not stop to inquire by what system of logic this result presented itself to that just youth as a consistent deduction or whether some indistinct apprehension of another and a better world beyond the settlement where there were no schools and blackberries were plenty had not influenced him in taking this fatal step enough that he entered on his rash career by instantly eating the dinner which he carried with him and having propitiated that terrible god whose seat is every small boys stomach with a feeling of inexpressible guiltiness creeping over him he turned his back upon the schoolhouse and ran into the woods  away from the glare of the red road how deliciously cool was the damp breath and twilight dimness of the stately pines how they seemed to welcome him in their deepest recesses ranging themselves silently around him as he ran shutting out the world and its schoolhouses and the pursuit of indignant parents and vindictive teachers how in the forest depths the blue jay called to him mockingly and the kingbird spreading his tail like a crimson pennant beckoned him onward how there was recognition and greeting even in the squirrel that scampered past him mischievously whisking his ridiculous tail within an inch of his outstretched fingers and how aristides at last flinging away hat shoes and satchel uttered a shrill whoop and dashed forward like a youthful savage but are not these  things written in the dogseared pages of every boys memory even though they seemed afterward to the just aristides a part and parcel of his own strange vision  yet even such delights had their hour of culmination and aristides found himself at high noon back on the road again in a state of feverish excitement carrying a ravished jays nest two pine cones a dead hare and a plume of the white syringa somewhat overpowered by the weight of these trophies which he had collected in the vague belief that they would be of future service to him he began to look about for some convenient place to bestow his booty it was nearly time for the great wingdam stage to go by and when it came at last with a sharp rattle of wheels and prancing of horses and a red pillar of dust hanging over it that partook of both the fiery and cloudy attributes of the israelitish sign aristides exchanged epithets with the driver and although standing kneedeep in red dust felt a thrill of joy in the recognition which no future honor or dignity might ever give him  retracing his steps the truant presently came to a semicircular opening in the side of red mountain which inclosed like the walls of some vast amphitheatre what had been the arena of the early struggles of the gladiators of fortune there were terrible traces of that struggle stillin the rock blasted by firein the bank furrowed by waterand in the debris of red mountain scattered along the gulch two miles in extent their forgotten engines were lying half buried in the ditchesthe primeval structure which had served them for a banking house was roofless and held the hoards of fieldmice and squirrels the unshapely stumps of ancient pines dotted the ground and aristides remembered that under the solitary redwood which of all its brothers remained still standing one of those early pioneers lay buried no wonder that as the gentle breeze of that summer day swept through its branches the just aristides might have heard as part of his wonderful dream some echo of its far off brothers of lebanon saying since thou art fallen no feller has risen up against us  but the short legs of aristides were aching and he was getting thirsty there was a rough cavern close at hand and as most of these openings condensed their general dampness somewhere in quiet pools aristides turned into the first one when he had slaked his thirst he looked around him and recognized smiths pocket  it had undergone little change in the last two years the winter rains had detached those portions of the wall which were not upheld by decaying timbers it was certainly a dirty pocketa pocket filled with rubbisha shabby pocketa wornout and ragged pocket it was so unpromising in its present exterior so graphic in its story of misfortune and so terrible in its recent memories that the most sanguine prospector would have passed it by as though the hopeless sentence of dante had been written over its ragged portal  the active mind of aristides however saw in the lurking shadows of its arches much promise as a future playroom to which he intended to induct hereafter his classical brother lycurgus in this reflection he threw himself on the ground and luxuriously burying his bare feet in the cool loose soil gave himself up to serene meditation but the heat and exertion were beginning to exert a certain influence over him and once or twice his eyes closed the water rippled beside him with a sleepy sound the sunlight on the hill without made him wink the longdrawn cawing of a crow on the opposite hillside and the buzzing of a bluebottle fly who had sought retreat in the cavern had a like effect and he felt himself falling asleep how long he slept or if he slept at all he could not remember for he started suddenly and listening a moment sprang to his feet    the low heavy blows of a pick came deadened and muffled from the extremity of the cavern  at first a terrible fear took possession of him for an instant the white rigid face of smith as he had seen it on the day of the inquest when an irresistible curiosity led him to creep into the room where the dead man was lyingfor an instant only this fearful remembrance seemed to rise before him out of the gloom of the pit the terror passed away  ghosts were historically unknown to aristides and even had his imaginative faculty been more prominent the education of smiths pocket was not of a kind to foster such weaknesses except a twinge of conscience a momentary  recollection of the evil that comes to bad boys through the severe pages of sundayschool bookswith this exception aristides was not long in recovering his selfpossession he did not run away for his curiosity was excited the same instinct which prompted an examination of beartracks gave a fascination to the situation and a nervous energy to his frame  the regular blows of the pick still resounded through the cavern he crept cautiously to the deepest recesses of the pocket and held his breath and listened the sound seemed to come from the bowels of the mountain there was no sign of opening or ingress an impenetrable veil of quartz was between him and the mysterious laborer he was creeping back between the displaced rafters when a light glanced suddenly in his face and flashed on the wet roof above him looking fearfully down aristides beheld between the interstices of the rafters which formed a temporary flooring that there was another opening below and in that opening a man was working in the queer fantasy of aristidess dream it took the aspect of a second pocket and a duplicate smith  he had no time to utter his astonishment for at that  moment an ominous rattling of loose soil upon his back made him look up and he had barely time to spring away before a greater portion of the roof of smiths pocket loosened by the displacement of its supports in his search fell heavily to the ground but in the fall a longhandled shovel which had been hidden somewhere in the crevices of the rock above came rattling down with it and seizing this as a trophy aristides emerged from smiths pocket at a rate of speed which seemed singularly disproportionate with his short legs and round stomach  when he reached the road the sun was setting inspecting his prize by that poetic light he found that the shovel was a new one and bore neither mark of use nor exposure shouldering it again with the intention of presenting it as a peaceoffering to propitiate the just wrath of his parents aristides had gone but a few rods when an unexpected circumstance occurred which dashed his fond hope and to the conscientious child seemed the shadow of an inevitable nemesis at the curve of the road as the settlement of smiths pocket came into view with its straggling street and its church spire that seemed a tongue of flame in the setting sun a broadshouldered figure sprang apparently from out of the bank and stood in the path of that infelix infant  where are you going with that shovel you young devil  aristides looked up and saw that his interlocutor was a man of powerful figure whose face though partially concealed by a red handkerchief even in that uncertain light was not prepossessing children are quick physiognomists and aristides feeling the presence of evil from the depths of his mighty little soul then and there took issue with the giant  where are you going with that shovel dn you do you hear said he of the red handkerchief impatiently  home said aristides stoutly  home eh said the stranger sneeringly and where did you steal it you young thief  the morpher stock not being of a kind to receive opprobrious epithets meekly aristides slowly and with an evident effort lifted the shovel in a menacing attitude  a single step was all that separated six feet of strength from three feet of valor the stranger eyed aristides with an expression of surly amazement and hesitated the elephant quailed before the gadfly as that precocious infant waved the threatening shovel his youthful lips slowly fashioned this tremendous sentence  you let me pass and i wont hit you  and here i must pause i would that for the sake of poetry i could leave my hero bathed in that heroic light erect and menacing but alas in this practical world of ours the battle is too often to the strong and i hasten over the humiliating spectacle of aristides spanked cuffed and kicked and pick him from the ditch into which he was at last ignominiously tossed a defeated but still struggling warrior and so bring him as the night closes charitably around him in contrite tears and muddy garments to his fathers door  when the master stopped at mrs morphers to inquire after his errant pupil that night he found aristides in bed smelling strongly of soap and water and sinking into a feverish sleep as he muttered from time to time some incoherent sentence tossing restlessly in his cot the master turned to those about him and asked what it was he said  it was nothing aristides had been dreaming and that was his dream  that was all yet a dream that foreshadowed a slowcoming but unerring justice that should give the little dreamer in after years some credit to the title of aristides the just    chapter iii  under the greenwood tree   it was an amiable weakness of mrs morpher to imagine that of all her classical progeny clytemnestra was particularly the model for mliss following this fallacy she threw clytie at the head of mliss when she was bad and set her up before the child for adoration in her penitential moments it was not therefore surprising to the master to hear that clytie was coming to school obviously as a favor to the master and as an example for mliss and others for clytie was quite a young lady inheriting her mothers physical peculiarities and in obedience to the climatic laws of the red mountain region she was an early bloomer the youth of smiths pocket to whom this kind of flower was rare sighed for her in april and languished in may enamored swains haunted the schoolhouse at the hour of dismissal a few were jealous of the master  perhaps it was this latter circumstance that opened the masters eyes to another he could not help noticing that clytie was romantic that in school she required a great deal of attention that her pens were uniformly bad and wanted fixing that she usually accompanied the request with a certain expectation in her eye that was somewhat disproportionate to the quality of service she verbally required that she sometimes allowed the curves of a round plump white arm to rest on his when he was writing her copies that she always blushed and flung back her blond curls when she did so i dont remember whether i have stated that the master was a young manits of little consequence however he had been severely educated in the school in which clytie was taking her first lesson and on the whole withstood the flexible curves and facetious  glance like the fine young spartan that he was perhaps an insufficient quality of food may have tended to this asceticism he generally avoided clytie but one evening when she returned to the schoolhouse after something she had forgottenand did not find it until the master walked home with heri hear that he endeavored to make himself particularly agreeable partly from the fact i imagine that his conduct was adding gall and bitterness to the already overcharged hearts of clytemnestras admirers  the morning after this affecting episode mliss did not come to school noon came but not mliss questioning clytie on the subject it appeared that they had left for school together but the willful mliss had taken another road the afternoon brought her not in the evening he called on mrs morpher whose motherly heart was really alarmed mr morpher had spent all day in search of her without discovering a trace that might lead to her discovery aristides was summoned as a probable accomplice but that equitable infant succeeding in impressing the household with his innocence mrs morpher entertained a vivid impression that the child would yet be found drowned in a ditch orwhat was almost as terriblemuddyed and soiled beyond the redemption of soap and water sick at heart the master returned to the schoolhouse as he lit his lamp and seated himself at his desk he found a note lying before him addressed to himself in mlisss handwriting it seemed to be written on a leaf torn from some old memorandumbook and to prevent sacrilegious trifling had been sealed with six broken wafers  opening it almost tenderly the master read as follows  respected sir when you read this i am run away never to come back never never never you can give my beeds to mary jennings and my amerikas pride a highly colored lithograph from a tobacco box to sally  flanders but dont you give anything to clytie morper dont you dair to do you know what my opinnion is of her it is this she is perfekly disgustin that is all and no more at present from melissa smith  the master mused for some time over this characteristic epistle as he was mechanically refolding it his eye caught a sentence written on the back in pencil in another handwriting somewhat blurred and indistinct from the heavy incisive strokes of mlisss pen on the other side it seemed to be a memorandum belonging to the book from which the leaf was originally torn  july 17th 5 hours in driftdipping westtook out 20 oz cleaned up 40 oz memsaw m s  july 17th said the master opening his desk and taking out a file of the red mountain banner july 17th he repeated running over the pages till he came to a paragraph headed distressing suicide july 17thwhy thats the day smith killed himself thats funny  in a strict etymological sense there was nothing so very ludicrous in this coincidence nor did the masters face betray any expression of the kind perhaps the epithet was chosen to conceal the vague uneasiness which it produced in his mind we are all of us more affected by these coincidences than we care to confess to one another if the most matteroffact reader of these pages were to find a hearse standing in front of his door for three consecutive mornings although the circumstance might be satisfactorily explainedshall i go further and say because the circumstance might be satisfactorily explainedhe would vaguely wish it hadnt happened philosophize as we may the simple  fact of two remote lines crossing each other always seems to us of tremendous significance and quite overshadows the more important truth that the real parallels of lifes journey are the lines that never meet it will do us good to remember these things and look more kindly on our brothers of borrioboolagha and their fetich superstitions when we drop our silver in the missionary box next sabbath  i wonder where that memorandum came from said the master as he rose at last and buttoned up his coat who is m s m s stands for manuscript and melissa smith why dontbut checking an impulsive query as to why people dont make their private memoranda generally intelligible the master put the letter in his pocket and went home  at sunrise the next morning he was picking his way through the palm like fern and thick underbrush of the pine forest starting the hare from its form and awakening a querulous protest from a few dissipated crows who had evidently been making a night of it and so came to the wooded ridge where he had once found mliss there he found the prostrate pine and tessellated branches but the throne was vacant as he drew nearer what might have been some frightened animal started through the crackling limbs it ran up the tossed arms of the fallen monarch and sheltered itself in some friendly foliage the master reaching the old seat found the nest still warm looking up in the intertwining branches he met the black eyes of the errant mliss they gazed at each other without speaking she was first to break the silence  what do you want she asked curtly  the master had decided on a course of action i want some crab apples he said humbly  shant have em go away why dont you get em of clytemnerestera it seemed to be a relief to mliss to express her contempt in additional syllables to that classical young womans  already long drawn title oh you wicked thing  i am hungry lissy i have eaten nothing since dinner yesterday i am famished and the young man in a state of remarkable exhaustion leaned against the tree  melissas heart was touched in the bitter days of her gypsy life she had known the sensation he so artfully simulated overcome by his heartbroken tone but not entirely divested of suspicion she said  dig under the tree near the roots and you ll find lots but mind you dont tell for mliss had her hoards as well as the rats and squirrels  but the master of course was unable to find them the effects of hunger probably blinding his senses mliss grew uneasy at length she peered at him through the leaves in an elfish way and questioned  if i come down and give you some youll promise you wont touch me  the master promised  hope youll die if you do  the master accepted instant dissolution as a forfeit mliss slid down the tree the duties of hospitality fulfilled she seated herself at a little distance and eyed the master with extreme caution  why didnt you eat your breakfast you bad man  because ive run away  where to said mliss her eyes twinkling  anywhereanywhere away from here responded that deceitful wretch with tragic wildness of demeanor  what made youbad boy said mliss with a sudden respect of conventionalities and a rare touch of tenderness in her tones youd better go back where your vittals are  what are victuals to a wounded spirit asked the young man dramatically he had reached the side of  mliss during this dialogue and had taken her unresisting hand he was too wise to notice his victory however and drawing melissas note from his pocket opened it before her  couldnt you find any paper in the schoolhouse without tearing a leaf out of my memorandum book melissa he asked  it aint out of your memorandum book responded mliss fiercely  indeed said the master turning to the lines in pencil i thought it was my handwriting  mliss who had been looking over his shoulder suddenly seized the paper and snatched it out of his hand  its fathers writing she said after a pause in a softer tone  where did you get it mliss  aristides gave it to me  where did he get it  dont know he had the book in his pocket when i told him i was going to write to you and he tore the leaf out there nowdont bother me any more mliss had turned her face away and the black hair had hid her downcast eyes  something in her gesture and expression reminded him of her father something and more that was characteristic to her at such moments made him fancy another resemblance and caused him to ask impulsively and less cautiously than was his wont  do you remember your mother mliss  no  did you never see her  nodidnt i tell you not to bother and youre agoin and doin it said mliss savagely  the master was silent a moment did you ever think you would like to have a mother mliss he asked again  noooo  the master rose mliss looked up  does aristides come to school today  i dont know  are you going back youd better she said  wellperhaps i may goodby  he had proceeded a few steps when as he expected she called him back he turned she was standing by the tree with tears glistening in her eyes the master felt the right moment had come going up to her he took both her hands in his and looking in her tearful eyes said gravely  mliss do you remember the first evening you came to  see me  mliss remembered  you asked me if you might come to school and i said  come responded the child softly  if i told you i was lonely without my little scholar and that i wanted her to come what would you say  the child hung her head in silence the master waited patiently tempted by the quiet a hare ran close to the couple and raising her bright eyes and velvet fore paws gazed at them fearlessly a squirrel ran halfway down the furrowed bark of the fallen tree and there stopped  we are waiting lissy said the master in a whisper and the child smiled stirred by a passing breeze the treetops rocked and a slanting sunbeam stole through their interlaced boughs and fell on the doubting face and irresolute little figure but a step in the dry branches and a rustling in the underbrush broke the spell  a man dressed as a miner carrying a longhandled shovel came slowly through the woods a red handkerchief tied around his head under his hat with the loose ends hanging from beneath did not add much favor to his  unprepossessing face he did not perceive the master and mliss until he was close upon them when he did he stopped suddenly and gazed at them with an expression of lowering distrust mliss drew nearer to the master  goodmorninpicknickin eh he asked with an attempt at geniality that was more repulsive than his natural manner  how are youprospecting eh said the master quietly after the established colloquial formula of red mountain  yesa little in that way  the stranger still hesitated apparently waiting for them to go first a matter which mliss decided by suddenly taking the masters hand in her quick way what she said was scarcely audible but the master parting her hair over her forehead kissed her and so hand in hand they passed out of the damp aisles and forest odors into the open sunlit road but mliss looking back saw that her old seat was occupied by the hopeful prospector and fancied that in the shadows of her former throne something of a gratified leer overspread his face hell have to dig deep to find the crab apples said the child to the master as they came to the red mountain road  when aristides came to school that day he was confronted by mliss but neither threats nor entreaties could extract from that reticent youth the whereabout of the memorandum book nor where he got it two or three days afterward during recess he approached mliss and beckoned her one side  well said mliss impatiently  did you ever read the story of ali baba  yes  do you believe it  no  well said that sage infant wheeling around on his stout legs its true     chapter iv  which has a good moral tendency   somewhat less spiteful in her intercourse with the other scholars mliss still retained an offensive attitude toward clytemnestra perhaps the jealous element was not entirely stilled in her passionate little breast perhaps it was that clytemnestras round curves and plump outlines afforded an extensive pinching surface but while these ebullitions were under the masters control her enmity occasionally took a new and  irresponsible form  in his first estimate of the childs character he could not conceive that she had ever possessed a doll but the master like many other professed readers of character was safer in a posteriori than a priori reasoning for mliss had a doll but then it was a peculiar dolla frightful perversion of wax and sawdusta doll fearfully and wonderfully madea smaller edition of mliss its unhappy existence had been a secret discovered accidentally by mrs morpher it had been the oldtime companion of mlisss wanderings and bore evident marks of suffering its original complexion was long since washed away by the weather and anointed by the slime of ditches it looked very much as mliss had in days past its one gown of faded stuff was dirty and ragged as hers had been mliss had never been known to apply to it any childish term of endearment she never exhibited it in the presence of other children it was put severely to bed in a hollow tree near the schoolhouse and only allowed exercise during mlisss rambles fulfilling a stern duty to her dollas she would to herselfit knew no luxuries  now mrs morpher obeying a commendable impulse bought another doll and gave it to mliss the child received it gravely and  curiously the master on looking at it one day fancied he saw a slight resemblance in its round red cheeks and mild blue eyes to clytemnestra it became evident before long that mliss had also noticed the same resemblance accordingly she hammered its waxen head on the rocks when she was alone and sometimes dragged it with a string round its neck to and from school at other times setting it up on her desk she made a pincushion of its patient and inoffensive body whether this was done in revenge of what she considered a second figurative obtrusion of clyties excellencies upon her or whether she had an intuitive appreciation of the rites of certain other heathens and indulging in that fetich ceremony imagined that the original of her wax model would pine away and finally die is a metaphysical question i shall not now consider  in spite of these moral vagaries the master could not help noticing in her different tasks the workings of a quick restless and vigorous perception she knew neither the hesitancy nor the doubts of childhood her answers in class were always slightly dashed with audacity of course she was not infallible but her courage and daring in venturing beyond her own depth and that of the floundering little swimmers around her in their minds outweighed all errors of judgment children are no better than grown people in this respect i fancy and whenever the little red hand flashed above her desk there was a wondering silence and even the master was sometimes oppressed with a doubt of his own experience and judgment  nevertheless certain attributes which at first amused and entertained his fancy began to affect him with grave doubts he could not but see that mliss was revengeful irreverent and willful but there was one better quality which pertained to her semisavage dispositionthe faculty of physical fortitude and selfsacrifice and  anotherthough not always an attribute of the noble savagetruth mliss was both fearless and sincereperhaps  in such a character the adjectives were synonymous  the master had been doing some hard thinking on this subject and had arrived at that conclusion quite common to all who think sincerely that he was generally the slave of his own prejudices when he determined to call on the rev mr mcsnagley for advice this decision was somewhat humiliating to his pride as he and mcsnagley were not friends but he thought of mliss and the evening of their first meeting and perhaps with a pardonable superstition that it was not chance alone that had guided her willful feet to the schoolhouse and perhaps with a complacent consciousness of the rare magnanimity of the act he choked back his dislike and went to mcsnagley  the reverend gentleman was glad to see him moreover he observed that the master was looking peartish and hoped he had got over the neuralgy and rheumatiz he himself had been troubled with a dumb ager since last conference but he had learned to rastle and pray  pausing a moment to enable the master to write this certain method of curing the dumb ager upon the book and volume of his brain mr mcsnagley proceeded to inquire after sister morpher she is an adornment to christewanity and has a likely growin young family added mr mcsnagley and there is that mannerly young galso well behavedmiss clytie in fact clyties perfections seemed to affect him to such an extent that he dwelt for several minutes upon them the master was doubly embarrassed in the first place there was an enforced contrast with poor mliss in all this praise of clytie secondly there was something unpleasantly confidential in his tone of speaking of morphers earliest born so that  the master after a few futile efforts to say something natural found it convenient to recall another engagement and left without asking the information required but in his after reflections somewhat unjustly giving the rev mr mcsnagley the full benefit of having refused it  but the master obtained the advice in another and unexpected direction  the resident physician of smiths pocket was a dr duchesne or as he was better known to the locality dr doochesny of a naturally refined nature and liberal education he had steadily resisted the aggressions and temptations of smiths pocket and represented to the master a kind of connecting link between his present life and the past so that an intimacy sprang up between the two men involving prolonged interviews in the doctors little back shop often to the exclusion of other suffering humanity and their physical ailments it was in one of these interviews that the master mentioned the coincidence of the date of the memoranda on the back of mlisss letter and the day of smiths suicide  if it were smiths own handwriting as the child says it is said the master it shows a queer state of mind that could contemplate suicide and indite private memoranda within the same twentyfour hours  dr duchesne removed his cigar from his lips and looked attentively at his friend  the only hypothesis continued the master is that smith was either drunk or crazy and the fatal act was in a measure unpremeditated  every man who commits suicide returned the doctor gravely is in my opinion insane or what is nearly the same thing becomes through suffering an irresponsible agent in my professional experience i have seen most of the forms of mental and physical agony and know what sacrifices men will make to preserve even an existence that  to me seemed little better than death so long as their intellect remained unclouded when you come to reflect on the state of mind that chooses death as a preferable alternative you generally find an exaltation and enthusiasm that differs very little from the ordinary diagnosis of delirium smith was not drunk added the doctor in his usual careless tone i saw his body  the master remained buried in reflection presently the doctor removed his cigar  perhaps i might help you to explain the coincidence you speak of  how  very easily but this is a professional secret you understand  yes i understand said the master hastily with an illdefined uneasiness creeping over him  do you know anything of the phenomena of death by gunshot wounds  no  then you must take certain facts as granted smith you remember was killed instantly the nature of his wound and the manner of his death were such as would have caused an instantaneous and complete relaxation of all the muscles rigidity and contraction would have supervened of course but only after life was extinct and consciousness fled now smith was found with his hand tightly grasping a pistol  well  well my dear boy he must have grasped it after he was dead or have prevailed on some friend to stiffen his fingers round it  do you mean that he was murdered  dr duchesne rose and closed the door we have different names for these things in smiths pocket i mean to say that he didnt kill himselfthats all   but doctor said the master earnestly do you think you have done right in concealing this fact do you think it justdo you think it consistent with your duty to his orphan child  thats why i have said nothing about it replied the doctor coolly because of my consideration for his orphan child  the master breathed quickly and stared at the doctor  doctor you dont think that mliss  hushdont get excited my young friend remember i am not a lawyeronly a doctor  but mliss was with me the very night he must have been killed we were walking together when we heard the reportthat isa report which must have been the onestammered the master  when was that  at half past eleven i remember looking at my watch  humphwhen did you meet her first  at half past eight come doctor you have made a mistake here at least said the young man with an assumption of ease he was far from feeling give mliss the benefit of the doubt  dr duchesne replied by opening a drawer of his desk after rummaging among the powders and mysterious looking instruments with which it was stored he finally brought forth a longitudinal slip of folded white paper it was appropriately labeled poison  look here said the doctor opening the paper it contained two or three black coarse hairs do you know them  no  look again  it looks something like melissas hair said the master with a fathomless sinking of the heart  when i was called to look at the body continued the  doctor with the deliberate cautiousness of a professional diagnosis my suspicions were aroused by the circumstance i told you of i managed to get possession of the pistol and found these hairs twisted around the lock as though they had been accidentally caught and violently disentangled i dont think that any one else saw them i removed them without observation andthey are at your service  the master sank back in his seat and pressed his hand to his forehead the image of mliss rose before him with flashing eye and long black hair and seemed to beat down and resist defiantly the suspicion that crept slowly over his heart  i forbore to tell you this my friend continued the doctor slowly and gravely because when i learned that you had taken this strange child under your protection i did not wish to tell you that which though i contend does not alter her claims to mans sympathy and kindnessstill might have prejudiced her in your eyes her improvement under your care has proven my position correct i have as you know peculiar ideas of the extent to which humanity is responsible i find in my heartlooking back over that childs careerno sentiment but pity i am mistaken in you if i thought this circumstance aroused any other feeling in yours  still the figure of mliss stood before the master as he bent before the doctors words in the same defiant attitude with something of scorn in the great dark eyes that made the blood tingle in his cheeks and seemed to make the reasoning of the speaker but meaningless and empty words at length he rose as he stood with his hand on the latch he turned to dr duchesne who was watching him with careful solicitude  i dont know but that you have done well to keep this from me at all events it has notcannot and should not alter my opinion toward mliss you will of course keep it a secret in the mean time you must not blame me if i cling to my instincts in preference to your judgment i still believe that you are mistaken in regard to her  stay one moment said the doctor promise me you will not say anything of this nor attempt to prosecute the matter further till you have consulted with me  i promise goodnight  goodnight and so they parted  true to that promise and his own instinctive promptings the master endeavored to atone for his momentary disloyalty by greater solicitude for mliss but the child had noticed some change in the masters thoughtful manner and in one of their long postprandial walks she stopped suddenly and mounting a stump looked full in his face with big searching eyes  you aint mad said she with an interrogative shake of the black braids  no  nor bothered  no  nor hungry hunger was to mliss a sickness that might attack a person at any moment  no  nor thinking of her  of whom lissy  that white girl this was the latest epithet invented by mliss who was a very dark brunette to express clytemnestra  no  upon your word a substitute for hope you ll die proposed by the master  yes  and sacred honor  yes  then mliss gave him a fierce little kiss and hopping down fluttered off for two or three days after that she condescended to appear like other children and be as she expressed it good  when the summer was about spent and the last harvest had been gathered in the valleys the master bethought him of gathering in a few ripened shoots of the young idea and of having his harvest home or examination so the savans and professionals of smiths pocket were gathered to witness that timehonored custom of placing timid children in a constrained position and bullying them as in a witnessbox as usual in such cases the most audacious and selfpossessed were the lucky recipients of the honors the reader will imagine that in the present instance mliss and clytie were preeminent and divided public attention mliss with her clearness of material perception and self reliance and clytie with her placid selfesteem and saintlike correctness of deportment the other little ones were timid and blundering mlisss readiness and brilliancy of course captivated the greatest number and provoked the greatest applause and mlisss antecedents had unconsciously awakened the strongest sympathies of the miners whose athletic forms were ranged against the walls or whose handsome bearded faces looked in at the window but mlisss popularity was overthrown by an unexpected circumstance  mcsnagley had invited himself and had been going through the pleasing entertainment of frightening the more timid pupils by the vaguest and most ambiguous questions delivered in an impressive funereal tone and mliss had soared into astronomy and was tracking the course of our spotted ball through space and defining the tethered orbits of the planets when mcsnagley deliberately arose  meelissy ye were speaking of the revolutions of this yer yearth and its movements with regard to the sun and i think you said it had been adoin of it since the creation eh  mliss nodded a scornful affirmative  well was that the truth said mcsnagley folding his arms  yes said mliss shutting up her little red lips tightly  the handsome outlines at the windows peered further into the schoolroom and a saintly raphaellike face with blond beard and soft blue eyes belonging to the biggest scamp in the diggings turned toward the child and whispered  stick to it mliss its only a big bluff of the parson  the reverend gentleman heaved a deep sigh and cast a compassionate glance at the master then at the children and then rested his eye on clytemnestra that young woman softly elevated her round white arm its seductive curves were enhanced by a gorgeous and massive specimen bracelet the gift of one of her humblest worshipers worn in honor of the occasion there was a momentary pause clyties round cheeks were very pink and soft clyties big eyes were very bright and blue clyties lownecked white bookmuslin rested softly on clyties white plump shoulders clytie looked at the master and the master nodded then clytie spoke softly  joshua commanded the sun to stand still and it obeyed him  there was a low hum of applause in the schoolroom a triumphant expression on mcsnagleys face a grave shadow on the masters and a comical look of disappointment reflected from the windows mliss skimmed rapidly over her astronomy and then shut the book with a loud snap a groan burst from mcsnagley an expression of astonishment from the schoolroom and a yell from the windows as mliss brought her red fist down on the desk with the emphatic declaration  its a dn lie i dont believe it     chapter v  open sesame   the long wet season had drawn near its close signs of spring were visible in the swelling buds and rushing torrents the pine forests exhaled a fresher spicery the azaleas were already budding the ceanothus getting ready its lilac livery for spring on the green upland which climbed the red mountain at its southern aspect the long spike of the monkshood shot up from its broadleaved stool and once more shook its dark blue bells again the billow above smiths grave was soft and green its crest just tossed with the foam of daisies and buttercups the little graveyard had gathered a few new dwellers in the past year and the mounds were placed two by two by the little paling until they reached smiths grave and there there was but one general superstition had shunned the enforced companionship the plot beside smith was vacant  it was the custom of the driver of the great wingdam stage to whip up his horses at the foot of the hill and soenter smiths pocket  at that remarkable pace which the woodcuts in the hotel barroom represented to credulous humanity as the usual rate of speed of that conveyance at least aristides morpher thought so as he stood one sunday afternoon uneasily conscious of his best jacket and collar waiting its approach nor could anything shake his belief that regularly on that occasion the horses ran away with the driver and that that individual from motives of deep policy pretended not to notice it until they were stopped  anybody up from below bill said the landlord as the driver slowly descended from his perch  nobody for you responded bill shortly dusenberry kem up as usual and got  off at the old place you cant make a livin off him i reckon  have you found out what his name is yet continued the landlord implying that dusenberry was simply a playful epithet of the driver  he says his name is waters returned bill jake said he saw him at the north fork in 50called himself moore then guess he aint no good nowhow whats he doin round here  says hes prospectin replied the landlord he has a claim somewhere in the woods gambles a little too i reckon he dont travel on his beauty anyhow  if you had seen him makin up to a piece of calico inside last trip and she amakin up to him quite confidentiallike i guess youd think he was a ladykiller my eye but wasnt she a stunner clytie morpher wasnt nowhere to begin with her  who was she bill asked half a dozen masculine voices  dont know we picked her up this side of coyote fancy i tell youpretty little hat and pink ribbingseyes that ud bore you through at a hundred yardswhite teethbrown gaiters and such an ankle she didnt want to show itoh no added the sarcastic bill with deep significance  where did you leave her bill asked a gentle village swain who had been fired by the glowing picture of the fair unknown  thats whats the matter you see after we picked her up she said she was goin through to wingdam of course there wasnt anything in the stage or on the road too good to offer her old major spaffler wanted to treat her to lemonade at every station judge plunkett kep apullin down the blinds and ahistin of them up to keep out the sun and let in the air blest if old mcsnagley didnt want  to carry her travelinbag there wasnt any attention boys she didnt get but it wasnt no usebless you she never so much as passed the time of day with them  but where did she go inquired another anxious auditor  keep your foot off the drag and i ll tell you arter we left ring tail canon dusenberry as usual got on presently one of the outsides turned round to me and says he dd if ugly mug aint got the inside track of all of you this time i looked down and dern my skin if there wasnt dusenberry asittin up alongside of the lady quite comfortable as if they had ben children together at the next station dusenberry gets off so does the lady aint you goin on to wingdam says i no says she maynt we have the pleasure of your kempany further says the judge taking off his hat no ive changed my mind says she and off she got and off she walked arm in arm with him as cool as you please  wonder if that want the party that passed through here last july asked the blacksmith joining the loungers in front of the stage office waters brought up a buggy to get the axle bolted there was a woman setting in the buggy but the hood was drawn down and i didnt get to see her face during this conversation aristides after a long lingering glance at the stage had at last torn himself away from its fascinations and was now lounging down the long straggling street in a peculiarly dissipated manner with his hat pushed on the back part of his head his right hand and a greater portion of his right arm buried in his trousers pocket this might have been partly owing to the shortness of his legs and the comparative amplitude of his trousers which to the casual observer seemed to obviate the necessity of any other garment but when he reached the bottom of the street and further enlivened his progress by  whistling shrilly between his fingers and finally drew a fragment of a cigar from his pocket and placed it between his teeth it was evident that there was a moral as well as physical laxity in his conduct the near fact was that aristides had that afternoon evaded the sundayschool and was open to any kind of infant iniquity  the main street of smiths pocket gradually lost its civilized character and after one or two futile attempts at improvement at its lower extremity terminated impotently in a chaos of ditches races and trailings out of this again a narrow trail started along the mountain side and communicated with that vast amphitheatre which still exhibited the pioneer efforts of the early settlers it was this trail that aristides took that sunday afternoon and which he followed until he reached the hillside a few rods below the yawning fissure of smiths pocket after a careful examination of the vicinity he cleared away the underbrush beside a fallen pine that lay near and sat down in the attitude of patient and deliberate expectancy  five minutes passedten twentyand finally a halfhour was gone aristides threw away his cigar which he had lacked determination to light and peeled small slips from the inner bark of the pinetree and munched them gravely another five ten and twenty minutes passed and the sun began to drop below the opposite hillside another ten minutes and the whole of the amphitheatre above was in heavy shadow ten minutes more and the distant windows in the settlement flamed redly five minutes and the spire of the methodist church caught the glowand then the underbrush crackled  aristides looking up saw the trunk of the prostrate pine slowly lifting itself before him  a second glance showed the fearless and selfpossessed boy that the apparent phenomenon was simply and easily explained the tree had fallen midway and at right angles  across the trunk of another prostrate monarch so accurately and evenly was it balanced that the child was satisfied from a liberal experience of the application of these principles to the game of seesaw that a very slight impulse to either end was sufficient to destroy the equilibrium that impulse proceeded from his end of the tree as he saw when the uplifted trunk disclosed an opening in the ground beneath it and the head and shoulders of a man emerging therefrom  aristides threw himself noiselessly on his stomach the thick clump of an azalea hid him from view though it did not obstruct his survey of the stranger whom he at once recognized as his former enemythe man with the red handkerchiefthe hopeful prospector of red mountain and the hypothetical dusenberry of the stagedriver  the stranger looked cautiously round and aristides shrank close behind the friendly azalea  satisfied that he was unobserved the subterranean proprietor returned to the opening and descended reappearing with a worn black enameled travelingbag which he carried with difficulty this he again enveloped in a blanket and strapped tightly on his back and a long handled shovel brought up from the same mysterious storehouse completed his outfit as he stood for a moment leaning on the shovel it was the figure of the hopeful prospector in the heart of the forest a very slight effort was sufficient to replace the fallen tree in its former position raising the shovel to his shoulder he moved away brushing against the azalea bush which hid the breathless aristides the sound of his footsteps retreating through the crackling brush presently died out and a drowsy sabbath stillness succeeded  aristides rose there was a wonderful brightness in his gray eyes and a flush on his sunburned cheek seizing a root of the fallen pine he essayed to move it but it defied his endeavors aristides looked round  theres some trick about it but ill find it yet said that astute child breaking off the limb of a buckeye he extemporized a lever the first attempt failed the second succeeded and the long roots of the tree again ascended but as it required prolonged effort to keep the tree up before the impetus was lost aristides seized the opportunity to jump into the opening at the same moment the tree slowly returned to its former position  in the sudden change from the waning light to complete darkness aristides was for a moment confounded recovering himself he drew a match from his capacious pocket and striking it against the sole of his shoe by the upspringing flash perceived a candle stuck in the crevices of the rock beside him lighting it he glanced curiously around him he was at the entrance of a long gallery at the further extremity of which he could faintly see the glimmering of the outer daylight following this gallery cautiously he presently came to an antechamber and by the glimmering of the light above him at once saw that it was the same he had seen in his wonderful dream  the antechamber was about fourteen feet square with walls of decomposed quartz mingling with flaky mica that reflected here and there the gleam of aristidess candle with a singular brilliancy it did not need much observation on his part to determine the reason of the strangers lonely labors on a rough rocker beside him were two fragments of ore taken from the adjacent wall the smallest of which the two arms of aristides could barely clasp to his dazzled eyes they seemed to be almost entirely of pure gold the great strike of 56 at ring tail canon had brought to the wonderful vision of smiths pocket no such nuggets as were here  aristides turned to the wall again which had been apparently the last scene of the strangers labors and from  which the two masses of ore were taken even to his inexperienced eye it represented a wealth almost incalculable through the loose red soil everywhere glittering star points of the precious metal threw back the rays of his candle aristides turned pale and trembled  here was the realization of his most extravagant fancy ever since his strange dream and encounter with the stranger he had felt an irresistible desire to follow up his adventure and discover the secrets of the second cavern but when he had returned to smiths pocket a few days after the wreck of the fallen roof had blocked up that part of the opening from which he had caught sight of the hidden workman below during his visit he had picked up from among the rubbish the memorandum book which had supplied mliss with letter paper still haunting the locality after school hours he had noticed that regularly at sunset the man with the red handkerchief appeared in some mysterious way from the hillside below smiths pocket and went away in the direction of the settlement by careful watching aristides had fixed the location of his mysterious appearance to a point a few rods below the opening of smiths pocket flushed by this discovery he had been betrayed from his usual discretion so far as to intimate a hinting of the suspicion that possessed him in the few mysterious words he had whispered to mliss at school the accident we have described above determined the complete discovery of the secret  who was the stranger and why did he keep the fact of this immense wealth hidden from the world suppose he aristides were to tell wouldnt the schoolboys look up at him with interest as the hero and discoverer of this wonderful cavern and wouldnt the stagedriver feel proud of his acquaintance and offer him rides for nothing  why hadnt smith discovered itwho was poor and wanted money whom aristides had liked who was the father of  mliss for whom aristides confessed a secret passion who belonged to the settlement and helped to build it upinstead of the stranger had smith never a suspicion that gold was so near him and if so why had he killed himself but did smith kill himself and at this thought and its correlative fancy again the cheek of aristides blanched and the candle shook in his nerveless fingers  apart and distinct from these passing conjectures one idea remained firm and dominant in his mind the man with the red handkerchief had no right to this treasure the mysterious instinct which directed this judicial ruling of aristides had settled this fact as indubitably as though proven by the weight of the strongest testimony for an instant a wild thought sprang up in his heart and he seized the nearest mass of ore with the halfformed intention of bearing it directly to the feet of mliss as her just and due inheritance but aristides could not lift it and the idea passed out of his mind with the frustrated action  at the further end of the gallery a few blankets were lying and with some mining implements a kettle of water a few worn flannel shirts were the only articles which this subterranean habitation possessed in turning over one of the blankets aristides picked up a womans comb it was a tortoiseshell and bright with some fanciful ornamentation without a moments hesitation aristides pocketed it as the natural property of mliss a pocketbook containing a few old letters in the breast pocket of one of the blue shirts was transferred to that of aristides with the same coolness and sentiment of instinctive justice  aristides wisely reflected that these unimportant articles would excite no suspicion if found in his possession a fragment of the rock which if he had taken it as he felt impelled would have precipitated the discovery that aristides had decided to put off until he had perfected a certain plan    the light from the opening above had gradually faded and aristides knew that night had fallen to prevent suspicion he must return home he reentered the gallery and reached the opening of the egress one of the roots of the tree projected into the opening  he seized it and endeavored to lift it but in vain panting with exertion he again and again exerted the fullest power of his active sinews but the tree remained immovablethe opening remained sealed as firmly as with solomons signet raising his candle towards it aristides saw the reason of its resistance in his hurried ingress he had allowed the tree to revolve sufficiently to permit one of its roots to project into the opening which held it firmly down in the shock of the discovery the excitement which had sustained him gave way and with a hopeless cry the just aristides fell senseless on the floor of the gallery     chapter vi  the trials of mrs morpher   now where on earth can that child be said mrs morpher shading her eyes with her hand as she stood at the door of the mountain ranch looking down the wingdam road at sunset with his best things on too goodnesswhat were boys made for  mr morpher without replying to this question apparently addressed to himself as an adult representative of the wayward species appeared at the door and endeavored to pour oil on the troubled waters  oh hes all right sue dont fuss about him said mr morpher with an imbecile sense of conveying comfort in the emphasized pronoun hes down the gulch or in the tunnel or over to the claim hell turn up by bedtime dont you worry about him ill look him up in a minit and mr morpher taking his hat sauntered down the road in the direction of the national hotel  mrs mopher gazed doubtfully after her liege looking up aristides in her domestic experience implied a prolonged absence in the bar room of the hotel the tedium whereof was beguiled by sevenup or euchre but she only said dont be long james and sighed hopelessly as she turned back into the house  once again within her own castle walls mrs morpher dropped her look of patient suffering and glanced defiantly around for a fresh grievance  the decorous little parlor offered nothing to provoke the hostility of her peculiar instincts spotless were the white curtains the bright carpet guiltless of stain or dust the chairs were placed arithmetically in twos and added up evenly on the four sides with nothing to carry over two bunches of lavender and fennel breathed an odor of sanctified cleanliness through the room five daguerreotypes on the mantelpiece represented the morpher family in the progressive stages of petrifaction and had the medusalike effect of freezing visitors into similar attitudes in their chairs the walls were further enlivened with two colored engravings of scenes in the domestic history of george washington in which the father of his country seemed to look blandly from his own correct family circle into morphers and to breathe quite audibly from his gilt frame a dignified blessing  lingering a moment in this sacred inclosure to readjust the tablecloth mrs morpher passed into the diningroom where the correct crytie presided at the suppertable at which the rest of the family were seated mrs morphers quick eyes caught the spectacle of mliss with her chin resting on her hands and her elbows on the table sardonically surveying the model of deportment opposite to her  mliss  well  wheres your elbows  heres one and theres the other said mliss quietly indicating their respective localities by smartly tapping them with the palm of her hand  take them off the table instantly you bold forward girland you sir quit that giggling and eat your supper if you dont want to be put to bed without it added mrs morpher to lycurgus to whom mlisss answer had afforded boundless satisfaction youre getting to be just as bad as her and mercy knows you never were a seraphim  whats a seraphim mother and what do they do asked lycnrgus with growing interest  they dont ask questions when they should be eating their supper and thankful for it interposed clytie authoritatively as one to whom the genteel attributes and social habits of the seraphim had been a privileged revelation  but mother  hushand dont be a heathenrun and see who is coming in said mrs morpher as the sound of footsteps was heard in the passage  the door opened and mcsnagley entered  why bless my soulhow do you do said mrs morpher with genteel astonishment quite a stranger i declare  this was a polite fiction mliss knew the fact to be that mrs morpher was reputed to set the best table in smiths pocket and mcsnagley always called in on sunday evenings at supper to discuss the current gossip and nag mliss with selected texts the verbal mcsnagley as usual couldnt stop a momentand just dropped in in passin the actual mcsnagley deposited his hat in the corner and placed himself in the flesh on a chair by the table  and hows brother james and the fammerly  theyre all wellexcept risty hes off againas if my life werent already pestered out with one child and mrs morpher glanced significantly at mliss  ah well we all of us have our trials said mcsnagley ive been ailin again that ager must be in my bones still ive been rather onsettled myself today  there was the appearance of truth in this statement mr mcsnagleys voice had a hollow resonant sound and his eyes were nervous and fidgety he had an odd trick too of occasionally stopping in the middle of a sentence and listening as though he heard some distant sound these things which mrs morpher recalled afterwards did not in the undercurrent of uneasiness about aristides which she felt the whole of that evening so particularly attract her notice  i know something said lycurgus during one of these pauses from the retirement of his corner  if you dare tokerg said mliss  mliss says she knows where risty is but she wont tell said the lawgiver not heeding the warning the words were scarcely uttered before mlisss red hand flashed in the air and descended with a sounding box on the traitors ear lycurgus howled mrs morpher darted into the corner and mliss was dragged defiant and struggling to the light  oh you wicked wicked childwhy dont you say where if you know said mrs morpher shaking her as if the information were to be dislodged from some concealed part of her clothing  i didnt say i knew for sure at last responded mliss i said i thought i knew  well where do you think he is  but mliss was firm even the gloomy picture of the future state devised by mcsnagley could not alter her  determination mrs morpher who had a wholesome awe for this strange child at last had recourse to entreaty finally mliss offered a compromise  ill tell the master but i wont tell youpartikerly him said mliss indicating the parson with a bodkinlike dart of her forefinger  mrs morpher hesitated her maternal anxiety at length overcame her sense of dignity and discipline  who knows where the master is or where he is to be found tonight she asked hastily  hes over to dr duchesnes said clytie eagerly that is she stammered a rich color suddenly flushing from her temples to her round shoulders hes usually there in the evenings i mean  run over theres a dear and ask him to come here said mrs morpher without noticing a sudden irregularity of conduct in her firstborn run quick  clytie did not wait for a second command without availing herself of the proffered company of mcsnagley she hastily tied the strings of her school hat under her plump chin and slipped out of the house it was not far to the doctors office and clytie walked quickly overlooking in her haste and preoccupation the admiring glances which several of the swains of smiths pocket cast after her as she passed but on arriving at the doctors door so out of breath and excited was this usual model of deportment that on finding herself in the presence of the master and his friend she only stood in embarrassed silence and made up for her lack of verbal expression by a succession of eloquent blushes  let us look at her for a moment as she stands there her little straw hat trimmed with cherrycolored ribbons rests on the waves of her blonde hair there are other gay ribbons on her light summer dress clasping her round waist girdling her wrist and fastening her collar about her  white throat her large blue eyes are very dark and moist it may be with excitement or a tearful thought of the lost aristides or the tobacco smoke with which i regret to say the room is highly charged but certainly as she stands leaning against the doorway biting her moist scarlet lip and trying to pull down the broad brim of her hat over the surging waves of color that will beat rhythmically up to her cheeks and temples she is so dangerously pretty that i am glad for the masters sake he is the philosopher he has just described himself to his friend the doctor and that he prefers to study human physiology from the inner surfaces  when clytie had recovered herself sufficiently to state her message the master offered to accompany her back as clytie took his arm with some slight trepidation dr duchesne who had taken sharp notes of these febrile symptoms uttered a prolonged whistle and returned thoughtfully to his office  although clytie found the distance returning no further than the distance going with the exhaustion of her first journey it was natural that her homeward steps should be slower and that the master should regulate his pace to accommodate her it was natural too that her voice should be quite low and indistinct so that the master was obliged to bring his hat nearer the cherrycolored ribbons in the course of conversation it was also natural that he should offer the sensitive young girl such comfort as lay in tenderly modulated tones and playful epithets and if in the irregularities of the main street it was necessary to take clyties hand or to put his arm around her waist in helping her up declivities that the master saw no impropriety in the act was evident from the fact that he did not remove his arm when the difficulty was surmounted in this way clyties return occupied some moments more than her going and mrs morpher was waiting anxiously at the door when the young people arrived    as the master entered the rooom mliss called him to her bend down your head she said and ill whisper but mind now i dont say i know for truth where risty is i only reckon  the master bent down his head as usual in such cases everybody else felt constrained to listen and mcsnagleys curiosity was awakened to its fullest extent when the master had received the required information he said quietly  i think ill go myself to this place which mliss wishes to make a secret of and see if the boy is there it will save trouble to any one else if she should be mistaken  hadnt you better take some one with you said mrs morpher  by all means i ll go said mr mcsnagley with feverish alacrity  the master looked inquiringly at mliss  he can go if he wants to but hed better not said mliss looking directly into mcsnagleys eyes  what do you mean by that you little savage said mcsnagley quickly  mliss turned scornfully away go she saidgo if you want to and resumed her seat in the corner  the master hesitated but he could not withstand the appeal in the eyes of the mother and daughter and after a short inward struggle he turned to mcsnagley and bade him briefly come  when they had left the house and stood in the road together mcsnagley stopped  where are you goin  to smiths pocket  mcsnagley still lingered do you ever carry any weppings  he at length asked  weapons no what do you want with weapons to  go a mile on a starlit road to a deserted claim nonsense man what are you thinking of were hunting a lost child not a runaway felon come along and the master dragged him away  mrs morpher watched them from the door until their figures were lost in the darkness when she returned to the diningroom clytie had already retired to her room and mrs morpher overruling mlisss desire to sit up until the master returned bade her follow that correct example theres clytie now gone to bed like a young lady and do you do like her and mrs morpher with this one drop of balm in the midst of her trials trimmed the light and sat down in patience to wait for aristides and console herself with the reflection of clyties excellence poor clytie mused that motherly woman how excited and worried she looks about her brother i hope shell be able to get to sleep  it did not occur to mrs morpher that there were seasons in the life of young girls when younger brothers ceased to become objects of extreme solicitude it did not occur to her to go upstairs and see how her wish was likely to be gratified it was well in her anxiety that she did not and that the crowning trial of the days troubles was spared her then for at that moment clytie was lying on the bed where she had flung herself without undressing the heavy masses of her blond hair tumbled about her neck and her hot face buried in her hands  of what was the correct clytie thinking  she was thinking lying there with her burning cheeks pressed against the pillow that she loved the master she was recalling step by step every incident that had occurred in their lonely walk she was repeating to herself his facile sentences wringing and twisting them to extract one drop to assuage the strange thirst that was growing up in her soul she was thinkingsilly clytiethat he had  never appeared so kind before and she was thinkingsillier clytiethat no one had ever before felt as she did then  how soft and white his hands were how sweet and gentle were the tones of his voice how easily he spokeso unlike her father mcsnagley or the young men whom she met at church or on picnics how tall and handsome he looked as he pressed her hand at the door did he press her hand or was it a mistake yes he must have pressed her hand for she remembers now to have pressed his in return and he put his arm around her waist once and she feels it yet and the strange perfume as he drew her closer to him memthe master had been smoking poor clytie  when she had reached this point she raised herself and sat up and began the process of undressing mechanically putting each article away in the precise methodical habit of her former life but she found herself soon sitting again on the bed twisting her hair which fell over her plump white shoulders idly between her fingers and patting the carpet with her small white foot she had been sitting thus some minutes when she heard the sound of voices without the trampling of many feet and a loud rapping at the door below she sprang to the door and looked out in the passage something white passed by her like a flash and crouched down at the head of the stairs it was mliss  mrs morpher opened the door  is mr morpher in said a half dozen strange hoarse voices  no  where is he hes at some of the saloons oh tell me has anything happened is it about aristides where is heis he safe said mrs morpher wringing her hands in agony  hes all right said one of the men with mr morphers old emphasis but  but what  mliss moved slowly down the staircase and clytie from the passage above held her breath  theres been a row down to smiths old pocketa fighta man killed  who shouted mliss from the stairs  mcsnagleyshot dead    chapter vii  the people vs john doe waters  before chief justice lynch   the hurried statement of the messenger was corroborated in the streets that night it was certain that mcsnagley was killed smiths pocket excited but skeptical had seen the body had put its fingers in the bullethole and was satisfied smiths pocket albeit hoarse with shouting and excitement still discussed details with infinite relish in barrooms and saloons and in the main street in clamorous knots that in front of the jail where the prisoner was confined seemed to swell into a mob smiths pocket bearded blueshirted and belligerent crowding about this locality from time to time uttered appeals to justice that swelled on the night wind not infrequently coupling these invocations with the name of that eminent jurist lynch  let not the simple reader suppose that the mere taking off of a fellow mortal had created this uproar the tenure of life in smiths pocket was vain and uncertain at the best and as such philosophically accepted and the blowing out of a brief candle here and there seldom left a permanent shadow with the survivors in such instances too the victims had received their quietus from the hands of brother townsmen socially as it were in broad day in the open streets and under other mitigating circumstances thus when judge starbottle of virginia and french pete exchanged shots with each other across the plaza until their revolvers were exhausted and the luckless pete received a bullet through the lungs half the town witnessed it and were struck with the gallant and chivalrous bearing of these gentlemen and to this day point with feelings of pride and admiration to the bulletholes in the door of the national hotel as they explain how narrow was the escape of the women in the parlor but here was a man murdered at night in a lonely place and by a strangera man unknown to the saloons of smiths pocketa wretch who could not plead the excitement of monte or the delirium of whiskey as an excuse no wonder that smiths pocket surged with virtuous indignation beneath the windows of his prison and clamored for his blood  and as the crowd thickened and swayed to and fro the story of his crime grew exaggerated by hurried and frequent repetition half a dozen speakers volunteered to give the details with an added horror to every sentence how one of morphers children had been missing for a week or more how the schoolmaster and the parson were taking a walk that evening and coming to smiths pocket heard a faint voice from its depths which they recognized as belonging to the missing child how they had succeeded in dragging him out and gathered from his infant lips the story of his incarceration by the murderer waters arid his enforced labors in the mine how they were interrupted by the appearance of waters followed by a highly colored and epithet illustrated account of the interview and quarrel how waters struck the schoolmaster who returned the blow with a pick how waters thereupon drew a derringer and fired missing the schoolmaster but killing mcsnagley  behind him how it was believed that waters was one of joaquins gang that he had killed smith etc etc at each pause the crowd pushed and panted stealthily creeping around the doors and windows of the jail like some strange beast of prey until the climax was reached and a hush fell and two men were silently dispatched for a rope and a critical examination was made of the limbs of a pine tree in the vicinity  the man to whom these incidents had the most terrible significance might have seemed the least concerned as he sat that night but a few feet removed from the eager crowd without his hands lightly clasped together between his knees and the expression on his face of one whose thoughts were far away a candle stuck in a tin sconce on the wall flickered as the night wind blew freshly through a broken pane of the window its uncertain light revealed a low room whose cloth ceiling was stained and ragged and from whose boarded walls the torn paper hung in strips a lumberroom partitioned from the front office which was occupied by a justice of the peace if this temporary dungeon had an appearance of insecurity there was some compensation in the spectacle of an armed sentinel who sat upon a straw mattress in the doorway and another who patrolled the narrow hall which led to the street that the prisoner was not placed in one of the cells in the floor below may have been owing to the fact that the law recognized his detention as only temporary and while providing the two guards as a preventive against the egress of crime within discreetly removed all unnecessary and provoking obstacles to the ingress of justice from without  since the prisoners arrest he had refused to answer any interrogatories since he had been placed in confinement he had not moved from his present attitude the guard finding all attempts at conversation fruitless had fallen into a reverie and regaled himself with pieces of straw plucked  from the mattress a mouse ran across the floor the silence contrasted strangely with the hum of voices in the street  the candlelight falling across the prisoners forehead showed the features which smiths pocket knew and recognized as waters the strange prospector had mliss or aristides seen him then they would have missed that sinister expression which was part of their fearful remembrance the hard grim outlines of his mouth were relaxed the broad shoulders were bent and contracted the quick searching eyes were fixed on vacancy the strong manphysically strong onlywas breaking up the fist that might have felled an ox could do nothing more than separate its idle fingers with childishness of power and purpose an hour longer in this condition and the gallows would have claimed a figure scarcely less limp and impotent than that it was destined to ultimately reject  he had been trying to collect his thoughts would they hang him no they must try him first legally and he could provehe could prove but what could he prove for whenever he attempted to consider the uncertain chances of his escape he found his thoughts straying wide of the question it was of no use for him to clasp his fingers or knit his brows why did the recollection of a schoolfellow long since forgotten blot out all the fierce and feverish memories of the night and the terrible certainty of the future why did the strips of paper hanging from the wall recall to him the pattern of a kite he had flown forty years ago in a moment like this when all his energies were required and all his cunning and tact would be called into service could he think of nothing better than trying to match the torn paper on the wall or to count the cracks in the floor and an oath rose to his lips but from very feebleness died away without expression  why had he ever come to smiths pocket if he had  not been guided by that hellcat this would not have happened what if he were to tell all he knew what if he should accuse her but would they be willing to give up the bird they had already caught yet he again found himself cursing his own treachery and cowardice and this time an exclamation burst from his lips and attracted the attention of the guard  hello there easy old fellow thar aint any good in that said the sentinel looking up its a bad fix youre in sure but rarin and pitchin wont help things t aint no use cussin leastways t aint that kind o swearing that gets a chap out o here he added with a conscientious reservation now ef i was in your place id kinder reflect on my sins and make my peace with god almighty for i tell you the looks o them people outside aint pleasant youre in the hands of the law and the law will protect you as far as it canas far as two men can stand agin a hundred sabe thats whats the matter and its as well that you knowed that now as any time  but the prisoner had relapsed into his old attitude and was surveying the jailor with the same abstracted air as before that individual resumed his seat on the mattress and now lent his ear to a colloquy which seemed to be progressing at the foot of the stairs presently he was bailed by his brother turnkey from below  oh bill said fidus achates from the passage with the usual californian prefatory ejaculation  well  heres mliss says she wants to come up shall i let her in  the subject of inquiry however settled the question of  admission by darting past the guard below in this moment  of preoccupation and bounded up the stairs like a young  fawn the guards laughed  now then my infant phenomenon said the one   called bill as mliss stood panting before him wot s up and nextly wots in that bottle  mliss whisked the bottle which she held in her hand smartly under her apron and said curtly wheres him that killed the parson  yonder replied the man indicating the abstracted figure with his hand wot do you want with him none o your tricks here now he added threateningly  i want to see him  well look make the most of your time and his too for the matter of that but mind now no nonsense mliss he wont stand it repeated the guard with an emphasis in the caution  mliss crossed the room until opposite the prisoner are you the chap that killed the parson she said addressing the motionless figure  something in the tone of her voice startled the prisoner from the reverie he raised his head and glanced quickly and with his old sinister expression at the child  whats that to you he asked with the grim lines setting about his mouth again and the old harshness of his voice  didnt i tell you he wouldnt stand any of your nonsense mliss said the guard testily  mliss only repeated her question  and what if i did kill him said the prisoner savagely whats that to you you young hellcat guarddamnationwhat do you let her come here for do you hear guard he screamed rising in a transport of passion take her away fling her downstairs what the hll is she doing here  if you was the man that killed mcsnagley said mliss without heeding the interruption ive brought you something and she drew the bottle from under her apron and extended it to waters adding its brandycognaca1  take it away and take yourself with it returned waters without abating his angry accents take it away do you hear  well thats what i call ongrateful doggone my skin if it aint said the guard who had been evidently struck with mlisss generosity pass the licker this way my beauty and ill keep it till he changes his mind hes naturally a little flustered just now but hell come round after you go  but mliss didnt accede to this change in the disposition of the gift and was evidently taken aback by her reception and the refusal of the proffered comfort  come hand the bottle here repeated the guard its agin rules to bring the prisner anything anyway and its confiscated to the law its agin the rules too to ask a prisner any question thatll criminate him and on the whole youd better go mliss added the guard to whom the appearance of the bottle had been the means of provoking a spasm of discipline  but mliss refused to make over the coveted treasure bill arose half jestingly and endeavored to get possession of the bottle a struggle ensued goodnaturedly on the part of the guard but characterized on the part of mliss by that halfsavage passion which any thwarted whim or instinct was sure to provoke in her nature at last with a curse she freed herself from his grasp and seizing the bottle by the neck aimed it with the full strength of her little arm fairly at his head but he was quick enough to avert that important object if not quick enough to save his shoulder from receiving the strength of the blow which shattered the thin glass and poured the fiery contents of the bottle over his shirt and breast saturating his clothes and diffusing a sharp alcoholic odor through the room  a forced laugh broke from his lips as he sank back on the mattress not without an underlying sense of awe at  this savage girl who stood panting before him and from whom he had just escaped a blow which might have been fatal its a pity to waste so much good licker he added with affected carelessness narrowly watching each movement of the young pythoness whose rage was not yet abated  come mliss he said at last well say quits youve lost your brandy and ive got some of the pieces of yonder bottle sticking in my shoulder yet i suppose brandy is good for bruises though hand me the light  mliss reached the candle from the sconce and held it by the guard as he turned back the collar of his shirt to lay bare his shoulder so he muttered black and blue no bones broken though no fault of yours eh my young cherub if it wasnt therewhy what are you looking at in that way mliss are you crazyhells furies dont hold the light so near what are you doing hellho there help  too late for in an instant he was a sheet of living flame when or how the candle had touched his garments saturated with the inflammable fluid waters the only inactive spectator in the room could never afterward tell he only knew that the combustion was instantaneous and complete and before the cry had died from his lips not only the guard but the straw mattress on which he had been sitting and the loose strips of paper hanging from the walls and the torn cloth ceiling above were in flames  help help fire fire  with a superhuman effort mliss dragged the prisoner past the blazing mattress through the doorway into the passage and drew the door which opened outwardly against him the unhappy guard still blazing like a funeral pyre after wildly beating the air with his arms for a few seconds dashed at the broken window which gave way with his weight and precipitated him still flaming into the yard below a column of smoke and a licking tongue of flame leaped from the open window at the same moment and the cry of fire was reechoed from a hundred voices in the street but scarcely had mliss closed the open door against waters when the guard from the doorway mounted the stairs in time to see a flaming figure leap from the window the room was filled with smoke and fire with an instinct of genius mliss pointing to the open window shouted hoarsely in his ear  waters has escaped  a cry of fury from the guard was echoed from the stairs even now crowded by the excited mob who feared the devastating element might still cheat them of their intended victim in another moment the house was emptied and the front street deserted as the people rushed to the rear of the jailclimbing fences and stumbling over ditches in pursuit of the imagined runaway mliss seized the hat and coat of the luckless bill and dragging the prisoner from his place of concealment hurriedly equipped him and hastened through the blinding smoke of the staircase boldly on the heels of the retiring crowd once in the friendly darkness of the street it was easy to mingle with the pushing throng until an alley crossing at right angles enabled them to leave the main thoroughfare a few moments rapid flight and the outskirts of the town were reached the tall pines opened their abysmal aisles to the fugitives and mliss paused with her companion until daybreak at least here they were safe  from the time they had quitted the burning room to that moment waters had passed into his listless abstracted condition so helpless and feeble that he retained the grasp of mlisss hand more through some instinctive prompting rather than the dictates of reason mliss had found it necessary to almost drag him from the main street and the hurrying  crowd which seemed to exercise a strange fascination over his bewildered senses and now he sat down passively beside her and seemed to submit to the guidance of her superior nature  youre safe enough now till daylight said mliss when she had recovered her breath but you must make the best time you can through these woods tonight keeping the wind to your back until you come to the wingdam road there do you hear said mliss a little vexed at her companions apathy  waters released the hand of mliss and commenced mechanically to button his coat around his chest with fumbling purposeless fingers he then passed his hand across his forehead as if to clear his confused and bewildered brain all this however to no better result than to apparently root his feet to the soil and to intensify the stupefaction which seemed to be creeping over him  be quick now youve no time to lose keep straight on through the woods until you see the stars again before you and youre on the other side of the ridge what are you waiting for and mliss stamped her little foot impatiently  an idea which had been struggling for expression at last seemed to dawn in his eyes something like a simpering blush crept over his face as he fumbled in his pocket at last drawing forth a twentydollar piece he bashfully offered it to mliss in a twinkling the extended arm was stricken up and the bright coin flew high in the air and disappeared in the darkness  keep your money i dont want it dont do that again said mliss highly excited or illillbite you  her wicked little white teeth flashed ominously as she said it  get off while you can look she added pointing to  a column of flame shooting up above the straggling mass of buildings in the village the jail is burning and if that goes the block will go with it before morning these woods will be filled with people save yourself while you can  waters turned and moved away in the darkness keep straight on and dont waste  a moment urged the child as the man seemed still disposed to linger trot now and in another moment he seemed to melt into the forest depths  mliss threw her apron around her head and coiled herself up at the root of a tree in something of her old fashion she had prophesied truly of the probable extent of the fire the fresh wind whirling the sparks over the little settlement had already fanned the single flame into the broad sheet which now glowed fiercely defining the main street along its entire length the breeze which fanned her cheek bore the crash of falling timbers and the shouts of terrified and anxious men there were no engines in smiths pocket and the contest was unequal nothing but a change of wind could save the doomed settlement  the red glow lit up the dark cheek of mliss and kindled a savage light in her black eyes relieved by the background of the sombre woods she might have been a redhanded nemesis looking over the city of vengeance as the long tongues of flame licked the broad colonnade of the national hotel and shot a wreathing pillar of fire and smoke high into the air mliss extended her tiny fist and shook it at the burning building with an inspiration that at the moment seemed to transfigure her  so the night wore away until the first red bars of morning light gleamed beyond the hill and seemed to emulate the dying embers of the devastated settlement mliss for the first time began to think of the home she had quitted the night before and looked with some anxiety in the direction of mountain ranch its white walls and little  orchard were untouched and looked peacefully over the blackened and deserted village mliss rose and stretching her cramped limbs walked briskly toward the town she had proceeded but a short distance when she heard the sound of cautious and hesitating footsteps behind her and facing quickly about encountered the figure of waters  are you drunk said mliss passionately or what do you mean by this nonsense  the man approached her with a strange smile on his face rubbing his hands together and shivering as with cold when he had reached her side he attempted to take her hand mliss shrank away from him with an expression of disgust  what are you doing here again she demanded  i want to go with you its dark in there he said motioning to the wood he had just quitted and i dont like to be alone youll let me be with you wont you i wont be any trouble and a feeble smile flickered on his lips  mliss darted a quick look into his face the grim outlines of his mouth were relaxed and his lips moved again impotently but his eyes were bright and openbright with a look that was new to mliss that imparted a strange softness and melancholy to his featuresthe incipient gleam of insanity     chapter viii  the author to the readerexplanatory   if i remember rightly in one of the admirable tragedies of tsien tsiang at a certain culminating point of interest an innocent person is about to be sacrificed the knife is raised and the victim meekly awaits the stroke at this moment the author of the play appears on the stage and  delivering an excellent philosophical dissertation on the merits of the situation shows that by the purest principles of art the sacrifice is necessary but at the same time offers to the audience the privilege of changing the denouement such however is the nice aesthetic sense of a chinese auditory and so universal the desire of bloodshed in the heathen breast that invariably at each representation of this remarkable tragedy the cause of humanity gives way to the principles of art  i offer this precedent as an excuse for digressing at a moment when i have burned down a small settlement dispatched a fellow being and left my heroine alone in the company of an escaped convict who has just developed insanity as a new social quality my object in thus digressing is to confer with the reader in regard to the evolution of this storya familiarity not without precedent as i might prove from most of the old greek comedies whose parabasis permits the poet to mingle freely with the dramatis personae to address the audience and descant at length in regard to himself his play and his own merits  the fact is that during the progress of this story i have received many suggestions from intimate friends in regard to its incidents and construction i have also been in the receipt of correspondence from distant readers one letter of which i recall signed by an honest miner who advises me to do the right thing by mliss or intimates somewhat obscurely that he will bust my crust for me which though complimentary in its abstract expression of interest and implying a taste for euphonism evinces an innate coarseness which i fear may blunt his perceptions of delicate shades and greek outlines  again the practical nature of californians and their familiarity with scenes and incidents which would be novel to other people have occasioned me great uneasiness in the course of the last three chapters of mliss i have received some twenty or  thirty communications from different parts of the state corroborating incidents of my story which i solemnly assure the reader is purely fictitious some one has lately sent me a copy of an interior paper containing an old obituary of smith of smiths pocket another correspondent writes to me that he was acquainted with the schoolmaster in the fall of 49 and that they grubbed together the editors of the serial in which this story appears assure me that they have received an advertisement from the landlord of the national hotel contingent upon an editorial notice of its having been at one time the abode of mliss while an aunt of the heroine alluding in excellent terms to the reformed character of her niece mliss clenches her sincerity by requesting the loan of twenty dollars to buy clothes for the desolate orphan  under these circumstances i have hesitated to go on what were the bodiless creatures of my fancythe pale phantoms of thought evoked in the solitude of my chamber and sometimes even midst the hum of busy streetshave suddenly grown into flesh and blood living people protected by the laws of society and having their legal right to actions for slander in any court worse than that i have sometimes thought with terror of the new responsibility which might attach to my development of their characters what if i were obliged to support and protect these frankenstein monsters what if the original of the principal villain of my story should feel impelled through aesthetic principles of art to work out in real life the supposititious denouement i have sketched for him  i have therefore concluded to lay aside my pen for this week leaving the catastrophe impending and await the suggestion of my correspondents i do so the more cheerfully as it enables the editors of this weekly to publish twentyseven more columns of miss braddons outcasts of society and the remainder of the  dukes mottotwo works which in the quiet simplicity of their homelike pictures and household incidents are attended with none of the difficulties which beset my unhappy story     chapter ix  cleaning up   as the master waneyed and unrefreshed by slumber strayed the next morning among the blackened ruins of the fire he was conscious of having undergone some strange revulsion of sentiment what he remembered of the last evenings events though feverish and indistinct as a dream and though like a dream without coherency or connected outline had nevertheless seriously impressed him how frivolous and trifling his past life and its pursuits looked through the lightning vista opened to his eyes by the flash of waterss pistol suppose i had been killed ruminated the master what then a paragraph in the banner headed fatal affray and my name added to the already swollen list of victims to lawless violence and crime humph a pretty scrape truly and the master ground his teeth with vexation  let not the reader judge him too hastily in the best regulated mind thankfulness for deliverance from danger is apt to be mingled with some doubts as to the necessity of the trial  in this frame of mind the last person he would have cared to meet was clytie that young womans evil genius however led her to pass the burnt district that morning perhaps she had anticipated the meeting at all events he had proceeded but a few steps before he was confronted by the identical round hat and cherry colored ribbons but in his present humor the cheerful color somehow reminded him of the fire and of a ruddy stain over mcsnagleys heart and invested the innocent clytie with a figurative significance now clyties reveries at that moment were pleasant if the brightness of her eyes and the freshened color on her cheeks were any sign and as she had not seen the master since then she naturally expected to take up the thread of romance where it had been dropped but it required all her feminine tact to conceal her embarrassment at his formal greeting and constrained manner  he is bashful reasoned clytie to herself  this girl is a tremendous fool growled the master inwardly  an awkward pause ensued finally clytie loquitur  mliss has been missing since the fire  missing echoed the master in his natural tone  clytie bit her lip with vexation yes shes always running away shell be back again but you look interested do you know she continued with exceeding archness i sometimes think mr gray if mliss were a little older  well  well putting this and that together you know  well  people will talk you know continued clytie with that excessive fondness weak people exhibit in enveloping in mystery the commonest affairs of life  people are dd fools roared the master  the correct clytie was a little shocked perhaps underneath it was a secret admiration of the transgressor force even of this cheap quality goes a good way with some natures  that is continued the master with an increase of dignity in inverse proportion to the lapse he had made people are apt to be mistaken miss morpher and without  meaning it to do infinite injustice to their fellow mortals but i see i am detaining you i will try and find melissa i wish you goodmorning and don whiskerandos stalked solemnly away  clytie turned red and white by turns and her eyes filled with tears this denouement to her dreams was utterly unexpected while a girl of stronger character and active intelligence would have employed the time in digesting plans of future retaliation and revenge clyties dull brain and placid nature were utterly perplexed and shaken  dear me said clytie to herself as she started home if he dont love me why dont he say so  the master or mr gray as we may now call him as he draws near the close of his  professional career took the old trail through the forest which led to mlisss former hidingplace he walked on briskly revolving in his mind the feasibility of leaving smiths pocket the late disaster which would affect the prosperity of the settlement for some time to come offered an excuse to him to give up his situation on searching his pockets he found his present capital to amount to ten dollars this increased by forty dollars due him from the trustees would make fifty dollars deduct thirty dollars for liabilities and he would have twenty dollars left to begin the world anew youth and hope added an indefinite number of ciphers to the right hand of these figures and in this sanguine mood our young alnaschar walked on until he had reached the old pine throne in the bank of the forest mliss was not there he sat down on the trunk of the tree and for a few moments gave himself up to the associations it suggested what would become of mliss after he was gone but he quickly dropped the subject as one too visionary and sentimental for his then fiercely practical consideration and to prevent the recurrence of such distracting fancies began to retrace his steps toward the settlement at the edge of the woods at a point where the trail forked toward the old site of smiths pocket he saw mliss coming toward him her ordinary pace on such occasions was a kind of indian trot to his surprise she was walking slowly with her apron thrown over her headan indication of meditation with mliss and the usual way in which she excluded the outer world in studying her lessons when she was within a few feet of him he called her by name she started as she recognized him there was a shade of seriousness in her dark eyes and the hand that took his was listless and totally unlike her old frank energetic grasp  you look worried mliss said mr gray soothingly as the old sentimental feeling crept over his heart whats the matter now  mliss replied by seating herself on the bank beside the road and pointed to a place by her side mr gray took the proffered seat mliss then fixing her eyes on some distant part of the view remained for some moments in silence then without turning her head or moving her eyes she asked  whats that they call a girl that has money left her  an heiress mliss  yes an heiress  well said mr gray  well said mliss without moving her eyes im oneim a heiress  whats that mliss said mr gray laughingly  mliss was silent again suddenly turning her eyes full upon him she said  can you keep a secret  yes said mr gray beginning to be impressed by the childs manner listen then  in short quick sentences mliss began how aristides had several times hinted of the concealed riches of smiths pocket how he had last night repeated the story to her of a strange discovery he had made how she remembered to have heard her father often swear that there was money in that hole if he only had means to work it how partly impressed by this statement and partly from curiosity and pity for the prisoner she had visited him in confinement an account of her interview the origin of the fire her flight with waters questions by mr gray what was your object in assisting this man to escape ans they were going to kill him ques hadnt he killed mcsnagley ans yes but mcsnagley ought to have been killed long ago how she had taken leave of him that morning how he had come back again silly how she had dragged him on toward the wingdam road and how he had told her that all the hidden wealth of smiths pocket had belonged to her father how she had found out from some questions that he had known her father but how all his other answers were silly  and where is he now asked mr gray  gone said mliss i left him at the edge of the wood to go back and get some provisions and when i returned he was gone if he had any senses left hes miles away by this time when he was off i went back to smiths pocket i found the hidden opening and saw the gold  mr gray looked at her curiously he had in his more intimate knowledge of her character noticed the unconcern with which she spoke of the circumstances of her fathers death and the total lack of any sentiment of filial regard the idea that this man whom she had aided in escaping had ever done her injury had not apparently entered her mind nor did mr gray think it necessary to hint the deeper suspicion he had gathered from dr duchesne that waters had murdered her father if the story of the concealed treasures of smiths pocket were exaggerated he  could easily satisfy himself on that point mliss met his suggestion to return to the pocket with alacrity and the two started away in that direction  it was late in the afternoon when mr gray returned his heightened color and eager inquiry for dr duchesne provoked the usual hope from the people that he met that it was nothing serious no nothing was the matter the master answered with a slight laugh but would they send the doctor to his schoolhouse when he returned that young chaps worse than he thinks was one sympathizing suggestion this kind of lifes too rough for his sort  to while away the interim mr gray stopped on his way to the schoolhouse at the stage office as the wingdam stage drew up and disgorged its passengers he was listlessly watching the passengers as they descended when a soft voice from the window addressed him may i trouble you for your arm as i get down mr gray looked up it was a singular request as the driver was at that moment standing by the door apparently for that purpose but the request came from a handsome woman and with a bow the young man stepped to the door the lady laid her hand lightly on his arm sprang from the stage with a dexterity that showed the service to have been merely ceremonious thanked him with an elaboration of acknowledgment which seemed equally gratuitous and disappeared in the office  thats what i call a dead set said the driver drawing a long breath as he turned to mr gray who stood in some embarrassment do you know her no said mr gray laughingly do you  nary time but take care of yourself young man shes after you sure  but mr gray was continuing his walk to the schoolhouse unmindful of the caution for the momentary glimpse he had caught of this womans face she appeared to be about thirty her dress though tasteful and elegant in the present condition of california society afforded no criterion of her social status but the figure of dr duchesne waiting for him at the schoolhouse door just then usurped the place of all others and she dropped out of his mind  now then said the doctor as the young man grasped his hand you want me to tell you why your eyes are bloodshot why your cheeks burn and your hand is dry and hot  not exactly perhaps youll understand the symptoms better when youve heard my story sit down here and listen  the doctor took the proffered seat on top of a desk and mr gray after assuring himself that they were entirely alone related the circumstances he had gathered from mliss that morning  you see doctor how unjust were your surmises in regard to this girl continued mr gray but let that pass now at the conclusion of her story i offered to go with her to this ali baba cave it was no easy job finding the concealed entrance but i found it at last and ample corroboration of every item of this wild story the pocket is rich with the most valuable ore it has evidently been worked for some time since the discovery was made but there is still a fortune in its walls and several thousand dollars of ore sacked up in its galleries look at that continued mr gray as he drew an oblong mass of quartz and metal from his pocket think of a secret of this kind having been intrusted for three weeks to a penniless orphan girl of twelve and an eccentric schoolboy of ten and undivulged except when a proper occasion offered  dr duchesne smiled and waters is really clear  yes said mr gray  and mliss assisted him to escape yes  well you are an innocent one and you see nothing in this but an act of thoughtless generosity no assisting of an old accomplice to escape  i see nothing but truth in her statement returned mr gray stoutly if there has been any wrong committed i believe her to be innocent of its knowledge  well im glad at least the money goes to her and not to him but how are you to establish her right to this property  that was my object in conferring with you at present the claim is abandoned i have taken up the ground in my own name for her and this afternoon i posted up the usual notice  go on you are not so much of a fool after all  thank you this will hold until a better claim is established now if smith had discovered this lead and was as the lawyers say seized and possessed of it at the time of his death mliss of course as next of kin inherits it  but how can this be proved it is the general belief that smith committed suicide through extreme poverty and destitution  mr gray drew a letter from his pocket  you remember the memorandum i showed you which came into my possession here it is it is dated the day of his death  dr duchesne took it and read  july 17th five hours in driftdipping west took out 20 oz cleaned up 40 ozmem saw m s  this evidently refers to actual labor in the mine at the time said dr duchesne but is it legally sufficient to support a claim of this magnitude that is the only question now you say this paper was the leaf of an old memorandum torn off and used for  a letter by mliss do you know where the orignal book can be found  aristides has it or knows where it is answered mr gray  find it by all means and get legal advice before you do anything go this very evening to judge plunkett and state your case to him the promise of a handsome contingent fee wont hurt mlisss prospects any remember our ideas of abstract justice and the letter of the law in this case may be entirely different take judge plunkett your proofs that is said the doctor stopping and eyeing his friend keenly if you have no fears for mliss if this matter should be thoroughly ventilated  mr gray did not falter  i go at once said he gayly if only to prove the childs claim to a good name if we fail in getting her property  the two men left the schoolhouse together as they reached the main street the doctor paused  you are still determined  i am responded the young man  goodnight and god speed you then and the doctor left him  the fire had been particularly severe on the legal fraternity in the settlement and judge plunketts office together with those of his learned brethren had been consumed with the courthouse on the previous night the judges house was on the outskirts of the village and thither mr gray proceeded the judge was at home but engaged at that moment mr gray would wait and was ushered into a small room evidently used as a kitchen but just then littered with law books bundles of papers and blanks that had been hastily rescued from the burning building the sideboard groaned with the weight of several volumes of new york reports that seemed to impart a dusty flavor to the adjoining victual mr gray picked up a volume of supreme court decisions from the coalscuttle and was deep in an interesting case when the door of the adjoining room opened and judge plunkett appeared  he was an oily man of about fifty with spectacles he was glad to see the schoolmaster he hoped he was not suffering from the excitement of the previous evening for his part the spectacle of sober citizens rising in a body to vindicate the insulted majesty of the laws of society and of man had always something sublime in it and the murderer had really got away after all and it was a narrow escape the schoolmaster had too at smiths pocket  mr gray took advantage of the digression to state his business he briefly recounted the circumstances of the discovery of the hidden wealth of smiths pocket and exhibited the memorandum he had shown the doctor when he had concluded judge plunkett looked at him over his spectacles and rubbed his hands with satisfaction  you apprehend said the judge eagerly that you will have no difficulty in procuring this book from which the leaf was originally torn  none replied mr gray  then sir i should give as my professional opinion that the case was already won  mr gray shook the hand of the little man with great fervor and thanked him for his belief and so this property will go entirely to mliss he asked again  wellahnonot exactly said judge plunkett with some caution she will benefit by it undoubtedlyundoubtedly and he rubbed his hands again  why not mliss alone there are no other claimants said mr gray  i beg your pardonyou mistake said judge plunkett with a smile you surely would not leave out the widow and mother   why mliss is an orphan said mr gray in utter bewilderment  a sad mistake sira painful though natural mistake mr smith though separated from his wife was never divorced a very affecting historythe old story you knowan injured and loving woman deserted by her natural protector but disdaining to avail herself of our legal aid by a singular coincidence that i should have told you i am anticipating you in this very case your services however i feel will be invaluable your concern for her amiable and interesting daughter narcissaah no melissawill of course make you with us you have never seen mrs smith a finelooking noble woman sir though still disconsolatestill thinking of the departed one by another singular coincidence that i should have told you she is here now you shall see her sir pray let me introduce you and still rubbing his hands judge plunkett led the way to the adjoining room  mr gray followed him mechanically a handsome woman rose from the sofa as they entered it was the woman he assisted to alight from the wingdam stage     chapter x  the red rock   in the strong light that fell upon her face mr gray had an opportunity to examine her features more closely her eyes which were dark and singularly brilliant were half closed either from some peculiar conformation of the lids or an habitual effort to conceal expression her skin was colorless with that satinlike lustre that belongs to some brunettes relieved by one or two freckles that were scarcely blemishes her face was squared a little at the lower angles but the chin was round and soft and the  curves about the mouth were full and tender enough to destroy the impression left by contemplation of those rigid outlines the effect of its general contour was that of a handsome woman of thirty in detail as the eye dwelt upon any particular feature you could have added a margin of ten years either way  mrs smithmr gray said the lawyer briskly mr gray is the gentleman who since the decease of your husband has taken such a benevolent interest in our playful narcissamelissa i should say he is the preceptor of our district school and beside his relation as teacher to your daughter has i may say in our legal fashion stood in loco parentisin other words has been a parent aafather to her  at the conclusion of this speech mrs smith darted a quick glance at mr gray which was unintelligible to any but a woman as there were none of her own keenwitted sex present to make an ungracious interpretation of it it passed unnoticed except the slight embarrassment and confusion it caused the young man from its apparent gratuity  we have met before i believe said mrs smith with her bright eyes half hid and her white teeth half disclosed i can easily imagine mr grays devotion to a friend from his courtesy to a stranger let me thank you again for both my daughter and myself  in the desperate hope of saying something natural mr gray asked if she had seen melissa yet  oh dear no think how provoking judge plunkett says it is absolutely impossible till some tiresome formalities are over there are so many stupid forms to go through with first but how is she you have seen her have you not you will see her again tonight perhaps how i long to embrace her again she was a mere baby when she left me tell her how i long to fly to her  her impassioned utterance and the dramatic gestures that accompanied these words afforded a singular contrast to the cool way with which she rearranged the folds of her dress when she had finished folding her hands over her lap and settling herself unmistakably back again on the sofa perhaps it was this that made mr gray think she had at some time been an actress but the next moment he caught her eye again and felt pleasedand again vexed with himself for being so and in this mental condition began to speak in favor of his old pupil his embarrassment passed away as he warmed with his subject dwelling at length on mlisss better qualities and did not return until in a breathless pause he became aware that this womans bright eyes were bent upon him the color rose in his cheek and with a halfmuttered apology for his prolixity he offered his excuses to retire  stay a moment mr gray said the lawyer you are going to town and will not think it a trouble to see mrs smith safely back to her hotel you can talk these things over with our fair friend on the way tomorrow at ten i trust to see you both again  perhaps i am taxing mr grays gallantry too much interposed the lady with a very vivid disclosure of eyes and teeth mr gray would be only too happy after he had uttered this civility there was a slight consciousness of truth about it that embarrassed him again but mrs smith took his proffered arm and they bade the lawyer goodnight and passed out in the starlit night together                                       four weeks have elapsed since the advent of mrs smith to the settlementfour weeks that might have been years in any other but a california mining camp for the wonderful change that has been wrought in its physical aspect each stage has brought its load of fresh adventurers another hotel which sprang up on the site of the national has its new landlord and a new set of faces about its hospitable board where  the conventional bean appears daily as a modest vegetable or in the insincerer form of coffee the sawmills have been hard at work for the last month and huge gaps appear in the circling files of redwood where the fallen trees are transmuted to a new style of existence in the damp sappy tenements that have risen over the burnt district the great strike at smiths pocket has been heralded abroad and above and below and on either side of the crumbling tunnel that bears that name as other tunnels are piercing the bowels of the mountain shafts are being sunk and claims are taken up even to the crest of red mountain in the hope of striking the great smith lead already an animated discussion has sprung up in the columns of the red mountain banner in regard to the direction of the famous leada discussion assisted by correspondents who have assumed all the letters of the alphabet in their anonymous arguments and have formed the opposing angle and dip factions of smiths pocket but whatever be the direction of the lead the progress of the settlement has been steadily onward with an impetus gained by the late disaster that classical but much abused bird the phoenix has been invoked from its ashes in several editorials in the banner to sit as a type of resuscitated smiths pocket while in the homelier phrase of an honest miner it seemed as if the fire kem to kinder clean out things for a fresh start  meanwhile the quasilegal administration of the estate of smith is drawing near a termination that seems to credit the prophetic assertion of judge plunkett one fact has been evolved in the process of examination viz that smith had discovered the new lead before he was murdered it was a fair hypothesis that the man who assumed the benefit of his discovery was the murderer but as this did not immediately involve the settlement of the estate it excited little comment or opposition the probable murderer had escaped judicial investigations even in the hands of the people had been attended with disastrous public results and there was no desire on the part of justice to open the case and deal with an abstract principle when there was no opportunity of making an individual example the circumstances were being speedily forgotten in the new excitement even the presence of mrs smith lost its novelty the banner when alluding to her husband spoke of him as the late j smith esq attributing the present activity of business as the result of his lifelong example of untiring energy and generally laid the foundation of a belief which thereafter obtained that he died comfortably in the bosom of his family surrounded by disconsolate friends the history of all pioneer settlements has this legendary basis and mliss may live to see the day when her fathers connection with the origin of the settlement shall become apocryphal and contested like that of romulus and remus and their wolfish wetnurse  it is to the everlasting credit and honor of smiths pocket that the orphan and widow meet no opposition from the speculative community and that the claims utmost boundaries are liberally rendered how far this circumstance may be owing to the rare personal attractions of the charming widow or to mlisss personal popularity i shall not pretend to say it is enough that when the brief of judge plunketts case is ready there are clouds of willing witnesses to substantiate and corroborate doubtful points to an extent that is more creditable to their generosity than their veracity  mliss has seen her mother mr gray with his knowledge of his pupils impulsiveness has been surprised to notice that the new relationship seems to awaken none of those emotions in the childs nature that he confidently looked for on the occasion of their first meeting to which mr gray was admitted mliss maintained a guarded shyness totally different  from her usual frank boldnessa shyness that was the more remarkable from its contrast with the unrepressed and somewhat dramatic emotions of mrs smith now under her mothers protection and care he observes another radical change in mlisss appearance she is dressed more tastefully and neatlynot entirely the result of a mothers influence but apparently the result of some natural instinct now for the first time indulged and exhibited in a ribbon or a piece of jewelry worn with a certain air of consciousness there is a more strict attention to the conventionalities of life her speech is more careful and guarded her walk literally more womanly and graceful those things mr gray naturally attributes to the influence of the new relation though he cannot help recalling his meeting with mliss in the woods on the morning of the fire and of dating many of these changes from thence  it is a pleasant morning and mr gray is stirring early he has been busied in preparation the night previous for this is his last day in smiths pocket he lingers for some time about the schoolhouse gathering up those little trifles which lie about his desk which have each a separate history in his experience of smiths pocket and are a part of the incrustations of his life lastly a file of the red mountain banner is taken from the same receptacle and packed away in his bag he walks to the door and turns to look back has he forgotten anything no nothing but still he lingers he wonders who will take his place at the desk and for the first time in his pedagogue experience perhaps feels something of an awful responsibility as he thinks of his past influence over the wretched little beings who used to tremble at his nod and whose future ill or good he may have helped to fashion at last he closes the door almost tenderly and walks thoughtfully down the road he has to pass the cabin of an irish miner  whose little boy is toddling in the ditch with a pinafore hands and face in a chronic state of untidiness mr gray seizes him with an hilarious impulse and after a number of rapid journeys to banbury cross in search of an old woman who mounted a mythical white horse he kisses the cleanest place on his broad expanse of cheek presses some silver into his chubby fist tells him to be a good boy and deposits him in the ditch again having in this youthful way atoned for certain sins of omission a little further back he proceeds with a sense of perfect absolution on his way to the settlement  a few hours lie between him and his departure to be employed in friendly visits to mrs morpher dr duchesne mliss and her mother the mountain ranch is nearest and thither mr gray goes first mrs morpher over a kneadingtrough with her bare arm whitened with flour is genuinely grieved at parting with the master and in spite of mr grays earnest remonstrances insists upon conducting him into the chill parlor leaving him there until she shall have attired herself in a manner becoming to company i dont want you to go at allno more i dont says mrs morpher with all sincerity as she seats herself finally on the shining horsehair sofa the children will miss you i dont believe that any one will do for risty kerg and clytie what you have done but i suppose you know best whats best young men like to see the world and it aint expected one so young as you should settle down yet thats what i was telling clytie this morning that was just the way with my john afore he was married i suppose youll see mliss and her before you go they say that she is going to san francisco soon is it so  mr gray understands the personal pronoun to refer to mrs smith a title mrs morpher has never granted mlisss mother for whom she entertains an instinctive dislike he answers in the affirmative however with the consciousness of uneasiness under the inquiry and as the answer does not seem to please mrs morpher he is constrained to commend mlisss manifest improvement under her mothers care  well says mrs morpher with a significant sigh i hope its so but bless us wheres clytie you mustnt go without saying goodby to her and mrs morpher starts away in search of her daughter  the diningroom door scarcely closes before the bedroom door opens and clytie crosses the parlor softly with something in her hands you are going now she says hurriedly  yes  will you take this putting a sealed package into his hand and keep it without opening it until  until when clytie  until you are married  mr gray laughs  promise me repeats clytie  but i may expire in the mean time through sheer curiosity  promise says clytie gravely  i promise then  mr gray receives the package goodby says clytie softly  clyties rosy cheek is very near mr gray there is nobody by he is going away it is the last time he kisses her just before the door opens again to mrs morpher  another shake of hands all around and mr gray passes out of the mountain ranch forever  dr duchesnes office is near at hand but for some reason that mr gray cannot entirely explain to himself he prefers to go to mrs smiths first the little cottage which they have taken temporarily is soon reached and as the young man stands at the door he reknots the bow of  his cravat and passes his fingers through his curlstrifles that to dr duchesne or any other critical middleaged person might look bad  mliss and mrs smith are both at home they have been waiting for him so long was it that pretty daughter of mrs morpherthe fair young lady with blond curlswho caused the detention is not mr gray a sly young fellow for all his seeming frankness so he must go today he cannot possibly wait a few days and go with them thus mrs smith between her red lips and white teeth and under her halfclosed eyes for mliss stands quietly apart without speaking her reserve during the interview contrasts with the vivacity of her mother as though they had changed respective places in relationship mr gray is troubled by this and as he rises to go he takes mlisss hand in his  have you nothing to say to me before i go he asks  goodby answers mliss  nothing more  thats enough rejoins the child simply  mr gray bites his lips i may never see you again you know melissa he continues  you will see us again says mliss quietly raising her great dark eyes to his  the blood mounted to his cheek and crimsoned his forehead he was conscious too that the mothers face had taken fire at his own as she walked away toward the window  goodby then said mr gray pettishly as he stooped to kiss her  mliss accepted the salute stoically mr gray took mrs smiths hand her face had resumed its colorless satinlike sheen  mliss knows the strength of your good will and makes her calculations accordingly i hope she may not be mistaken she said with a  languid tenderness of voice and eye the young man bent over her outstretched hand and withdrew as the wingdam stage noisily rattled up before the national hotel  there was but little time left to spend with dr duchesne so the physician walked with him to the stage office there were a few of the old settlers lounging by the stage who had discerned just as the master was going away how much they liked him mr gray had gone through the customary bibulous formula of leavetaking with a hearty shake of the doctors hand and a promise to write he climbed to the box of the stage all aboard cried the driver and with a preliminary bound the stage rolled down main street  mr gray remained buried in thought as they rolled through the town each object in passing recalling some incident of his past experience the stage had reached the outskirts of the settlement when he detected a wellknown little figure running down a bytrail to intersect the road before the stage had passed he called the drivers attention to it and as they drew up at the crossing aristidess short legs and wellknown features were plainly discernible through the dust he was holding in his hand a letter  well my little man what is it said the driver impatiently  a letter for the master gasped the exhausted child  give it hereany answer  wait a moment said mr gray  look sharp then and get your billet duxis before you go next time  mr gray hurriedly broke the seal and read these words    judge plunkett has just returned from the county seat   our case is   won we leave here next week    js    ps have you got my address in san francisco  any answer said the driver  none  get up  and the stage rolled away from smiths pocket leaving the just aristides standing in the dust of its triumphal wheels      highwater mark   when the tide was out on the dedlow marsh its extended dreariness was patent its spongy lowlying surface sluggish inky pools and tortuous sloughs twisting their slimy way eellike toward the open bay were all hard facts so were the few green tussocks with their scant blades their amphibious flavor and unpleasant dampness and if you chose to indulge your fancyalthough the flat monotony of the dedlow marsh was not inspiringthe wavy line of scattered drift gave an unpleasant consciousness of the spent waters and made the dead certainty of the returning tide a gloomy reflection which no present sunshine could dissipate the greener meadowland seemed oppressed with this idea and made no positive attempt at vegetation until the work of reclamation should be complete in the bitter fruit of the low cranberry bushes one might fancy he detected a naturally sweet disposition curdled and soured by an injudicious course of too much regular cold water  the vocal expression of the dedlow marsh was also melancholy and depressing the sepulchral boom of the bittern the shriek of the curlew the scream of passing brant the wrangling of quarrelsome teal the sharp querulous protest of the startled crane and syllabled complaint of the killdeer plover were beyond the power of written expression nor was the aspect of these mournful fowls at all cheerful and inspiring certainly not the blue heron standing midleg deep in the water obviously catching cold in a reckless disregard of wet feet and consequences nor  the mournful curlew the dejected plover or the lowspirited snipe who saw fit to join him in his suicidal contemplation nor the impassive kingfisheran ornithological marius reviewing the desolate expanse nor the black raven that went to and fro over the face of the marsh continually but evidently couldnt make up his mind whether the waters had subsided and felt low spirited in the reflection that after all this trouble he wouldnt be able to give a definite answer on the contrary it was evident at a glance that the dreary expanse of dedlow marsh told unpleasantly on the birds and that the season of migration was looked forward to with a feeling of relief and satisfaction by the full grown and of extravagant anticipation by the callow brood but if dedlow marsh was cheerless at the slack of the low tide you should have seen it when the tide was strong and full when the damp air blew chilly over the cold glittering expanse and came to the faces of those who looked seaward like another tide when a steellike glint marked the low hollows and the sinuous line of slough when the great shell incrusted trunks of fallen trees arose again and went forth on their dreary purposeless wanderings drifting hither and thither but getting no farther toward any goal at the falling tide or the days decline than the cursed hebrew in the legend when the glossy ducks swung silently making neither ripple nor furrow on the shimmering surface when the fog came in with the tide and shut out the blue above even as the green below had been obliterated when boatmen lost in that fog paddling about in a hopeless way started at what seemed the brushing of mermens fingers on the boats keel or shrank from the tufts of grass spreading around like the floating hair of a corpse and knew by these signs that they were lost upon dedlow marsh and must make a night of it and a gloomy one at thatthen you might know something of dedlow marsh at high water  let me recall a story connected with this latter view which never failed to recur to my mind in my long gunning excursions upon dedlow marsh although the event was briefly recorded in the county paper i had the story in all its eloquent detail from the lips of the principal actor i cannot hope to catch the varying emphasis and peculiar coloring of feminine delineation for my narrator was a woman but ill try to give at least its substance  she lived midway of the great slough of dedlow marsh and a goodsized river which debouched four miles beyond into an estuary formed by the pacific ocean on the long sandy peninsula which constituted the southwestern boundary of a noble bay the house in which she lived was a small frame cabin raised from the marsh a few feet by stout piles and was three miles distant from the settlements upon the river her husband was a loggera profitable business in a county where the principal occupation was the manufacture of lumber  it was the season of early spring when her husband left on the ebb of a high tide with a raft of logs for the usual transportation to the lower end of the bay as she stood by the door of the little cabin when the voyagers departed she noticed a cold look in the southeastern sky and she remembered hearing her husband say to his companions that they must endeavor to complete their voyage before the coming of the southwesterly gale which he saw brewing and that night it began to storm and blow harder than she had ever before experienced and some great trees fell in the forest by the river and the house rocked like her babys cradle  but however the storm might roar about the little cabin she knew that one she trusted had driven bolt and bar with his own strong hand and that had he feared for her he would not have left her this and her domestic duties and the care of her little sickly baby helped to keep her mind from dwelling on the weather except of course to hope that he was safely harbored with the logs at utopia in the dreary distance but she noticed that day when she went out to feed the chickens and look after the cow that the tide was up to the little fence of their garden patch and the roar of the surf on the south beach though miles away she could hear distinctly and she began to think that she would like to have some one to talk with about matters and she believed that if it had not been so far and so stormy and the trail so impassable she would have taken the baby and have gone over to ryekmans her nearest neighbor but then you see he might have returned in the storm all wet with no one to see to him and it was a long exposure for baby who was croupy and ailing  but that night she never could tell why she didnt feel like sleeping or even lying down the storm had somewhat abated but she still sat and sat and even tried to read i dont know whether it was a bible or some profane magazine that this poor woman read but most probably the latter for the words all ran together and made such sad nonsense that she was forced at last to put the book down and turn to that dearer volume which lay before her in the cradle with its white initial leaf as yet unsoiled and try to look forward to its mysterious future and rocking the cradle she thought of everything and everybody but still was wide awake as ever  it was nearly twelve oclock when she at last lay down in her clothes how long she slept she could not remember but she awoke with a dreadful choking in her throat and found herself standing trembling all over in the middle of the room with her baby clasped to her breast and she was saying something the baby cried and sobbed and she walked up and down trying to hush it when she heard a scratching at the door she opened it  fearfully and was glad to see it was only old pete their dog who crawled dripping with water into the room she would have liked to look out not in the faint hope of her husbands coming but to see how things looked but the wind shook the door so savagely that she could hardly hold it then she sat down a little while and then walked up and down a little while and then she lay down again a little while lying close by the wall of the little cabin she thought she heard once or twice something scrape slowly against the clapboards like the scraping of branches then there was a little gurgling sound like the baby made when it was swallowing then something went clickclick and cluckcluck so that she sat up in bed when she did so she was attracted by something else that seemed creeping from the back door toward the centre of the room it wasnt much wider than her little finger but soon it swelled to the width of her hand and began spreading all over the floor it was water  she ran to the front door and threw it wide open and saw nothing but water she ran to the back door and threw it open and saw nothing but water she ran to the side window and throwing that open she saw nothing but water then she remembered hearing her husband once say that there was no danger in the tide for that fell regularly and people could calculate on it and that he would rather live near the bay than the river whose banks might overflow at any time but was it the tide so she ran again to the back door and threw out a stick of wood it drifted away towards the bay she scooped up some of the water and put it eagerly to her lips it was fresh and sweet it was the river and not the tide  it was thenoh god be praised for his goodness she did neither faint nor fall it was thenblessed be the saviour for it was his merciful hand that touched and strengthened her in this awful moment that fear dropped  from her like a garment and her trembling ceased it was then and thereafter that she never lost her selfcommand through all the trials of that gloomy night  she drew the bedstead toward the middle of the room and placed a table upon it and on that she put the cradle the water on the floor was already over her ankles and the house once or twice moved so perceptibly and seemed to be racked so that the closet doors all flew open then she heard the same rasping and thumping against the wall and looking out saw that a large uprooted tree which had lain near the road at the upper end of the pasture had floated down to the house luckily its long roots dragged in the soil and kept it from moving as rapidly as the current for had it struck the house in its full career even the strong nails and bolts in the piles could not have withstood the shock the hound had leaped upon its knotty surface and crouched near the roots shivering and whining a ray of hope flashed across her mind she drew a heavy blanket from the bed and wrapping it about the babe waded in the deepening waters to the door as the tree swung again broadside on making the little cabin creak and tremble she leaped on to its trunk by gods mercy she succeeded in obtaining a footing on its slippery surface and twining an arm about its roots she held in the other her moaning child then something cracked near the front porch and the whole front of the house she had just quitted fell forwardjust as cattle fall on their knees before they lie downand at the same moment the great redwood tree swung round and drifted away with its living cargo into the black night  for all the excitement and danger for all her soothing of her crying babe for all the whistling of the wind for all the uncertainty of her situation she still turned to look at the deserted and water swept cabin she remembered oven then and she wondered how foolish she was to think of it at  that time that she wished she had put on another dress and the babys best clothes and she kept praying that the house would be spared so that he when he returned would have something to come to and it wouldnt be quite so desolate andhow could he ever know what had become of her and baby and at the thought she grew sick and faint but she had something else to do besides worrying for whenever the long roots of her ark struck an obstacle the whole trunk made half a revolution and twice dipped her in the black water the hound who kept distracting her by running up and down the tree and howling at last fell off at one of these collisions he swam for some time beside her and she tried to get the poor beast upon the tree but he acted silly and wild and at last she lost sight of him forever then she and her baby were left alone the light which had burned for a few minutes in the deserted cabin was quenched suddenly she could not then tell whither she was drifting the outline of the white dunes on the peninsula showed dimly ahead and she judged the tree was moving in a line with the river it must be about slack water and she had probably reached the eddy formed by the confluence of the tide and the overflowing waters of the river unless the tide fell soon there was present danger of her drifting to its channel and being carried out to sea or crushed in the floating drift that peril averted if she were carried out on the ebb toward the bay she might hope to strike one of the wooded promontories of the peninsula and rest till daylight sometimes she thought she heard voices and shouts from the river and the bellowing of cattle and bleating of sheep then again it was only the ringing in her ears and throbbing of her heart she found at about this time that she was so chilled and stiffened in her cramped position that she could scarcely move and the baby cried so when she put it to her breast that she noticed the milk refused to flow and she was so  frightened at that that she put her head under her shawl and for the first time cried bitterly  when she raised her head again the boom of the surf was behind her and she knew that her ark had again swung round she dipped up the water to cool her parched throat and found that it was salt as her tears there was a relief though for by this sign she knew that she was drifting with the tide it was then the wind went down and the great and awful silence oppressed her there was scarcely a ripple against the furrowed sides of the great trunk on which she rested and around her all was black gloom and quiet she spoke to the baby just to hear herself speak and to know that she had not lost her voice she thought thenit was queer but she could not help thinking it how awful must have been the night when the great ship swung over the asiatic peak and the sounds of creation were blotted out from the world she thought too of mariners clinging to spars and of poor women who were lashed to rafts and beaten to death by the cruel sea she tried to thank god that she was thus spared and lifted her eyes from the baby who had fallen into a fretful sleep suddenly away to the southward a great light lifted itself out of the gloom and flashed and flickered and flickered and flashed again her heart fluttered quickly against the babys cold cheek it was the lighthouse at the entrance of the bay as she was yet wondering the tree suddenly rolled a little dragged a little and then seemed to lie quiet and still she put out her hand and the current gurgled against it the tree was aground and by the position of the light and the noise of the surf aground upon the dedlow marsh  had it not been for her baby who was ailing and croupy had it not been for the sudden drying up of that sensitive fountain she would have felt safe and relieved perhaps it was this which tended to make all her impressions mournful  and gloomy as the tide rapidly fell a great flock of black brant fluttered by her screaming and crying then the plover flew up and piped mournfully as they wheeled around the trunk and at last fearlessly lit upon it like a gray cloud then the heron flew over and around her shrieking and protesting and at last dropped its gaunt legs only a few yards from her but strangest of all a pretty white bird larger than a dovelike a pelican but not a pelicancircled around and around her at last it lit upon a rootlet of the tree quite over her shoulder she put out her hand and stroked its beautiful white neck and it never appeared to move it stayed there so long that she thought she would lift up the baby to see it and try to attract her attention but when she did so the child was so chilled and cold and had such a blue look under the little lashes which it didnt raise at all that she screamed aloud and the bird flew away and she fainted  well that was the worst of it and perhaps it was not so much after all to any but herself for when she recovered her senses it was bright sunlight and dead low water there was a confused noise of guttural voices about her and an old squaw singing an indian hushaby and rocking herself from side to side before a fire built on the marsh before which she the recovered wife and mother lay weak and weary her first thought was for her baby and she was about to speak when a young squaw who must have been a mother herself fathomed her thought and brought her the mowitch pale but living in such a queer little willow cradle all bound up just like the squaws own young one that she laughed and cried together and the young squaw and the old squaw showed their big white teeth and glinted their black eyes and said plenty get well skeena mowitch wagee man come plenty soon and she could have kissed their brown faces in her joy and then she found that they had been gathering berries on the marsh in  heir queer comical baskets and saw the skirt of her gown fluttering on the tree from afar and the old squaw couldnt resist the temptation of procuring a new garment and came down and discovered the wagee woman and child and of course she gave the garment to the old squaw as you may imagine and when he came at last and rushed up to her looking about ten years older in his anxiety she felt so faint again that they had to carry her to the canoe for you see he knew nothing about the flood until he met the indians at utopia and knew by the signs that the poor woman was his wife and at the next high tide he towed the tree away back home although it wasnt worth the trouble and built another house using the old tree for the foundation and props and called it after her marys ark but you may guess the next house was built above high water mark and thats all  not much perhaps considering the malevolent capacity of the dedlow marsh but you must tramp over it at low water or paddle over it at high tide or get lost upon it once or twice in the fog as i have to understand properly marys adventure or to appreciate duly the blessings of living beyond highwater mark      a lonely ride   as i stepped into the slumgullion stage i saw that it was a dark night a lonely road and that i was the only passenger let me assure the reader that i have no ulterior design in making this assertion a long course of light reading has forewarned me what every experienced intelligence must confidently look for from such a statement the storyteller who willfully tempts fate by such obvious beginnings who is to the expectant reader in danger of being robbed or half murdered or frightened by an escaped lunatic or introduced to his ladylove for the first time deserves to be detected i am relieved to say that none of these things occurred to me the road from wingdam to slumgullion knew no other banditti than the regularly licensed hotelkeepers lunatics had not yet reached such depth of imbecility as to ride of their own free will in californian stages and my laura amiable and longsuffering as she always is could not i fear have borne up against these depressing circumstances long enough to have made the slightest impression on me  i stood with my shawl and carpetbag in hand gazing doubtingly on the vehicle  even in the darkness the red dust of wingdam was visible on its roof and sides and the red slime of slumgullion clung tenaciously to its wheels i opened the door the stage creaked uneasily and in the gloomy abyss the swaying straps beckoned me like ghostly hands to come in now and have my sufferings out at once  i must not omit to mention the occurrence of a circumstance which struck me as  appalling and mysterious a lounger on the steps of the hotel who i had reason to suppose was not in any way connected with the stage company gravely descended and walking toward the conveyance tried the handle of the door opened it expectorated in the carriage and returned to the hotel with a serious demeanor hardly had he resumed his position when another individual equally disinterested impassively walked down the steps proceeded to the back of the stage lifted it expectorated carefully on the axle and returned slowly and pensively to the hotel a third spectator wearily disengaged himself from one of the ionic columns of the portico and walked to the box remained for a moment in serious and expectorative contemplation of the boot and then returned to his column there was something so weird in this baptism that i grew quite nervous  perhaps i was out of spirits a number of infinitesimal annoyances winding up with the resolute persistency of the clerk at the stage office to enter my name misspelt on the waybill had not predisposed me to cheerfulness the inmates of the eureka house from a social viewpoint were not attractive there was the prevailing opinionso common to many honest peoplethat a serious style of deportment and conduct toward a stranger indicates high gentility and elevated station obeying this principle all hilarity ceased on my entrance to supper and general remark merged into the safer and uncompromising chronicle of several bad cases of diphtheria then epidemic at wingdam when i left the diningroom with an odd feeling that i had been supping exclusively on mustard and tea leaves i stopped a moment at the parlor door a piano harmoniously related to the dinnerbell tinkled responsive to a diffident and uncertain touch on the white wall the shadow of an old and sharp profile was bending over several symmetrical and shadowy curls i sez to mariar mariar sez i praise to the face is open disgrace i heard no more dreading some susceptibility to sincere expression on the subject of female loveliness i walked away checking the compliment that otherwise might have risen unbidden to my lips and have brought shame and sorrow to the household  it was with the memory of these experiences resting heavily upon me that i stood hesitatingly before the stage door the driver about to mount was for a moment illuminated by the open door of the hotel he had the wearied look which was the distinguishing expression of wingdam satisfied that i was properly waybilled and receipted for he took no further notice of me i looked longingly at the boxseat but he did not respond to the appeal i flung my carpetbag into the chasm dived recklessly after it andbefore i was fairly seated with a great sigh a creaking of unwilling springs complaining bolts and harshly expostulating axle we moved away rather the hotel door slipped behind the sound of the piano sank to rest and the night and its shadows moved solemnly upon us  to say it was dark expressed but faintly the pitchy obscurity that encompassed the vehicle the roadside trees were scarcely distinguishable as deeper masses of shadow i knew them only by the peculiar sodden odor that from time to time sluggishly flowed in at the open window as we rolled by we proceeded slowly so leisurely that leaning from the carriage i more than once detected the fragrant sigh of some astonished cow whose ruminating repose upon the highway we had ruthlessly disturbed but in the darkness our progress more the guidance of some mysterious instinct than any apparent volition of our own gave an indefinable charm of security to our journey that a moments hesitation or indecision on the part of the driver would have destroyed  i had indulged a hope that in the empty vehicle i might obtain that rest so often denied me in its crowded condition it was a weak delusion when i stretched out my limbs it was only to find that the ordinary conveniences for making several people distinctly uncomfortable were distributed throughout my individual frame at last resting my arms on the straps by dint of much gymnastic effort i became sufficiently composed to be aware of a more refined species of torture the springs of the stage rising and falling regularly produced a rhythmical beat which began to painfully absorb my attention slowly this thumping merged into a senseless echo of the mysterious female of the hotel parlor and shaped itself into this awful and benumbing axiom praisetothefaceisopendisgrace praisetothefaceisopendisgrace inequalities of the road only quickened its utterance or drawled it to an exasperating length  it was of no use to seriously consider the statement it was of no use to except to it indignantly it was of no use to recall the many instances where praise to the face had redounded to the everlasting honor of praiser and bepraised of no use to dwell sentimentally on modest genius and courage lifted up and strengthened by open commendation of no use to except to the mysterious femaleto picture her as rearing a thinblooded generation on selfish and mechanically repeated axiomsall this failed to counteract the monotonous repetition of this sentence there was nothing to do but to give in and i was about to accept it weakly as we too often treat other illusions of darkness and necessity for the time being when i became aware of some other annoyance that had been forcing itself upon me for the last few moments how quiet the driver was  was there any driver had i any reason to suppose that he was not lying gagged and bound on the roadside and the highwayman with blackened face who did the  thing so quietly driving mewhither the thing is perfectly feasible and what is this fancy now being jolted out of me a story its of no use to keep it back particularly in this abysmal vehicle and here it comes i am a marquisa french marquis french because the peerage is not so well known and the country is better adapted to romantic incidenta marquis because the democratic reader delights in the nobility my name is something ligny i am coming from paris to my countryseat at st germain it is a dark night and i fall asleep and tell my honest coachman andre not to disturb me and dream of an angel the carriage at last stops at the chateau it is so dark that when i alight i do not recognize the face of the footman who holds the carriagedoor but what of thatpeste i am heavy with sleep the same obscurity also hides the old familiar indecencies of the statues on the terrace but there is a door and it opens and shuts behind me smartly then i find myself in a trap in the presence of the brigand who has quietly gagged poor andre and conducted the carriage thither there is nothing for me to do as a gallant french marquis but to say parbleu draw my rapier and die valorously i am found a week or two after outside a deserted cabaret near the barrier with a hole through my ruffled linen and my pockets stripped no on second thoughts i am rescuedrescued by the angel i have been dreaming of who is the assumed daughter of the brigand but the real daughter of an intimate friend  looking from the window again in the vain hope of distinguishing the driver i found my eyes were growing accustomed to the darkness i could see the distant horizon defined by indiainky woods relieving a lighter sky a few stars widely spaced in this picture glimmering sadly i noticed again the infinite depth of patient sorrow in their serene faces and i hope that the vandal who first  applied the flippant twinkle to them may not be driven melancholy mad by their reproachful eyes i noticed again the mystic charm of space that imparts a sense of individual solitude to each integer of the densest constellation involving the smallest star with immeasurable loneliness something of this calm and solitude crept over me and i dozed in my gloomy cavern when i awoke the full moon was rising seen from my window it had an indescribably unreal and theatrical effect it was the full moon of normathat remarkable celestial phenomenon which rises so palpably to a hushed audience and a sublime andante chorus until the casta diva is sungthe inconstant moon that then and thereafter remains fixed in the heavens as though it were a part of the solar system inaugurated by joshua again the whiterobed druids filed past me again i saw that improbable mistletoe cut from that impossible oak and again cold chills ran down my back with the first strain of the recitative the thumping springs essayed to beat time and the private boxlike obscurity of the vehicle lent a cheap enchantment to the view but it was a vast improvement upon my past experience and i hugged the fond delusion  my fears for the driver were dissipated with the rising moon a familiar sound had assured me of his presence in the full possession of at least one of his most important functions frequent and full expectoration convinced me that his lips were as yet not sealed by the gag of highwaymen and soothed my anxious ear with this load lifted from my mind and assisted by the mild presence of diana who left as when she visited endymion much of her splendor outside my caverni looked around the empty vehicle on the forward seat lay a womans hairpin i picked it up with an interest that however soon abated there was no scent of the roses to cling to it still not even of hairoil no bent or twist in its rigid angles betrayed  any trait of its wearers character i tried to think that it might have been mariars i tried to imagine that confining the symmetrical curls of that girl it might have heard the soft compliments whispered in her ears which provoked the wrath of the aged female but in vain it was reticent and unswerving in its upright fidelity and at last slipped listlessly through my fingers  i had dozed repeatedlywaked on the threshold of oblivion by contact with some of the angles of the coach and feeling that i was unconsciously assuming in imitation of a humble insect of my childish recollection that spherical shape which could best resist those impressions when i perceived that the moon riding high in the heavens had begun to separate the formless masses of the shadowy landscape trees isolated in clumps and assemblages changed places before my window the sharp outlines of the distant hills came back as in daylight but little softened in the dry cold dewless air of a california summer night i was wondering how late it was and thinking that if the horses of the night traveled as slowly as the team before us faustus might have been spared his agonizing prayer when a sudden spasm of activity attacked my driver a succession of whipsnappings like a pack of chinese crackers broke from the box before me the stage leaped forward and when i could pick myself from under the seat a long white building had in some mysterious way rolled before my window it must be slumgullion as i descended from the stage i addressed the driver  i thought you changed horses on the road  so we did two hours ago  thats odd i didnt notice it  must have been asleep sir hope you had a pleasant nap bully place for a nice quiet snooze empty stage sir      the man of no account   his name was faggdavid fagg he came to california in 52 with us in the skyscraper i dont think he did it in an adventurous way he probably had no other place to go to when a knot of us young fellows would recite what splendid opportunities we resigned to go and how sorry our friends were to have us leave and show daguerreotypes and locks of hair and talk of mary and susan the man of no account used to sit by and listen with a pained mortified expression on his plain face and say nothing i think he had nothing to say he had no associates except when we patronized him and in point of fact he was a good deal of sport to us he was always seasick whenever we had a capful of wind he never got his sealegs on either and i never shall forget how we all laughed when eattler took him the piece of pork on a string andbut you know that timehonored joke and then we had such a splendid lark with him miss fanny twinkler couldnt bear the sight of him and we used to make fagg think that she had taken a fancy to him and sent him little delicacies and books from the cabin you ought to have witnessed the rich scene that took place when he came up stammering and very sick to thank her didnt she flash up grandly and beautifully and scornfully so like medora rattler saidrattler knew byron by heartand wasnt old fagg awfully cut up but he got over it and when rattler fell sick at valparaiso old fagg used to nurse him you see he was a good sort of fellow but he lacked manliness and spirit    he had absolutely no idea of poetry ive seen him sit stolidly by mending his old clothes when rattler delivered that stirring apostrophe of byrons to the ocean he asked rattler once quite seriously if he thought byron was ever seasick i dont remember rattlers reply but i know we all laughed very much and i have no doubt it was something good for rattler was smart  when the skyscraper arrived at san francisco we had a grand feed we agreed to meet every year and perpetuate the occasion of course we didnt invite fagg fagg was a steerage passenger and it was necessary you see now we were ashore to exercise a little discretion but old fagg as we called himhe was only about twenty five years old by the waywas the source of immense amusement to us that day it appeared that he had conceived the idea that he could walk to sacramento and actually started off afoot we had a good time and shook hands with one another all around and so parted ah me only eight years ago and yet some of those hands then clasped in amity have been clenched at each other or have dipped furtively in one anothers pockets i know that we didnt dine together the next year because young barker swore he wouldnt put his feet under the same mahogany with such a very contemptible scoundrel as that mixer and nibbles who borrowed money at valparaiso of young stubbs who was then a waiter in a restaurant didnt like to meet such people  when i bought a number of shares in the coyote tunnel at mugginsville in 54 i thought id take a run up there and see it i stopped at the empire hotel and after dinner i got a horse and rode round the town and out to the claim one of those individuals whom newspaper correspondents call our intelligent informant and to whom in all small communities the right of answering questions is tacitly yielded was quietly pointed out to me habit had  enabled him to work and talk at the same time and he never pretermitted either he gave me a history of the claim and added you see stranger he addressed the bank before him gold is sure to come outer that theer claim he put in a comma with his pick but the old proprietor he wriggled out the word and the point of his pick warnt of much account a long stroke of the pick for a period he was green and let the boys about here jump himand the rest of his sentence was confided to his hat which he had removed to wipe his manly brow with his red bandana  i asked him who was the original proprietor  his name war fagg  i went to see him he looked a little older and plainer he had worked hard he said and was getting on soso i took quite a liking to him and patronized him to some extent whether i did so because i was beginning to have a distrust for such fellows as rattler and mixer is not necessary for me to state  you remember how the coyote tunnel went in and how awfully we shareholders were done well the next thing i heard was that rattler who was one of the heaviest shareholders was up at mugginsville keeping bar for the proprietor of the mugginsville hotel and that old fagg had struck it rich and didnt know what to do with his money all this was told me by mixer who had been there settling up matters and likewise that eagg was sweet upon the daughter of the proprietor of the aforesaid hotel and so by hearsay and letter i eventually gathered that old robins the hotel man was trying to get up a match between nellie robins and fagg nellie was a pretty plump and foolish little thing and would do just as her father wished i thought it would be a good thing forfagg if he should marry and settle down that as a married man he might be of some account so i ran up to mugginsville one day to look after things    it did me an immense deal of good to make rattler mix my drinks for merattler the gay brilliant and unconquerable rattler who had tried to snub me two years ago i talked to him about old fagg and nellie particularly as i thought the subject was distasteful he never liked fagg and he was sure he said that nellie did nt did nellie like anybody else he turned round to the mirror behind the bar and brushed up his hair i understood the conceited wretch i thought ld put fagg on his guard and get him to hurry up matters i had a long talk with him you could see by the way the poor fellow acted that he was badly stuck he sighed and promised to pluck up courage to hurry matters to a crisis nellie was a good girl and i think had a sort of quiet respect for old faggs unobtrusiveness but her fancy was already taken captive by rattlers superficial qualities which were obvious and pleasing i dont think nellie was any worse than you or i we are more apt to take acquaintances at their apparent value than their intrinsic worth its less trouble and except when we want to trust them quite as convenient the difficulty with women is that their feelings are apt to get interested sooner than ours and then you know reasoning is out of the question this is what old fagg would have known had he been of any account but he was nt so much the worse for him  it was a few months afterward and i was sitting in my office when in walked old fagg i was surprised to see him down but we talked over the current topics in that mechanical manner of people who know that they have something else to say but are obliged to get at it in that formal way after an interval fagg in his natural manner said  im going home  going home  yesthat is i think ill take a trip to the atlantic    states i came to see you as you know i have some little property and i have executed a power of attorney for you to manage my affairs i have some papers id like to leave with you will you take charge of them  yes i said but what of nellie  his face fell he tried to smile and the combination resulted in one of the most startling and grotesque effects i ever beheld at length he said  i shall not marry nelliethat ishe seemed to apologize internally for the positive form of expressioni think that i had better not  david fagg i said with sudden severity youre of no account  to my astonishment his face brightened  yes said he thats itim of no account but i always knew it you see i thought rattler loved that girl as well as i did and i knew she liked him better than she did me and would be happier i dare say with him but then i knew that old robins would have preferred me to him as i was better offand the girl would do as he saidand you see i thought i was kinder in the wayand so i left but he continued as i was about to interrupt him for fear the old man might object to rattler ive lent him enough to set him up in business for himself in dogtown a pushing active brilliant fellow you know like rattler can get along and will soon be in his old position againand you neednt be hard on him you know if he doesnt goodby  i was too much disgusted with his treatment of that rattler to be at all amiable but as his business was profitable i promised to attend to it and he left a few weeks passed the return steamer arrived and a terrible incident occupied the papers for days afterwards people in all parts of the state conned eagerly the details of an awful shipwreck and those who had friends aboard went away by themselves and read the long list of the lost under their breath i read of the gifted the gallant the noble and loved ones who had perished and among them i think i was the first to read the name of david fagg for the man of no account had gone home      notes by flood and field   part i  in the field   it was near the close of an october day that i began to be disagreeably conscious of the sacramento valley i had been riding since sunrise and my course through the depressing monotony of the long level landscape affected me more like a dull dyspeptic dream than a business journey performed under that sincerest of natural phenomenaa california sky the recurring stretches of brown and baked fields the gaping fissures in the dusty trail the hard outline of the distant hills and the herds of slowly moving cattle seemed like features of some glittering stereoscopic picture that never changed active exercise might have removed this feeling but my horse by some subtle instinct had long since given up all ambitious effort and had lapsed into a dogged trot  it was autumn but not the season suggested to the atlantic reader under that title the sharply defined boundaries of the wet and dry seasons were prefigured in the clear outlines of the distant hills in the dry atmosphere the decay of vegetation was too rapid for the slow hectic which overtakes an eastern landscape or else nature was too practical for such thin disguises she merely turned the hippocratic face to the spectator with the old diagnosis of death in her sharp contracted features  in the contemplation of such a prospect there was little to excite any but a morbid fancy there were no clouds  in the flinty blue heavens and the setting of the sun was accompanied with as little ostentation as was consistent with the dryly practical atmosphere darkness soon followed with a rising wind which increased as the shadows deepened on the plain the fringe of alder by the watercourse began to loom up as i urged my horse forward a halfhours active spurring brought me to a corral and a little beyond a house so low and broad it seemed at first sight to be half buried in the earth  my second impression was that it had grown out of the soil like some monstrous vegetable its dreary proportions were so in keeping with the vast prospect there were no recesses along its roughly boarded walls for vagrant and unprofitable shadows to lurk in the daily sunshine no projection for the wind by night to grow musical over to wail whistle or whisper to only a long wooden shelf containing a chillylooking tin basin and a bar of soap its uncurtained windows were red with the sinking sun as though bloodshot and inflamed from a too long unlidded existence the tracks of cattle led to its front door firmly closed against the rattling wind  to avoid being confounded with this familiar element i walked to the rear of the house which was connected with a smaller building by a slight platform a grizzled hardfaced old man was standing there and met my salutation with a look of inquiry and without speaking led the way to the principal room as i entered four young men who were reclining by the fire slightly altered their attitudes of perfect repose but beyond that betrayed neither curiosity nor interest a hound started from a dark corner with a growl but was immediately kicked by the old man into obscurity and silenced  again i cant tell why but i instantly received the impression that for a long time the group by the fire had not uttered a word or moved a muscle taking a seat i briefly stated my business    was a united states surveyor had come on account of the espiritu santo rancho wanted to correct the exterior boundaries of township lines so as to connect with the near exteriors of private grants there had been some intervention to the old survey by a mr tryan who had preempted adjacentsettled land warrants interrupted the old man ah yes land warrantsand then this was mr tryan  i had spoken mechanically for i was preoccupied in connecting other public lines with private surveys as i looked in his face it was certainly a hard face and reminded me of the singular effect of that mining operation known as ground sluicing the harder lines of underlying character were exposed and what were once plastic curves and soft outlines were obliterated by some powerful agency  there was a dryness in his voice not unlike the prevailing atmosphere of the valley as he launched into an ex parte statement of the contest with a fluency which like the wind without showed frequent and unrestrained expression he told mewhat i had already learned that the boundary line of the old spanish grant was a creek described in the loose phraseology of the deseno as beginning in the valda or skirt of the hill its precise location long the subject of litigation i listened and answered with little interest for my mind was still distracted by the wind which swept violently by the house as well as by his odd face which was again reflected in the resemblance that the silent group by the fire bore toward him he was still talking and the wind was yet blowing when my confused attention was aroused by a remark addressed to the recumbent figures  now then which on yell see the stranger up the creek to altascars tomorrow  there was a general movement of opposition in the group but no decided answer  kin you go kerg  whos to look up stock in strarberry perarie  this seemed to imply a negative and the old man turned to another hopeful who was pulling the fur from a mangy bearskin on which he was lying with an expression as though it were somebodys hair  well tom wots to hinder you from goin  mams goin to browns store at sunup and i spose ive got to pack her and the baby again  i think the expression of scorn this unfortunate youth exhibited for the filial duty into which he had been evidently beguiled was one of the finest things i had ever seen  wise  wise deigned no verbal reply but figuratively thrust a worn and patched boot into the discourse the old man flushed quickly  i told ye to get brown to give you a pair the last time you war down the river  said he wouldnt without an order said it was like pulling gumteeth to get the money from you even then  there was a grim smile at this local hit at the old mans parsimony and wise who was clearly the privileged wit of the family sank back in honorable retirement  well joe ef your boots are new and you arent pestered with wimmin and children praps youll go said tryan with a nervous twitching intended for a smile about a mouth not remarkably mirthful  tom lifted a pair of bushy eyebrows and said shortly  got no saddle  wots gone of your saddle  kerg there indicating his brother with a look such as cain might have worn at the sacrifice  you lie returned kerg cheerfully  tryan sprang to his feet seizing the chair flourishing it  around his head and gazing furiously in the hard young faces which fearlessly met his own but it was only for a moment his arm soon dropped by his side and a look of hopeless fatality crossed his face he allowed me to take the chair from his hand and i was trying to pacify him by the assurance that i required no guide when the irrepressible wise again lifted his voice  theers george comin why dont ye ask him hell go and introduce you to don fernandys darter too ef you aint pertickler  the laugh which followed this joke which evidently had some domestic allusion the general tendency of rural pleasantry was followed by a light step on the platform and the young man entered seeing a stranger present he stopped and colored made a shy salute and colored again and then drawing a box from the corner sat down his hands clasped tightly together and his very handsome bright blue eyes turned frankly on mine  perhaps i was in a condition to receive the romantic impression he made upon me and i took it upon myself to ask his company as guide and he cheerfully assented but some domestic duty called him presently away  the fire gleamed brightly on the hearth and no longer resisting the prevailing influence i silently watched the spirting flame listening to the wind which continually shook the tenement besides the one chair which had acquired a new importance in my eyes i presently discovered a crazy table in one corner with an inkbottle and pen the latter in that greasy state of decomposition peculiar to country taverns and farmhouses a goodly array of rifles and doublebarreled guns stocked the corner half a dozen saddles and blankets lay near with a mild flavor of the horse about them some deer and bear skins completed the inventory as i sat there with the silent group around me the shadowy gloom within and the dominant wind  without i found it difficult to believe i had ever known a different existence my profession had often led me to wilder scenes but rarely among those whose unrestrained habits and easy unconsciousness made me feel so lonely and uncomfortable i shrank closer to myself not without grave doubtswhich i think occur naturally to people in like situations that this was the general rule of humanity and i was a solitary and somewhat gratuitous exception  it was a relief when a laconic announcement of supper by a weakeyed girl caused a general movement in the family we walked across the dark platform which led to another lowceiled room its entire length was occupied by a table at the further end of which a weakeyed woman was already taking her repast as she at the same time gave nourishment to a weakeyed baby as the formalities of introduction had been dispensed with and as she took no notice of me i was enabled to slip into a seat without discomposing or interrupting her tryan extemporized a grace and the attention of the family became absorbed in bacon potatoes and dried apples  the meal was a sincere one gentle gurglings at the upper end of the table often betrayed the presence of the wellspring of pleasure the conversation generally referred to the labors of the day and comparing notes as to the whereabouts of missing stock yet the supper was such a vast improvement upon the previous intellectual feast that when a chance allusion of mine to the business of my visit brought out the elder tryan the interest grew quite exciting i remember he inveighed bitterly against the system of ranchholding by the greasers as he was pleased to term the native californians as the same ideas have been sometimes advanced under more pretentious circumstances they may be worthy of record  look at em holdin the finest grazin land that ever lay outer doors whars the papers for it was it grants    mighty fine grantsmost of em made arter the merrikans got possession more fools the merrikans for lettin em hold em wat paid for em merrikan blood and money  didnt they oughter have suthin out of their native country wot for did they ever improve got a lot of yallerskinned diggers not so sensible as niggers to look arter stock and they asittin home and smokin with their gold and silver candlesticks and missions and crucifixens priests and graven idols and sich them sort things wurent allowed in mizzoori  at the mention of improvements i involuntarily lifted my eyes and met the halflaughing halfembarrassed look of george the act did not escape detection and i had at once the satisfaction of seeing that the rest of the family had formed an offensive alliance against us  it was agin nater and agin god added tryan god never intended gold in the rocks to be made into heathen candlesticks and crucifixens thats why he sent merrikans here nater never intended such a climate for lazy lopers she never gin six months sunshine to be slept and smoked away  how long he continued and with what further illustration i could not say for i took an early opportunity to escape to the sittingroom i was soon followed by george who called me to an open door leading to a smaller room and pointed to a bed  youd better sleep there tonight he said youll be more comfortable and ill call you early  i thanked him and would have asked him several questions which were then troubling me but he shyly slipped to the door and vanished  a shadow seemed to fall on the room when he had gone the boys returned one by one and shuffled to their old places a larger log was thrown on the fire and the huge  chimney glowed like a furnace but it did not seem to melt or subdue a single line of the hard faces that it lit half an hour later the furs which had served as chairs by day undertook the nightly office of mattresses and each received its owners fulllength figure mr tryan had not returned and i missed george i sat there until wakeful and nervous i saw the fire fall and shadows mount the wall there was no sound but the rushing of the wind and the snoring of the sleepers at last feeling the place insupportable i seized my hat and opening the door ran out briskly into the night  the acceleration of my torpid pulse in the keen fight with the wind whose violence was almost equal to that of a tornado and the familiar faces of the bright stars above me i felt as a blessed relief i ran not knowing whither and when i halted the square outline of the house was lost in the alderbushes an uninterrupted plain stretched before me like a vast sea beaten flat by the force of the gale as i kept on i noticed a slight elevation toward the horizon and presently my progress was impeded by the ascent of an indian mound it struck me forcibly as resembling an island in the sea its height gave me a better view of the expanding plain but even here i found no rest the ridiculous interpretation tryan had given the climate was somehow sung in my ears and echoed in my throbbing pulse as guided by the stars i sought the house again  but i felt fresher and more natural as i stepped upon the platform the door of the lower building was open and the old man was sitting beside the table thumbing the leaves of a bible with a look in his face as though he were hunting up prophecies against the greaser i turned to enter but my attention was attracted by a blanketed figure lying beside the house on the platform the broad chest heaving with healthy slumber and the open honest face were familiar it was george who had given up his bed to  the stranger among his people i was about to wake him but he lay so peaceful and quiet i felt awed and hushed and i went to bed with a pleasant impression of his handsome face and tranquil figure soothing me to sleep                                       i was awakened the next morning from a sense of lulled repose and grateful silence by the cheery voice of george who stood beside my bed ostentatiously twirling a riata as if to recall the duties of the day to my sleepbewildered eyes i looked around me the wind had been magically laid and the sun shone warmly through the windows a dash of cold water with an extra chill on from the tin basin helped to brighten me it was still early but the family had already breakfasted and dispersed and a wagon winding far in the distance showed that the unfortunate tom had already packed his relatives away i felt more cheerfulthere are few troubles youth cannot distance with the start of a good nights rest after a substantial breakfast prepared by george in a few moments we were mounted and dashing down the plain  we followed the line of alder that defined the creek now dry and baked with summers heat but which in winter george told me overflowed its banks i still retain a vivid impression of that mornings ride the faroff mountains like silhouettes against the steelblue sky the crisp dry air and the expanding track before me animated often by the wellknit figure of george tryan musical with jingling spurs and picturesque with flying riata he rode a powerful native roan wildeyed untiring in stride and unbroken in nature alas the curves of beauty were concealed by the cumbrous machillas of the spanish saddle which levels all equine distinctions the single rein lay loosely on the cruel bit that can gripe and if need be crush the jaw it controls  again the illimitable freedom of the valley rises before  me as we again bear down into sunlit space can this be chuchu staid and respectable filly of american pedigreechuchu forgetful of plank roads and cobble stones wild with excitement twinkling her small white feet beneath me george laughs out of a cloud of dust give her her head dont you see she likes it and chuchu seems to like it and whether bitten by native tarantula into native barbarism or emulous of the roan blood asserts itself and in a moment the peaceful servitude of years is beaten out in the music of her clattering hoofs the creek widens to a deep gully we dive into it and up on the opposite side carrying a moving cloud of impalpable powder with us cattle are scattered over the plain grazing quietly or banded together in vast restless herds george makes a wide indefinite sweep with the riata as if to include them all in his vaqueros loop and says ours  about how many george  dont know  how many  well praps three thousand head says george reflecting we dont know takes five men to look em up and keep run  what are they worth  about thirty dollars a head  i make a rapid calculation and look my astonishment at the laughing george perhaps a recollection of the domestic economy of the tryan household is expressed in that look for george averts his eye and says apologetically  ive tried to get the old man to sell and build but you know he says it aint no use to settle down just yet we must keep movin in fact he built the shanty for that purpose lest titles should fall through and wed have to get up and move stakes farther down    suddenly his quick eye detects some unusual sight in a herd we are passing and with an exclamation he puts his roan into the centre of the mass i follow or rather chuchu darts after the roan and in a few moments we are in the midst of apparently inextricable horns and hoofs toro shouts george with vaquero enthusiasm and the band opens a way for the swinging riata i can feel their steaming breaths and their spume is cast on chuchus quivering flank  wild devilishlooking beasts are they not such shapes as jove might have chosen to woo a goddess nor such as peacefully range the downs of devon but lean and hungry cassiuslike bovines economically got up to meet the exigencies of a sixmonths rainless climate and accustomed to wrestle with the distracting wind and the blinding dust  thats not our brand says george theyre strange stock and he points to what my scientific eye recognizes as the astrological sign of venus deeply seared in the brown flanks of the bull he is chasing but the herd are closing round us with low mutterings and george has again recourse to the authoritative toro and with swinging riata divides the bossy bucklers on either side when we are free and breathing somewhat more easily i venture to ask george if they ever attack any one  never horsemensometimes footmen not through rage you know but curiosity they think a man and his horse are one and if they meet a chap afoot they run him down and trample him under hoof in the pursuit of knowledge but adds george heres the lower bench of the foothills and heres altascars corral and that white building you see yonder is the casa  a whitewashed wall inclosed a court containing another adobe building baked with the solar beams of many summers leaving our horses in  the charge of a few peons  in the courtyard who were basking lazily in the sun we entered a low doorway where a deep shadow and an agreeable coolness fell upon us as sudden and grateful as a plunge in cool water from its contrast with the external glare and heat in the centre of a lowceiled apartment sat an old man with a black silk handkerchief tied about his head the few gray hairs that escaped from its folds relieving his gambogecolored face the odor of cigarritos was as incense added to the cathedral gloom of the building  as senor altascar rose with wellbred gravity to receive us george advanced with such a heightened color and such a blending of tenderness and respect in his manner that i was touched to the heart by so much devotion in the careless youth in fact my eyes were still dazzled by the effect of the outer sunshine and at first i did not see the white teeth and black eyes of pepita who slipped into the corridor as we entered  it was no pleasant matter to disclose particulars of business which would deprive the old senor of the greater part of that land we had just ridden over and i did it with great embarrassment but he listened calmlynot a muscle of his dark face stirringand the smoke curling placidly from his lips showed his regular respiration when i had finished he offered quietly to accompany us to the line of demarcation george had meanwhile disappeared but a suspicious conversation in broken spanish and english in the corridor betrayed his vicinity when he returned again a little absentminded the old man by far the coolest and most selfpossessed of the party extinguished his black silk cap beneath that stiff uncomely sombrero which all native californians affect a serapa thrown over his shoulders hinted that he was waiting horses are always ready saddled in spanish ranchos and in half an hour from the time of our arrival we were again loping in the staring sunlight    but not as cheerfully as before george and myself were weighed down by restraint and altascar was gravely quiet to break the silence and by way of a consolatory essay i hinted to him that there might be further intervention or appeal but the proffered oil and wine were returned with a careless shrug of the shoulders and a sententious que bueno your courts are always just  the indian mound of the previous nights discovery was a bearing monument of the new line and there we halted we were surprised to find the old man tryan waiting us for the first time during our interview the old spaniard seemed moved and the blood rose in his yellow cheek i was anxious to close the scene and pointed out the corner boundaries as clearly as my recollection served  the deputies will be here tomorrow to run the lines from this initial point and there will be no further trouble i believe gentlemen  senor altascar had dismounted and was gathering a few tufts of dried grass in his hands george and i exchanged glances he presently arose from his stooping posture and advancing to within a few paces of joseph tryan said in a voice broken with passion  and i fernando jesus maria altascar put you in possession of my land in the fashion of my country  he threw a sod to each of the cardinal points  i dont know your courts your judges or your corregidores take the llanoand take this with it may the drought seize your cattle till their tongues hang down as long as those of your lying lawyers may it be the curse and torment of your old age as you and yours have made it of mine  we stepped between the principal actors in this scene which only the passion of altascar made tragical but tryan with a humility but ill concealing his triumph interrupted  let him curse on he ll find em coming home to him sooner than the cattle he has lost through his sloth and pride the lord is on the side of the just as well as agin all slanderers and revilers  altascar but half guessed the meaning of the missourian yet sufficiently to drive from his mind all but the extravagant power of his native invective  stealer of the sacrament open notopen not i say your lying judas lips to me ah halfbreed with the soul of a coyotecarrr ramba  with his passion reverberating among the consonants like distant thunder he laid his hand upon the mane of his horse as though it had been the gray locks of his adversary swung himself into the saddle and galloped away  george turned to me  will you go back with us tonight  i thought of the cheerless walls the silent figures by the fire and the roaring wind and hesitated  well then goodby  goodby george  another wring of the hands and we parted i had not ridden far when i turned and looked back the wind had risen early that afternoon and was already sweeping across the plain a cloud of dust traveled before it and a picturesque figure occasionally emerging therefrom was my last indistinct impression of george tryan     part ii  in the flood   three months after the survey of the espiritu santo rancho i was again in the valley of the sacramento but a general and terrible visitation had erased the memory of that event as completely as i supposed it had obliterated  the boundary monuments i had planted the great flood of 186162 was at its height when obeying some indefinite yearning i took my carpetbag and embarked for the inundated valley  there was nothing to be seen from the bright cabin windows of the golden city but night deepening over the water the only sound was the pattering rain and that had grown monotonous for the past two weeks and did not disturb the national gravity of my countrymen as they silently sat around the cabin stove some on errands of relief to friends and relatives wore anxious faces and conversed soberly on the one absorbing topic others like myself attracted by curiosity listened eagerly to newer details but with that human disposition to seize upon any circumstance that might give chance event the exaggerated importance of instinct i was half conscious of something more than curiosity as an impelling motive  the dripping of rain the low gurgle of water and a leaden sky greeted us the next morning as we lay beside the halfsubmerged levee of sacramento here however the novelty of boats to convey us to the hotels was an appeal that was irresistible i resigned myself to a dripping rubbercased mariner called joe and wrapping myself in a shining cloak of the like material about as suggestive of warmth as courtplaster might have been took my seat in the stern sheets of his boat it was no slight inward struggle to part from the steamer that to most of the passengers was the only visible connecting link between us and the dry and habitable earth but we pulled away and entered the city stemming a rapid current as we shot the levee  we glided up the long level of k streetonce a cheerful busy thoroughfare now distressing in its silent desolation the turbid water which seemed to meet the horizon edge before us flowed at right angles in sluggish rivers  through the streets nature had revenged herself on the local taste by disarraying the regular rectangles by huddling houses on street corners where they presented abrupt gables to the current or by capsizing them in compact ruin crafts of all kinds were gliding in and out of lowarched doorways the water was over the top of the fences surrounding wellkept gardens in the first stories of hotels and private dwellings trailing its slime on velvet carpets as well as roughly boarded floors and a silence quite as suggestive as the visible desolation was in the voiceless streets that no longer echoed to carriagewheel or footfall the low ripple of water the occasional splash of oars or the warning cry of boatmen were the few signs of life and habitation  with such scenes before my eyes and such sounds in my ears as i lie lazily in the boat is mingled the song of my gondolier who sings to the music of his oars it is not quite as romantic as his brother of the lido might improvise but my yankee giuseppe has the advantage of earnestness and energy and gives a graphic description of the terrors of the past week and of noble deeds of selfsacrifice and devotion occasionally pointing out a balcony from which some california bianca or laura had been snatched halfclothed and famished giuseppe is otherwise peculiar and refuses the proffered fare foram i not a citizen of san francisco which was first to respond to the suffering cry of sacramento and is not he giuseppe a member of the howard society no giuseppe is poor but cannot take my money still if i must spend it there is the howard society and the women and children without food and clothing at the agricultural hall  i thank the generous gondolier and we go to the halla dismal bleak place ghastly with the memories of last years opulence and plentyand here giuseppes fare is swelled by the strangers mite but here giuseppe tells  me of the relief boat which leaves for the flooded district in the interior and here profiting by the lesson he has taught me i make the resolve to turn my curiosity to the account of others and am accepted of those who go forth to succor and help the afflicted giuseppe takes charge of my carpetbag and does not part from me until i stand on the slippery deck of relief boat no 3  an hour later i am in the pilothouse looking down upon what was once the channel of a peaceful river but its banks are only defined by tossing tufts of willow washed by the long swell that breaks over a vast inland sea stretches of tule land fertilized by its once regular channel and dotted by nourishing ranchos are now cleanly erased the cultivated profile of the old landscape had faded dotted lines in symmetrical perspective mark orchards that are buried and chilled in the turbid flood the roofs of a few farmhouses are visible and here and there the smoke curling from chimneys of halfsubmerged tenements shows an undaunted life within cattle and sheep are gathered on indian mounds waiting the fate of their companions whose carcases drift by us or swing in eddies with the wrecks of barns and outhouses wagons are stranded everywhere where the tide could carry them as i wipe the moistened glass i see nothing but water pattering on the deck from the lowering clouds dashing against the window dripping from the willows hissing by the wheels everywhere washing coiling sapping hurrying in rapids or swelling at last into deeper and vaster lakes awful in their suggestive quiet and concealment  as day fades into night the monotony of this strange prospect grows oppressive i seek the engineroom and in the company of some of the few halfdrowned sufferers we have already picked up from temporary rafts i forget the general aspect of desolation in their individual misery later we meet the san francisco packet and transfer a  number of our passengers from them we learn how inwardbound vessels report to having struck the welldefined channel of the sacramento fifty miles beyond the bar there is a voluntary contribution taken among the generous travelers for the use of our afflicted and we part company with a hearty god speed on either side but our signal lights are not far distant before a familiar sound comes back to us an indomitable yankee cheerwhich scatters the gloom  our course is altered and we are steaming over the obliterated banks far in the interior once or twice black objects loom up near usthe wrecks of houses floating by there is a slight rift in the sky towards the north and a few bearing stars to guide us over the waste as we penetrate into shallower water it is deemed advisable to divide our party into smaller boats and diverge over the submerged prairie i borrow a peacoat of one of the crew and in that practical disguise am doubtfully permitted to pass into one of the boats we give way northerly it is quite dark yet although the rift of cloud has widened  it must have been about three oclock and we were lying upon our oars in an eddy formed by a clump of cottonwood and the light of the steamer is a solitary bright star in the distance when the silence is broken by the bow oar  light ahead  all eyes are turned in that direction in a few seconds a twinkling light appears shines steadily and again disappears as if by the shifting position of some black object apparently drifting close upon us  stern alla steamer  hold hard there steamer be dd is the reply of the coxswain its a house and a big one too  it is a big one looming in the starlight like a huge fragment of the darkness the light comes from a single  candle which shines through a window as the great shape swings by some recollection is drifting back to me with it as i listen with beating heart  theres some one in it by heavens give way boyslay her alongside handsomely now the doors fastened try the window no heres another  in another moment we are trampling in the water which washes the floor to the depth of several inches it is a large room at the farther end of which an old man is sitting wrapped in a blanket holding a candle in one hand and apparently absorbed in the book he holds with the other i spring toward him with an exclamation  joseph tryan  he does not move we gather closer to him and i lay my hand gently on his shoulder and say  look up old man look up your wife and children where are they the boysgeorge are they here are they safe  he raises his head slowly and turns his eyes to mine and we involuntarily recoil before his look it is a calm and quiet glance free from fear anger or pain but it somehow sends the blood curdling through our veins he bowed his head over his book again taking no further notice of us the men look at me compassionately and hold their peace i make one more effort  joseph tryan dont you know methe surveyor who surveyed your ranchthe espiritu santo look up old man  he shuddered and wrapped himself closer in his blanket presently he repeated to himself the surveyor who surveyed your ranch espiritu santo over and over again as though it were a lesson he was trying to fix in his memory  i was turning sadly to the boatmen when he suddenly caught me fearfully by the hand and said  hush  we were silent  listen he puts his arm around my neck and whispers in my ear im amoving off  moving off  hush dont speak so loud moving off ah wots that dont you heartherelisten  we listen and hear the water gurgle and click beneath the floor  its them wot he sent iold altascar sent theyve been here all night i heard em first in the creek when they came to tell the old man to move farther off they came nearer and nearer they whispered under the door and i saw their eyes on the steptheir cruel hard eyes ah why dont they quit  i tell the men to search the room and see if they can find any farther traces of the family while tryan resumes his old attitude it is so much like the figure i remember on the breezy night that a superstitious feeling is fast overcoming me when they have returned i tell them briefly what i know of him and the old man murmurs again  why dont they quit then they have the stockall gonegone gone for the hides and hoofs and he groans bitterly  there are other boats below us the shanty cannot have drifted far and perhaps the family are safe by this time says the coxswain hopefully  we lift the old man up for he is quite helpless and carry him to the boat he is still grasping the bible in his right hand though its strengthening grace is blank to his vacant eye and he cowers in the stern as we pull slowly to the steamer while a pale gleam in the sky shows the coming day  i was weary with excitement and when we reached the steamer and i had seen joseph tryan comfortably bestowed i wrapped myself in a blanket near the boiler and presently fell asleep but even then the figure of the old man often started before me and a sense of uneasiness about george made a strong undercurrent to my drifting dreams i was awakened at about eight oclock in the morning by the engineer who told me one of the old mans sons had been picked up and was now on board  is it george tryan i ask quickly  dont know but hes a sweet one whoever he is adds the engineer with a smile at some luscious remembrance youll find him forard  i hurry to the bow of the boat and find not george but the irrepressible wise sitting on a coil of rope a little dirtier and rather more dilapidated than i can remember having seen him  he is examining with apparent admiration some rough dry clothes that have been put out for his disposal i cannot help thinking that circumstances have somewhat exalted his usual cheerfulness he puts me at ease by at once addressing me  these are high old times aint they i say what do you reckons become o them thar boundry moniments you stuck ah  the pause which succeeds this outburst is the effect of a spasm of admiration at a pair of high boots which by great exertion he has at last pulled on his feet  so youve picked up the ole man in the shanty clean crazy he must have been soft to have stuck there instead o leavin with the old woman did nt know me from adam took me for george  at this affecting instance of paternal forgetfulness wise was evidently divided between amusement and chagrin i took advantage of the contending emotions to ask about george  dont know whar he is if hed tended stock instead  of running about the prairie packin off wimmin and children he might have saved suthin he lost every hoof and hide ill bet a cooky say you to a passing boatman when are you goin to give us some grub im hungry nough to skin and eat a hoss reckon ill turn butcher when things is dried up and save hides horns and taller  i could not but admire this indomitable energy which under softer climatic influences might have borne such goodly fruit  have you any idea what youll do wise i ask  thar aint much to do now says the practical young man ill have to lay over a spell i reckon till things comes straight the land aint worth much now and wont be i dessay for some time wonder whar the ole manll drive stakes next  i meant as to your father and george wise  oh the ole man and ill go on to miless whar tom packed the old woman and babies last week georgell turn up somewhar atween this and altascars ef he aint thar now  i ask how the altascars have suffered  well i reckon he aint lost much in stock i shouldnt wonder if george helped him drive em up the foothills and his casas built too high oh thar aint any water thar you bet ah says wise with reflective admiration those greasers aint the darned fools people thinks em ill bet thar aint one swamped out in all er californy but the appearance of grub cut this rhapsody short  i shall keep on a little farther i say and try to find george  wise stared a moment at this eccentricity until a new light dawned upon him  i dont think youll save much whats the percentageworkin on shares eh  i answer that i am only curious which i feel lessens his  opinion of me and with a sadder feeling than his assurance of georges safety might warrant i walked away  from others whom we picked up from time to time we heard of georges selfsacrificing devotion with the praises of the many he had helped and rescued but i did not feel disposed to return until i had seen him and soon prepared myself to take a boat to the lower valda of the foothills and visit altascar i soon perfected my arrangements bade farewell to wise and took a last look at the old man who was sitting by the furnace fires quite passive and composed then our boathead swung round pulled by sturdy and willing hands  it was again raining and a disagreeable wind had risen our course lay nearly west and we soon knew by the strong current that we were in the creek of the espiritu santo from time to time the wrecks of barns were seen and we passed many halfsubmerged willows hung with farming implements  we emerge at last into a broad silent sea it is the llano de espiritu santo as the wind whistles by me piling the shallower fresh water into mimic waves i go back in fancy to the long ride of october over that boundless plain and recall the sharp outlines of the distant hills which are now lost in the lowering clouds the men are rowing silently and i find my mind released from its tension growing benumbed and depressed as then the water too is getting more shallow as we leave the banks of the creek and with my hand dipped listlessly over the thwarts i detect the tops of chimisal which shows the tide to have somewhat fallen there is a black mound bearing to the north of the line of alder making an adverse current which as we sweep to the right to avoid it i recognize we pull close alongside and i call to the men to stop  there was a stake driven near its summit with the initials l e s i tied halfway down was a curiously worked riata it was  georges it had been cut with some sharp instrument and the loose gravelly soil of the mound was deeply dented with horses hoofs the stake was covered with horsehairs it was a record but no clue  the wind had grown more violent as we still fought our way forward resting and rowing by turns and oftener poling the shallower surface but the old valda or bench is still distant my recollection of the old survey enables me to guess the relative position of the meanderings of the creek and an occasional simple professional experiment to determine the distance gives my crew the fullest faith in my ability night overtakes us in our impeded progress our condition looks more dangerous than it really is but i urge the men many of whom are still new in this mode of navigation to greater exertion by assurance of perfect safety and speedy relief ahead we go on in this way until about eight oclock and ground by the willows we have a muddy walk for a few hundred yards before we strike a dry trail and simultaneously the white walls of altascars appear like a snowbank before us lights are moving in the courtyard but otherwise the old tomblike repose characterizes the building  one of the peons recognized me as i entered the court and altascar met me on the corridor  i was too weak to do more than beg his hospitality for the men who had dragged wearily with me he looked at my hand which still unconsciously held the broken riata i began wearily to tell him about george and my fears but with a gentler courtesy than was even his wont he gravely laid his hand on my shoulder  poco a poco senornot now you are tired you have hunger you have cold necessary it is you should have peace  he took us into a small room and poured out some french  cognac which he gave to the men that had accompanied me they drank and threw themselves before the fire in the larger room the repose of the building was intensified that night and i even fancied that the footsteps on the corridor were lighter and softer the old spaniards habitual gravity was deeper we might have been shut out from the world as well as the whistling storm behind those ancient walls with their timeworn inheritor  before i could repeat my inquiry he retired in a few minutes two smoking dishes of chupa with coffee were placed before us and my men ate ravenously i drank the coffee but my excitement and weariness kept down the instincts of hunger  i was sitting sadly by the fire when he reentered  you have eat  i said yes to please him  bueno eat when you canfood and appetite are not always  he said this with that sancholike simplicity with which most of his countrymen utter a proverb as though it were an experience rather than a legend and taking the riata from the floor held it almost tenderly before him  it was made by me senor  i kept it as a clue to him don altascar i said if i could find him  he is here  here andbut i could not say well i understood the gravity of the old mans face the hushed footfalls the tomblike repose of the building in an electric flash of consciousness i held the clue to the broken riata at last altascar took my hand and we crossed the corridor to a sombre apartment a few tall candles were burning in sconces before the window  in an alcove there was a deep bed with its counterpane pillows and sheets heavily edged with lace in all that  splendid luxury which the humblest of these strange people lavish upon this single item of their household i stepped beside it and saw george lying as i had seen him one before peacefully at rest but a greater sacrifice than that he had known was here and his generous heart was stilled forever  he was honest and brave said the old man and turned away  there was another figure in the room a heavy shawl drawn over her graceful outline and her long black hair hiding the hands that buried her downcast face i did not seem to notice her and retiring presently left the loving and loved together  when we were again beside the crackling fire in the shifting shadows of the great chamber altascar told me how he had that morning met the horse of george tryan  swimming on the prairie how that farther on he found him lying quite cold and dead with no marks or bruises on his person that he had probably become exhausted in fording the creek and that he had as probably reached the mound only to die for want of that help he had so freely given to others that as a last act he had freed his horse these incidents were corroborated by many who collected in the great chamber that eveningwomen and children most of them succored through the devoted energies of him who lay cold and lifeless above  he was buried in the indian moundthe single spot of strange perennial  greenness which the poor aborigines had raised above the dusty plain a little slab of sandstone with the initials g t is his monument and one of the bearings of the initial corner of the new survey of the espiritu santo rancho      waiting for the ship  a fort point idyl   about an hours ride from the plaza there is a high bluff with the ocean breaking uninterruptedly along its rocky beach there are several cottages on the sands which look as if they had recently been cast up by a heavy sea the cultivated patch behind each tenement is fenced in by bamboos broken spars and driftwood with its few green cabbages and turniptops each garden looks something like an aquarium with the water turned off in fact you would not be surprised to meet a merman digging among the potatoes or a mermaid milking a seacow hard by  near this place formerly arose a great semaphoric telegraph with its gaunt arms tossed up against the horizon it has been replaced by an observatory connected with an electric nerve to the heart of the great commercial city from this point the incoming ships are signaled and again checked off at the city exchange and while we are here looking for the expected steamer let me tell you a story  not long ago a simple hardworking mechanic had amassed sufficient by diligent labor in the mines to send home for his wife and two children he arrived in san francisco a month before the time the ship was due for he was a western man and had made the overland journey and knew little of ships or seas or gales he procured work in the city but as the time approached he would go to the shipping office regularly every day the month passed but the ship came not then a month and a week two weeks three weeks two months and then a year the rough patient face with soft lines overlying its hard features which had  become a daily apparition at the shippingagents then disappeared it turned  up one afternoon at the observatory as the setting sun relieved the operator  from his duties there was something so childlike and simple in the few  questions asked by this stranger touching his business that the operator spent  some time to explain when the mystery of signals and telegraphs was unfolded  the stranger had one more question to ask how long might a vessel be absent  before they would give up expecting her the operator couldnt tell it would  depend on circumstances would it be a year yes it might be a year and  vessels had been given up for lost after two years and had come home the  stranger put his rough hand on the operators and thanked him for his  troubil and went away  still the ship came not stately clippers swept into the gate and merchantmen went by with colors flying and the welcoming gun of the steamer often reverberated among the hills then the patient face with the old resigned expression but a brighter wistful look in the eye was regularly met on the crowded decks of the steamer as she disembarked her living freight he may have had a dimly defined hope that the missing ones might yet come this way as only another road over that strange unknown expanse but he talked with ship captains and sailors and even this last hope seemed to fail when the careworn face and bright eyes were presented again at the observatory the operator busily engaged could not spare time to answer foolish interrogatories so he went away but as night fell he was seen sitting on the rocks with his face turned seaward and was seated there all that night when he became hopelessly insane for that was what the physicians said made his eyes so bright and wistful he was cared for by a fellow craftsman who had known his troubles    he was allowed to indulge his fancy of going out to watch for the ship in which she and the children were at night when no one else was watching he had made up his mind that the ship would come in at night this and the idea that he would relieve the operator who would be tired with watching all day seemed to please him so he went out and relieved the operator every night  for two years the ships came and went he was there to see the outwardbound clipper and greet her on her return he was known only by a few who frequented the place when he was missed at last from his accustomed spot a day or two elapsed before any alarm was felt one sunday a party of pleasureseekers clambering over the rocks were attracted by the barking of a dog that had run on before them when they came up they found a plainly dressed man lying there dead there were a few papers in his pocketchiefly slips cut from different journals of old marine memorandaand his face was turned towards the distant sea     a night at wingdam   i had been stageridden and bewildered all day and when we swept down with the darkness into the arcadian hamlet of wingdam i resolved to go no farther and rolled out in a gloomy and dyspeptic state the effects of a mysterious pie and some sweetened carbonic acid known to the proprietor of the halfway house as lemming sody still oppressed me even the facetia of the gallant expressman who knew everybodys christian name along the route who rained letters newspapers and bundles from the top of the stage whose legs frequently appeared in frightful proximity to the wheels who got on and off while we were going at full speed whose gallantry energy and superior knowledge of travel crushed all us other passengers to envious silence and who just then was talking with several persons and manifestly doing something else at the same timeeven this had failed to interest me so i stood gloomily clutching my shawl and carpetbag and watched the stage roll away taking a parting look at the gallant expressman as he hung on the top rail with one leg and lit his cigar from the pipe of a running footman i then turned toward the wingdam temperance hotel  it may have been the weather or it may have been the pie but i was not impressed favorably with the house perhaps it was the name extending the whole length of the building with a letter under each window making the people who looked out dreadfully conspicuous perhaps it was that temperance always suggested to my mind rusks and weak tea it was uninviting it might have  been called the total abstinence hotel from the lack of anything to intoxicate or inthrall the senses it was designed with an eye to artistic dreariness it was so much too large for the settlement that it appeared to be a very slight improvement on outdoors it was unpleasantly new there was the forest flavor of dampness about it and a slight spicing of pine nature outraged but not entirely subdued sometimes broke out afresh in little round sticky resinous tears on the doors and windows it seemed to me that boarding there must seem like a perpetual picnic as i entered the door a number of the regular boarders rushed out of a long room and set about trying to get the taste of something out of their mouths by the application of tobacco in various forms a few immediately ranged themselves around the fireplace with their legs over each others chairs and in that position silently resigned themselves to indigestion remembering the pie i waived the invitation of the landlord to supper but suffered myself to be conducted into the sittingroom mine host was a magnificent looking heavily bearded specimen of the animal man he reminded me of somebody or something connected with the drama i was sitting beside the fire mutely wondering what it could be and trying to follow the particular chord of memory thus touched into the intricate past when a little delicatelooking woman appeared at the door and leaning heavily against the casing said in an exhausted tone husband as the landlord turned toward her that particular remembrance flashed before me in a single line of blank verse it was this two souls with but one single thought two hearts that beat as one  it was ingomar and parthenia his wife i imagined a different denouement from the play ingomar had taken parthenia back to the mountains and kept a hotel for the benefit of the alemanni who resorted there in large numbers poor parthenia was pretty well fagged out and did  all the work without help she had two young barbarians a boy and a girl she was faded but still goodlooking  i sat and talked with ingomar who seemed perfectly at home and told me several stories of the alemanni all bearing a strong flavor of the wilderness and being perfectly in keeping with the house how he ingomar had killed a certain dreadful bar whose skin was just up yar over his bed how he ingomar had killed several bucks whose skins had been prettily fringed and embroidered by parthenia and even now clothed him how he ingomar had killed several injins and was once nearly scalped himself all this with that ingenious candor which is perfectly justifiable in a barbarian but which a greek might feel inclined to look upon as blowing thinking of the wearied parthenia i began to consider for the first time that perhaps she had better married the old greek then she would at least have always looked neat then she would not have worn a woolen dress flavored with all the dinners of the past year then she would not have been obliged to wait on the table with her hair half down then the two children would not have hung about her skirts with dirty fingers palpably dragging her down day by day i suppose it was the pie which put such heartless and improper ideas in my head and so i rose up and told ingomar i believed id go to bed preceded by that redoubtable barbarian and a flaring tallow candle i followed him upstairs to my room it was the only single room he had he told me he had built it for the convenience of married parties who might stop here but that event not happening yet he had left it half furnished it had cloth on one side and large cracks on the other the wind which always swept over wingdam at nighttime puffed through the apartment from different apertures the window was too small for the hole in the side of the house where it  hung and rattled noisily everything looked cheerless and dispiriting before ingomar left me he brought that barskin and throwing it over the solemn bier which stood in one corner told me he reckoned that would keep me warm and then bade me goodnight i undressed myself the light blowing out in the middle of that ceremony crawled under the barskin and tried to compose myself to sleep  but i was staringly wide awake i heard the wind sweep down the mountainside and toss the branches of the melancholy pine and then enter the house and try all the doors along the passage sometimes strong currents of air blew my hair all over the pillow as with strange whispering breaths the green timber along the walls seemed to be sprouting and sent a dampness even through the barskin i felt like robinson crusoe in his tree with the ladder pulled upor like the rocked baby of the nursery song after lying awake half an hour i regretted having stopped at wingdam at the end of the third quarter i wished i had not gone to bed and when a restless hour passed i got up and dressed myself there had been a fire down in the big room perhaps it was still burning i opened the door and groped my way along the passage vocal with the snores of the alemanni and the whistling of the night wind i partly fell downstairs and at last entering the big room saw the fire still burning i drew a chair toward it poked it with my foot and was astonished to see by the upspringing flash that parthenia was sitting there also holding a fadedlooking baby  i asked her why she was sitting up  she did not go to bed on wednesday night before the mail arrived and then she awoke her husband and there were passengers to tend to  did she not get tired sometimes  a little but abner the barbarians christian name  had promised to get her more help next spring if business was good  how many boarders had she  she believed about forty came to regular meals and there was transient custom which was as much as she and her husband could tend to but he did a great deal of work  what work  oh bringing in the wood and looking after the traders things how long had she been married  about nine years she had lost a little girl and boy three children living he was from illinois she from boston had an education boston female high schoolgeometry algebra a little latin and greek mother and father died came to illinois alone to teach school saw himyesa love match two souls etc etc married and emigrated to kansas thence across the plains to california always on the outskirts of civilization he liked it  she might sometimes have wished to go home would like to on account of her children would like to give them an education had taught them a little herself but couldnt do much on account of other work hoped that the boy would be like his father strong and hearty was fearful the girl would be more like her had often thought she was not fit for a pioneers wife  why  oh she was not strong enough and had seen some of his friends wives in kansas who could do more work but he never complainedhe was so kind two souls etc  sitting there with her head leaning pensively on one hand holding the poor wearied and limplooking baby wearily on the other arm dirty drabbled and forlorn with the firelight playing upon her features no longer fresh or  young but still refined and delicate and even in her grotesque slovenliness still bearing a faint reminiscence of birth and breeding it was not to be wondered that i did not fall into excessive raptures over the barbarians kindness emboldened by my sympathy she told me how she had given up little by little what she imagined to be the weakness of her early education until she found that she acquired but little strength in her new experience how translated to a backwoods society she was hated by the women and called proud and fine and how her dear husband lost popularity on that account with his fellows how led partly by his roving instincts and partly from other circumstances he started with her to california an account of that tedious journey how it was a dreary dreary waste in her memory only a blank plain marked by a little cairn of stonesa childs grave how she had noticed that little willie failed how she had called abners attention to it but man like he knew nothing about children and poohpoohed it and was worried by the stock how it happened that after they had passed sweetwater she was walking beside the wagon one night and looking at the western sky and she heard a little voice say mother how she looked into the wagon and saw that little willie was sleeping comfortably and did not wish to wake him how that in a few moments more she heard the same voice saying mother how she came back to the wagon and leaned down over him and felt his breath upon her face and again covered him up tenderly and once more resumed her weary journey beside him praying to god for his recovery how with her face turned to the sky she heard the same voice saying mother and directly a great bright star shot away from its brethren and expired and how she knew what had happened and ran to the wagon again only to pillow a little pinched and cold white face upon her weary bosom the thin red hands went up to her eyes here and for a few  moments she sat still the wind tore round the house and made a frantic rush at the front door and from his couch of skins in the inner room ingomar the barbarian snored peacefully  of course she always found a protector from insult and outrage in the great courage and strength of her husband  oh yes when ingomar was with her she feared nothing but she was nervous and had been frightened once  how  they had just arrived in california they kept house then and had to sell liquor to traders ingomar was hospitable and drank with everybody for the sake of popularity and business and ingomar got to like liquor and was easily affected by it and how one night there was a boisterous crowd in the barroom she went in and tried to get him away but only succeeded in awakening the coarse gallantry of the halfcrazed revelers and how when she had at last got him in the room with her frightened children he sank down on the bed in a stupor which made her think the liquor was drugged and how she sat beside him all night and near morning heard a step in the passage and looking toward the door saw the latch slowly moving up and down as if somebody were trying it and how she shook her husband and tried to waken him but without effect and how at last the door yielded slowly at the top it was bolted below as if by a gradual pressure without and how a hand protruded through the opening and how as quick as lightning she nailed that hand to the wall with her scissors her only weapon but the point broke and somebody got away with a fearful oath how she never told her husband of it for fear he would kill that somebody but how on one day a stranger called here and as she was handing him his coffee she saw a queer triangular scar on the back of his hand    she was still talking and the wind was still blowing and ingomar was still snoring from his couch of skins when there was a shout high up the straggling street and a clattering of hoofs and rattling of wheels the mail had arrived parthenia ran with the faded baby to awaken ingomar and almost simultaneously the gallant expressman stood again before me addressing me by my christian name and invited me to drink out of a mysterious black bottle the horses were speedily watered and the business of the gallant expressman concluded and bidding parthenia good by i got on the stage and immediately fell asleep and dreamt of calling on parthenia and ingomar and being treated with pie to an unlimited extent until i woke up the next morning in sacramento i have some doubts as to whether all this was not a dyspeptic dream but i never witness the drama and hear that noble sentiment concerning two souls etc without thinking of wingdam and poor parthenia                                                spanish and american legends                                            the legend of monte del diablo   the cautious reader will detect a lack of authenticity in the following pages i am not a cautious reader myself yet i confess with some concern to the absence of much documentary evidence in support of the singular incident i am about to relate disjointed memoranda the proceedings of ayuntamientos and early departmental juntas with other records of a primitive and superstitious people have been my inadequate authorities it is but just to state however that though this particular story lacks corroboration in ransacking the spanish archives of upper california i have met with many more surprising and incredible stories attested and supported to a degree that would have placed this legend beyond a cavil or doubt i have also never lost faith in the legend myself and in so doing have profited much from the examples of divers grantclaimants who have often jostled me in their more practical researches and who have my sincere sympathy at the skepticism of a modern hardheaded and practical world  for many years after father junipero serro first rang his bell in the wilderness of upper california the spirit which animated that adventurous priest did not wane the conversion of the heathen went on rapidly in the establishment of missions throughout the land so sedulously did the good fathers set about their work that around their isolated chapels there  presently arose adobe huts whose mud plastered and savage tenants partook regularly of the provisions and occasionally of the sacrament of their pious hosts nay so great was their progress that one zealous padre is reported to have administered the lords supper one sabhath morning to over three hundred heathen salvages it was not to be wondered that the enemy of souls being greatly incensed thereat and alarmed at his decreasing popularity should have grievously tempted and embarrassed these holy fathers as we shall presently see  yet they were happy peaceful days for california the vagrant keels of prying commerce had not as yet ruffled the lordly gravity of her bays no torn and ragged gulch betrayed the suspicion of golden treasure the wild oats drooped idly in the morning heat or wrestled with the afternoon breezes deer and antelope dotted the plain the watercourses brawled in their familiar channels nor dreamed of ever shifting their regular tide the wonders of the yosemite and calaveras were as yet unrecorded the holy fathers noted little of the landscape beyond the barbaric prodigality with which the quick soil repaid the sowing a new conversion the advent of a saints day or the baptism of an indian baby was at once the chronicle and marvel of their day  at this blissful epoch there lived at the mission of san pablo father jose antonio haro a worthy brother of the society of jesus he was of tall and cadaverous aspect a somewhat romantic history had given a poetic interest to his lugubrious visage while a youth pursuing his studies at famous salamanca he had become enamored of the charms of dona carmen de torrencevara as that lady passed to her matutinal devotions untoward circumstances hastened perhaps by a wealthier suitor brought this amour to a disastrous issue and father jose entered  a monastery taking upon himself the vows of celibacy it was here that his natural fervor and poetic enthusiasm conceived expression as a missionary a longing to convert the uncivilized heathen succeeded his frivolous earthly passion and a desire to explore and develop unknown fastnesses continually possessed him in his flashing eye and sombre exterior was detected a singular commingling of the discreet las casas and the impetuous balboa  fired by this pious zeal father jose went forward in the van of christian pioneers on reaching mexico he obtained authority to establish the mission of san pablo like the good junipero accompanied only by an acolyte and muleteer he unsaddled his mules in a dusky canon and rang his bell in the wilderness the savagesa peaceful inoffensive and inferior racepresently flocked around him the nearest military post was far away which contributed much to the security of these pious pilgrims who found their open trustfulness and amiability better fitted to repress hostility than the presence of an armed suspicious and brawling soldiery so the good father jose said matins and prime mass and vespers in the heart of sin and heathenism taking no heed to himself but looking only to the welfare of the holy church conversions soon followed and on the 7th of july 1760 the first indian baby was baptizedan event which as father jose piously records exceeds the richnesse of gold or precious jewels or the chancing upon the ophir of solomon i quote this incident as best suited to show the ingenious blending of poetry and piety which distinguished father joses record  the mission of san pablo progressed and prospered until the pious founder thereof like the infidel alexander might have wept that there were no more heathen worlds to conquer but his ardent and enthusiastic spirit could not long brook an idleness that seemed begotten of sin and one pleasant august morning in the year of grace 1770  father jose issued from the outer court of the mission building equipped to explore the field for new missionary labors  nothing could exceed the quiet gravity and unpretentiousness of the little cavalcade first rode a stout muleteer leading a packmule laden with the provisions of the party together with a few cheap crucifixes and hawks bells after him came the devout padre jose bearing his breviary and cross with a black serapa thrown around his shoulders while on either side trotted a dusky convert anxious to show a proper sense of his regeneration by acting as guide into the wilds of his heathen brethren their new condition was agreeably shown by the absence of the usual mudplaster which in their unconverted state they assumed to keep away vermin and cold the morning was bright and propitious before their departure mass had been said in the chapel and the protection of st ignatius invoked against all contingent evils but especially against bears which like the fiery dragons of old seemed to cherish unconquerable hostility to the holy church  as they wound through the canon charming birds disported upon boughs and sprays and sober quails piped from the alders the willowy watercourses gave a musical utterance and the long grass whispered on the hillside on entering the deeper defiles above them towered dark green masses of pine and occasionally the madrono shook its bright scarlet berries as they toiled up many a steep ascent father jose sometimes picked up fragments of scoria which spake to his imagination of direful volcanoes and impending earthquakes to the less scientific mind of the muleteer ignacio they had even a more terrifying significance and he once  or twice snuffed the air suspiciously and declared that it smelt of sulphur so the first day of their journey wore away and at night they encamped without having met a single heathen face    it was on this night that the enemy of souls appeared to ignacio in an appalling form he had retired to a secluded part of the camp and had sunk upon his knees in prayerful meditation when he looked up and perceived the archfiend in the likeness of a monstrous bear the evil one was seated on his hind legs immediately before him with his fore paws joined together just below his black muzzle wisely conceiving this remarkable attitude to be in mockery and derision of his devotions the worthy muleteer was transported with fury seizing an arquebus he instantly closed his eyes and fired when he had recovered from the effects of the terrific discharge the apparition had disappeared father jose awakened by the report reached the spot only in time to chide the muleteer for wasting powder and ball in a contest with one whom a single ave would have been sufficient to utterly discomfit what further reliance he placed on ignacios story is not known but in commemoration of a worthy californian custom the place was called la canada de la tentacion del pio muletero or the glen of the temptation of the pious muleteer a name which it retains to this day  the next morning the party issuing from a narrow gorge came upon a long valley sear and burnt with the shadeless heat its lower extremity was lost in a fading line of low hills which gathering might and volume toward the upper end of the valley upheaved a stupendous bulwark against the breezy north the peak of this awful spur was just touched by a fleecy cloud that shifted to and fro like a banneret father jose gazed at it with mingled awe and admiration by a singular coincidence the muleteer ignacio uttered the simple ejaculation diablo  as they penetrated the valley they soon began to miss the agreeable life and companionable echoes of the canon they had quitted huge fissures in the parched soil seemed to cane as with thirsty mouths a few squirrels darted  from the earth and disappeared as mysteriously before the jingly mules a gray wolf trotted leisurely along just ahead but whichever way father jose turned the mountain always asserted itself and arrested his wandering eye out of the dry and arid valley it seemed to spring into cooler and bracing life deep cavernous shadows dwelt along its base rocky fastnesses appeared midway of its elevation and on either side huge black hills diverged like massy roots from a central trunk his lively fancy pictured these hills peopled with a majestic and intelligent race of savages and looking into futurity he already saw a monstrous cross crowning the domelike summit far different were the sensations of the muleteer who saw in those awful solitudes only fiery dragons colossal bears and breakneck trails the converts concepcion and incarnacion trotting modestly beside the padre recognized perhaps some manifestation of their former weird mythology  at nightfall they reached the base of the mountain here father jose unpacked his mules said vespers and formally ringing his bell called upon the gentiles within hearing to come and accept the holy faith the echoes of the black frowning hills around him caught up the pious invitation and repeated it at intervals but no gentiles appeared that night nor were the devotions of the muleteer again disturbed although he afterward asserted that when the fathers exhortation was ended a mocking peal of laughter came from the mountain nothing daunted by these intimations of the near hostility of the evil one father jose declared his intention to ascend the mountain at early dawn and before the sun rose the next morning he was leading the way  the ascent was in many places difficult and dangerous huge fragments of rock often lay across the trail and after a few hours climbing they were forced to leave their mules in a little gully and continue the ascent afoot unaccustomed to such exertion  father jose often stopped to wipe the perspiration from his thin cheeks as the day wore on a strange silence oppressed them except the occasional pattering of a squirrel or a rustling in the chimisal bushes there were no signs of life the halfhuman print of a bears foot sometimes appeared before them at which ignacio always crossed himself piously the eye was sometimes cheated by a dripping from the rocks which on closer inspection proved to be a resinous oily liquid with an abominable sulphurous smell when they were within a short distance of the summit the discreet ignacio selecting a sheltered nook for the camp slipped aside and busied himself in preparations for the evening leaving the holy father to continue the ascent alone never was there a more thoughtless act of prudence never a more imprudent piece of caution without noticing the desertion buried in pious reflection father jose pushed mechanically on and reaching the summit cast himself down and gazed upon the prospect  below him lay a succession of valleys opening into each other like gentle lakes until they were lost to the southward westerly the distant range hid the bosky canada which sheltered the mission of san pablo in the farther distance the pacific ocean stretched away bearing a cloud of fog upon its bosom which crept through the entrance of the bay and rolled thickly between him and the northeastward  the same fog hid the base of the mountain and the view beyond still from time to time the fleecy veil parted and timidly disclosed charming glimpses of mighty rivers mountain defiles and rolling plains sear with ripened oats and bathed in the glow of the setting sun as father jose gazed he was penetrated with a pious longing already his imagination filled with enthusiastic conceptions beheld all that vast expanse gathered under the mild sway of the holy faith and peopled with zealous converts each little knoll in fancy became crowned with a chapel from each dark canon gleamed the white walls of a mission building growing bolder in his enthusiasm and looking farther into futurity he beheld a new spain rising on these savage shores he already saw the spires of stately cathedrals the domes of palaces vineyards gardens and groves convents half hid among the hills peeping from plantations of branching limes and long processions of chanting nuns wound through the denies so completely was the good fathers conception of the future confounded with the past that even in their choral strain the wellremembered accents of carmen struck his ear he was busied in these fanciful imaginings when suddenly over that extended prospect the faint distant tolling of a bell rang sadly out and died it was the angelus father jose listened with superstitious exaltation the mission of san pablo was far away and the sound must have been some miraculous omen but never before to his enthusiastic sense did the sweet seriousness of this angelic symbol come with such strange significance with the last faint peal his glowing fancy seemed to cool the fog closed in below him and the good father remembered he had not had his supper he had risen and was wrapping his serapa around him when he perceived for the first time that he was not alone  nearly opposite and where should have been the faithless ignacio a grave and decorous figure was seated his appearance was that of an elderly hidalgo dressed in mourning with mustaches of irongray carefully waxed and twisted round a pair of lanternjaws the monstrous hat and prodigious feather the enormous ruff and exaggerated trunkhose contrasted with a frame shriveled and wizened all belonged to a century previous yet father jose was not astonished his adventurous life and poetic imagination continually on the lookout for the marvelous gave him a certain advantage over the practical and materialminded    he instantly detected the diabolical quality of his visitant and was prepared with equal coolness and courtesy he met the cavaliers obeisance  i ask your pardon sir priest said the stranger for disturbing your meditations pleasant they must have been and right fanciful i imagine when occasioned by so fair a prospect  worldly perhaps sir devilfor such i take you to be said the holy father as the stranger bowed his black plumes to the ground worldly perhaps for it hath pleased heaven to retain even in our regenerated state much that pertaineth to the flesh yet still i trust not without some speculation for the welfare of the holy church in dwelling upon yon fair expanse mine eyes have been graciously opened with prophetic inspiration and the promise of the heathen as an inheritance hath marvelously recurred to me for there can be none lack such diligence in the true faith but may see that even the conversion of these pitiful salvages hath a meaning as the blessed st ignatius discreetly observes continued father jose clearing his throat and slightly elevating his voice the heathen is given to the warriors of christ even as the pearls of rare discovery which gladden the hearts of shipmen nay i might say  but here the stranger who had been wrinkling his brows and twisting his mustaches with wellbred patience took advantage of an oratorical pause  it grieves me sir priest to interrupt the current of your eloquence as discourteously as i have already broken your meditations but the day already waneth to night i have a matter of serious import to make with you could i entreat your cautious consideration a few moments  father jose hesitated the temptation was great and the prospect of acquiring some knowledge of the great enemys plans not the least trifling object and if the  truth must be told there was a certain decorum about the stranger that interested the padre though well aware of the protean shapes the archfiend could assume and though free from the weaknesses of the flesh father jose was not above the temptations of the spirit had the devil appeared as in the case of the pious st anthony in the likeness of a comely damsel the good father with his certain experience of the deceitful sex would have whisked her away in the saying of a paternoster but there was added to the security of age a grave sadness about the strangera thoughtful consciousness as of being at a great moral disadvantage which at once decided him on a magnanimous course of conduct  the stranger then proceeded to inform him that he had been diligently observing the holy fathers triumphs in the valley that far from being greatly exercised thereat he had been only grieved to see so enthusiastic and chivalrous an antagonist wasting his zeal in a hopeless work for he observed the issue of the great battle of good and evil had been otherwise settled as he would presently show him it wants but a few moments of night he continued and over this interval of twilight as you know i have been given complete control look to the west  as the padre turned the stranger took his enormous hat from his head and waved it three times before him at each sweep of the prodigious feather the fog grew thinner until it melted impalpably away and the former landscape returned yet warm with the glowing sun as father jose gazed a strain of martial music arose from the valley and issuing from a deep canon the good father beheld a long cavalcade of gallant cavaliers habited like his companion as they swept down the plain they were joined by like processions that slowly defiled from every ravine and canon of the mysterious mountain from time to time the peal of a trumpet swelled fitfully upon the breeze the cross of santiago glittered and the royal banners of castile and aragon waved over the moving column so they moved on solemnly toward the sea where in the distance father jose saw stately caravels bearing the same familiar banner awaiting them the good padre gazed with conflicting emotions and the serious voice of the stranger broke the silence  thou hast beheld sir priest the fading footprints of adventurous castile thou hast seen the declining glory of old spaindeclining as yonder brilliant sun the sceptre she hath wrested from the heathen is fast dropping from her decrepit and fleshless grasp the children she hath fostered shall know her no longer the soil she hath acquired shall be lost to her as irrevocably as she herself hath thrust the moor from her own granada  the stranger paused and his voice seemed broken by emotion at the same time father jose whose sympathizing heart yearned toward the departing banners cried in poignant accents  farewell ye gallant cavaliers and christian soldiers farewell thou juries de balboa thou alonzo de ojeda and thou most venerable las casas farewell and may heaven prosper still the seed ye left behind  then turning to the stranger father jose beheld him gravely draw his pockethandkerchief from the baskethilt of his rapier and apply it decorously to his eyes pardon this weakness sir priest said the cavalier apologetically but these worthy gentlemen were ancient friends of mine and have done me many a delicate servicemuch more perchance than these poor sables may signify he added with a grim gesture toward the mourning suit he wore  father jose was too much preoccupied in reflection to notice the equivocal nature of this tribute and after a few moments silence said as if continuing his thought  but the seed they have planted  shall thrive and prosper on this fruitful soil  as if answering the interrogatory the stranger turned to the opposite direction and again waving his hat said in the same serious tone look to the east  the father turned and as the fog broke away before the waving plume he saw that the sun was rising issuing with its bright beams through the passes of the snowy mountains beyond appeared a strange and motley crew instead of the dark and romantic visages of his last phantom train the father beheld with strange concern the blue eyes and flaxen hair of a saxon race in place of martial airs and musical utterance there rose upon the ear a strange din of harsh gutturals and singular sibilation instead of the decorous tread and stately mien of the cavaliers of the former vision they came pushing bustling panting and swaggering and as they passed the good father noticed that giant trees were prostrated as with the breath of a tornado and the bowels of the earth were torn and rent as with a convulsion and father jose looked in vain for holy cross or christian symbol there was but one that seemed an ensign and he crossed himself with holy horror as he perceived it bore the effigy of a bear  who are these swaggering ishmaelites he asked with something of asperity in his tone  the stranger was gravely silent  what do they here with neither cross nor holy symbol he again demanded  have you the courage to see sir priest responded the stranger quietly  father jose felt his crucifix as a lonely traveler might his rapier and assented  step under the shadow of my plume said the stranger  father jose stepped beside him and they instantly sank through the earth  when he opened his eyes which had remained closed in prayerful meditation during his rapid descent he found himself in a vast vault bespangled overhead with luminous points like the starred firmament it was also lighted by a yellow glow that seemed to proceed from a mighty sea or lake that occupied the centre of the chamber around this subterranean sea dusky figures flitted bearing ladles filled with the yellow fluid which they had replenished from its depths from this lake diverging streams of the same mysterious flood penetrated like mighty rivers the cavernous distance as they walked by the banks of this glittering styx father jose perceived how the liquid stream at certain places became solid the ground was strewn with glittering flakes one of these the padre picked up and curiously examined it was virgin gold  an expression of discomfiture overcast the good fathers face at this discovery but there was trace neither of malice nor satisfaction in the strangers air which was still of serious and fateful contemplation when father jose recovered his equanimity he said bitterly  this then sir devil is your work this is your deceitful lure for the weak souls of sinful nations so would you replace the christian grace of holy spain  this is what must be returned the stranger gloomily but listen sir priest it lies with you to avert the issue for a time leave me here in peace go back to castile and take with you your bells your images and your missions continue here and you only precipitate results stay promise me you will do this and you shall not lack that which will render your old age an ornament and a blessing and the stranger motioned significantly to the lake  it was here the legend discreetly relates that the devil showedas he always shows sooner or laterhis cloven hoof the worthy padre sorely perplexed by this threefold  vision and if the truth must he told a little nettled at this wresting away of the glory of holy spanish discovery had shown some hesitation but the unlucky bribe of the enemy of souls touched his castilian spirit starting hack in deep disgust he brandished his crucifix in the face of the unmasked fiend and in a voice that made the dusky vault resound cried  avaunt thee sathanas diaholus i defy thee what wouldst thou bribe meme a brother of the sacred society of the holy jesus licentiate of cordova and inquisitor of guadalaxara thinkest thou to buy me with thy sordid treasure avaunt  what might have been the issue of this rupture and how complete might have been the triumph of the holy father over the archfiend who was recoiling aghast at these sacred titles and the nourishing symbol we can never know for at that moment the crucifix slipped through his fingers  scarcely had it touched the ground before devil and holy father simultaneously cast themselves toward it in the struggle they clinched and the pious jose who was as much the superior of his antagonist in bodily as in spiritual strength was about to treat the great adversary to a back somersault when he suddenly felt the long nails of the stranger piercing his flesh a new fear seized his heart a numbing chillness crept through his body and he struggled to free himself but in vain a strange roaring was in his ears the lake and cavern danced before his eyes and vanished and with a loud cry he sank senseless to the ground  when he recovered his consciousness he was aware of a gentle swaying motion of his body he opened his eyes and saw it was high noon and that he was being carried in a litter through the valley he felt stiff and looking down perceived that his arm was tightly bandaged to his side  he closed his eyes and after a few words of thankful prayer thought how miraculously he had been preserved  and made a vow of candlesticks to the blessed saint jose he then called in a faint voice and presently the penitent ignacio stood beside him  the joy the poor fellow felt at his patrons returning consciousness for some time choked his utterance he could only ejaculate a miracle blessed saint jose he lives and kiss the padres bandaged hand father jose more intent on his last nights experience waited for his emotion to subside and asked where he had been found  on the mountain your reverence but a few varas from where he attacked you  howyou saw him then asked the padre in unfeigned astonishment  saw him your reverence mother of god i should think i did and your reverence shall see him too if he ever comes again within range of ignacios arquebus  what mean you ignacio said the padre sitting boltupright in his litter  why the bear your reverencethe bear holy father who attacked your worshipful person while you were meditating on the top of yonder mountain  ah said the holy father lying down again chut child i would be at peace  when he reached the mission he was tenderly cared for and in a few weeks was enabled to resume those duties from which as will be seen not even the machinations of the evil one could divert him the news of his physical disaster spread over the country and a letter to the bishop of guadalaxara contained a confidential and detailed account of the good fathers spiritual temptation but in some way the story leaked out arid long after jose was gathered to his fathers his mysterious encounter formed the theme of thrilling and whispered narrative the mountain was generally shunned it is true that senor joaquin pedrillo afterward located a grant near the base of the mountain but as senora pedrillo was known to be a termagant half breed the senor was not supposed to be overfastidious  such is the legend of monte del diablo as i said before it may seem to lack essential corroboration the discrepancy between the fathers narrative and the actual climax has given rise to some skepticism on the part of ingenious quibblers all such i would simply refer to that part of the report of senor julio serro subprefect of san pablo before whom attest of the above was made touching this matter the worthy prefect observes that although the body of father jose doth show evidence of grievous conflict in the flesh yet that is no proof that the enemy of souls who could assume the figure of a decorous elderly caballero could not at the same time transform himself into a bear for his own vile purposes     the right eye of the commander   the year of grace 1797 passed away on the coast of california in a southwesterly gale the little bay of san carlos albeit sheltered by the headlands of the blessed trinity was rough and turbulent its foam clung quivering to the seaward wall of the mission garden the air was filled with flying sand and spume and as the senor comandante hermenegildo salvatierra looked from the deep embrasured window of the presidio guardroom he felt the salt breath of the distant sea buffet a color into his smokedried cheeks  the commander i have said was gazing thoughtfully from the window of the guardroom he may have been reviewing the events of the year now about to pass away but like the garrison at the presidio there was little to review the year like its predecessors had been uneventfulthe days had slipped by in a delicious monotony of simple duties unbroken by incident or interruption the regularly recurring feasts and saints days the halfyearly courier from san diego the rare transportship and rarer foreign vessel were the mere details of his patriarchal life if there was no achievement there was certainly no failure abundant harvests and patient industry amply supplied the wants of presidio and mission isolated from the family of nations the wars which shook the world concerned them not so much as the last earthquake the struggle that emancipated their sister colonies on the other side of the continent to them had no suggestiveness in short it was that glorious indian summer of californian history around which so much poetical haze still lingersthat bland indolent autumn of spanish rule so soon to be followed by the wintry storms of mexican independence and the reviving spring of american conquest  the commander turned from the window and walked toward the fire that burned brightly on the deep ovenlike hearth a pile of copybooks the work of the presidio school lay on the table as he turned over the leaves with a paternal interest and surveyed the fair round scripture textthe first pious pothooks of the pupils of san carlos an audible commentary fell from his lips abimelech took her from abrahamah little one excellentjacob sent to see his brother body of christ that upstroke of thine paquita is marvelous the governor shall see it a film of honest pride dimmed the commanders left eyethe right alas twenty years before had been sealed by an indian arrow he rubbed it softly with the sleeve of his leather jacket and continued the ishmaelites having arrived  he stopped for there was a step in the courtyard a foot upon the threshold and a stranger entered with the instinct of an old soldier the commander after one glance at the intruder turned quickly toward the wall where his trusty toledo hung or should have been hanging but it was not there and as he recalled that the last time he had seen that weapon it was being ridden up and down the gallery by pepito the infant son of bautista the tortiliomaker he blushed and then contented himself with frowning upon the intruder  but the strangers air though irreverent was decidedly peaceful he was unarmed and wore the ordinary cape of tarpaulin and seaboots of a mariner except a villainous smell of codfish there was little about him that was peculiar  his name as he informed the commander in spanish  that was more fluent than elegant or precisehis name was peleg scudder he was master of the schooner general court of the port of salem in massachusetts on a trading voyage to the south seas but now driven by stress of weather into the bay of san carlos he begged permission to ride out the gale under the headlands of the blessed trinity and no more water he did not need having taken in a supply at bodega he knew the strict surveillance of the spanish port regulations in regard to foreign vessels and would do nothing against the severe discipline and good order of the settlement there was a slight tinge of sarcasm in his tone as he glanced toward the desolate parade ground of the presidio and the open unguarded gate the fact was that the sentry felipe gomez had discreetly retired to shelter at the beginning of the storm and was then sound asleep in the corridor  the commander hesitated the port regulations were severe but he was accustomed to exercise individual authority and beyond an old order issued ten years before regarding the american ship columbia there was no precedent to guide him the storm was severe and a sentiment of humanity urged him to grant the strangers request it is but just to the commander to say that his inability to enforce a refusal did not weigh with his decision he would have denied with equal disregard of consequences that right to a seventyfourgun ship which he now yielded so gracefully to this yankee trading schooner he stipulated only that there should be no communication between the ship and shore for yourself senor captain he continued accept my hospitality the fort is yours as long as you shall grace it with your distinguished presence and with oldfashioned courtesy he made the semblance of withdrawing from the guardroom  master peleg scudder smiled as he thought of the halfdismantled fort the two mouldy brass cannon cast in manila a century previous and the  shiftless garrison a wild thought of accepting the commanders offer literally conceived in the reckless spirit of a man who never let slip an offer for trade for a moment filled his brain but a timely reflection of the commercial unimportance of the transaction checked him he only took a capacious quid of tobacco as the commander gravely drew a settle before the fire and in honor of his guest untied the black silk handkerchief that bound his grizzled brows  what passed between salvatierra and his guest that night it becomes me not as a grave chronicler of the salient points of history to relate i have said that master peleg scudder was a fluent talker and under the influence of divers strong waters furnished by his host he became still more loquacious and think of a man with a twenty years budget of gossip the commander learned for the first time how great britain lost her colonies of the french revolution of the great napoleon whose achievements perhaps peleg colored more highly than the commanders superiors would have liked and when peleg turned questioner the commander was at his mercy he gradually made himself master of the gossip of the mission and presidio the small beer chronicles of that pastoral age the conversion of the heathen the presidio schools and even asked the commander how he had lost his eye it is said that at this point of the conversation master peleg produced from about his person divers small trinkets kickshaws and newfangled trifles and even forced some of them upon his host it is further alleged that under the malign influence of peleg and several glasses of aguardiente the commander lost somewhat of his decorum and behaved in a manner unseemly for one in his position reciting high flown spanish poetry and even piping in a thin high voice divers madrigals and heathen canzonets of an amorous complexion chiefly in regard to a little one who was his  the commanders soul these allegations perhaps unworthy the notice of a serious chronicler should be received with great caution and are introduced here as simple hearsay that the commander however took a handkerchief and attempted to show his guest the mysteries of the sembi cuacua capering in an agile but indecorous manner about the apartment has been denied enough for the purposes of this narrative that at midnight peleg assisted his host to bed with many protestations of undying friendship and then as the gale had abated took his leave of the presidio and hurried aboard the general court when the day broke the ship was gone  i know not if peleg kept his word with his host it is said that the holy fathers at the mission that night heard a loud chanting in the plaza as of the heathens singing psalms through their noses that for many days after an odor of salt codfish prevailed in the settlement that a dozen hard nutmegs which were unfit for spice or seed were found in the possession of the wife of the baker and that several bushels of shoepegs which bore a pleasing resemblance to oats but were quite inadequate to the purposes of provender were discovered in the stable of the blacksmith  but when the reader reflects upon the sacredness of a yankee traders word the stringent discipline of the spanish port regulations and the proverbial indisposition of my countrymen to impose upon the confidence of a simple people he will at once reject this part of the story  a roll of drums ushering in the year 1798 awoke the commander the sun was shining brightly and the storm had ceased he sat up in bed and through the force of habit rubbed his left eye as the remembrance of the previous night came back to him he jumped from his couch and ran to the window there was no ship in the bay a sudden thought seemed to strike him and he rubbed both of his eyes not content with this he consulted the metallic  mirror which hung beside his crucifix there was no mistake the commander had a visible second eyea right oneas good save for the purposes of vision as the left  whatever might have been the true secret of this transformation but one opinion prevailed at san carlos it was one of those rare miracles vouchsafed a pious catholic community as an evidence to the heathen through the intercession of the blessed san carlos himself that their beloved commander the temporal defender of the faith should be the recipient of this miraculous manifestation was most fit and seemly the commander himself was reticent he could not tell a falsehoodhe dared not tell the truth after all if the good folk of san carlos believed that the powers of his right eye were actually restored was it wise and discreet for him to undeceive them for the first time in his life the commander thought of policyfor the first time he quoted that text which has been the lure of so many wellmeaning but easy christians of being all things to all men infeliz hermenegildo salvatierra  for by degrees an ominous whisper crept through the little settlement the right eye of the commander although miraculous seemed to exercise a baleful effect upon the beholder no one could look at it without winking it was cold hard relentless and unflinching more than that it seemed to be endowed with a dreadful presciencea faculty of seeing through and into the inarticulate thoughts of those it looked upon the soldiers of the garrison obeyed the eye rather than the voice of their commander and answered his glance rather than his lips in questioning the servants could not evade the ever watchful but cold attention that seemed to  pursue them the children of the presidio school smirched their copybooks under the awful supervision and poor paquita the prize pupil failed utterly in that marvelous upstroke when her patron stood beside  her gradually distrust suspicion selfaccusation and timidity took the place of trust confidence and security throughout san carlos wherever the right eye of the commander fell a shadow fell with it  not was salvatierra entirely free from the baleful influence of his miraculous acquisition unconscious of its effect upon others he only saw in their actions evidence of certain things that the crafty peleg had hinted on that eventful new years eve his most trusty retainers stammered blushed and faltered before him selfaccusations confessions of minor faults and delinquencies or extravagant excuses and apologies met his mildest inquiries the very children that he lovedhis pet pupil paquitaseemed to be conscious of some hidden sin the result of this constant irritation showed itself more plainly for the first halfyear the commanders voice and eye were at variance he was still kind tender and thoughtful in speech gradually however his voice took upon itself the hardness of his glance and its skeptical impassive quality and as the year again neared its close it was plain that the commander had fitted himself to the eye and not the eye to the commander  it may be surmised that these changes did not escape the watchful solicitude of the fathers indeed the few who were first to ascribe the right eye of salvatierra to miraculous origin and the special grace of the blessed san carlos now talked openly of witchcraft and the agency of luzbel the evil one it would have fared ill with hermenegildo salvatierra had he been aught but commander or amenable to local authority but the reverend father friar manuel de cortes had no power over the political executive and all attempts at spiritual advice failed signally he retired baffled and confused from his first interview with the commander who seemed now to take a grim satisfaction in the fateful power of his glance the holy    father contradicted himself exposed the fallacies of his own arguments and even it is asserted committed himself to several undoubted heresies when the commander stood up at mass if the officiating priest caught that skeptical and searching eye the service was inevitably ruined even the power of the holy church seemed to be lost and the last hold upon the affections of the people and the good order of the settlement departed from san carlos  as the long dry summer passed the low hills that surrounded the white walls of the presidio grew more and more to resemble in hue the leathern jacket of the commander and nature herself seemed to have borrowed his dry hard glare the earth was cracked and seamed with drought a blight had fallen upon the orchards and vineyards and the rain long delayed and ardently prayed for came not the sky was as tearless as the right eye of the commander murmurs of discontent insubordination and plotting among the indians reached his ear he only set his teeth the more firmly tightened the knot of his black silk handkerchief and looked up his toledo  the last day of the year 1798 found the commander sitting at the hour of evening prayers alone in the guardroom he no longer attended the services of the holy church but crept away at such times to some solitary spot where he spent the interval in silent meditation the firelight played upon the low beams and rafters but left the bowed figure of salvatierra in darkness sitting thus he felt a small hand touch his arm and looking down saw the figure of paquita his little indian pupil at his knee ah littlest of all said the commander with something of his old tenderness lingering over the endearing diminutives of his native speech sweet one what doest thou here art thou not afraid of him whom every one shuns and fears  no said the little indian readily not in the dark   i hear your voicethe old voice i feel your touchthe old touch but i see not your eye senor comandante that only i fearand that o senor o my father said the child lifting her little arms towards his that i know is not thine own  the commander shuddered and turned away then recovering himself he kissed paquita gravely on the forehead and bade her retire a few hours later when silence had fallen upon the presidio he sought his own couch and slept peacefully  at about the middle watch of the night a dusky figure crept through the low embrasure of the commanders apartment other figures were flitting through the paradeground which the commander might have seen had he not slept so quietly the intruder stepped noiselessly to the couch and listened to the sleepers deepdrawn respiration something glittered in the firelight as the savage lifted his arm another moment and the sore perplexities of hermenegildo salvatierra would have been over when suddenly the savage started and fell back in a paroxysm of terror the commander slept peacefully but his right eye widely opened fixed and unaltered glared coldly on the wouldbe assassin the man fell to the earth in a fit and the noise awoke the sleeper  to rise to his feet grasp his sword and deal blows thick and fast upon the mutinous savages who now thronged the room was the work of a moment help opportunely arrived and the undisciplined indians were speedily driven beyond the walls but in the scuffle the commander received a blow upon his right eye and lifting his hand to that mysterious organ it was gone never again was it found and never again for bale or bliss did it adorn the right orbit of the commander  with it passed away the spell that had fallen upon san  carlos the rain returned to invigorate the languid soil harmony was restored between priest and soldier the green grass presently waved over the sere hillsides the children flocked again to the side of their martial preceptor a te deum was sung in the mission church and pastoral content once more smiled upon the gentle valleys of san carlos and far southward crept the general court with its master peleg scudder trafficking in heads and peltries with the indians and offering glass eyes wooden legs and other boston notions to the chiefs     the legend of devils point   on the northerly shore of san francisco bay at a point where the golden gate broadens into the pacific stands a bluff promontory it affords shelter from the prevailing winds to a semicircular bay on the east around this bay the hillside is bleak and barren but there are traces of former habitation in a weatherbeaten cabin and deserted corral it is said that these were originally built by an enterprising squatter who for some unaccountable reason abandoned them shortly after the jumper who succeeded him disappeared one day quite as mysteriously the third tenant who seemed to be a man of sanguine hopeful temperament divided the property into building lots staked off the hillside and projected the map of a new metropolis failing however to convince the citizens of san francisco that they had mistaken the site of their city he presently fell into dissipation and despondency he was frequently observed haunting the narrow strip of beach at low tide or perched upon the cliff at high water in the latter position a sheeptender one day found him cold and pulseless with a map of his property in his hand and his face turned toward the distant sea  perhaps these circumstances gave the locality its infelicitous reputation vague rumors were bruited of a supernatural influence that had been exercised on the tenants strange stories were circulated of the origin of the diabolical title by which the promontory was known by some it was believed to be haunted by the spirit of one of sir francis drakes sailors who had deserted his ship in consequence of stories told by the  indians of gold discoveries but who had perished by starvation on the rocks a vaquero who had once passed a night in the ruined cabin related how a strangely dressed and emaciated figure had knocked at the door at midnight and demanded food other story tellers of more historical accuracy roundly asserted that sir francis himself had been little better than a pirate and had chosen this spot to conceal quantities of illgotten booty taken from neutral bottoms and had protected his hidingplace by the orthodox means of hellish incantation and diabolic agencies on moonlight nights a shadowy ship was sometimes seen standing off and on or when fogs encompassed sea and shore the noise of oars rising and falling in their rowlocks could be heard muffled and indistinctly during the night whatever foundation there might have been for these stories it was certain that a more weird and desolatelooking spot could not have been selected for their theatre high hills verdureless and enfiladed with dark canadas cast their gaunt shadows on the tide during a greater portion of the day the wind which blew furiously and incessantly seemed possessed with a spirit of fierce disquiet and unrest toward nightfall the seafog crept with soft step through the portals of the golden gate or stole in noiseless marches down the hillside tenderly soothing the windbuffeted face of the cliff until sea and sky were hid together at such times the populous city beyond and the nearer settlement seemed removed to an infinite distance an immeasurable loneliness settled upon the cliff the creaking of a windlass or the monotonous chant of sailors on some unseen outlying ship came faint and far and full of mystic suggestion  about a year ago a welltodo middleaged broker of san prancisco found himself at nightfall the sole occupant of a plunger encompassed in a dense fog and drifting toward the golden gate this unexpected termination of an afternoons sail was partly  attributable to his want of nautical skill and partly to the effect of his usually sanguine nature having given up the guidance of his boat to the wind and tide he had trusted too implicitly for that reaction which his business experience assured him was certain to occur in all affairs aquatic as well as terrestrial the tide will turn soon said the broker confidently or something will happen he had scarcely settled himself back again in the sternsheets before the bow of the plunger obeying some mysterious impulse veered slowly around and a dark object loomed up before him a gentle eddy carried the boat farther in shore until at last it was completely embayed under the lee of a rocky point now faintly discernible through the fog he looked around him in the vain hope of recognizing some familiar headland the tops of the high hills which rose on either side were hidden in the fog as the boat swung around he succeeded in fastening a line to the rocks and sat down again with a feeling of renewed confidence and security  it was very cold the insidious fog penetrated his tightly buttoned coat and set his teeth to chattering in spite of the aid he sometimes drew from a pocketflask his clothes were wet and the sternsheets were covered with spray the comforts of fire and shelter continually rose before his fancy as he gazed wistfully on the rocks in sheer despair he finally drew the boat toward the most accessible part of the cliff and essayed to ascend this was less difficult than it appeared and in a few moments he had gained the hill above a dark object at a little distance attracted his attention and on approaching it proved to be a deserted cabin the story goes on to say that having built a roaring fire of stakes pulled from the adjoining corral with the aid of a flask of excellent brandy he managed to pass the early part of the evening with comparative comfort    there was no door in the cabin and the windows were simply square openings which freely admitted the searching fog but in spite of these discomfortsbeing a man of cheerful sanguine temperamenthe amused himself by poking the fire and watching the ruddy glow which the flames threw on the fog from the open door in this innocent occupation a great weariness overcame him and he fell asleep  he was awakened at midnight by a loud halloo which seemed to proceed directly from the sea thinking it might be the cry of some boatman lost in the fog he walked to the edge of the cliff but the thick veil that covered sea and land rendered all objects at the distance of a few feet indistinguishable he heard however the regular strokes of oars rising and falling on the water the halloo was repeated he was clearing his throat to reply when to his surprise an answer came apparently from the very cabin he had quitted hastily retracing his steps he was the more amazed on reaching the open door to find a stranger warming himself by the fire stepping back far enough to conceal his own person he took a good look at the intruder  he was a man of about forty with a cadaverous face but the oddity of his dress attracted the brokers attention more than his lugubrious physiognomy his legs were hid in enormously wide trousers descending to his knee where they met long boots of sealskin a peajacket with exaggerated cuffs almost as large as the breeches covered his chest and around his waist a monstrous belt with a buckle like a dentists sign supported two trumpetmouthed pistols and a curved hanger he wore a long queue which depended halfway down his back as the firelight fell on his ingenuous countenance the broker observed with some concern that this queue was formed entirely of a kind of tobacco known as pigtail or twist its effect the broker  remarked was much heightened when in a moment of thoughtful abstraction the apparition bit off a portion of it and rolled it as a quid into the cavernous recesses of his jaws  meanwhile the nearer splash of oars indicated the approach of the unseen boat the broker had barely time to conceal himself behind the cabin before a number of uncouthlooking figures clambered up the hill toward the ruined rendezvous they were dressed like the previous comer who as they passed through the open door exchanged greetings with each in antique phraseology bestowing at the same time some familiar nickname flashinthepan spitteroffrogs malmsey butt latheyard will and markthepinker were the few sobriquets the broker remembered whether these titles were given to express some peculiarity of their owner he could not tell for a silence followed as they slowly ranged themselves upon the floor of the cabin in a semicircle around their cadaverous host  at length malmsey butt a sphericalbodied manofwarsman with a rubicund nose got on his legs somewhat unsteadily and addressed himself to the company they had met that evening said the speaker in accordance with a timehonored custom this was simply to relieve that one of their number who for fifty years had kept watch and ward over the locality where certain treasures had been buried at this point the broker pricked up his ears if so be camarados and brothers all he continued ye are ready to receive the report of our excellent and wellbeloved brother master slittheweazand touching his search for this treasure why marry to t and begin  a murmur of assent went around the circle as the speaker resumed his seat master slittheweazand slowly opened his lantern jaws and began he had spent much of his time in determining the exact location of the treasure he believednay he could state positivelythat its position was now settled  it was true he had done some trifling little business outside modesty forbade his mentioning the particulars but he would simply state that of the three tenants who had occupied the cabin during the past ten years none were now alive applause and cries of go to thou wast always a tall fellow and the like  markthepinker next arose before proceeding to business he had a duty to perform in the sacred name of friendship it ill became him to pass a eulogy upon the qualities of the speaker who had preceded him for he had known him from boyhoods hour side by side they had wrought together in the spanish war for a neat hand with a toledo he challenged his equal while how nobly and beautifully he had won his present title of slittheweazand all could testify the speaker with some show of emotion asked to be pardoned if he dwelt too freely on passages of their early companionship he then detailed with a fine touch of humor his comrades peculiar manner of slitting the ears and lips of a refractory jew who had been captured in one of their previous voyages he would not weary the patience of his hearers but would briefly propose that the report of slittheweazand be accepted and that the thanks of the company be tendered him  a breaker of strong spirits was then rolled into the hut and cans of grog were circulated freely from hand to hand the health of slitthe weazand was proposed in a neat speech by markthepinker and responded to by the former gentleman in a manner that drew tears to the eyes of all present to the broker in his concealment this momentary diversion from the real business of the meeting occasioned much anxiety as yet nothing had been said to indicate the exact locality of the treasure to which they had mysteriously alluded fear restrained him from open inquiry and curiosity kept him from making good his escape during the orgy which followed    but his situation was beginning to become critical flashinthepan who seemed to have been a man of choleric humor taking fire during some hotly contested argument discharged both his pistols at the breast of his opponent the balls passed through on each side immediately below his armpits making a clean hole through which the horrified broker could see the firelight behind him the wounded man without betraying any concern excited the laughter of the company by jocosely putting his arms akimbo and inserting his thumbs into the orifices of the wounds as if they had been armholes this having in a measure restored good humor the party joined hands and formed a circle preparatory to dancing the dance was commenced by some monotonous stanzas hummed in a very high key by one of the party the rest joining in the following chorus which seemed to present a familiar sound to the brokers ear    her majesty is very sicke lord essex hath the measles our admiral   hath licked ye frenchpoppe saith ye weasel  at the regular recurrence of the last line the party discharged their loaded pistols in all directions rendering the position of the unhappy broker one of extreme peril and perplexity  when the tumult had partially subsided flashinthepan called the meeting to order and most of the revelers returned to their places malmsey butt however insisting upon another chorus and singing at the top of his voice    i am ycleped j keyseri was born at spring hys garden my father   toe make me ane clerke erst did essaye but a fico for ye offisi   spurn ye losels offeire for i fain would be ane butcher byr   ladykin alwaye  flashinthepan drew a pistol from his belt and bidding some one gag malmsey butt with the stock of it proceeded to read from a portentous roll of parchment that he held in his hand it was a semilegal document clothed in the quaint phraseology of a bygone period after a long preamble asserting their loyalty as lieges of her most bountiful majesty and sovereign lady the queen the document declared that they then and there took possession of the promontory and all the treasuretrove therein contained formerly buried by her majestys most faithful and devoted admiral sir francis drake with the right to search discover and appropriate the same and for the purpose thereof they did then and there form a guild or corporation to so discover search for and disclose said treasures and by virtue thereof they solemnly subscribed their names but at this moment the reading of the parchment was arrested by an exclamation from the assembly and the broker was seen frantically struggling at the door in the strong arms of markthepinker  let me go he cried as he made a desperate attempt to reach the side of master flashinthepan let me go i tell you gentlemen that document is not worth the parchment it is written on the laws of the state the customs of the country the mining ordinances are all against it dont by all thats sacred throw away such a capital investment through ignorance and informality let me go i assure you gentlemen professionally that you have a big thinga remarkably big thing and even if i aint in it im not going to see it fall through dont for gods sake gentlemen i implore you put your names to such a ridiculous paper there isnt a notary  he ceased the figures around him which were beginning to grow fainter and more indistinct as he went on swam before his eyes flickered reappeared again and finally went out he rubbed his eyes and gazed around him the cabin was deserted on the hearth the red embers of his fire were fading away in the bright beams of the morning sun that looked aslant through the open window he  ran out to the cliff the sturdy seabreeze fanned his feverish cheeks and tossed the white caps of waves that beat in pleasant music on the beach below a stately merchantman with snowy canvas was entering the gate the voices of sailors came cheerfully from a bark at anchor below the point the muskets of the sentries gleamed brightly on alcatraz and the rolling of drums swelled on the breeze farther on the hills of san francisco cottagecrowned and bordered with wharves and warehouses met his longing eye  such is the legend of devils point any objections to its reliability may be met with the statement that the broker who tells the story has since incorporated a company under the title of flashinthepan gold and silver treasure mining company and that its shares are already held at a stiff figure a copy of the original document is said to be on record in the office of the company and on any clear day the locality of the claim may be distinctly seen from the hills of san francisco     the adventure of padre vicentio  a legend of san francisco   one pleasant new years eve about forty years ago padre yicentio was slowly picking his way across the sandhills from the mission dolores as be climbed the crest of the ridge beside mission creek his broad shining face might have been easily mistaken for the beneficent image of the rising moon so bland was its smile and so indefinite its features for the padre was a man of notable reputation and character his ministration at the mission of san jose bad been marked with cordiality and unction he was adored by the simpleminded savages and had succeeded in impressing his individuality so strongly upon them that the very children were said to have miraculously resembled him in feature  as the holy man reached the loneliest portion of the road he naturally put spurs to his mule as if to quicken that decorous pace which the obedient animal had acquired through long experience of its masters habits the locality had an unfavorable reputation sailors deserters from whaleshipshad been seen lurking about the outskirts of the town and low scrub oaks which everywhere beset the trail might have easily concealed some desperate runaway besides these material obstructions the devil whose hostility to the church was well known was said to sometimes haunt the vicinity in the likeness of a spectral whaler who had met his death in a drunken bout from a harpoon in the hands of a companion the ghost of this unfortunate mariner was frequently observed sitting on the hill toward  the dusk of evening armed with his favorite weapon and a tub containing a coil of line looking out for some belated traveler on whom to exercise his professional skill it is related that the good father jose maria of the mission dolores had been twice attacked by this phantom sportsman that once on returning from san francisco and panting with exertion from climbing the hill he was startled by a stentorian cry of there she blows quickly followed by a hurtling harpoon which buried itself in the sand beside him that on another occasion he narrowly escaped destruction his serapa having been transfixed by the diabolical harpoon and dragged away in triumph popular opinion seems to have been divided as to the reason for the devils particular attention to father jose some asserting that the extreme piety of the padre excited the evil ones animosity and others that his adipose tendency simply rendered him from a professional viewpoint a profitable capture  had father vicentio been inclined to scoff at this apparition as a heretical innovation there was still the story of concepcion the demon vaquero whose terrible riata was fully as potent as the whalers harpoon concepcion when in the flesh had been a celebrated herder of cattle and wild horses and was reported to have chased the devil in the shape of a fleet pinto colt all the way from san luis obispo to san francisco vowing not to give up the chase until he had overtaken the disguised archenemy this the devil prevented by resuming his own shape but kept the unfortunate vaquero to the fulfillment of his rash vow and concepcion still scoured the coast on a phantom steed beguiling the monotony of his eternal pursuit by lassoing travelers dragging them at the heels of his unbroken mustang until they were eventually picked up half strangled by the roadside the padre listened attentively for the tramp of this terrible rider but no footfall broke the stillness of the night even the hoofs of his own mule sank noiselessly in  the shifting sand now and then a rabbit bounded lightly by him or a quail ran into the bushes the melancholy call of plover from the adjoining marshes of mission creek came to him so faintly and fitfully that it seemed almost a recollection of the past rather than a reality of the present  to add to his discomposure one of those heavy seafogs peculiar to the locality began to drift across the hills and presently encompassed him while endeavoring to evade its cold embraces padre vicentio incautiously drove his heavy spurs into the flanks of his mule as that puzzled animal was hesitating on the brink of a steep declivity whether the poor beast was indignant at this novel outrage or had been for some time reflecting on the evils of being priestridden has not transpired enough that he suddenly threw up his heels pitching the reverend man over his head and having accomplished this feat coolly dropped on his knees and tumbled after his rider  over and over went the padre closely followed by his faithless mule luckily the little hollow which received the pair was of sand that yielded to the superincumbent weight half burying them without further injury for some moments the poor man lay motionless vainly endeavoring to collect his scattered senses a hand irreverently laid upon his collar and a rough shake assisted to recall his consciousness as the padre staggered to his feet he found himself confronted by a stranger  seen dimly through the fog and under circumstances that to say the least were not prepossessing the newcomer had an inexpressibly mysterious and brigandlike aspect a long boatcloak concealed his figure and a slouched hat hid his features permitting only his eyes to glisten in the depths with a deep groan the padre slipped from the strangers grasp and subsided into the soft sand again  gads life said the stranger pettishly hast no more bones in thy fat carcass than a jellyfish lend a  hand here yo heave ho and he dragged the padre into an upright position now then who and what art thou  the padre could not help thinking that the question might have more properly been asked by himself but with an odd mixture of dignity and trepidation he began enumerating his different titles which were by no means brief and would have been alone sufficient to strike awe in the bosom of an ordinary adversary the stranger irreverently broke in upon his formal phrases and assuring him that a priest was the very person he was looking for coolly replaced the old mans hat which had tumbled off and bade him accompany him at once on an errand of spiritual counsel to one who was even then lying in extremity to think said the stranger that i should stumble upon the very man i was seeking body of bacchus but this is lucky follow me quickly for there is no time to lose  like most easy natures the positive assertion of the stranger and withal a certain authoritative air of command overcame what slight objections the padre might have feebly nurtured during this remarkable interview the spiritual invitation was one also that he dared not refuse  not only that but it tended somewhat to remove the superstitious dread with which he had begun to regard the mysterious stranger but following at a respectful distance the padre could not help observing with a thrill of horror that the strangers footsteps made no impression on the sand and his figure seemed at times to blend and incorporate itself with the fog until the holy man was obliged to wait for its reappearance in one of these intervals of embarrassment he heard the ringing of the faroff mission bell proclaiming the hour of midnight scarcely had the last stroke died away before the announcement was taken up and repeated by a multitude of bells of all sizes and the air was filled with the sound of striking clocks and the  pealing of steeple chimes the old man uttered a cry of alarm the stranger sharply demanded the cause the bells did you not hear them gasped padre vicentio tush tush answered the stranger thy fall hath set triple bobmajors ringing in thine ears come on  the padre was only too glad to accept the explanation conveyed in this discourteous answer but he was destined for another singular experience when they had reached the summit of the eminence now known as russian hill an exclamation again burst from the padre the stranger turned to his companion with an impatient gesture but the padre heeded him not the view that burst upon his sight was such as might well have engrossed the attention of a more enthusiastic temperament the fog had not yet reached the hill and the long valleys and hillsides of the embarcadero below were glittering with the light of a populous city look said the padre stretching his hand over the spreading landscape look dost thou not see the stately squares and brilliantly lighted avenues of a mighty metropolis dost thou not see as it were another firmament below  avast heaving reverend man and quit this folly said the stranger dragging the bewildered padre after him behold rather the stars knocked out of thy hollow noddle by the fall thou hast had prithee get over thy visions and rhapsodies for the time is wearing apace  the padre humbly followed without another word descending the hill toward the north the stranger leading the way in a few moments the padre detected the wash of waves and presently his feet struck the firmer sand of the beach here the stranger paused and the padre perceived a boat lying in readiness hard by as he stepped into the sternsheets in obedience to the command of his companion he noticed that the rowers seemed to partake of the misty incorporeal texture of his companion a similarity that  became the more distressing when he perceived also that their oars in pulling together made no noise the stranger assuming the helm guided the boat on quietly while the fog settling over the face of the water and closing around them seemed to interpose a muffled wall between themselves and the rude jarring of the outer world as they pushed further into this penetralia the padre listened anxiously for the sound of creaking blocks and the rattling of cordage but no vibration broke the veiled stillness or disturbed the warm breath of the fleecy fog only one incident occurred to break the monotony of their mysterious journey a oneeyed rower who sat in front of the padre catching the devout fathers eye immediately grinned such a ghastly smile and winked his remaining eye with such diabolical intensity of meaning that the padre was constrained to utter a pious ejaculation which had the disastrous effect of causing the marine cocles to catch a crab throwing his heels in the air and his head into the bottom of the boat but even this accident did not disturb the gravity of the rest of the ghastly boats crew  when as it seemed to the padre ten minutes had elapsed the outline of a large ship loomed up directly across their bow before he could utter the cry of warning that rose to his lips or brace himself against the expected shock the boat passed gently and noiselessly through the sides of the vessel and the holy man found himself standing on the berthdeck of what seemed to be an ancient caravel the boat and boats crew had vanished only his mysterious friend the stranger remained by the light of a swinginglamp the padre beheld him standing beside a hammock whereon apparently lay the dying man to whom he had been so mysteriously summoned as the padre in obedience to a sign from his companion stepped to the side of the sufferer he feebly opened his eyes and thus addressed him  thou seest before thee reverend father a helpless mortal struggling not only with the last agonies of the flesh but beaten down and tossed with sore anguish of the spirit it matters little when or how i became what thou now seest me enough that my life has been ungodly and sinful and that my only hope of absolution lies in my imparting to thee a secret which is of vast importance to the holy church and affects greatly her power wealth and dominion on these shores but the terms of this secret and the conditions of my absolution are peculiar i have but five minutes to live in that time i must receive the extreme unction of the church  and thy secret said the holy father  shall be told afterwards answered the dying man come my time is short shrive me quickly  the padre hesitated couldst thou not tell this secret first  impossible said the dying man with what seemed to the padre a momentary gleam of triumph then as his breath grew feebler he called impatiently shrive me shrive me  let me know at least what this secret concerns suggested the padre insinuatingly  shrive me first said the dying man  but the priest still hesitated parleying with the sufferer until the ships bell struck when with a triumphant mocking laugh from the stranger the vessel suddenly fell to pieces amid the rushing of waters which at once involved the dying man the priest and the mysterious stranger  the padre did not recover his consciousness until high noon the next day when he found himself lying in a little hollow between the mission hills and his faithful mule a few paces from him cropping the sparse herbage the padre made the best of his way home but wisely abstained from narrating the facts mentioned above until after the  discovery of gold when the whole of this veracious incident was related with the assertion of the padre that the secret which was thus mysteriously snatched from his possession was nothing more than the discovery of gold years since by the runaway sailors from the expedition of sir francis drake     the devil and the broker  a mediaeval legend   the church clocks in san francisco were striking ten the devil who had been flying over the city that evening just then alighted on the roof of a church near the corner of bush and montgomery streets it will he perceived that the popular belief that the devil avoids holy edifices and vanishes at the sound of a credo or paternoster is long since exploded indeed modern skepticism asserts that he is not averse to these orthodox discourses which particularly bear reference to himself and in a measure recognize his power and importance  i am inclined to think however that his choice of a restingplace was a good deal influenced by its contiguity to a populous thoroughfare when he was comfortably seated he began pulling out the joints of a small rod which he held in his hand and which presently proved to be an extraordinary fishingpole with a telescopic adjustment that permitted its protraction to a marvelous extent affixing a line thereto he selected a fly of a particular pattern from a small box which he carried with him and making a skillful cast threw his line into the very centre of that living stream which ebbed and flowed through montgomery street  either the people were very virtuous that evening or the bait was not a taking one in vain the devil whipped the stream at an eddy in front of the occidental or trolled his line into the shadows of the cosmopolitan five minutes passed without even a nibble dear me quoth the  devil thats very singular one of my most popular flies too why theyd have risen by shoals in broadway or beacon street for that well here goes another and fitting a new fly from his well filled box he gracefully recast his line  for a few moments there was every prospect of sport the line was continually bobbing and the nibbles were distinct and gratifying once or twice the bait was apparently gorged and carried off to the upper stories of the hotels to be digested at leisure at such times the professional manner in which the devil played out his line would have thrilled the heart of izaak walton but his efforts were unsuccessful the bait was invariably carried off without hooking the victim and the devil finally lost his temper ive heard of these san franciscans before he muttered wait till i get hold of one thats all he added malevolently as he rebaited his hook a sharp tug and a wriggle followed his next trial and finally with considerable effort he landed a portly twohundredpound broker upon the church roof  as the victim lay there gasping it was evident that the devil was in no hurry to remove the hook from his gills nor did he exhibit in this delicate operation that courtesy of manner and graceful manipulation which usually distinguished him  come he said gruffly as he grasped the broker by the waistband quit that whining and grunting dont flatter yourself that youre a prize either i was certain to have had you it was only a question of time  it is not that my lord which troubles me whined the unfortunate wretch as he painfully wriggled his head but that i should have been fooled by such a paltry bait what will they say of me down there to have let bigger things go by and to be taken in by this cheap trick he added as he groaned and glanced at the fly which the devil was carefully rearranging is whatpardon me my lordis what gets me  yes said the devil philosophically i never caught anybody yet who didnt say that but tell me aint you getting somewhat fastidious down there here is one of my most popular flies the greenback he continued exhibiting an emeraldlooking insect which he drew from his box this so generally considered excellent in election season has not even been nibbled at perhaps your sagacity which in spite of this unfortunate contretemps no one can doubt added the devil with a graceful return to his usual courtesy may explain the reason or suggest a substitute  the broker glanced at the contents of the box with a supercilious smile too oldfashioned my lordlong ago played out yet he added with a gleam of interest for a consideration i might offer somethingahemthat would make a taking substitute for these trifles give me he continued in a brisk businesslike way a slight percentage and a bonus down and im your man  name your terms said the devil earnestly  my liberty and a percentage on all you take and the things done  the devil caressed his tail thoughtfully for a few moments he was certain of the broker anyway and the risk was slight done he said  stay a moment said the artful broker there are certain contingencies give me your fishingrod and let me apply the bait myself it requires a skillful hand my lord even your wellknown experience might fail leave me alone for half an hour and if you have reason to complain of my success i will forfeit my depositi mean my liberty  the devil acceded to his request bowed and withdrew alighting gracefully in montgomery street he dropped into  meade  cos clothing store where having completely equipped himself a la mode he sallied forth intent on his personal enjoyment determining to sink his professional character he mingled with the current of human life and enjoyed with that immense capacity for excitement peculiar to his nature the whirl hustle and feverishness of the people as a purely aesthetic gratification unalloyed by the cares of business what he did that evening does not belong to our story we return to the broker whom we left on the roof  when he made sure that the devil had retired he carefully drew from his pocketbook a slip of paper and affixed it on the hook the line had scarcely reached the current before he felt a bite the hook was swallowed to bring up his victim rapidly disengage him from the hook and reset his line was the work of a moment another bite and the same result another and another in a very few minutes the roof was covered with his panting spoil the broker could himself distinguish that many of them were personal friends nay some of them were familiar frequenters of the building on which they were now miserably stranded that the broker felt a certain satisfaction in being instrumental in thus misleading his fellowbrokers no one acquainted with human nature will for a moment doubt but a stronger pull on his line caused him to put forth all his strength and skill the magic pole bent like a coachwhip the broker held firm assisted by the battlements of the church again and again it was almost wrested from his hand and again and again he slowly reeled in a portion of the tightening line at last with one mighty effort he lifted to the level of the roof a struggling object a howl like pandemonium rang through the air as the broker successfully landed at his feetthe devil himself  the two glared fiercely at each other the broker perhaps mindful of his former  treatment evinced no haste to remove the hook from his antagonists jaw when it was finally accomplished he asked quietly if the devil was satisfied that gentleman seemed absorbed in the contemplation of the bait which he had just taken from his mouth i am he said finally and forgive you but what do you call this  bend low replied the broker as he buttoned up his coat ready to depart the devil inclined his ear i call it wild cat     the ogress of silver land  or  the diverting history of prince badfellah and prince bulleboye   in the second year of the reign of the renowned caliph lo there dwelt in silver land adjoining his territory a certain terrible ogress she lived in the bowels of a dismal mountain where she was in the habit of confining such unfortunate travelers as ventured within her domain the country for miles around was sterile and barren in some places it was covered with a white powder which was called in the language of the country al ka li and was supposed to be the pulverized bones of those who had perished miserably in her service  in spite of this every year great numbers of young men devoted themselves to the service of the ogress hoping to become her godsons and to enjoy the good fortune which belonged to that privileged class for these godsons had no work to perform neither at the mountain nor elsewhere but roamed about the world with credentials of their relationship in their pockets which they called stokh which was stamped with the stamp and sealed with the seal of the ogress and which enabled them at the end of each moon to draw large quantities of gold and silver from her treasury and the wisest and most favored of those godsons were the princes badfellah and bulleboye they knew all the secrets of the ogress and how to wheedle and coax her they were also the favorites of soopah intendent who was her lord  high chamberlain and prime minister and who dwelt in silver land  one day soopah intendent said to his servants whan is that which travels the most surely the most secretly and the most swiftly  and they all answered as one man lightning my lord travels the most surely the most swiftly and the most secretly  then said soopah intendent let lightning carry this message secretly swiftly and surely to my beloved friends the princes badfellah and bulleboye and tell them that their godmother is dying and bid them seek some other godmother or sell their stokh ere it becomes badjeeworthless  bekhesm on our heads be it answered the servants  and they ran to lightning with the message who flew with it to the city by the sea and delivered it even at that moment into the hands of the princes badfellah and bulleboye  now the prince badfellah was a wicked young man and when he had received this message he tore his beard and rent his garment and reviled his godmother and his friend soopah intendent but presently he arose and dressed himself in his finest stuffs and went forth into the bazaars and among the merchants capering and dancing as he walked and crying in a loud voice oh happy day oh day worthy to be marked with a white stone  this he said cunningly thinking the merchants and men of the bazaars would gather about him which they presently did and began to question him what news then o most worthy and serene highness tell us that we may make merry too  then replied the cunning prince good news o my brothers for i have heard this day that my godmother in  silver land is well the merchants who were not aware of the substance of the real message envied him greatly and said one to another surely our brother the prince badfellah is favored by allah above all men and they were about to retire when the prince checked them saying tarry for a moment here are my credentials or stokh the same i will sell you for fifty thousand sequins for i have to give a feast today and need much gold who will give fifty thousand and he again fell to capering and dancing but this time the merchants drew a little apart and some of the oldest and wisest said what dirt is this which the prince would have us swallow if his godmother were well why should he sell his stokh bismillah the olives are old and the jar is broken when prince badfellah perceived them whispering his countenance fell and his knees smote against each other through fearbut dissembling again he said well so be it lo i have much more than shall abide with me for my days are many and my wants are few say forty thousand sequins for my stokh and let me depart in allahs name who will give forty thousand sequins to become the godson of such a healthy mother and he again fell to capering and dancing but not as gayly as before for his heart was troubled the merchants however only moved farther away thirty thousand sequins cried prince badfellah but even as he spoke they fled before his face crying his godmother is dead lo the jackals are defiling her grave mashallah he has no godmother and they sought out panik the swiftfooted messenger and bade him shout through the bazaars that the godmother of prince badfellah was dead when he heard this the prince fell upon his face and rent his garments and covered himself with the dust of the marketplace as he was sitting thus a porter passed him with jars of wine on his shoulders and the prince begged him to give him a jar for he was exceeding thirsty and faint  but the porter said what will my lord give me first and the prince in very bitterness of spirit said take this and handed him his stokh and so exchanged it for a jar of wine  now the prince bulleboye was of a different disposition when he received the message of soopah intendent he bowed his head and said it is the will of god then he rose and without speaking a word entered the gates of his palace but his wife the peerless maree jahann perceiving the gravity of his countenance said why is my lord cast down and silent why are those rare and priceless pearls his words shut up so tightly between those gorgeous oystershells his lips but to this he made no reply thinking further to divert him she brought her lute into the chamber and stood before him and sang the song and danced the dance of ben kotton which is called ibrahims daughter but she could not lift the veil of sadness from his brow  when she had ceased the prince bulleboye arose and said allah is great and what am i his servant but the dust of the earth lo this day has my godmother sickened unto death and my stokh become as a withered palmleaf call hither my servants and camel drivers and the merchants that have furnished me with stuffs and the beggars who have feasted at my table and bid them take all that is here for it is mine no longer with these words he buried his face in his mantle and wept aloud  but maree jahann his wife plucked him by the sleeve prithee my lord said she bethink thee of the brokah or scrivener who besought thee but yesterday to share thy stokh with him and gave thee his bond for fifty thousand sequins but the noble prince bulleboye raising his head said shall i sell to him for fifty thousand sequins that which i know is not worth a soo markee for is not all the brokahs wealth even his wife and children pledged on that bond shall i ruin him to save myself allah forbid bather let me eat the salt fish of honest penury than the kabobs of dishonorable affluence rather let me wallow in the mire of virtuous oblivion than repose on the divan of luxurious wickedness  when the prince had given utterance to this beautiful and edifying sentiment a strain of gentle music was heard and the rear wall of the apartment which had been ingeniously constructed like a flat opened and discovered the ogress of silver land in the glare of blue fire seated on a triumphal car attached to two ropes which were connected with the flies in the very act of blessing the unconscious prince when the walls closed again without attracting his attention prince bulleboye arose dressed himself in his coarsest and cheapest stuffs and sprinkled ashes on his head and in this guise having embraced his wife went forth into the bazaars in this it will be perceived how differently the good prince bulleboye acted from the wicked prince badfellah who put on his gayest garments to simulate and deceive  now when prince bulleboye entered the chief bazaar where the merchants of the city were gathered in council he stood up in his accustomed place and all that were there held their breath for the noble prince bulleboye was much respected let the brokah whose bond i hold for fifty thousand sequins stand forth said the prince and the brokah stood forth from among the merchants then said the prince here is thy bond for fifty thousand sequins for which i was to deliver unto thee one half of my stokh know then o my brotherand thou too o aga of the brokahsthat this my stokh which i pledged to thee is worthless for my godmother the ogress of silver land is dying thus do i release thee from thy bond and from the poverty which might overtake thee as it has even me thy brother the prince bulleboye and with that the noble prince bulleboye tore the bond of the brokah into pieces and scattered it to the four winds  now when the prince tore up the bond there was a great commotion and some said surely the prince bulleboye is drunken with wine and others he is possessed of an evil spirit and his friends expostulated with him saying what thou hast done is not the custom of the bazaarsbehold it is not biz but to all the prince answered gravely it is right on my own head be it  but the oldest and wisest of the merchants they who had talked with prince badfellah the same morning whispered together and gathered round the brokah whose bond the prince bulleboye had torn up hark ye said they our brother the prince bulleboye is cunning as a jackal what bosh is this about ruining himself to save thee such a thing was never heard before in the bazaars it is a trick o thou mooncalf of a brokah dost thou not see that he has heard good news from his godmother the same that was even now told us by the prince badfellah his confederate and that he would destroy thy bond for fifty thousand sequins because his stokh is worth a hundred  thousand be not deceived o too credulous brokah for this that our brother the prince doeth is not in the  name of allah but of biz the only god known in the  bazaars of the city  when the foolish brokah heard these things he cried justice aga of the brokahsjustice and the fulfillment of my bond let the prince deliver unto me the  stokh here are my fifty thousand sequins but the prince said have i not told thee that my godmother is dying and that my stokh is valueless at this the brokah only clamored the more for justice and the fulfillment of his bond then the aga of the brokahs said since the bond is destroyed behold thou hast no claim go thy ways but the brokah again cried justice my lord   aga behold i offer the prince seventy thousand sequins for his stokh but the prince said it is not worth one sequin then the aga said bismillah i cannot understand this whether thy godmother be dead or dying or immortal does not seem to signify therefore o prince by the laws of biz and allah though art released give the brokah thy stokh for seventy thousand sequins and bid him depart in peace  on his own head be it when the prince heard this command he handed the stokh to the brokah who counted out to him seventy thousand sequins but the heart of the virtuous prince did not rejoice nor did the brokah when he found his stokh was valueless but the merchants lifted their hands in wonder at the sagacity and wisdom of the famous prince bulleboye for none would believe that it was the law of allah that the prince followed and not the rules of biz     the christmas gift that came to rupert  a story for little soldiers   it was the christmas season in californiaa season of falling rain and springing grasses there were intervals when through driving clouds and flying scud the sun visited the haggard hills with a miracle and death and resurrection were as one and out of the very throes of decay a joyous life struggled outward and upward even the storms that swept down the dead leaves nurtured the tender buds that took their places there were no episodes of snowy silence over the quickening fields the farmers ploughshare hard followed the furrows left by the latest rains perhaps it was for this reason that the christmas evergreens which decorated the drawingroom took upon themselves a foreign aspect and offered a weird contrast to the roses seen dimly through the windows as the southwest wind beat their soft faces against the panes  now said the doctor drawing his chair closer to the fire and looking mildly but firmly at the semicircle of flaxen heads around him i want it distinctly understood before i begin my story that i am not to be interrupted by any ridiculous questions at the first one i shall stop at the second i shall feel it my duty to administer a dose of castoroil all round the boy that moves his legs or arms will be understood to invite amputation i have brought my instruments with me and never allow pleasure to interfere with my business do you promise  yes sir said six small voices simultaneously the  volley was however followed by half a dozen dropping questions  silence bob put your feet down and stop rattling that sword flora shall sit by my side like a little lady and be an example to the rest fung tang shall stay too if he likes now turn down the gas a little there that will dojust enough to make the fire look brighter and to show off the christmas candles silence everybody the boy who cracks an almond or breathes too loud over his raisins will be put out of the room  there was a profound silence bob laid his sword tenderly aside and nursed his leg thoughtfully flora after coquettishly adjusting the pockets of her little apron put her arm upon the doctors shoulder and permitted herself to be drawn beside him fung tang the little heathen page who was permitted on this rare occasion to share the christmas revels in the drawingroom surveyed the group with a smile that was at once sweet and philosophical the light ticking of a french clock on the mantel supported by a young shepherdess of bronze complexion and great symmetry of limb was the only sound that disturbed the christmaslike peace of the apartmenta peace which held the odors of evergreens new toys cedar boxes glue and varnish in a harmonious combination that passed all understanding  about four years ago at this time began the doctor i attended a course of lectures in a certain city one of the professors who was a sociable kindly manthough somewhat practical and hardheaded invited me to his house on christmas night i was very glad to go as i was anxious to see one of his sons who though only twelve years old was said to be very clever i dare not tell you how many latin verses this little fellow could recite or how many english ones he had composed in the first place youd want me to repeat them secondly im not a  judge of poetrylatin or english but there were judges who said they were wonderful for a boy and everybody predicted a splendid future for him everybody but his father he shook his head doubtingly whenever it was mentioned for as i have told you he was a practical matteroffact man  there was a pleasant party at the professors that night all the children of the neighborhood were there and among them the professors clever son rupert as they called hima thin little chap about as tall as bobby there and fair and delicate as flora by my side his health was feeble his father said he seldom ran about and played with other boyspreferring to stay at home and brood over his books and compose what he called his verses  well we had a christmastree just like this and we had been laughing and talking calling the names of the children who had presents on the tree and everybody was very happy and joyous when one of the children suddenly uttered a cry of mingled surprise and hilarity and said heres something for rupertand what do you think it is  we all guessed a desk a copy of milton a gold pen a rhyming dictionary no what then  a drum  a what asked everybody  a drum with ruperts name on it  sure enough there it was a goodsized bright new brassbound drum with a slip of paper on it with the inscription for rupert  of course we all laughed and thought it a good joke you see youre to make a noise in the world rupert said one heres parchment for the poet said another ruperts last work in sheepskin covers said a third give us a classical tune rupert said a fourth and so on but rupert seemed too mortified to speak he changed  color bit his lips and finally burst into a passionate fit of crying and left the room then those who had joked him felt ashamed and everybody began to ask who had put the drum there but no one knew or if they did the unexpected sympathy awakened for the sensitive boy kept them silent even the servants were called up and questioned but no one could give any idea where it came from and what was still more singular everybody declared that up to the moment it was produced no one had seen it hanging on the tree what do i think well i have my own opinion but no questions enough for you to know that rupert did not come downstairs again that night and the party soon after broke up  i had almost forgotten those things for the war of the rebellion broke out the next spring and i was appointed surgeon in one of the new regiments and was on my way to the seat of war but i had to pass through the city where the professor lived and there i met him my first question was about rupert the professor shook his head sadly hes not so well he said he has been declining since last christmas when you saw him a very strange case he added giving it a long latin name a very singular case but go and see him yourself he urged it may distract his mind and do him good  i went accordingly to the professors house and found eupert lying on a sofa propped up with pillows around him were scattered his books and what seemed in singular contrast that drum i told you about was hanging on a nail just above his head his face was thin and wasted there was a red spot on either cheek and his eyes were very bright and widely opened he was glad to see me and when i told him where i was going he asked a thousand questions about the war i thought i had thoroughly diverted his mind from its sick and languid fancies when he suddenly grasped my hand and drew me towards him  doctor said he in a low whisper you wont laugh at me if i tell you something  no certainly not i said  you remember that drum he said pointing to the glittering toy that hung against the wall you know too how it came to me a few weeks after christmas i was lying half asleep here and the drum was hanging on the wall when suddenly i heard it beaten at first low and slowly then faster and louder until its rolling filled the house in the middle of the night i heard it again i did not dare to tell anybody about it but i have heard it every night ever since  he paused and looked anxiously in my face sometimes he continued it is played softly sometimes loudly but always quickening to a long roll so loud and alarming that i have looked to see people coming into my room to ask what was the matter but i think doctori think he repeated slowly looking up with painful interest into my face that no one hears it but myself  i thought so too but i asked him if he had heard it at any other time  once or twice in the daytime he replied when i have been reading or writing then very loudly as though it were angry and tried in that way to attract my attention away from my books  i looked into his face and placed my hand upon his pulse his eyes were very bright and his pulse a little flurried and quick i then tried to explain to him that he was very weak and that his senses were very acute as most weak peoples are and how that when he read or grew interested and excited or when he was tired at night the throbbing of a big artery made the beating sound he heard he listened to me with a sad smile of unbelief but thanked me and in a little while i went away but as i was going downstairs i met the professor i gave him my opinion of the casewell no matter what it was  he wants fresh air and exercise said the professor and some practical experience of life sir the professor was not a bad man but he was a little worried and impatient and thoughtas clever people are apt to thinkthat things which he didnt understand were either silly or improper  i left the city that very day and in the excitement of battlefields and hospitals i forgot all about little rupert nor did i hear of him again until one day meeting an old classmate in the army who had known the professor he told me that rupert had become quite insane and that in one of his paroxysms he had escaped from the house and as he had never been found it was feared that he had fallen into the river and was drowned i was terribly shocked for the moment as you may imagine but dear me i was living just then among scenes as terrible and shocking and i had little time to spare to mourn over poor rupert  it was not long after receiving this intelligence that we had a terrible battle in which a portion of our army was slaughtered i was detached from my brigade to ride over to the battlefield and assist the surgeons of the beaten division who had more on their hands than they could attend to when i reached the barn that served for a temporary hospital i went at once to work ah bob said the doctor thoughtfully taking the bright sword from the hands of the half frightened bob and holding it gravely before him these pretty playthings are symbols of cruel ugly realities  i turned to a tall stout vermonter he continued very slowly tracing a pattern on the rug with the point of the scabbard who was badly wounded in both thighs but he held up his hands and begged me to help others first who needed it more than he i did not at first heed his request for this kind of unselfishness was very common in the army but he went on for gods sake doctor leave me here there is a drummer boy of our regimenta mere  childdying if he isnt dead now go and see him first he lies over there he saved more than one life he was at his post in the panic of this morning and saved the honor of the regiment i was so much more impressed by the mans manner than by the substance of his speech which was however corroborated by the other poor fellows stretched around me that i passed over to where the drummer lay with his drum beside him i gave one glance at his faceandyes bobyes my childrenit was rupert  well well it needed not the chalked cross which my brother surgeons had left upon the rough board whereon he lay to show how urgent was the relief he sought it needed not the prophetic words of the vermonter nor the damp that mingled with the brown curls that clung to his pale forehead to show how hopeless it was now i called him by name he opened his eyeslarger i thought in the new vision that was beginning to dawn upon himand recognized me he whispered im glad you are come but i dont think you can do me any good  i could not tell him a lie i could not say anything i only pressed his hand in mine as he went on  but you will see father and ask him to forgive me nobody is to blame but myself it was a long time before i understood why the drum came to me that christmas night and why it kept calling to me every night and what it said i know it now the work is done and i am content tell father it is better as it is i should have lived only to worry and perplex him and something in me tells me this is right  he lay still for a moment and then grasping my hand said  hark  i listened but heard nothing but the suppressed moans  of the wounded men around me the drum he said faintly dont you hear itthe drum is calling me  he reached out his arm to where it lay as though he would embrace it  listenhe went onits the reveille there are the ranks drawn up in review dont you see the sunlight flash down the long line of bayonets their faces are shiningthey present armsthere comes the generalbut his face i cannot look at for the glory round his head he sees me he smiles it is and with a name upon his lips that he had learned long ago he stretched himself wearily upon the planks and lay quite still  thats all  no questions nownever mind what became of the  drum  whos that sniveling  bless my soul wheres my pillbox   the end
