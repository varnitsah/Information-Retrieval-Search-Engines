warfare alike in its duration and in the immense preparations made by the united powers of france and spain for the capture of the fortress a greater number of guns were employed than in any operation up to that time although in number and still more in calibre the artillery then used have in modern times been thrown into the shade by the sieges of sebastopol and paris gibraltar differs however from these sieges inasmuch as the defence was a successful one and indeed at no period of the investment was the fortress in any danger of capture save by hunger  at that period england was not as she afterwards became invincible by sea and as we were engaged at the same time in war with france spain holland and the united states it was only occasionally that a fleet could be spared to bring succour and provisions to the beleaguered garrison scurvy was the direst enemy of the defenders the art of preserving meat in tins had not been discovered and they were forced to subsist almost entirely upon salt meat during the first year of the siege the supply of fresh vegetables was scanty in the extreme and the garrison consequently suffered so severely from scurvy that at one time scarcely half of the men of the garrison were strong enough to carry a firelock and perform their duty the providential capture of a vessel laden with oranges and lemons checked the ravages of the scourge and the successful efforts of the garrison to raise vegetables prevented it from ever afterwards getting a firm hold upon them  in such a siege there was but little scope for deeds of individual gallantry it was a long monotony of hardship and suffering nobly endured and terminating in one of the greatest triumphs ever recorded in the long roll of british victories  g a henty    chapter 1 something like an adventure   had mr tulloch the headmaster and proprietor of a large school at putney been asked which was the most troublesome boy in his school he would probably have replied without hesitation bob repton  but being a just and fairminded man he would have hastened to qualify this remark by adding  most troublesome but by no means the worst boy you must understand that he is always in scrapes always in mischief in all my experience i have never before come across a boy who had such an aptitude for getting into trouble but i have nothing else to say against him he is straightforward and manly i have never known him to tell a lie to screen himself he is an example to many others in that way i like the boy in spite of the endless trouble he gives and yet there is scarcely a day passes that i am not obliged to cane him and even that does him no good as far as i can see for he seems to forget it five minutes after it is over i wonder sometimes if he has really got hardened and doesnt feel it  he is sharp and does his lessons well i have no difficulty with him on that score but he is a perfect imp of mischief  with such characteristics it need hardly be said that bob repton was one of the most popular boys at tullochs school  school life was in those daysfor it was in august 1778 that bob was at tullochsa very different thing to what it is at present learning was thrashed into boys it was supposed that it could only be instilled in this manner and although some masters were of course more tyrannical and brutal than others the cane was everywhere in use and that frequently lads then had far less liberty and fewer sports than at present but as boys spirits cannot be altogether suppressed even by the use of the cane they found vent in other ways and there was much more mischief and more breaking out of bounds than now take place boys were less trusted and more harshly treated in consequence of which there was a kind of warfare between the masters and the boys in which the masters in spite of their canes did not always get the best of it  bob repton was nearly fifteen he was short rather than tall for his age but squarely built and strong his hair could never be got to lie down but bristled aggressively over his head his nose was inclined to turn up his gray eyes had a merry mischievous expression and his lips were generally parted in a smile a casual observer would have said that he was a happygolucky merry impudentlooking lad but he was more than this he was shrewd intelligent and exceptionally plucky always ready to do a good turn to others and to take more than his fair share of blame for every scrape he got into he had fought many battles and that with boys older than himself but he had never been beaten the opinion generally among the boys was that he did not feel pain and being caned so frequently such punishment as he got in a fight was a mere trifle to him  he was a thorn in the side of mr purfleet the usher who was generally in charge of the playground who had learned by long experience that whenever bob repton was quiet he was certain to be planning some special piece of mischief the usher was sitting now on a bench with a book in his hand but his attention was at present directed to a group of four boys who had drawn together in a corner of the playground  there is repton again he said to himself i wonder what he is plotting now that boy will be the death of me i am quite sure it was he who put that eel in my bed last week though of course i could not prove it  mr purfleet prided himself on his nerve he had been telling the boys some stories he had read of snakes in india among them one of an officer who when seated at table had felt a snake winding itself round his leg and who sat for several minutes without moving until some friends brought a saucer of milk and placed it near when the snake uncurled itself and went to drink  it must have required a lot of nerve mr purfleet bob repton had said to sit as quiet as that  not at all not at all the usher replied confidently it was the natural thing to do a man should always be calm in case of sudden danger bob the first thought in his mind should be what is this the second what had best be done under the circumstances and these two things being decided a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger i should despise myself if i were to act otherwise  it was two nights later that the usher having walked down between the two rows of beds in the dormitory and seeing that all the boys were quiet and apparently asleep proceeded to his own bed which was at the end of the room and partly screened off from the rest by a curtain no sooner did he disappear behind this than half a dozen heads were raised an oil lamp burned at the end of the room affording light for the usher to undress and enabling him as he lay in bed to command a general if somewhat faint view of the dormitory five minutes after mr purfleet had disappeared behind the curtain the watching eyes saw the clothes at the end of the bed pulled down and caught a partial view of mr purfleet as he climbed in a second later there was a yell of terror and the usher leapt from the bed instantly the dormitory was in an uproar  what is it mr purfleetwhat is the matter sir and several of the boys sprang from their beds and ran towards him the only exceptions to the general excitement being the four or five who were in the secret these lay shaking with suppressed laughter with the bedclothes or the corner of a pillow thrust into their mouths to prevent them from breaking out into screams of delight  what is it sir  it was some time before the usher could recover himself sufficiently to explain  there is a snake in my bed he said  a snake the boys repeated in astonishment several of the more timid at once making off to their beds  certainly a snake mr purfleet panted i put my legs down and they came against something cold and it began to twist about in a moment if i had not leapt out i should no doubt have received a fatal wound  where did it come from  what is to be done  and a variety of other questions burst from the boys  i will run down and get three or four hockey sticks mr purfleet one of the elder boys said  that will be the best plan mason quick quick there do you see it moving under the clothes  there was certainly something wriggling so there was a general movement back from the bed  we had better hold the clothes down mr purfleet bob repton said pushing himself forward if it were to crawl out at the top and get on to the floor it might bite a dozen of us i will hold the clothes down tight on one side if someone will hold them on the other  one of the other boys came forward and the clothes were stretched tightly across the bed by the pillow in a minute or two mason ran up with four hockey sticks  now you must be careful mr purfleet said because if it should get out the consequences might be terrible now then four of you take the sticks and all hit together as hard as you cannow  the sticks descended together there was a violent writhing and contortion beneath the clothes but the blows rained down fast and in a very short time all movement ceased  it must be dead now bob repton said i think we can look at it now sir  well draw the clothes down very gently boys and be ready to strike again if you see the least movement  the clothes were drawn down till the creature was visible  it must be a cobra the usher said looking at it from a distance it is thick and short it must have escaped from somewhere be very careful all of you  mason approached cautiously to get a nearer view and then exclaimed  why sir it is an eel  there was a moments silence and then a perfect yell of laughter from the boys for a moment the usher was dumbfounded then he rallied  you will all go to your beds at once he said i shall report the matter to mr tulloch in the morning  the boys retired laughing to their beds but above the din the usher heard the words in a muffled voice  a man should always be calm in sudden danger  another voice equally disguised said  yes he should first ask himself what is this then what had best be done under the circumstances  a third voice then took it up  it follows that a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger  then there was a chorus of half a dozen voices  i should despise myself if i were to act otherwise  silence the usher shouted rushing down the line between the beds i will thrash the first boy who speaks  as mr purfleet had one of the hockey sticks in his hand the threat was sufficient to ensure silence  to the relief of the two or three boys engaged in the affair mr purfleet made no report in the morning mr tulloch by no means spared the cane but he always inquired before he flogged and as the usher felt sure that the snake story would be brought forward by way of excuse for the trick played upon him he thought it better to drop it making a mental note however that he would get even with bob repton another timefor he made sure that he was at the bottom of the matter especially as he had been one of those who had listened to the snake story  mr purfleet was held in but light respect by the boys he was a pale young man and looked as if he had been poorly fed as a boy he took the junior classes and the belief was that he knew nothing of latin  moffat who took the upper classes was much more severe and sent up many more boys to be caned than did the junior usher but the boys did not dislike him caning they considered their natural portion and felt no ill will on that account while they knew that mr moffat was a capital scholar and though strict was always scrupulously just above all he was not a sneak if he reported them he reported them openly but brought no accusation against them behind their back while mr purfleet was always carrying tittle tattle to the headmaster there was therefore little gratitude towards him for holding his tongue as to the eel for the boys guessed the real reason of his silence and put it down to dread of ridicule and not to any kindliness of feeling  purfleet would give sixpence to know what we are talking about bob one of the group talking in the corner of the playground said  it is worth more than that jim still we shall have to be extra careful he suspects it was our lot who played him the trick about the eel and he will do his best to catch us out in something  well as i was saying johnny gibson has got a firstrate dog for rabbits and he says there are lots of them up on the common i told him that i would come and i expected two or three more and we would meet him at the top of the hill at four oclock tomorrow morning it will be getting light by that time of course we shall get out in the usual way and we can be back by half past six and no one will be any the wiser old thomas never comes down till a quarter to seven i have heard him a dozen times he just comes down in time to ring the bell for us to get up  oh i aint afraid of thomas one of the others said but i am afraid of purfleet  there need be no fear about him he never wakes till the bell rings and sleeps like a top why he didnt wake the other morning when we had a scrimmage and you tumbled out of bed besides we all sleep at the other end of the room and even if he did wake up in the night he wouldnt notice that we had gone especially if we shoved something in the bed to make a lump  my only fear is that we shant wake we ought to keep watch till its time to get up but i am sure we shouldnt keep awake we must all make up our minds to wake at three then one of us will be sure to do it and mind if one wakes he must promise not to go to sleep again before he hears the hall clock strike and knows what time it is if it is before three he can go off to sleep again that way one of us is sure to be awake when it strikes three  i say shant we just be licked if we are found out bob  of course we shall but as we get licked pretty well every day that wont make much difference and we shall have had awful fun still if any of you fellows dont like it dont you go i am going but i dont want to persuade any of you  of course we are going if you are going bob what are we going to do with the rabbits  oh i settled johnny gibson should keep them he is going to bring his dog you know besides what could we do with them we cant cook them can we  as it was clear to all the party that this could not be managed no objection was raised to this disposal of their game  bob repton slept but little that night they went to bed at eight and he heard every hour strike after nine dozing off occasionally and waking up each time convinced that the clock would strike three next time at last he heard the three welcome strokes and at once got up and went to the beds of the other three boys  they were all sound asleep and required some shaking before they could be convinced that it was time to get up then each boy put his bolster in his bed rolled up his night shirt into a ball and laid it on the pillow and then partly covered it up with the clothes then they slipped on their shirts breeches and stockings and taking their jackets and shoes in their hand stole out of the door at their end of the room and closed it behind them they then crept downstairs to the room where their caps were kept put on these and their jackets and each boy got a hockey stick out of the cupboard in the corner in which they were kept then they very cautiously unfastened the shutter raised the window and slipped out they pulled the shutter to behind them closed the window and then put on their shoes  that is managed first rate bob said there wasnt the least noise i made sure wharton would have dropped his shoes  why should i drop them more than anyone else wharton asked in an aggrieved voice  i dont know billy the idea occurred to me i didnt think anyone else would do it but i quite made up my mind that you would  well i wish you wouldnt be so fast about making up your mind then wharton grumbled i aint more clumsy than other people  you are all right jim sankey put in bobs only joking  well he might as well joke with somebody else jim i dont see any joke in it  no that is where the joke is billy bob said if you did see the joke there wouldnt be any joke in it  well never mind here is the walnut tree now who will get over first  the walnut tree stood in the playground near the wall and had often proved useful as a ladder to boys at tullochs one of its branches extended over the wall and from this it was easy to drop down beyond it the return was more difficult and was only to be accomplished by means of an old ivy which grew against the wall at some distance off by its aid the wall could be scaled without much difficulty and there was then the choice of dropping twelve feet into the playground or of walking on the top of the wall until the walnut tree was reached  tullochs stood some little distance along the lower richmond road there were but one or two houses standing back from the road between it and the main road up the hill and there was little fear of anyone being abroad at that time in the morning there was as yet but a faint gleam of daylight in the sky and it was dark in the road up the hill as the trees growing in the grounds of the houses on either side stretched far over it  i say jim sankey said wont it be a go if johnny gibson isnt there after all  he will be up there by four bob said confidently he said his father would be going out in his boat to fish as soon as it began to be daylightbecause the tide served at that hourand that he would start as soon as his father shoved off the boat  my eye jim what is that ahead of us it looks to me like a coach  it is a coach or a carriage or something of that sort  no it isnt it is a light cart what can it be doing here at this hour let us walk the other side of the road  they crossed to the left as they got abreast of the cart a man whom they had not noticed before said sharply  you are about early  yes we are off to work bob replied and they walked steadily on  he couldnt see what we were like jim sankey said when they had got a hundred yards further  not he bob said i could not make out his figure at all and it is darker on this side of the road than it is on the other  i say you fellows i think he is up to no good  what do you mean bob  well what should a cart be standing on the hill for at this time in the morning thats admiral langtons i know the door is just where the cart was stopping  well what has that got to do with it bob the cart wont do him any harm  no but there may be some fellows with it who may be breaking into his house  do you think so bob  well it seems likely to me it may be his house or one of the others  well what are we to do bob  i vote we see about it jim we have pretty nearly half an hour to spare now before johnny gibson will come along we have got our hockey sticks you know  but suppose there shouldnt be any men there bob and we should be caught in the grounds they would think we were going to steal something  that would be a go bob said but there isnt likely to be anyone about at half past three and if there were i dont suppose he would be able to catch us but we must risk something anyhow it will be a bit of fun and it will be better than waiting at the top of the hill with nothing to do till johnny gibson comes  they were now past the wall in front of admiral langtons and far out of sight of the man in the cart  there is some ivy on this wall bob said we can climb over it by that then we will make our way along until we can find some place where we can climb over into the admirals garden  perhaps there are some dogs about wharton objected  well if there are they are most likely chained up we must risk something  well here goes if you dont like it wharton you can stay behind  so saying he put his hockey stick between his teeth and then proceeded to climb up the wall by means of the ivy  the wall was but nine feet high and as soon as he gained the top bob said  come on you fellows i am going to drop down  in two minutes he was joined by the other three  there is a path just beyond bob said let us go by that dont you fellows say a word as wharton says there may be some dogs about  quietly they stole along the path which ran parallel to the road until it turned off at right angles  now the first tree that grows against the wall we will get over by bob whispered  after going twenty yards he stopped  this tree will do  but what are you going to do if there should be some men wharton asked in a tone that showed he objected altogether to the proceeding  it depends upon how many of them there are bob replied of course the admiral has got some men in the house and they will wake up and help us if we give the alarm anyhow we ought to be able to be a match for two men with these sticks especially if we take them by surprise  what do you say jim  i should think so jim replied anyhow if you are game to go on i am  what do you say fullarton  oh i am ready fullarton who was a boy of few words replied  only if there is anyone bob and we get into a row with them of course it will all come out about us and then shant we get it just  i suppose we shall bob admitted but i dont see we can help that  well we are in for it now and he began to climb the tree and working along a limb which extended over the wall he dropped down into the garden  the others soon joined wharton being more afraid of staying behind by himself than of going with the rest  now what are we to do next  i should say we ought to find out whether anyone has got into the house that is the first thing then if they have we have got to try to wake up the people and to frighten the men inside  have you got some string in your pockets  i have got some  they all had string  what do you want string for bob  string is always useful jim we may want to tie their hands but what i was thinking was we might fasten it across the stairs or some of the passages and then set up a sudden shout and they would think the watchmen had come and would make a bolt and when they got to the string over they would go and then we would drop on them with these hockey sticks before they could get up  well come on there maynt be anyone here after all now we will go up to the house and creep round  the house stood thirty or forty yards away and stepping as noiselessly as they could the boys crossed the lawn and moved along the front suddenly tom fullarton caught hold of bobs arm  look bob there is a light in that room do you seethrough the slit in the shutters  so there is well there is no mistake now there must be some fellows belonging to that cart inside that must be the drawing room or dining room and they would never have lights there at this time of night  now let us find out where they got in this is something like fun it beats rabbit hunting all to nothing  now mind you fellows if we do come upon them and there is a fight you remember the best place to hit to begin with is the ankle you have only just got to fancy that it is a bung and swipe at it with all your might anyone you hit there is sure to go down and if he wants it you can hit him over the head afterwards  now come along i expect they got in at the back of the house  they soon came upon a door at the side of the house it was open  that looks as if they had been let in bob whispered see there is a light in there somewhere come on  now let us take our shoes off  the others were thoroughly excited now and followed bob without hesitation  bob is the key in the door jim whispered  yes on the inside they have been let in i wish i dare lock it and take the key away let me see if it turns easy  very gently he turned the key and found the bolt shot noiselessly it had doubtless been carefully oiled he turned it again shut the door locked it and put the key in his pocket  then they crept on tiptoe along the passage at the end were two large chests strengthened with iron bands a lighted lantern stood upon them bob peered round the corner into the hall no one was to be seen but he heard a noise through an open door from which came a stream of light  motioning the others to stand still he crept forward noiselessly till he could look into the room a man was occupied in packing some articles of massive plate clocks and other valuables into a sack he was alone  bob made his way back to the others  theres only one fellow there he said if there are any more they are upstairs let us have this one firsthis back is to the door  now wharton you hold our handkerchiefs and the string if he dont look round i will jump on his back and have him down  the moment he is down you two throw yourselves on him and you shove the handkerchiefs into his mouth wharton in the surprise he wont know that we are only boys and we will tie his hands before he has time to resist  now come on  they were all plucky boysfor wharton although less morally courageous than the others was no coward physically their stockinged feet made no sound and the man heard nothing until bob sprang on to his back the force sending him down on to his face bobs arm was tightly round his throat and the other two threw themselves upon him each seizing an arm while wharton crammed two handkerchiefs into his mouth the mans hands were dragged behind his back as he lay on his face and his wrists tied firmly together he was rendered utterly helpless before he had recovered from the first shock of surprise  tie his ankles together with the other two handkerchiefs bob said still lying across him  that is right you are sure they are tight there he will do now i must lock him in  this was done  now then lets go upstairs  now fasten this last piece of string across between the banisters six or eight steps up  make haste he added as a faint cry was heard above  it did not take a second to fasten the string at each end and then grasping their sticks the boys sprang upstairs on gaining the landing they heard voices proceeding from a room along a corridor and as they crept up to it they heard a mans voice say angrily  now we aint going to waste any more time if you dont tell us where your money is we will knock you and the girl on the head  no you cant talk but you can point out where it is we know that you have got it  very well bill hit that young woman over the head with the butt of your pistol dont be afraid of hurting her  ah i thought you would change your mind so it is under the bed  look under dick what is there  a square box another voice said  well haul it out  come on bob repton whispered to the others the moment we are in shout  illustration bob and his companions surprise the burglars  he stood for a moment in the doorway a man was standing with his back to him holding a pistol in his hand another similarly armed stood by the side of a young woman who in a loose dressing gown sat shrinking in an armchair into which she had evidently been thrust a third was in the act of crawling under the bed an elderly man in his nightshirt was standing up a gag had been thrust into his mouth and he was tightly bound by a cord round his waist to one of the bedposts  bob sprang forward whirling his hockey stick round his head and giving a loud shout of down with the villains the others joining at the top of their voices  before the man had time to turn round bobs stick fell with all the boys strength upon his ankle and he went down as if he had been shot his pistol exploding as he fell bob raised his stick again and brought it down with a swinging blow on the robbers head  the others had made a rush together towards the man standing by the lady taken utterly by surprise he discharged his pistol at random and then sprang towards the door two blows fell on him and sankey and fullarton tried to grapple with him but he burst through them and rushed out  bob and wharton sprang on the kneeling man before he could gain his feet and rolled him over throwing themselves upon him he was struggling furiously and would soon have shaken them off when the other boys sprang to their assistance  you help them jim i will get this cord off fullarton said and running to the bed began to unknot the cord that bound the admiral  the ruffian on the ground was a very powerful man and the three boys had the greatest difficulty in holding him down till fullarton slipped a noose round one of his ankles and then jumping on the bed hauled upon it with all his strengththe admiral giving his assistance  get off him he is safe he shouted but the others had the greatest difficulty in shaking themselves free from the manwho had fortunately laid his pistol on the bed before he crawled under it to get at the box  jim sankey was the first to shake himself free from him and seeing what fullarton was doing he jumped on to the bed and gave him his assistance and in half a minute the ruffians leg was lashed to the bedpost at a height of five feet from the ground  just as this was done there was a rush of feet outside and three men one holding a cutlass and the other two armed with pokers ran into the room it was fortunate they did so for the man whom bob had first felled was just rising to his feet but he was at once struck down again by a heavy blow over the head with the cutlass by this time the admiral had torn off the bandage across his mouth  another of them ran downstairs jackson give chase we can deal with these fellows  the three men rushed off  well i dont know who you are the admiral went on turning to the boys but you turned up at the nick of time and i am deeply indebted to you not only for saving my moneyalthough i should not have liked to lose thatbut for having captured these pirates  that villain has not hurt you much i hope for both bob and jim sankey were bleeding freely from the face from the heavy blows the robber had dealt them  no sir we are not hurt to speak of bob said we belong to tullochs school  to the school the admiral exclaimed what on earth are you doing here at four oclock in the morning  but never mind that now what is it jackson has he got away  no sir he was lying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs there was a lanyard fastened across  we tied a string across sir as we came up bob explained  well done lads  are there any more of them jackson  dont see any signs of any more admiral there are the two plate chests in the passage as if they had been brought out from the butlers strong room in readiness to take away  where is the butler he must have heard the pistol shots the admiral exclaimed angrily  he is not in his room admiral we looked in to bring him with us the door was open but he isnt there  there is another man in the drawing room tied bob said he was putting a lot of things into a sack  the scoundrel perhaps that is the butler the admiral said  well emma you had better go back to bed again  jackson you stand guard over these two villains here and split their heads open if they venture to move  now let us go and see to this other fellow  the admiral proceeded downstairs followed by the boys the other two servants were standing beside the third robber who was still insensible  you keep watch over him john the admiral said  william you come with us there is another man in the drawing room but he is tied  there is the key sir bob said producing it we thought it safest to lock him up  upon my word young gentlemen you seem to have thought of everything if i were in command of a ship i should like to have you all as midshipmen  the door was opened the man was still lying on the ground but had rolled some distance from where they had left him he had succeeded in getting his feet loosened from the handkerchief but the whipcord round his wrists had resisted all his efforts to break or slacken it he was panting heavily from the exertions he had made  it is harper the admiral said in a tone of indignation and disgust  so you treacherous scoundrel it was you who let these men in was it well it is a hanging matter my lad and if any fellow deserves the rope you do  you had better go and get some more cord williams and tie all these four fellows up securely let jackson see to the knots  where did the scoundrels get in he asked turning to the boys  at the door at the end of the passage sir where the plate chests are standing we found it openhere is the key of it we locked it after we came in so as to prevent anyone from getting away  there is another man with a cart in the road  we will see to him directly we have got the others all tied up safely the admiral said that is the first thing to see to  in five minutes the four men were laid side by side in the hall securely bound hand and foot  now williams you keep guard over them  jackson do you and john sally out there is a cart standing outside the gate and a fellow in it bring him in and lay him alongside the others  the boys followed the two men to see the capture the light had broadened out over the sky and it was almost sunrise as they sallied out they went quietly along until they reached the gatewhich stood ajarthen they flung it open and rushed out to their disappointment the cart was standing about fifty yards lower down the hill the man was in it with his whip in one hand and the reins in another and was looking back and the moment he saw them he struck the horse and drove off at the top of his speed the pace was such that it was hopeless for them to think of following him  i expect he heard the pistol shots jackson said and sheered off a bit so as to be able to cut and run if he found his consorts were in trouble well we cannot help it we have taken four prizes out of the five and i call that pretty fair  i think we had better go now bob said we have got a friend waiting for us  then he must wait a bit longer jackson said the admiral will want to ask you some more questions but if your friend is anywhere near one of you might run and tell him to back and fill a bit till you come to him  tell him to do what jim sankey asked  tell him to wait a bit lad  i will run up wharton said  shall i tell him we shant want him at all today bob  i think so wharton you see it is four oclock now and we maynt be able to get away for half an hour and it will be too late then besides jim and i have been knocked about too much to care for rabbit hunting now you tell him we will go some other day  you neednt tell him that wharton fullarton put in it will be some time before we get a chance you may be sure  all right tell him to go home then wharton tell him i will make it all right with him for losing his mornings work of course you will come in here when you come down the hill again  wharton nodded and started at a run up the hill while his companions accompanied the two men into the house the admiral was down in the hall again he had now had time to add to his former scanty costume  get the shutters of the drawing room open jackson he said after hearing the report of the mans escape and tell the maidsi suppose they are all upto light a fire and get some coffee ready at once and something to eat  now young gentlemen sit down and tell me all about this business now which of you will be spokesman  jim nodded to bob  its his doing sir i mean about our coming in here we should never have thought anything about the cart if it hadnt been for bob and we didnt much like coming only he pretty well made us and he arranged it all  thats all rot bob said we were just all in it together sir and this is how it was  and he told the whole story of what had taken place  well you couldnt have done better if you had been officers in his majestys service the admiral said you have saved me the loss of my two plate chests of all the plate in this roomand that couldnt be counted in money for they were most of the things given me at different times on serviceand of 500 pounds i had in that box upstairsaltogether at least 2000 pounds in money value more than that you prevented my being captured and it would have been a sorer blow to me than the loss of the money if those scoundrels had had their way and had got off scot free  but you havent told me yet how you happened to be going up the hill at half past three oclock in the morning what on earth were you doing there surely your master does not allow you to ramble about in the middle of the night  well no sir that is the worst of it bob said you see i had arranged with one of the fishermens boys who has got a firstrate dog that we could meet him upon the common and do some rabbit hunting we slipped out from tullochs and meant to have been back before anyone was up and now i expect we shall get it nicely because i suppose it must all come out  the admiral laughed  you are four nice young scamps he saidfor wharton had rejoined them before bob had finished the storybut it is not for me to blame you it will certainly have to be told lads because you will have to appear as witnesses at the trial of these fellows but i will go down myself the first thing in the morning and speak to your master  thank you sir bob said it wont make any difference about the thrashing we are bound to get that but we shant mind that we are pretty well accustomed to it still if you speak for us i expect we shall get off with that otherwise i dont know what tulloch would have done when he found out that we had been slipping out at night  i expect it is not the first time you have done it  well no it is not sir we have been out two or three times with one of the fishermen in his boat  i expect you are nice young pickles the admiral said well what time does school begin  half past seven sir  very well then i will be there at that hour lads and do my best for you you see with those faces of yours you would be sure to be noticed anyhow and i hope you wouldnt in any case have been mean enough to screen yourselves by lying  that we shouldnt bob said i dont think there is a boy in the school who would tell a lie to tulloch  that is right lads a gentleman will never tell a lie to screen himself when he has got into a scrape i wouldnt keep the smartest young officer in the service on board a ship of mine if i caught him telling a lie for i should know that he would not only be a blackguard but a coward cowardice is at the bottom of half the lying of the world i would overlook anything except lying upon my word i would rather that a boy were a thief than a liar  well here is breakfast now sit down and make yourselves at home while i go up and see how my daughter is after the fright she has had  half an hour later after eating a hearty breakfast the four boys started for school    chapter 2 a great change   it was just striking six when they again climbed over the wall and descended by the tree they had had a discussion whether they should wait until the doors were opened and walk quietly in or return as they left they adopted the latter plan because they thought that if the matter was reported to mr tulloch he might proceed to administer punishment before the admiral arrived to give his version of the affair  the door was still ajar as they opened it they gave an exclamation of surprisefor there sitting on a chair in the passage was mr purfleet he smiled unpleasantly  so here you are you have had a pleasant ramble no doubt but i dont quite know what view mr tulloch may take of it  it was very good of you to sit up for us mr purfleet bob said quietly but you see we had left the door open and could have got in by ourselves i hope you will not have caught cold sitting there only in a dressing gown  you are an impudent young scamp mr purfleet said in a rage you will laugh with the other side of your mouth presently you and sankey are nicelooking figures aint you with your faces all cut and swollen  we have been a little in the wars bob replied  i dont want to hear anything about it the usher replied you will have to explain matters to mr tulloch  so i suppose mr purfleet  well jim well go and have a good wash the bell will be ringing in half an hour  so saying bob went into the lavatory followed by his companions while the usher returned upstairs he was certainly disappointed quietly as the boys had dressed the slight noise they had made in closing the door had woke him he thought little of it but just as he was going off to sleep again he heard the bolts of the door below withdrawn he at once got up and walked to the other end of the dormitory and discovered that the four boys were missing  chuckling to himself that he should now be able to repay the grudge he owed to bob he put on his dressing gown and went downstairs and had sat there for three hours momentarily expecting their return he had certainly felt chilly but had borne it patiently comforted by the joyful expectation of the utter dismay that would be felt by the culprits when they saw him the meeting had not passed off at all as he had anticipated and he could only console himself by thinking that his turn would come when he made his report to mr tulloch  the four boys did not return to the dormitory but after they had washed strolled about in the playground there was quite a ferment in the dormitory when their absence was perceived and the others noticed the four madeup figures in their place the operation of dressing was got through with much greater alacrity than usual and when they went downstairs and saw the four missing boys in the playground these were at once surrounded by an excited throng they refused however to answer any questions  you will hear it all in good time bob said we have been out and we have been caught that is all i am going to tell you  at the usual hour the bell rang and the boys assembled in the schoolroom the two ushers were in their places they waited three or four minutes for mr tulloch to appear then the door opened and the manservant entered and walking up to mr moffat said a word or two the latter nodded  lessons will begin at once he said in a loud voice the first class will come up to me  the boys of this class who occupied the senior dormitory at once began their lessons while mr purfleet took the lower class the second class including bob and his friends remained in their places in a quarter of an hour the door opened and mr tulloch entered accompanied by admiral langton mr tulloch was looking very serious while the admiral looked hot and angry  we are going to catch it bob whispered to jim sankey i knew the admiral wouldnt be able to get us off  i wish all the boys to return to their places mr moffat i have something to say mr tulloch said in a loud voice  when the boys were all seated he went on  admiral langton has been telling me that four of my boys were out and about soon after three oclock this morning the four boys in question will stand up  i do not say that this is the first time that such a serious infraction of the rules of the school has taken place it has happened before it may for aught i know have happened many times without my knowledge but upon the occasions when it has come to my knowledge the offenders have been most severely punished they must be punished now  admiral langton has been telling me that the boys in question have behaved with very great courage and have been the means of saving him from the loss of a large sum of money and plate and of capturing four burglars  a buzz of surprise passed round the school  that this conduct does them great credit i am fully prepared to admit had they been aware that this burglary was about to be committed and had they broken out of the house in the middle of the night for the purpose of preventing it i allow that it might have been pleaded as an excuse for their offence but this was not so it was an accident that occurred to them when they were engaged in breaking the rules and cannot be pleaded as a setoff against punishment  admiral langton has pleaded with me very strongly for a pardon for them but i regret that i am unable to comply with his request the admiral as a sailor is well aware that discipline must be maintained and i am quite sure that when he was in command of a ship he would not have permitted his judgment to be biased by anyone i have put it to him in that way and he acknowledges that to be so the two matters stand distinct the boys must be punished for this gross breach of the rules they may be thanked and applauded for the courage they have shown and the valuable service they have rendered to admiral langton  i have however so far yielded to his entreaties that while i must administer a severe caning for the gross breach of the rules i shall abstain from taking any further steps in the matter and from writing to the boys parents and guardians requesting them to remove their sons from the school at once as i certainly otherwise would have done at the same time i am willing to hear anything that these boys may have to urge in explanation or defence of their conduct i have already been informed by admiral langton that their object in so breaking out was to hunt rabbits up on the common  i wish to say sir bob said in a steady voice that it was entirely my doing i made the arrangements and persuaded the others to go and i think it is only right that they should not be punished as severely as i am  we were all in it together sir jim sankey broke in i was just as keen on it as bob was  so was i fullarton and wharton said together  well lads admiral langton said taking a step forward and addressing the boys in general as your master says discipline is discipline this is his ship and he is on his own quarterdeckbut i wish to tell you all that in my opinion you have every reason to be proud of your schoolfellows they behaved with the greatest pluck and gallantry and were i again in command of a ship i should be glad to have them serving me i am only sorry that i cannot persuade mr tulloch to see the matter in the same light as i do  goodbye lads and he walked across and shook hands with the four boys i shall see you again soon and the admiral turned abruptly and walked out of the schoolroom  mr tulloch at once proceeded to carry his sentence into effect and the four boys received as severe a caning as ever they had had in their lives and even bob case hardened as he was had as much as he could do to prevent himself from uttering a sound while it was being inflicted lessons were then continued as usual until eight oclock when the boys went in to breakfast after that was over they went into the playground until nine and the four culprits gave the rest a full account of the events of the night  i dont mind the thrashing bob said although tulloch did lay it on hot it was well worth it if it had only been to see that sneak purfleets face when the admiral told the story i was watching him when tulloch came in and saw how delighted he was at the tale he was going to tell and how satisfied he was that he should get no end of credit for sitting three hours in his dressing gown in order to catch us when we came in it was an awful sell for him when he saw that the admiral had come out with the whole story and there was nothing whatever for him to tell  when they went into school again mr tulloch said  boys i hear that four of your number have behaved with great gallantry they have prevented a serious robbery and arrested the men engaged in it i shall therefore give you a holiday for the remainder of the day the four boys in question will proceed at once to admiral langtons as they will be required to accompany him to kingston where the prisoners will be brought up before the magistrates  there was a general cheer from the boys and then bob and his companions hurried upstairs to put on their best clothes and ran off to the admirals  well boys is it all over he asked as they entered  all over sir they replied together  well boys i think it was a shame but i suppose discipline must be maintained in school as well as on board a ship but it vexes me amazingly to think that i have been the means of bringing you into it  it is just the other way sir bob said and it is very lucky for us that we came in here sir instead of going up to the common as we intended one of the ushers found out that we had gone and sat up until we came back and if it had not been for you we should not only have got a thrashing but should all have been expelled so it is the luckiest thing possible that we came in here  well i am very glad to hear that boys it has taken a load off my mind for i have been thinking that if you had not come in to help me you would have got back without being noticed  emma these are the four lads who did us such good service last night they caught sight of you before but you were hardly in a state to receive them formally  the young lady laughed as she came forward and shook hands with them  you need not have mentioned that papa  well i am very much obliged to you all for i have no doubt they meant to have my watch and jewels as well as papas money  now it is time for us to be off the admiral said my carriage is at the door and a fly you two who have been knocked about had better come with my daughter and myself the others can either ride inside the fly or one can go on the box of each vehicle as you like  wharton and fullarton both said that they should prefer going outside and in a few minutes they were on their way the three menservants riding inside the fly the prisoners had been sent off two hours before in a cart under the charge of the two local constables  the case lasted but an hour the four men being all committed for trial the party then returned to putney the admiral insisting upon the boys stopping to lunch with him after the meal was over he inquired what they were going to do on leaving school and what profession they intended to adopt  bob was the first questioned  i am going to be a wine merchant sir he said i have got no choice about it i lost my father and mother years ago and my guardian who is an uncle of mine is in the wine trade and he says i have got to go in too i think it is horrid but there is no good talking to him he is an awfully crusty old chap i should like to be a soldier or a sailor but of course it is of no use thinking of it my guardian has been very kind to me even though he is so crusty and it wouldnt be right not to do as he tells me and i dont suppose the wine business is so very bad when one is accustomed to it  has your uncle any sons lad  no sir he is an old bachelor and he says that some day i am to have his business  then you cant do better than stick to it lad the admiral said a boy who has before him the prospect of a solid substantial living on shore is simply a fool if he goes to sea it is a rough life and a hard one and if you dont get shot or drowned you may get laid on the shelf with the loss of a limb and a pension that wont find you in grog and tobacco  it is a pity for you would have made a good officer but you will be vastly better off in all respects at home and i can tell you there is not one sailor out of five who would not jump at a berth on shore if he could get the chance  sankeys father was a country clergyman and at present jim had no particular prospect  would you like to go to sea boy  yes sir i should like it of all things  very well give me your fathers name and address and i will write to him about it  fullartons father was a landed proprietor in somersetshire and he was the eldest son wharton was to be a lawyer and was to begin in his fathers office in a year or two admiral langton took notes of the addresses of the boys relatives  when he had done that he said to them  now lads i know you would rather be off i remember when i was a midshipman i was always glad enough to escape when i had to dine with the captain  a week later a young man came down from a city watchmakers with four handsome gold watches and chains for the boys with an inscription stating that they had been presented to them by admiral langton in remembrance of their gallant conduct on the night of august 6th 1778 they were immensely delighted with the gift for watches were in those days far more expensive luxuries than at present and their use was comparatively rare with the watches were four short notes from the admiral inviting them to come up on the following saturday afternoon  they had by this time received letters from their families who had each received a communication from the admiral expressing his warm commendation of their conduct and his thanks for the services that the boys had rendered  jim sankeys father wrote saying that the admiral had offered to procure him a berth as a midshipman at once and that he had written thankfully accepting the offer as he knew that it was what jim had been most earnestly wishingthough as he had no interest whatever among naval men he had hitherto seen no chance of his being able to obtain such an appointment this communication put jim into a state of the wildest delight and rendered him an object of envy to his schoolfellows  fullartons father wrote his son a hearty letter congratulating him on what he had done and saying that he felt proud of the letter he had received from the admiral  whartons father wrote to him sharply saying that thieftaking was a business that had better be left to constables and that he did not approve of freaks of that kind  mr bale wrote an irascible letter to bob  my dear nephew he began i am astonished and most seriously displeased at contents of communication i have received from a person signing himself j langton admiral i gather from it that instead of pursuing your studies you are wandering about at night engaged in pursuits akin to poaching i say akin because i am not aware whether the wild animals upon the common are the property of the lord of the manor or whether they are at the mercy of vagabonds it appears to me that there can be no proper supervision exercised by your masters  i spoke to you when you were here six weeks ago as to your school reports which although fairly satisfactory as to your abilities said there was a great want of steadiness in your general conduct i am convinced that you are doing no good for yourself and that the sooner you settle down to a desk in my office the better i have therefore written this morning informing mr tulloch that i shall remove you at michaelmas  your sister has been here with her husband today i am sorry to say that they do not view your wild and lawless conduct in the same light that i do and that they are unable to see there is anything positively disreputable in your being mixed up in midnight adventures with burglars i am glad to gather from admiral langtons letter that mr tulloch has seen your conduct in the proper light and has inflicted a wellmerited punishment upon you  all this is a very bad preparation for your future career as a respectable trader and i am most annoyed to hear that you will be called on to appear as a witness against the men who have been captured i have written to admiral langton acknowledging his letter and expressing my surprise that a gentleman in his position should give any countenance whatever to a lad who has been engaged in breaking the rules of his school and in wandering at night like a vagabond through the country  bob looked rather serious as he read through the letter for the first time but after going through it again he burst into a shout of laughter  what is it bob tom fullarton asked  read this letter tom i should like to have seen the admirals face as he read my uncles letter but it is too bad you see i have regularly done for myself i was to have stopped here till a year come christmas and now i have to leave at michaelmas i call it a beastly shame  it was some consolation to bob to receive next morning a letter from his sister saying she was delighted to hear how he had distinguished himself in the capture of the burglars  of course it was very wrong of you to get out at night but gerald says that boys are always up to tricks of that sort and so i suppose that it wasnt so bad as it seems to me uncle john pretends to be in a terrible rage about it but i dont think he is really as angry as he makes himself out to be he blew me up and said that i had always encouraged youwhich of course i haventand when gerald tried to say a good word for you he turned upon him and said something about fellowfeeling making men wondrous kind gerald only laughed and said he was glad my uncle had such a good opinion of him and that he should have liked to have been there to lend a hand in the fight and then uncle said something disagreeable and we came away  but i feel almost sure that uncle john is not really so angry as he seems and i believe that if gerald and i had taken the other side and had said that your conduct had been very wicked he would have defended you it was stupid of us not to think of it for you know uncle always likes to disagree with other peoplethere is nothing he hates more than their agreeing with him his bark is much worse than his bite and you must not forget how good and kind he has been to us all  you know how angry he was with my marriage and he said i had better have drowned myself than have married a soldier and i had better have hung myself than have married an irishmanspecially when he had intended all along that i should marry the son of an old friend of his a most excellent and wellconducted young man with admirable prospects but he came round in a month or two and the first notice of it was a letter from his lawyer saying that in accordance with the instruction of his client mr john bale he had drawn up and now enclosed a postnuptial settlement settling on me the sum of 5000 pounds consols and that his client wished him to say that had i married the person he had intended for me that sum would have been doubled  the idea when i never even saw the man and when i wrote thanking him he made no allusion to what he had said before but wrote that he should be glad at all times to see my husband and myself whenever we came to town but that as i knew his hours were regular and the door always locked at ten oclockjust as if gerald was in the habit of coming in drunk in the middle of the night fortunately nothing puts gerald out and he screamed over it and we went and stopped a week with uncle a month afterwards and he and gerald got on capitally together considering gerald said it was like a bear and a monkey in one cage but it was really very funny  so i have no doubt he will come round with you do try and not vex him more than you can help bob you know how much we all owe him  this was true bobs father had died when he was only three years oldhe being a lawyer with a good business at plymouthbut he had made no provision for his early death and had left his wife and two children almost penniless mr bale had at once taken charge of them and had made his sister an allowance that enabled her to live very comfortably she had remained in plymouth as she had many friends there  her daughter carriewho was six years older than bobhad four years before married gerald ohalloran who was then a lieutenant in the 58th regiment which was in garrison there he had a small income derived from an estate in ireland besides his pay but the young couple would have been obliged to live very economically had it not been for the addition of the money settled on her by her uncle  her mother had died a few months after the marriage and mr bale had at once placed bob at the school at putney and had announced his intention of taking him in due time into his business the boy always spent one half of his holidays with his uncle the other with his sister the former had been a trial both to him and to mr bale they saw but little of each other for mr bale who like most business men of the time lived over his offices went downstairs directly he had finished his breakfast and did not come up again until his work was over when at five oclock he dined the meal over he sometimes went out to the houses of friends or to the halls of one or other of the city companies to which he belonged  while bob was with him he told off one of the foremen in his business to go about with the boy the days therefore passed pleasantly as they generally went on excursions by water up or down the river or sometimes when it was not otherwise required in a light cart used in the business to epping or hainault forest bob was expected to be back to dinner and thanks to the foremanwho knew that his employer would not tolerate the smallest unpunctualityhe always succeeded in getting back in time to wash and change his clothes for dinner  the meal was a very solemn one mr bale asking occasional questions to which bob returned brief answers once or twice the boy ventured upon some lively remark but the surprise and displeasure expressed in his uncles face at this breach of the respectful silence then generally enforced upon the young in the presence of their elders deterred him from often trying the experiment  mr bale was as much bored as was bob by these meals and the evenings that sometimes followed them he would have been glad to have chatted more freely with his nephew but he was as ill at ease with him as he would have been with a young monkey there was nothing in common between them and the few questions he asked were the result of severe cogitation he used to glance at the boy from under his eyebrows wonder what he was smiling to himself about and wish that he understood him better it did not occur to him that if he had drawn him out and encouraged him to chatter as he liked he should get underneath the surface and might learn something of the nature hidden there it was in sheer desperation at finding nothing to say that he would often seize his hat and go out when he had quite made up his mind to stay indoors for the evening  bob put up as well as he could with his meals and the dull evenings for the sake of the pleasant time he had during the day but he eagerly counted the hours until the time when he was to take his place on the coach for canterbury where the 58th were now quartered he looked forward with absolute dread to the time when he would have to enter his uncles office  what is the use of being rich carrie he would say to his sister if one lives as uncle does i would rather work in the fields  yes bob but you see when you get to be rich you neednt live in the same way at all you could live as some traders do in the country at hampstead dulwich or chelsea and ride in to business and you can of course marry and enjoy life one neednt live like a hermit all alone because one is a trader in the city  the one consolation bob had was that his uncle had once said that he considered it was a great advantage to any young man going into the wine trade to go over to spain or portugal for two or three years to learn the whole routine of business there to study the different growths and know their values and to form a connection among the growers and shippers bob had replied gravely that he thought this would certainly be a great advantage and that he hoped his uncle would send him over there  i shall see when the time comes robert it will of course depend much upon the relations between this country and spain and portugal and also upon yourself i could not of course let you go out there until i was quite assured of your steadiness of conduct so far although i have nothing to complain of myself your schoolmasters reports are by no means hopeful on that head still we must hope that you will improve  it was terrible to bob to learn that he was to go fifteen months sooner than he had expected to his uncles but he was somewhat relieved when upon his arrival at the house at philpot lane his uncle after a very grave lecture on the enormity of his conduct at school said  i have been thinking robert that it will be more pleasant both for you and for me that you should not at present take up your abode here i am not accustomed to young people it would worry me having you here and after your companionship with boys of your own age you might find it somewhat dull  i have therefore arranged with mr medlin my principal clerk for you to board with him he has i believe some boys and girls of about your own age you will i hope be able to make yourself comfortable there  thank you uncle bob said suppressing his impulse to give a shout of satisfaction and looking as grave as possible i think that would be a very nice arrangement  mr medlin is a very trustworthy person mr bale went on he has been with me for upwards of twenty years and i have the greatest confidence in him  you had better sit down here and take a book at five oclock come down into the counting house mr medlin will leave at that hour  bob had hitherto avoided the counting house he had occasionally on previous visits slipped down to his friend the foreman and had wandered through the great cellars and watched the men at work bottling and gazed in surprise at the long tiers of casks stacked up to the roof of the cellar and the countless bottles stowed away in the bins once or twice he had gone down into the counting house with his uncle and waited there a few minutes until the foreman was disengaged he had noticed mr medlin at work at his high desk in one cornerkeeping as it seemed to him his eye upon two young clerks who sat on high stools at opposite sides of the desk on the other side of the office  mr medlin had a little rail round the top of his desk and curtains on rods that could be drawn round it he was a man of six or seven and thirty with a long face smooth shaven he always seemed absorbed in his work and when spoken to by mr bale answered in the fewest possible words in an even mechanical voice it had seemed to bob that he had been entirely oblivious to his presence and it did not appear to him now as he sat with a book before him waiting for the clock on the mantel to strike five that existence at mr medlins promised to be a lively one still as there were boys and girls it must be more amusing than it would be at his uncles and at any rate the clerk would not be so formidable a personage to deal with as mr bale  at one minute to five he went down so as to open the counting house door as the clock struck as he went in through the outer door his uncle came out from the inner office  ah there you are robert  mr medlin this is my nephew who as we have arranged will take up his residence with you i am afraid you will find him somewhat headstrong and troublesome i have already informed you why it has been necessary to remove him from school however i trust that there will be no repetition of such follies and that he will see the necessity of abandoning schoolboy pranks and settling down to business  yes sir mr medlin replied seeing that his employer expected an answer  bob had noticed that although the clerks eyes were directed upon him there appeared to be no expression of interest or curiosity in them but that they might as well have been fixed upon a blank wall  your boxes have already been sent round in the cart to mr medlins robert i dont know that there is anything else to say mr medlin will of course put you in the way of your duties here but if you have anything to say to meany questions to ask or any remarks connected with the business or otherwise you wish to makei shall always be ready to listen to you if you will come into the counting house at half past four  so saying mr bale retired into his private room again mr medlin placed his papers inside his desk locked it took off his coat and hung it on a peg put on another coat and his hat and then turned to bob  ready  quite ready  mr medlin led the way out of the counting house and bob followed mr medlin walked fast and bob had to step out to keep up with him the clerk appeared scarcely conscious of his presence until they were beyond the more crowded thoroughfare then he said  two miles out hackney way not too far  not at all bob replied the farther the better  no burglars there wouldnt pay  and bob thought that the shadow of a smile passed across his face  we can do without them bob said  hate coming here i suppose  that i do bob said cordially  mr medlin nodded  not so bad as it looks he said and then walked on again in silence  presently there was a break in the houses they were getting beyond the confines of business london  do you see this little garden mr medlin asked suddenly in a tone so unlike that in which he had before spoken that bob quite started  the lad looked at the little patch of ground with some stunted shrubs but could see nothing remarkable in it  yes i see it sir he said  that bob mr medlin went on for i suppose you are called bobmarks the end of all things  bob opened his eyes in astonishment and again examined the little garden  it marks bob the delimitation between london and country between slavery and freedom here every morning i leave myself behind here every evening i recover myselfor at least a considerable portion of myselfat a further mark half a mile on i am completely restored  i suppose you used to find just the same thing at the door of the schoolroom  a good deal sir bob said in a much brighter tone than he had used since he said goodbye to the fellows at tullochs  i am glad you feel like that i expect you will get like that as to the city in time but mind lad you must always find yourself again you stick to that you make a mark somewhere leave yourself behind in the morning and pick yourself up again when you come back it is a bad thing for those who forget to do that they might as well hang themselvesbetter  in there and he jerked his thumb back over his shoulder we are all machines you know it isnt us not a bit of it there is just the flesh the muscle the bones and a frozen bit of our brains the rest of us is left behind if as we come out we forget to pick it up we lose ourselves altogether before long and then there we are machines to the end of our lives you remember that bob keep it always in mind  it is a pity that my uncle didnt get the same advice forty years ago mr medlin  it is a pity my employer did not marry it is a pity my employer lives in that dull house in that dull lane all by himself mr medlin said angrily  but he has not got rid of himself altogether he is a good deal frozen up but he thaws out sometimes what a man he would be if he would but live out somewhere and pick himself up regularly as i do every day  this is my second mark bob this tree growing out in the road now you see we are pretty well in the country  can you run  yes i can run pretty well mr medlin  very well bob you see that tree growing out beyond that garden wall about four hundred yards on it is four hundred and twenty for i have measured it now then you walk on fifty yards and then run for your life see if i dont catch you before you are there  bob wondering as he went along at the astounding change that had come over his companion took fifty long steps then he heard a shout of now and went off at the top of his speed he was still a hundred yards from the mark when he heard steps coming rapidly up behind him and then the clerk dashed past him and came in fully twenty yards ahead  you dont run badly he said as bob stopped panting my jack generally comes to meet me and i always give him seventy yards and only beat him by about as much as i do you he couldnt come this afternoon he is busy helping his mother to get things straight i expect we shall meet him presently  well what are you laughing at  i was just thinking how astonished my uncle would be if he were to see us  mr medlin gave a hearty laugh  not so much as you would think bob five years ago my employer suddenly asked me just as we were shutting up one afternoon if i was fond of fishing i said that i used to be  he said i am going down for a fortnight into hampshire i have no one to go withsuppose you come with me  i said i will  he said coach tomorrow morning eight oclock black horse yard  i was there as we went over london bridge i found myself as usual and he found himself i explained to him that i could not help it he said he didnt want me to help it we had a glorious fortnight together and we have been out every year since he never alludes to it between times no more do i he is stiffer than usual for a bit so am i but we both know each other  you do not suppose that he would have sent you to me if he hadnt known that i have got another side to me  well i should not have thought bob said from the way he talked when he introduced me to you that he ever had such an idea in his mind  he was obliged to talk so mr medlin said laughing we were just machines at the time both of us but he talked in quite a different way when we were down fishing together three weeks ago he said then you were rather a pickle and that he didnt think you would do yourself any good where you were so that he was going to bring you up to business  i dont want him to turn out a dull blockhead he said and so i propose that you should take charge of him and teach him to keep himself young i wish i had done it myself  and so it was settled  there is no better employer in the city than your uncle there is not a man or boy about the place who isnt well paid and contented i used to think myself a lucky man before we went out fishing together for the first time but six months after that he gave me a rise that pretty well took my breath away  ah here come the young uns  a couple of minutes later four young people ran up there was a boy about bobs age a girl a year younger a boy and another girl in regular steps they greeted their father with a joyous shout of welcome  so you have got everything done he said i thought you would meet me somewhere here  this is bob repton my employers nephew and future member of the firm treat him with all respect and handle him gently he is a desperate fellow though he doesnt look it this is the young gentleman i told you of who made a night expedition and captured four burglars  after this introduction bob was heartily shaken by the hand all round and the party proceeded on their way the two girls holding their fathers hand the boys walking behind with bob who was so surprised at the unexpected turn affairs had taken that for a time he almost lost his usual readiness of speech    chapter 3 an unexpected journey   hawthorne cottage mr medlins abode was a pretty little house standing detached in a goodsized garden surrounded by a high wall  here we are mother the clerk said as he led the way into a cozy room where tea was laid upon the table while a bright fire blazed in the grate  a very pleasantfaced lady who did not look to bob more than thirtyalthough she must have been four or five years oldergreeted her husband affectionately  my dear he said in the exuberance of your feelings you forget that i have brought you home a visitor this is mr robert repton while he is resident in the house he may be greeted as bob we had a race and he runs faster than jack fifty yards in four hundred and twenty is the utmost i can give him  what nonsense you do talk will his wife said laughing i am sure master repton must think you out of your mind  it is a very jolly way of being out of his mind mrs medlin you dont know how pleased i am  he thought i was an ogre my dear and that you were an ogress  now let the banquet be served for i am hungry and i expect bob is too as for the children they are always hungryat least it seems so  it was a merry meal and bob thought he had never enjoyed one as much except at his sisters after tea they had music and he found that mr medlin performed admirably on the violin his wife played the spinet jack the clarionet and sophythe eldest girlthe piccolo  she is going to learn the harp presently mr medlin explained but for the present when we have no visitorsand i dont count you one after this eveningshe plays the piccolo she is a little shy about it but shyness is the failing of my family  it is very jolly bob said i wish i could play an instrument  we will see about it in time bob we want a french horn but i dont see at present where you are to practise  has uncle ever been here bob asked late in the evening  yes he came here the evening we got back from our fishing expedition he wanted to see the place before he finally settled about you coming here my wife was a little afraid of him but there was no occasion and everything went off capitallyexcept that sophy would not produce her piccolo i walked back with him till he came upon a hackney coach  he said as he got in i have spent a most pleasant evening medlin you are a very lucky fellow  i went back to work the next morning and we both dropt into the old groove and nothing more was said until yesterday when he informed me that you would come today  oh dear bob said as he started with the clerk at eight oclock on the following morning now i am going to begin at that wretched counting house  no you are not bob you are not coming in there at present when your uncle and i were talkingwhen we were fishing you knowhe said that he saw no use in your going in there at present and thought it would be quite time for you to learn how the books are kept in another three or four years and that till then you could go into the cellar you will learn bottling and packing and blending and something about the quality and value of wines you will find it much more pleasant than being shut up in a counting house making out bills and keeping ledgers  a great deal bob said joyfully i shant mind that at all  bob observed a noticeable change in his companions demeanour when he arrived at the tree and on passing the last garden his face assumed a stolid expression his brisk springy walk settled down into a business pace his words became few and he was again a steady and mechanical clerk  a fortnight later bob was summoned to the counting house  mr bale wishes to see you mr medlin said  bob entered wondering what he was wanted for  i received a subpoena a week ago robert for you to attend as a witness at kingston tomorrow these interruptions to business are very annoying i did not mention it to you before for if i had done so you would be thinking of nothing else  this morning i have received a letter from admiral langton requesting me to allow you to go down by the stage this afternoon and to sleep at his house he will take you over in the morning and you will sleep there again tomorrow night and come back by the early stage  i trust that you will endeavour to curb your exuberance of spirits this is a very grave matter and anything like levity would be altogether out of place  the letter says that the stage leaves the bell tavern at four oclock  bob replied gravely that he would be there in time and went off to his work again until twelve oclock  when he arrived at the admirals at a quarter to six a lad in midshipmans uniform came rushing out into the hall  hulloa bob  why jimbut no i suppose i ought to say mr james sankey to an officer of your importance how comes it sir that you are so soon attired in his majestys uniform  i will punch your head bob if you go on with that nonsense  but i say isnt it jolly the very afternoon after you left came down a big letter with a tremendous seal and therein i was informed that i was appointed to his majestys ship brilliant and was ordered to join immediately of course i did not know what to do so i came up here and who do you think i found here captain langton the admirals son who is in command of the brilliant  of course it was he who had got me the appointment he was very kind and told me that i could not join until after this trial so that i could go down home and stop there till today and the admiral sent me straight off to be measured for my uniform when i started next day he gave me a letter to my fatheran awfully nice letter it was saying that he intended to present me with my first outfit i got here about an hour ago and have been putting on my uniform to see how it fitted  you mean to see how you looked in it jim it looks first rate i wish i was in one too and was going with you instead of sticking in philpot lane  i am awfully sorry for you bob it must be beastly  well it is not so bad as i expected jim and uncle is turning out much better and i dont live there but with the head clerk out at hackney he is an awfully jolly sort of fellowyou never saw such a rum chap i will tell you all about it afterwards  i suppose i ought to go in and see the admiral  he is out at present bob he will be back at eight oclock to supper so you can come up and tell me all about it captain langton is here too  captain langton spoke very kindly to bob when the two boys came down to supper and told him that if at any time he changed his mind and there was a vacancy for a midshipman on board his ship he would give him the berth  i should be very glad to have you with me he said after the service you rendered my father and sister  on the following morning fullarton and wharton came up from the school and two carriages conveyed the witnesses over to kingston the prisoners bob heard were notorious and desperate criminals whom the authorities had long been anxious to lay hands on the butler was one of the gang and had obtained his post by means of a forged character the trial only occupied two hours for taken in the act as the men were there was no defence whatever all four were sentenced to be hung and the judge warmly complimented the four boys upon their conduct in the matter  the next morning bob returned to his work in the city  for the next three months his existence was a regular one on arriving in the cellar he took off his jacket and put on a large apron that completely covered him and from that time until five oclock he worked with the other boys bottling packing storing the bottles away in the bins or taking them down as required he learned from the foreman something of the localities from which the wine came their value and prices but had not begun to distinguish them by taste or bouquet mr bale the foreman said had given strict orders that he was not to begin tasting at present  three days before christmas one of the clerks brought him down word that mr bale wished to see him in the office at five oclock  during the three months he had scarcely spoken to his uncle the latter had nodded to him whenever he came into the cellar and had regularly said well robert how are you getting on  to which he had as regularly replied very well uncle  he supposed that the present meeting was for the purpose of inviting him to dine at philpot lane on christmas day and although he knew that he should enjoy the festivity more at hackney he was prepared to accept it very willingly  i have sent for you robert mr bale said when he entered his office to say that your sister has written to ask me to go down to spend christmas with her at portsmouth as her husbands regiment is on the point of going abroad i have decided on accepting her invitation and for the same reason i shall take you down with me you will therefore have your box packed tonight i shall send down a cart to fetch it tomorrow you will sleep here tomorrow night and we start the next morning  thank you very much uncle bob said in delight and then seeing that nothing further was expected of him he ran off to join mr medlin who was waiting for him outside  what do you think mr medlin i am going down to spend christmas at my sisters  ah the clerk said in a dull unsympathetic voice well mind how you walk mr robert it does not look well coming out from a place of business as if you were rushing out of school  bob knew well enough that it was no use whatever trying to get his companion to take any interest in matters unconnected with business at present so he dropped into his regular pace and did not open his lips again until they had passed the usual boundary  then mr medlin said briskly so you are going down to your sisters bob  yes that will be first rate wont it of course i went down in the summer to canterbury and hardly expected to go again this year as i have only been three months here i did not even think of going  it will be the last holiday i shall have for some time you know carrie said when she wrote to me a month ago that the regiment expected to be ordered abroad soon and uncle said it is on the point of going now  he is coming down with me  his voice fell a little at this part of the announcement  he is eh you think you will have to be on your best behaviour bob  before you told me about him mr medlin i should have thought it would quite spoil the holiday but i do not feel it so bad now  he will be all right bob you have never seen him outside the city yet still i shouldnt be up to any tricks with him you know if i were youshouldnt put cobblers wax on his pigtail or anything of that sort  as if i should think of such a thing mr medlin  well i dont know bob you have made jack pretty nearly as wild as you are yourself you are quite a scandal to the neighbourhood you two you nearly frightened those two ladies next door into fits last week by carrying in that snowman and sticking it up in their garden when you knew they were out i thought they were both going to have fits when they rushed in to tell me there was a ghost in their garden  i believe you suggested it yourself mr medlin bob said indignantly besides it served them right for coming in to complain that we had thrown stones and broken their window when we had done nothing of the sort  it was rather lucky for you that they did so bob for you see we were all so indignant then that they didnt venture to accuse you of the snowman businessthough i have no doubt they were convinced in their own minds that it was you but that is only one out of twenty pranks that you and jack have been up to  jack and i and someone else mr medlin we carry them out but i think someone else always suggests them  not suggest bobfar from it if i happen to say that it would be a most reprehensible thing if anyone were to do something somehow or other that is the very thing that jack and you do it was only last week i said that it would be a very objectionable trick if anyone was to tie paper bands round the neck of the clergymans black catwho is always stealing our chickensand to my surprise the next morning when we started for business there was quite a crowd outside his house watching the cat calmly sitting over the porch with white bands round its neck now that is an example of what i mean  quite so mr medlin that is just what i meant too and it was much better than throwing stones at him it is a savage beast though it does look so demure and scratched jacks hand and mine horribly when we were tying on the bands  at the tree the others met them and they laughed and chatted all the way back the young ones expressing much regret however that bob was to be away at christmas  at the appointed time mr bale and bob took their places on the coach the latter felt a little oppressed for his uncle had the evening before been putting him through a sort of examination as to the value of wines and had been exceedingly severe when bob had not acquitted himself to his satisfaction but had mixed up malaga with madeira and had stated that a french wine was grown near cadiz  i expect i shall know them better when i get to taste them bob had urged in excuse when you dont know anything about the wines it is very difficult to take an interest in them it is like learning that a town in india is on the ganges you dont care anything about the town and you dont care anything about the ganges and you are sure to mix it up next time with some other town on some other river  if those are your ideas robert i think you had better go to bed mr bale had said sternly and bob had gone to bed and had thought what a nuisance it was that his uncle was going down to portsmouth just when he wanted to be jolly with carrie and her husband for the last time  little had been said at breakfast and it was not until the coach was rattling along the high road and the last house had been left behind him that bobs spirits began to rise there had been a thaw a few days before and the snow had disappeared but it was now freezing sharply again  the air is brisk do you feel it cold robert mr bale said breaking silence for the first time  i feel cold about the toes and about the ears and nose uncle bob said but i am not very likely to feel cold anywhere else  his uncle looked down at the boy who was wedged in between him and a stout woman  well no he agreed you are pretty closely packed you had better pull that muffler over your ears more it was rather different weather when you went down to canterbury in the summer  that it was bob replied heartily it was hot and dusty just and there were a man and woman sitting opposite who kept on drinking out of a bottle every five minutes she had a baby with her too who screamed almost all the way i consider i saved that babys life  how was that robert  well you see uncle they had finished their bottle by the time we got to sevenoaks and we all got down for dinner there and before we sat down the man went to the bar and got it filled up again a pint of gin filled up with wateri heard him order it he put it in the pocket of his coat and hung the coat up on a peg when he sat down to dinner  i was not long over my dinner and finished before they did and i took the bottle out and ran out to the yard and emptied it and filled it up with water and put it back in the pocket again without his noticing it  you should have seen what a rage he was in when he took his first sip from the bottle after we had started he thought the man at the inn had played him a trick and he stood up and shouted to the coachman to turn back again but of course he wasnt going to do that and every one laughedexcept the woman i think she had had more than was good for her already and she cried for about an hour  the next two places where we changed horses we did it so quick that the man hadnt time to get down the third place he did and though the guard said we shouldnt stop a minute he went into the public house the guard shouted but he didnt come out and off we went without him then he came out running and waving his arms but the coachman wouldnt stop the woman got down with the child at the next place we changed horses and i suppose they went on next day and if they started sober they did perhaps get to dover all right  that was a very nasty trick the woman who was sitting next to bob said sharply  bob had noticed that she had already opened a basket on her lap and had partaken of liquid refreshment  but you see i saved the baby maam bob said humbly the woman was sitting at the end and if she had taken her share of the second bottle the chances are she would have dropped the baby it was a question of saving life you see  bob felt a sudden convulsion in his uncles figure  it is all very well to talk in that way the woman said angrily it was just a piece of impudence and you ought to have been flogged for it i have no patience with such impudent doings a wasting of good liquor too  i dont think madam mr bale said it was as much wasted as it would have been had they swallowed it for at least it did no harm i cannot see myself why because people get outside a coach they should consider it necessary to turn themselves into hogs  i will trouble you to keep your insinuations to yourself the woman said in great indignation you ought to be ashamed of yourself at your age encouraging a boy in such ways there is them as can stand the cold and theres them as cant and a little good liquor helps them wonderful i am sich myself  and she defiantly took out her bottle from her basket and applied it to her lips  i was not speaking personally my good woman mr bale said  i would have you to know the woman snapped that i aint your good woman i wouldnt demean myself to the like i will ask this company if it is right as a unprotected female should be insulted on the outside of one of his majestys mails  the other passengers who had been struggling with their laughter endeavoured to pacify her with the assurance that no insult had been meant and as mr bale made no reply she subsided into silence grumbling occasionally to herself  i am agoing down she broke out presently to meet my husband and i dont mind who knows it he is a warrant officer he is on board the latona as came in last week with two prizes there aint nothing to be ashamed of in that  and i will thank you boy she said turning sharply upon bob not to be ascrouging me so i pay for my place i do  i think you ought to pay for two places bob said i am sure you have got twice as much room as i have and if there is any scrouging it isnt me  would you have any objection sir the woman said majestically to a man sitting on the other side of her to change places with me i aint agoing to bear no longer with the insults of this boy and of the person as calls himself a man asitting next to him  the change was effected to bobs great satisfaction  you see robert what you have brought down upon me mr bale said this comes of your telling stories about bottles when there is a woman with one in her basket next to you  i really was not thinking of her when i spoke uncle but i am glad now for i really could hardly breathe before  why uncle i had no idea you smoked he added as mr bale took a cigar case from his pocket  i do not smoke when i am in the city robert but i see no harm in a cigarin fact i like oneat other times i observed a long pipe on the mantelpiece at mr medlins and indeed i have seen that gentleman smoke when we have been out together but i have never observed him indulging in that habit in the city  oh yes he smokes at home bob said  i have great confidence in mr medlin robert you have been comfortable with him i hope  could not be more comfortable sir  an excellent man of business robert and most trustworthy a seriousminded man  bob was looking up and saw a little twinkle in mr bales eye  you dont find it dull i hope  not at all dull sir mr medlin and his family are very musical  musical are they robert mr bale said in a tone of surprise as far as i have seen in the counting house i should not have taken him to be musical  no i dont think you would uncle just the same way as one wouldnt think it likely that you would smoke a cigar  well no robert you see one must not always go by appearances  no sir that is just what mr medlin says bob replied smiling  oh he says that does he i suppose he has been telling you that we go out fishing together  he did mention that sir  you must not always believe what medlin says robert  no sir i thought you told me he was perfectly trustworthy  in some points boy but it is notorious that from all times the narratives of fishermen must be received with a large amount of caution the man who can be trusted with untold gold cannot be relied upon to give with even an approach to accuracy the weights of the fish he has caught and indeed all his statements with reference to the pursuit must be taken with a large discount  you were surprised when you heard that i went fishing robert  not more surprised than i was when you lit your cigar sir  well you know what horace said robert i forget what it was in the latin but it meant  he is a poor soul who never rejoices  the bow must be relaxed robert or it loses its stiffness and spring i myself always bear this in mind and endeavour to forget that there is such a place as the city of london or a place of business called philpot lane directly i get away from it  dont you think that you could forget too uncle that the name i am known by in the city is robert and that my name at all other times is bob  i will try to do so if you make a point of it mr bale said gravely but at the same time it appears to me that bob is a name for a shorttailed sheepdog rather than for a boy  i dont mind who else is called by it uncle besides sheepdogs are very useful animals  they differ from boys in one marked respect bob  what is that uncle  they always attend strictly to business lad they are most conscientious workers now this is more than can be said for boys  but i dont suppose the sheepdogs do much while they are puppies uncle  humph i think you have me there bob i suppose we must make allowances for them both  well we shall be at guildford in half an hour and will stop there for dinner i shall not be sorry to get down to stamp my feet a bit it is very cold here in spite of these rugs  it was seven oclock in the evening when the coach drew up at the george hotel in portsmouth captain ohalloran was at the door to meet them  well mr bale you have had a coldish drive down today  how are you bob  at present i am cold bob said the last two hours have been bitter  i have taken bedrooms here for you mr bale there is no barrack accommodation at present for everyone is back from leave any other time we could have put you up  now if you will point out your baggage my man will see it taken up to your rooms and you can come straight on to me carrie has got supper ready and a big fire blazing it is not three minutes walk from here  they were soon seated at table and after the meal was over they drew round the fire  so you have really become a man of business bob his sister said i was very glad to hear from your letter that you liked it better than you expected  but it will be a long while yet before he is a man of business niece it is like having a monkey in a china shop the other day i went down to the cellar just in time to see him put down a bottle so carelessly that it tumbled over unfortunately there was a row of them he had just filled and a dozen went down like ninepins the corks had not been put in and half the contents were lost before they could be righted and the wine was worth eighty shillings a dozen  and what can you expect of him mr bale gerald ohalloran said is it a spalpeen like that you would trust with the handling of good wine i would as soon set a cat to bottle milk  he is young for it yet mr bale agreed but when a boy amuses himself by breaking out of school at three oclock in the morning and fighting burglars what are you to do with him  i should give him a medal for his pluck mr bale and let him do something where he would have a chance of showing his spirit  and make him as wild and harumscarum as you are yourself ohalloran and then expect him to turn out a respectable merchant afterwards i am sure i dont wish to be troubled with him till he has got rid of what you call his spirits but what are you to do with such a pickle as this there have been more bottles broken since he came than there ordinarily are in the course of a year and i suspect him of corrupting my chief clerk and am in mortal apprehension that he will be getting into some scrape at hackney and make the place too hot for him  i never gave you credit for much brains carrie but how it was you let your brother grow up like this is more than i can tell  although this all sounded serious bob did not feel at all alarmed carrie however thought that her uncle was greatly vexed and tried to take up the cudgels in his defence  i am sure bob does not mean any harm uncle  i did not say that he did niece but if he does harm it comes to the same thing  well we need not talk about that now so i hear that you are going out to the mediterranean  yes uncle to gibraltar it is a nice station everyone says and i am very pleased there are so many places where there is fighting going on now that i think we are most fortunate in going there i was so afraid the regiment might be sent either to america or india  and i suppose you would rather have gone where there was fighting ohalloran  i would the officer said promptly what is the use of your going into the army if you dont fight  i should say what is the use of going into the army at all mr bale said testily still i suppose someone must go  i suppose so sir captain ohalloran said laughing if it were not for the army and navy i fancy you trading gentlemen would very soon find the difference besides there are some of us born to it i should never have made a figure in the city for instance  i fancy not mr bale said dryly you will understand ohalloran that i am not objecting in the slightest to your being in the army my objection solely lies in the fact that you being in the army should have married my niece and that instead of coming to keep house for me comfortably she is going to wander about with you to the ends of the earth  carrie laughed  how do you know someone else would not have snapped me up if he hadnt uncle  that is right carrie  you would have found her twice as difficult to manage as bob mr bale you would never have kept her in philpot lane if i hadnt taken her there are some people can be tamed down and there are some who cant and carrie is one of the latter  i should pity you from my heart if you had her on your hands mr bale if ever i get to be a colonel it is she will command the regiment  well it is good that one of us should have sense gerald his wife said laughing and now you had better put the whisky on the table unless uncle would prefer some mulled port wine  neither one nor the other my dear your brother is half asleep now and it is as much as i can do to keep my eyes open after the cold ride we have had the sooner we get back to the george the better  we will breakfast there carrie i dont know what your hours are but when i am away on a holiday i always give myself a little extra sleep besides your husband will i suppose have to be on duty and i have no doubt it will suit you as well as me for us to breakfast at the george  perhaps it will be better uncle if you dont mind gerald happens to be orderly officer for the day and will have to get his breakfast as he can and will be busy all the morning but i shall be ready for you by ten  at that hour bob appeared alone  uncle wont come round till one oclock carrie he said he should take a quiet stroll round by himself and look at the ships and that no doubt we should like to have a talk together  is he very cross with you bob she asked anxiously you know he really is kind at heart very kind but i am afraid he must be very hard as a master  not a bit carrie i expected he was going to be so but he isnt the least like that he is very much liked by everyone there he doesnt say much and he certainly looks stiff and grim enough for anything but he isnt so really not a bit  didnt he scold you dreadfully about your upsetting those twelve bottles of wine  he never said a word about it and i did not know at the time he had seen me john the foremanthe one who used to take me out in the holidayswould not have said anything about it he said of course accidents did happen sometimes with the boys and when they did he himself blew them up and there was no occasion to mention it to mr bale when it wasnt anything very serious but of course i could not have that and said that either he must tell uncle or i should  it really happened because my fingers were so cold i could not feel the bottle of course the cellar is not cold but i had been outside taking in a waggon load of bottles that had just arrived and counting them and my fingers got regularly numbed  so john went to the counting house and told him about the wine being spilt he said i wished him to tell him and how it had happened  what did uncle say bob  he said he was glad to hear that i told john to tell him but that he knew it already for he had just come down to the cellar when the bottles went over and as he didnt wish to interfere with the foremans work had come back to the counting house without anyone noticing he had been there he said of course boys could not be trusted like men and that as he had chosen to put me there he must put up with accidents he never spoke about it to me till last night  well he seemed very vexed about it bob and made a great deal of it  he didnt mean it carrie and he knew i knew he didnt mean it he knows i am beginning to understand him  that evening mr bale sent bob back to the hotel by himself  i thought i would get him out of the way he said when bob had left i wanted to have a chat with you about him  you see carrie i acted hastily in taking him away from school but it seemed to me that he must be getting into a very bad groove to be playing such pranks as breaking out in the middle of the night i was sorry afterwards partly because it had upset all my plans partly because i was not sure that i had done the best thing by him  i had intended that he should have stopped for another year at school by that time he would be between sixteen and seventeen and i thought of taking him into the office for six months or so to begin with for him to learn a little of the routine then i had intended to send him out to oporto for two years and then to cadiz for two years so that he would have learnt portuguese and spanish well got up all there was to learn about the different growths and established friendly relations with my agents  now as it happens all these plans have been upset my agent at oporto died a month ago his son succeeds him he is a young man and not yet married in the first place i dont suppose he would care about being bothered with bob and in the second place boys of bobs age are not likely to submit very quietly to the authority of a foreigner then too your brother is full of mischief and fun and i dont suppose foreigners would understand him in the least and he would get into all manner of scrapes  my correspondent at cadiz is an elderly man without a family and the same objection would arise in his case and moreover from what i hear from him and from other spanish sources there is a strong feeling against england in spain and now that we are at war with france and have troubles in america i think it likely enough they will join in against us of course my correspondent writes cautiously but in his last letter he strongly advises me to buy largely at once as there is no saying about the future and several of my friends in the trade have received similar advice  i have put the boy into the cellar for at the moment i could see nothing else to do with him but really the routine he is learning is of little importance and there is no occasion for him to learn to do these things himself he would pick up all he wants to know there when he came back in a very short time  then what are you thinking of doing uncle carrie asked after a pause as she saw that mr bale expected her to say something  it seems to me that a way has opened out of the difficulty i dont want him to go back to school again he knows quite as much latin as is required in an importer of wines i want him to learn spanish and portuguese and to become a gentleman and a man of the world i have stuck to philpot lane all my life but there is no reason why he should do so after me things are changing in the city and many of our merchants no longer live there but have houses in the country and drive or ride to them some people shake their heads over what they call newfangled notions i think it is good for a man to get right away from his business when he has done work  but this is not the point bob is too young to begin to learn the business abroad two years too young at least but there is no reason why he should not begin to learn spanish now i thought if i could find someone i could intrust him to where his home would be bright and pleasant he might go there for a couple of years naturally i should be prepared to pay a fair sumsay 200 pounds a yearfor him for of course no one is going to be bothered with a boy without being paid for it  carrie listened for something further to come then her husband broke in  i see what you are driving at mr bale and carrie and myself would be delighted to have him  dont you see carrie your uncle means that bob shall stop with us and learn the language there  that would be delightful carrie exclaimed enthusiastically do you really mean that uncle  that is really what i do mean niece it seems to me that that is the very best thing we could do with the young scamp  it would be capital carrie went on it is what i should like above everything  a nicer arrangement couldnt be mr bale it will suit us all bob will learn the language he will be a companion to carrie when i am on duty and we will make a man of him but he wont be able to go out with us i am afraid officers wives and families get their passages in the transports but i am afraid it would be no use to ask for one for bob besides we sail in four days  no i will arrange about his passage and so on  well i am glad that my proposal suits you both the matter has been worrying me for the last three months and it is a comfort that it is off my mind  i will go back to my hotel now i will send bob round in the morning and you can tell him about it    chapter 4 preparations for a voyage   bob went round to the barracks at half past nine  uncle says you have a piece of news to tell me carrie  my dear bob captain ohalloran said your uncle is a broth of a boy he would do credit to galway and if anyone says anything to the contrary i will have him out tomorrow morning  what has he been doing bob asked  i told you carrie yesterday he wasnt a bit like what he seemed  well bob you are not going to stay at his place of business any longer  no where is he going to send meto school again i am not sure i should like that carrie i didnt want to leave but i dont think i should like to go back to caesar and euclid and all those wretched old books again  well you are not going bob  hurry up carrie her husband said dont you see that you are keeping the boy on thorns tell him the news without beating about the bush  well it is just this bob you are to come out for two years to live with us at gibraltar and learn spanish  bob threw his cap up to the ceiling with a shout of delight executed a wild dance rushed at his sister and kissed her violently and shook hands with her husband  that is glorious he said when he had sufficiently recovered himself for speech i said uncle was a brick didnt i but i never dreamt of such a thing as this  he is going to pay very handsomely while you are with us bob so it will be really a great help to us besides we will like to have you with us but you will have to work hard at spanish you know  oh i will work hard bob said confidently  and be very steady captain ohalloran said gravely  of course bob replied but who are you going to hire to teach me that  you are an impudent boy bob his sister said while captain ohalloran burst out laughing  sure he has us both there carrie i wonder your uncle did not make a proviso that we were to get one of the padres to look after him  as if i would let a spanish priest look after me bob said  i didnt mean a spanish priest bob i meant one of the army chaplains we always call them padres  that would be worth thinking about carrie  oh i say bob exclaimed in alarm that would spoil it altogether  well we will see how you go on bob we may not find it necessary you know but you will find you have to mind your ps and qs at gib it is a garrison place you know and they wont stand nonsense there if you played any tricks they would turn you outside the lines or send you up to one of the caverns to live with the apes  are there apes bob asked eagerly they would be awful fun i should think i have seen them at exeter change  there are apes bob but if you think you are going to get near enough to put salt on their tails you are mistaken  but am i going out with you bob asked why tomorrow is christmas day and you sail two days after dont you and i shouldnt have time even to go up to town and down to putney to say goodbye to the fellows i should like to do that and tell them that i am going abroad  you are not going with us bob and you will have time for all that we could not take you in the transport and uncle will arrange for a passage for you in some ship going out of course he knows all about vessels trading with spain  well we shant have to say goodbye now bob said i havent said much about it but i have been thinking a lot about how horrid it would be after being so jolly here to have to say goodbye knowing that i shouldnt see you again for years and years now that is all over  a few minutes later mr bale came in he had assumed his most businesslike expression but bob rushed up to him  oh uncle i am so obliged to you it is awfully kind  i thought the arrangement would be a suitable one mr bale began  no no uncle bob broke in you would say that if you were in philpot lane now you know you can say that you thought it would be the very jolliest thing that was ever heard of  i am afraid niece that the sentiment of respect for his elders is not strongly developed in bob  i am afraid not uncle but you see if elders set an example of being doublefaced to their nephews they must expect to forfeit their respect  and it is a lot better being liked than being respected isnt it uncle  perhaps it is bob but the two things may go together  so they do uncle only i keep my respect for philpot lane and it is all liking here  they spent two more delightful days at portsmouth visited some of the ships of war and the transport in which the 58th was to sail and went over the dockyard the next morning mr bale and bob returned by the early coach to london as the boxes and trunks and the portable furniture had to be sent off early on board  mr medlin was less surprised at hearing that bob was going to leave than the latter had expected  you know bob i was away one day last week well i didnt tell you at the time where i was because i was ordered not to but your uncle said to me the evening before  i am going to drive down by coach to windsor mr medlin and shall be glad if you will accompany me  i guessed he wanted to talk about things outside the business and so it was we had a capital dinner down there and then we had a long talk about you i told him frankly that though i was very glad to have you with me i really did not see that it was of any use your being kept at that work he said that he thought so too and had an idea on which he wanted my opinion he was thinking of accepting your sisters invitation to go down and spend christmas with her and intended to ask her if they would take charge of you for a couple of years in order that you might learn spanish of course i said that it was the very best thing in the world for you and would not be any loss of time because if you could speak spanish well you would learn the business much more quickly when you went to cadiz and need not be so long abroad then  i shall be awfully sorry to go away from you mr medlin and from mrs medlin and the others it has been so jolly with you and you have all been so kind  yes it has been very comfortable all round bob and we shall all be sorry that you are going but i did not expect we should have you long with us i felt sure your uncle would see he had made a mistake in taking you into the place so young and when he finds out he has made a mistake he says so some people wont but i have known him own up he has been wrong after blowing up one of the boys in the cellar for something he hadnt done now there is not one employer in a hundred who would do that  yes i felt sure that he would change his mind about you and either send you back to school again or make some other arrangement so i wasnt a bit surprised when he spoke to me last week still we shall all be sorry bob  another fortnight passed without bob hearing more except that he was taken by mr medlin to various shops and a large outfit was ordered  you will bear in mind two things mr medlin his employer had said in the first place that my nephew will grow in the next two years therefore order some of his things to fit him now and some to be made larger and in more manly fashion give instructions that when these are finished they are to be put in tin cases and soldered down so as to be kept distinct from the others  in the second place you will bear in mind that clothes which would be perfectly right and suitable for him here will not be at all suitable for him there he will be living with an officer and associating entirely with military men and there must therefore be a certain cut and fashion about his things of course i dont want him to look like a young fop but you understand what i want there will be no boys out there it is therefore better that he should look a little older than he is besides i think that boysand men tooto some extent live up to their clothes  i do not think that i have anything else to say mr medlin except that as he will not be able to replace any clothes he may destroy out there and as he is sure to be climbing about and destroying them in one way or another it is necessary that an ample supply should be laid in  mr medlin had scrupulously carried out all these instructions and bob was almost alarmed at the extent of the wardrobe ordered  i know what i am doing mr robertfor they were in the city when bob made his protesti am quite sure that my employer will make no objection to my ordering largely but he would certainly be much displeased if i did not order what he conceived to be sufficient  at the end of the fortnight mr bale informed bob that he had arranged for his passage to gibraltar in the brig antelope  she is bound to valencia for fruit she is a fast sailer and is well armed there will be no other passengers on board but as i am acquainted with the captainwho has several times brought over cargoes for me from cadiz and oportohe has agreed to take you i would rather you had gone in a ship sailing with a convoy but as there was a very strong one went at the time the transports sailed there may not be another for some time these small vessels do not wait for convoys but trust to their speed  you can now discontinue your work here as you will probably wish to go down to putney to say goodbye to your friends there the brig will sail next monday but you will go down on saturday by coach to southampton where she now is i shall request mr medlin to see you on board he tells me that your outfit is completed and your trunks with the exception of what will be required upon the voyage will be sent off by the carrier waggon on wednesday  on thursday afternoon you will leave mr medlins and stay here till you start  the week passed quickly bob enjoyed his day at putney where after saying goodbye to his old schoolfellows he called upon admiral langton who was very glad to hear of the change in his prospects  it will do you good he said to go out into the world and see a little of life it was a dull thing for a lad of your age and spirits to be cooped up in a counting house in the city but now that you are going to gibraltar and afterwards to cadiz and oporto and will not return to settle down to business until you are oneandtwenty or so i think that the prospect before you is a very pleasant one and i am glad that your uncle has proved altogether different to your anticipations of him  well you are sure to see my son at gibraltar sometimes i shall write to him and tell him that you are there and as your friend sankey is on board the brilliant it will be pleasant for both of you  only dont lead him into scrapes bob midshipmen are up to mischief enough on their own account  everyone always seems to think i am getting into scrapes admiral i dont think i get into more than other fellows  i rather think you do bob mr tulloch certainly intimated to me that you had a remarkable talent that way if in no other besides your face tells its own story pickle is marked upon it as plainly as if it were printed  now you must have supper with us at seven oclock and catch the eight oclock stage you can stay until then i hope  yes sir i told mr medlin that i might not come back until the last stage  at parting the admiral placed a case in bobs hands  there my lad are a brace of pistols you wont have any use for them for some years to come i hope but if you stay out in spain and portugal they may prove useful those fellows are very handy with their knives and it is always well to be armed if you go about at night among them i should advise you to practise shooting whenever you get an opportunity a pistol is an excellent weapon if you really know how to use it but is of no use at all if you dont  another thing is you may get involved in affairs of honour i consider duelling to be a foolish practice but it is no use one person standing up against a crowd it is the fashion in our days to fight duels and therefore it is almost a necessity for a gentleman to be able to shoot straight besides although you might be able to avoid fighting a duel with any of your countrymen there is no possibility of getting out of it if you become involved in a quarrel with a foreigner in that case an englishman who showed the white feather would be a disgrace to his country  another advantage of being a good shoti mean a really good shotis that if you get forced into an affair and are desirous of giving a lesson but no more to an opponent you have it in your power to wing him whereas if you are only a tolerably good shot you cant pick your spot and mayto your lasting regretkill him  but all this is in the future bob i have fought several duels myself with those very pistols and i am happy to say i have never killed my man and shall be glad to believe bob that they will always be used in the same spirit  bobs last two evenings before sailing were more pleasant than he had expected mr bale seemed to forget that he was still in philpot lane and chatted with him freely and confidentially  i hope that i am doing the best for you bob i know this is an experiment and i can only trust that it will turn out well i believe you have plenty of sound sense somewhere in your head and that this association with a number of young military men will not have any bad effect upon you but that after four or five years abroad you will not be less but rather more inclined to settle down to business i regard you as my son and have indeed no relations whom i care for in any way except you and your sister i trust that when you come back you will apply yourself to business without becoming as i have done a slave to it  i might if i chose make you altogether independent of it but i am sure that would not be for your good there is nothing more unfortunate for a young man belonging to the middle classes than to have no fixed occupation the heir to large estates is in a different position he has all sorts of responsibilities he has the pursuits of a country gentleman and the duties of a large landowner but the young man of our class who does not take to business is almost certain to go in for reckless dissipation or gambling i have seen numbers of young men sons of old friends of my own who have been absolutely ruined by being left the fortunes their fathers had made simply because they had nothing with which to occupy their minds  it is for this reason bob that i chiefly wish you to succeed me in my business it is a very good one i doubt whether any other merchant imports such large quantities of wines as i do during the next few years i shall endeavour to give up as far as i can what i may call private business and deal entirely with the trade i have been doing so for some time but it is very difficult to give up customers who have dealt with me and my father before me however i shall curtail the business in that direction as much as i can and you will then find it much more easily managed small orders require just as much trouble in their execution as large ones and a wholesale business is in all respects more satisfactory than one in which private customers are supplied as well as the trade  i am entering into arrangements now with several travellers for the purpose of extending my dealings with the trade in the provinces so that when it comes into your hands you will find it more compact and at the same time more extensive than it is now  i am glad that i have had you here for the past four months i have had my eye upon you more closely than you suppose and i am pleased to see that you have worked well and willinglyfar more so than i expected from you this has much encouraged me in the hope that you will in time settle down to business here and not be contented to lead a purposeless and idle life the happiest man in my opinion is he who has something to doand yet not too much who can by being free from anxieties regarding it view his business as an occupation and a pleasure and who is its master and not its slave  i am thinking of giving mr medlin a small interest in the business i mean to make a real effort to break a little loose from it and i have seen enough of him to know that he will make a very valuable junior he is a little eccentric perhapsa sort of exaggeration of myselfbut i shall signify to him that when he comes into the firm i consider that it will be to its advantage that he should import a little of what we may call his extraofficial manner into it  in our business as i am well awarealthough i do not possess it myselfa certain cheerfulness of disposition and a generally pleasing manner are of advantage buyers are apt to give larger orders than they otherwise would do under the influence of pleasant and genial relations and mr medlin can if he chooses make up for my deficiencies in that way  but i am taking the step rather in your interest than in my own it will relieve you of a considerable portion of the burden of the business and will enable you to relax somewhat when you are disposed if you have a partner in whom you can place thorough confidence  i do not wish you to mention this matter to him i would rather open it to him myself we will go on another fishing expedition together and i think we can approach it then on a more pleasant footing than we could here he has modelled himself so thoroughly upon me that the matter could only be approached in so intensely a businesslike way here that i feel sure we should not arrive at anything like such a satisfactory arrangement as we might do elsewhere  in the course of the week captain lockett of the antelope had called at the office and bob had been introduced to him by mr bale he was a hearty and energetic looking man of some fiveandthirty years of age  i shall want you to go to cadiz for me next trip captain lockett mr bale said i am having an unusually large cargo prepared for meenough i fancy to fill up your brig  all the better sir the sailor said there is nothing like having only one shipperit saves time and trouble but i should advise you to insure it for its full value for the channel swarms with french privateers at present and the fellows are building them bigger and mounting heavier guns than they used to do  i am mounting a long eighteen as a swivel gun this voyage in addition to those i carried before but even with that there are some of these french craft might prove very awkward customers if they fell in with us you see their craft are crowded with men and generally carry at least twice as many hands as ours it is just the same with their fishing boats it takes about three frenchmen to do the work of an englishman  well dont get caught this time captain lockett i dont want my nephew to learn to speak french instead of spanish for there is very little trade to be done in that quarter at present and what there is is all carried on by what i may call irregular channels  i fancy there is a great deal of french wine comes into this country still sir in spite of the two nations being at war it suits both governments to wink at the trade we want french wine and they want english money  thats so captain lockett but at any rate we cant send english buyers out there and must take what they choose to send  on saturday morning bob said goodbye to his uncle with an amount of feeling and regret he would have considered impossible four months previously mr medlin accompanied him to southampton and the journey was a very lively one  goodbye bob the clerk said as they shook hands on the deck of the antelope you will be a man when i see you againthat is if you dont come home for a bit before going to the people at cadiz and oporto you will be coming into the firm then and will be mr robert always  not if we go out fishing expeditions together bob said and laughed  ah well perhaps that will be an exception  well goodbye a pleasant voyage to you and dont get into more scrapes than you can help  oh i am growing out of that mr medlin  not you bob they may be different sorts of scrapes in the future but scrapes there will be or i am a dutchman  well youngster are you a good sailor the captain asked as the antelope with all sail set ran down southampton water  i hope i am captain but i dont know yet i have gone out sailing in boats at plymouth several times in rough weather and have never felt a bit ill but i dont know how it will be in a ship like this  if you can sail in rough water in a boat without feeling ill you ought to be all right here lad she is an easy craft as well as a fast one and makes good weather of it in anything short of a gale  there is eight bells strikingthat means eight oclock and breakfast you had better lay in as good a store as you can we shall be outside the needles if the wind holds by dinnertime and you may not feel so ready for it then  the second mate breakfasted in the cabin with the captain and bob the first mate remaining on deck the second mate was a young man of three or four and twenty a cousin of the captain he was a frank pleasantfaced young sailor and bob felt that he should like him  how many days do you expect to be in getting to gibraltar captain  about ten if we have luck twenty if we havent there is never any saying  how many men do you carry  twentyeight seamen the cook the steward two mates and myself and there are three boys thirtysix all told  i see you have eight guns besides the pivot gun  yes we have plenty of hands for working them if we only have to fight one side at once but we shouldnt be very strong handed if we had to work both broadsides there are four sixteen pounders four twelves and the pivot so that gives three men to a gun besides officers and idlers three men is enough for the twelves but it makes rather slow work with the sixteens however we may hope that we shant have to work both broadsides at once  we carry a letter of marque so that in case of our having the luck to fall in with a french trader we can bring her in but that is not our business we are peaceful traders and dont want to show our teeth unless we are interfered with  to bobs great satisfaction he found that he was able to eat his dinner with unimpaired appetite although the antelope was clear of the island and was bowing deeply to a lively sea the first matea powerful looking man of forty who had lost one eye and whose face was deeply seamed by an explosion of powder in an engagement with a french privateercame down to the meal while the second mate took the duty on deck bob found some difficulty in keeping his dish before him for the antelope was lying well over with a northerly wind abeam  she is travelling well probert the captain said we have got her in capital trim this time last time we were too light and could not stand up to our sails  if this wind holds we shall make a fast run of it we will keep her well inshore until we get down to the scillys and then stretch across the bay the nearer we keep to the coast the less fear there is of our running against one of those french privateers  the wind held steady and bob enjoyed the voyage immensely as the brig sailed along the coast after passing portland bill they lost sight of land until after eight hours run a bold headland appeared on the weather beam  that is the start the captain said when i get abeam of it we shall take our bearings and then shape our course across the bay if this wind does but hold we shall make quick work of it  presently the tiller was put up and as the brigs head paid off the yards were braced square and she ran rapidly along towards the southwest with the wind nearly dead aft the next morning when bob went on deck he found that the wind had dropped and the brig was scarcely moving through the water  this is a change mr probert he said to the first mate who was in charge of the deck  yes and not a pleasant one the officer replied i dont like the look of the sky either i have just sent down to the captain to ask him to step on deck  bob looked round the sky was no longer bright and clear there was a dull heavy look overhead and a smoky haze seemed to hang over the horizon all round bob thought it looked dull but wondered why the mate should send for the captain  the latter came up on deck in a minute or two  i dont much like the look of the sky sir the mate said the wind has died suddenly out this last half hour and the swell has got more kick in it than it had i fancy the wind is going round to the southwest and that when it does come it will come hard  i think you are right mr probert i glanced at the glass as i came up and it has fallen half an inch since i was up on deck in the middle watch i think you had better begin to take in sail at once call the watch up from below it is not coming yet but we may as well strip her at once  the mate gave the order to the boatswain whose shrill whistle sounded out followed by the shout of all hands to take in sail  the watch below tumbled up  take the royals and topgallant sails off her mr probert double reef the topsails and get in the courses  bob watched the men as they worked aloft and marvelled at the seeming carelessness with which they hung on where the slip of a foot or hand would mean sudden death and wondered whether he could ever attain such steadiness of head three quarters of an hours hard work and the mast was stripped save for the reduced topsails  get in two of the jibs and brail up the spanker  this was short work when it was done the second mate who had been working forward looked to the captain for further orders the latter had again gone below but was now standing on the poop talking earnestly with the first mate  yes i think you are right bob heard the captain say the glass is still falling and very likely it will be some time before we want these light spars again there is nothing like being snug  aloft again lads the mate sung out and send down the yards and topgallant masts  now she is ready for anything the captain said when the men again descended to the deck  bob who had been so intently watching the men that he had not looked round at the sky since they first went aloft now had time to do so and was startled with the change that had come over the sea and sky there was not a breath of wind there was a dull oily look on the water as it heaved in long regular waves unbroken by the slightest ripple black clouds had banked up from the southwest and extended in a heavy arch across the sky but little ahead of the brig from its edge ragged fragments seemed to break off suddenly and fly out ahead  it is going to blow and no mistake the captain said it is lucky that we have had plenty of time to get her into fighting trim  you had better get hold of something lad and clutch it tight it will begin with a heavy squall and like enough lay her pretty well over on her beam ends when it strikes her  higher and higher the threatening arch rose till its edge stood over the mainmast then the captain cried  here it comes lads hold on every one  looking ahead bob saw a white line it approached with wonderful rapidity and with a confused rushing sound then in a moment he felt himself clinging as if for life to the stanchion of which he had taken hold the wind almost wrenched him from his feet while at the same moment a perfect deluge of water came down upon him  he felt the brig going further and further over till the deck beneath his feet seemed almost perpendicular the captain and first mate had both grasped the spokes of the wheel and were aiding the helmsman in jamming it down bob had no longer a hold for his feet and was hanging by his arms looking down the sea seemed almost beneath him but with a desperate effort he got hold of the rail with one hand and then hauled himself up under it clinging tight to the main shrouds then he saw the second mate loose the jib halliards while one of the sailors threw off the forestaysail sheet and the spanker slowly brought the brigs head up into the wind  as it did so she righted gradually and bob regained his place on deck which was still however lying over at a very considerable angle the captain raised his hand and pointed to the main topsail and the second mate at once made his way aft with some of the men and laying out on the weather rigging made his way aloft the danger seemed to bob so frightful that he dared not look up he could hear through the pauses of the blast the mate shout to the men above him and in a few minutes they again descended to the deck  even bob could feel how much the brig was relieved when the pressure of the topsail was taken off the lower planks of the deck rose from the water and although this still rushed in and out through the scupper holes and rose at times to the level of the bulwark rail he felt that the worst was over  one of the men was called to assist at the helm and the captain and mate came forward to the poop rail  that was touch and go youngster the former shouted to bob  it was bob said more go than touch i should say for i thought she had gone altogether  you had better go below and change your things tell the steward to bring me my oilskins out of my cabin you had better keep below until this rain has stopped  bob thought the advice was good so he went down and got into dry clothes and then lay down on the cabin sofa to leewardhe could not have kept his place on the other side the rain was still falling so heavily on deck that it sounded like a waggon passing overhead and mingled with this noise was the howl of the wind and the swashing of the water against the ships side gradually the motion of the vessel became more violent and she quivered from bow to stern as the waves struck her  although it was early in the afternoon it became almost as dark as night in the cabin the steward had brought him a glass of hot grog as soon as he had changed his clothes and in spite of the din he presently fell off to sleep when he woke the rain had ceased but the uproar caused by the howling of the wind the creaking of the spars and the dashing of the waves was as loud as before  he soon made his way up on deck and found that a tremendous sea was running the foretopsail had been got off the ship the weather sheets of the jib and forestaysail hauled across and the vessel was making comparatively little way through the water she was in factalthough bob did not know itlying to under these sails and the spanker  it all looked so terrible to him that he kept his place but a few minutes and was then glad to return to the sofa below in a short time the captain came down  how are you getting on lad all in the dark eh  steward light the lamp and bring me a tumbler of hot grog keep the water boiling the other officers will be down directly  well what do you think of it young gentleman  i dont like it at all bob said i thought i should like to see a storm but i never want to see one again  i am not surprised at that the captain said with a laugh it is all very well to read about storms but it is a very different thing to be caught in one  is there any danger sir  there is always more or less danger in a storm lad but i hope and think the worst is over we are in for a heavy gale but now that the brig has got through the first burst there is not much fear of her weathering it she is a capital sea boat well found and in good trim and we were fortunate enough in having sufficient warning to get her snug before the first burst came  that is always the most dangerous point when a ship has way on her she can stand almost any gale but when she is caught by a heavy squall when she is lying becalmed you have to look out however she got through that without losing anything and she is lying to now under the smallest possible canvas and if all goes well there is no reason whatever for anxiety  what do you mean by if all goes well captain  i mean as long as one of her masts isnt carried away or anything of that sort i daresay you think it rough now but it is nothing to what it will be by tomorrow morning i should advise you to turn in at once you could see nothing if you went up and would run the risk of being washed overboard or of getting a limb broken  bobs recollections of his position as the ship heeled over when the storm struck her were still far too vivid for him to have any desire for a repetition of it and he accordingly took the captains advice and turned in at once  when he got up in the morning and with some difficulty made his way on deck he found that as the captain predicted the sea was far heavier than the night before great ridges of water bore down upon the ship each seeming as if it would overwhelm her and for the first few minutes bob expected to see the brig go head foremost and sink under his feet it was not till he reflected that she had lived through it for hours that he began to view the scene with composure although the waves were much higher than when he had left the deck on the previous afternoon the scene was really less terrifying  the sky was covered with masses of gray cloud ragged and torn hurrying along with great velocity apparently but a short distance above the masthead when the vessel rose on a wave it seemed to him that the clouds in places almost touched the water and mingled with the masses of spray caught up by the waves the scud borne along by the wind struck his face with a force that caused it to smart and for a time he was unable to face the gale even for a minute  the decks were streaming with water the boats had disappeared from the davits and a clean sweep seemed to have been made of everything movable forward was a big gap in the bulwark and as the brig met the great waves masses of green water poured in through this and swept along the deck waist deep the brig was under the same sail as before except that she now showed a closelyreefed foretopsail  when he became a little accustomed to the sea and to the motion he watched his time and then made a rush across from the companion to the weather bulwark and got a firm hold of one of the shrouds the captain and the second mate were on the poop near the wheel the former made his way to him  good morning master repton managed to get some sleep  yes i have slept all night captain i say isnt this tremendous i did not think anything could be like this it is splendid you know but it takes ones breath away  i dont think it is blowing quite so hard is it  every bit as hard but it is more regular and you are accustomed to it  but i see you have got up some more sail  yes thats to steady her you see when she gets into the trough between these great waves the lower sails are almost becalmed and we are obliged to show something above them to keep a little way on her we are still lying to you see and meet the waves head on if her head was to fall off a few points and one of these waves took her on the beam she would go down like a stone  yes the brig is doing very handsomely she has a fine run more like a schooner than a brig and she meets the waves easily and rises to them as lightly as a feather she is a beauty  if you are going to stay here lad you had better lash yourself for it is not safe standing as you are    chapter 5 a french privateer   as he became more accustomed to the scene around him and found that the waves were more terrible in appearance than reality bob began to enjoy it and to take in its grandeur and wildness the bareness of the deck had struck him at once and he now saw that four of the cannon were gonethe two forward guns on each sideand he rightly supposed that these must have been run out and tumbled overboard to lighten the ship forward and enable her to rise more easily to the waves  an hour later the second mate came along  you had better come down and get some breakfast he said i am going down first  bob threw off the rope and followed the mate down into the cabin mr probert had just turned out he had been lying down for two or three hours having gone down as daylight broke  the captain says you had better take something before you go on deck mr probert the second mate said he will come down afterwards and turn in for an hour or two  no change i suppose  no she goes over it like a duck the seas are more regular now and she is making good weather of it  bob wondered in his own mind what she would do if she was making bad weather  the meal was an irregular one the steward brought in three large mugs half filled with coffee a basket of biscuits and a ham from this he cut off some slices which he laid on biscuits and each of them ate their breakfast holding their mugs in one hand and their biscuits and ham in the other  as soon as they had finished the two officers went on deck and directly afterwards the captain came down bob chatted with him until he had finished his breakfast and then went up on deck again for two or three hours at the end of that time he felt so completely exhausted from the force of the wind and the constant change of the angle at which he was standing that he was glad to go below and lie down again  there was no regular dinner the officers coming below by turns and taking a biscuit and a chunk of cold meat standing but at teatime the captain and second mate came down together and bob who had again been up on deck for a bit joined them in taking a large bowl of coffee  i think the wind is blowing harder than ever he said to the captain  yes the glass has begun to rise a little and that is generally a sign you are getting to the worst of it i expect it is a three days gale and we shall have it at its worst tonight i hope by this time tomorrow we shall be beginning to shake out our reefs  you had better not go up any more it will be dark in half an hour and your bunk is the best place for you  bob was not sorry to obey the order for he felt that the scene would be a very terrible one after dark the night however seemed to him to be a miserably long one for he was only able to doze off occasionally the motion being so violent that he had to jam himself in his berth to prevent himself from being thrown out the blows with which the waves struck the ship were tremendous and so deeply did she pitch that more than once he thought that she would never come up again but go down head foremost once he thought he heard a crash and there were orders shouted on the deck above him but he resisted the desire to go up and see what it was for he knew that he could do nothing and that in the darkness he could see but little of what was going on  with the first gleam of daylight however he got out of the bunk he had not attempted to undress having taken off his shoes only when he lay down having put these on again he went up there was but little change since the previous morning but looking forward he saw that the bowsprit was gone and the foretopmast had been carried away the sea was as high as ever but patches of blue sky showed overhead between the clouds and the wind was blowing somewhat less violently  we have been in the wars you see youngster the captain said when bob made his way aft but we may thank god it was no worse we have had a pretty close squeak of it but the worst is over now the wind is going down and the gale will have blown itself out by this evening it was touchandgo several times during the night and if she had had a few more tons of cargo in her she would never have risen from some of those waves but i think now we shall see oporto safelywhich was more than i expected about midnight  for some hours bob himself had considerable doubts as to this so deeply did the brig bury herself in the waves but after twelve oclock the wind fell rapidly and although the waves showed no signs of decreasing in height their surface was smoother and they seemed to strike the vessel with less force and violence  now mr probert said the captain do you and joe turn in till first watch i will take charge of the deck after that you can set regular watches again  the maintopsail was already on her and at six oclock the captain had two of its reefs shaken out and the other reef was also loosed when mr probert came up and took charge of the first watch at eight bells that night bob lay on the floor for the motion was more violent than beforethe vessel rolling gunwale underfor the wind no longer pressed upon her sails and kept her steady and he would have found it impossible to maintain his position in his berth  in the morning he went up the sun was rising in an unclouded sky there was scarce a breath of wind the waves came along in high glassy rollerssmooth mounds of water which extended right and left in deep valleys and high ridges the vessel was rolling tremendously the lower yards sometimes touching the water bob had to wait some time before he could make a rush across to the bulwark and when he did so found it almost impossible to keep his feet he could see that the men forward were no longer crouching for shelter under the break of the focastle but were holding on by the shrouds or stays smoking their pipes and laughing and joking together until the motion abated somewhat it was clearly impossible to commence the work of getting things in order  did the bowsprit and mast both go together bob asked joe lockett who was holding on to the bulwark near him  yes the bowsprit went with the strain when she rose having buried herself halfway up the waist and the topmast snapped like a carrot a moment later that was the worst dive we made there is no doubt that getting rid of the leverage of the bowsprit right up in her eyes eased her a good bit and as the topmast was a pretty heavy spar too that also helped  how long will it be before the sea goes down  if you mean goes down enough for us to get to worka few hours if you mean goes down altogether it will be five or six days before this swell has quite flattened down unless a wind springs up from some other quarter  i meant till the mast can be got up again  well this afternoon the captain may set the men at work but i dont think they would do much good and there would be a good chance of getting a limb broken as long as this calm holds there is no hurry one way or the other  you mean because we couldnt be sailing even if we had everything set  well yes that is something but i didnt mean that i am not thinking so much of our sailing as of other peoples we are not very fit as we are now either for fighting or running and i should be sorry to see a french privateer coming along but as long as the calm continues there is no fear of that and i expect there have been few ships out in this gale who have not got repairs to do as well as we have  after dinner an effort was made to begin the work but the captain soon ordered the men to desist  it is of no use mr probert we shall only be getting some of the men killed it wouldnt be possible to get half done before dark and if the sea goes down a bit tonight they will get as much done in an hours work in the morning as they would if they were to work from now to sunset  the carpenter might get some canvas and nail it so as to hide those gaps in the bulwark that will be something done the boys can give it a coat of paint in the morning but as for the spar we must leave it  all hands were at work next morning with the first gleam of daylight the rollers were still almost as high as the day before but there was now a slight breath of wind which sufficed to give the vessel steerage way she was put head to the rollers changing the motion from the tremendous rolling when she was lying broadside to them for a regular rise and fall that interfered but little with the work a spare spar was fitted in the place of the bowsprit the stump of the topmast was sent down and the topgallant mast fitted in its place and by midday the light spars were all in their places again and the brig was showing a fair spread of canvas and a casual observer would at a distance have noticed but slight change in her appearance  that has been a good mornings work the captain said as they sat down to dinner we are a little short of headsail but that will make no great difference in our rate of sailing especially if the wind is aft we are ready to meet with another storm again if it should comewhich is not likely  we are ready for anything in fact except a heavilyarmed privateer the loss of four of our guns has crippled us but there was no choice about the matter it went against my heart to see them go overboard but it was better to lose four guns than to lose the ship  i hope we shall meet with nothing till we get through the straits i may be able to pick up some guns at gibraltar prizes are often brought in there and condemned and there are sales of stores so i hope to be able to get her into regular fighting trim again before i clear out from there  i should think you wont be sorry when we drop anchor off the mole youngster  i am in no hurry now bob said i would have given a good dealif i had had ittwo days ago to have been on dry land but now that we are all right again i dont care how long we are before we get there it is very warm and pleasant a wonderful change after what it was when we sailed  whereabouts are we captain  we are a good bit farther to the east than i like the captain replied we have been blown a long way into the bay there is a great set of current in here we have drifted nearly fifty miles in since noon yesterday we are in 4 degrees 50 minutes west longitude and 45 degrees latitude  i dont think that means anything to me  no i suppose not the captain laughed well it means we are nearly due west of bordeaux and about one hundred miles from the french coast and a little more than eighty north of santander on the spanish coast as the wind is sousouwest we can lay our course for cape ortegal and once round there we shall feel more comfortable  but dont you feel comfortable at present captain  well not altogether we are a good deal too close in to the french coast and we are just on the track of any privateer that may be making for bordeaux from the west or south or going out in those directions so although i cant say i am absolutely uncomfortable i shall be certainly glad when we are back again on the regular track of our own line of traffic for the straits or portugal there are english cruisers on that line and privateers on the lookout for the french so that the sound of guns might bring something up to our assistance but there is not much chance of meeting with a friendly craft hereunless it has like ourselves been blown out of its course  a lookout had already been placed aloft several sails were seen in the distance in the course of the afternoon but nothing that excited suspicion the wind continued light and although the brig had every sail set she was not making more than five and a half knots an hour through the water in the evening the wind dropped still more and by nine oclock the brig had scarcely steerage way  it is enough to put a saint out of temper the captain said as he came down into the cabin and mixed himself a glass of grog before turning in if the wind had held we should have been pretty nearly off finisterre by morning as it is we havent made more than forty knots since we took the observation at noon  bob woke once in the night and knew by the rippling sound of water and by the slight inclination of his berth that the breeze had sprung up again when he woke again the sun was shining brightly and he got up and dressed leisurely but as he went into the cabin he heard some orders given in a sharp tone by the captain on deck and quickened his pace up the companion to see what was going on  good morning mr lockett he said to the second mate who was standing close by looking up at the sails  good morning master repton he replied somewhat more shortly than usual  there is a nice breeze this morning bob went on we seem going on at a good rate  i wish she were going twice as fast the mate said there is a gentleman over there who seems anxious to have a talk with us and we dont want to make his acquaintance  bob looked round and saw over the quarter a large lugger some three miles away  what vessel is that he asked  that is a french privateerat least there is very little doubt about it we must have passed each other in the dark for when we first made him out he was about four miles away sailing northeast he apparently sighted us just as we made him out and hauled his wind at once he has gained about a mile on us in the last two hours we have changed our course and are sailing as you see northwest so as to bring the wind on our quarter and i dont think that fellow has come up much since still he does come up we feel the loss of our sail now  it seemed to bob looking up that there was already an immense amount of canvas on the brig stunsails had been set on her and she was running very fast through the water  we seem to have more canvas set than that vessel behind us he said  yes we have more but those luggers sail like witches they are splendid boats but they want very big crews to work them that is the reason why you scarcely ever see them with us except as fishing craft or something of that sort i daresay that lugger has a hundred men on boardeighty anyhowso it is no wonder we sometimes get the worst of it they always carry three hands to our two and very often two to our one of course we are really a trader though we do carry a letter of marque if we were a regular privateer we should carry twice as many hands as we do  walking to the poop rail bob saw that the men were bringing up shot and putting them in the racks by the guns the breech covers had been taken off the first officer was overlooking the work  well lad captain lockett said coming up to him you see that unlucky calm has got us into a mess after all and unless the wind drops again we are going to have to fight for it  would the wind dropping help us sir  yes we have more canvas on her than the lugger carries and if the breeze were lighter should steal away from her as it is she doesnt gain much but she does gain and in another two or three hours she will be sending a messenger to ask us to stop  and what will you do captain  we shall send another messenger back to tell her to mind her own business then it will be a question of good shooting if we can knock out one of her masts we shall get off if we cant the chances are we shall see the inside of a french prison  if she once gets alongside it is all up with us she can carry us by boarding for she can throw three times our strength of men on to our deck  there was but little talking on board the brig when the men had finished their preparations they stood waiting by the bulwarks watching the vessel in chase of them and occasionally speaking together in low tones  you may as well pipe the hands to breakfast mr probert i have told the cook to give them an extra good meal after that i will say a few words to them  now master repton we may as well have our meal we maynt get another good one for some time but i still hope that we shall be able to cripple that fellow i have great faith in that long eighteen the boatswain is an old manowarsman and is a capital shot i am a pretty good one myself and as the sea is smooth and we have a good steady platform to fire from i have good hope we shall cripple that fellow before he comes up to us  there was more talking than usual at breakfast captain lockett and the second mate both laughed and joked over the approaching fight mr probert was always a man of few words and he said but little now  the sooner they come up the better he growled i hate this running away especially when you cant run fastest  the men will all do their best i suppose probert you have been down among them  the first mate nodded  they dont want to see the inside of a prison captain no more than i do they will stick to the guns but i fancy they know well enough it will be no use if it comes to boarding  no use at all probert i quite agree with you there if she comes up alongside we must haul down the flag it is of no use throwing away the mens lives by fighting against such odds as that but we mustnt let her get up  that is it sir we have got to keep her off if it can be done we shall have to haul our wind a little when we begin so as to get that eighteen to bear on her  yes we must do that the captain said then we will get the other four guns over on the same side  after breakfast was over the captain went up and took his station at the poop rail the men had finished their breakfast and on seeing that the captain was about to address them moved aft  my lads he said that frenchman behind will be within range in the course of another hour what we have got to do is to knock some of her spars out of her and as she comes up slowly we shall have plenty of time to do it i daresay she carries a good many more guns than we do but i do not suppose that they are heavier metal if she got alongside of us she would be more than our match but i dont propose to let her get alongside and as i dont imagine any of you wish to see the inside of a french prison i know you will all do your best  let there be no hurrying in your fire aim at her spars and dont throw a shot away the chances are all in our favour for we can fight all our guns while she can fight only her bow chasersat any rate until she bears up she doesnt gain on us much now and when she comes to get a few shot holes in her sails it will make the difference i shall give ten guineas to be divided among the men at the first gun that knocks away one of her spars and five guineas besides to the man who lays the gun  the men gave a cheer  get the guns all over to the port side i shall haul her wind a little as soon as we are within range  by five bells the lugger was within a mile and a half the men were already clustered round the pivot gun  put her helm down a little the captain ordered that is enough  now boatswain you are well within range let us see what you can do fire when you have got her well on your sights  a few seconds later there was a flash and a roar all eyes were directed on the lugger which the captain was watching through his glass there was a shout from the men the ball had passed through the great foresail a couple of feet from the mast  very good the captain said give her a trifle more elevation next time if you can hit the yard it will be just as good as hitting the mast  ah there she goes  two puffs of white smoke broke out from the luggers bow one shot struck the water nearly abreast of the brig at a distance of ten yards the other fell short  fourteens the captain said i thought she wouldnt have eighteens so far forward  shot after shot was fired but so far no serious damage had been caused by them the brig had been hulled once and two shots had passed through her sails  the captain went himself to the pivot gun and laid it carefully bob stood watching the lugger intently and gave a shout as he saw the foresail run rapidly down  it is only the slings cut the second matewho was standing by himsaid they will have it up again in a minute if the shot had been the least bit lower it would have smashed the yard  the lugger came into the wind and as she did so eight guns flashed out from her side while almost at the same moment the four broadside guns of the antelope were for the first time discharged bob felt horribly uncomfortable for a moment as the shot hummed overhead cutting one of the stunsail booms in two and making five fresh holes in the sails  take the men from the small guns joe and get that sail in the captain said its loss is of no consequence  in half a minute the luggers foresail again rose and she continued the chase heading straight for the brig  he doesnt like this game of long bowls probert the captain said he intends to come up to board instead of trusting to his guns  now boatswain you try again  the brig was now sailing somewhat across the luggers bows so that her broadside gunstrained as far as possible aftcould all play upon her and a steady fire was kept up to which she only replied by her two bow chasers one of the men had been knocked down and wounded by a splinter from the bulwark but no serious damage had so far been inflicted while the sails of the lugger were spotted with shot holes  bob wished heartily that he had something to do and would have been glad to have followed the first mates examplethat officer having thrown off his coat and taken the place of the wounded man in working a gunbut he felt that he would only be in the way did he try to assist steadily the lugger came up until she was little more than a quarter of a mile behind them  now lads the captain shouted double shot the gunsthis is your last chance lay your guns carefully and all fire together when i give the word  now are you all ready fire  the five guns flashed out together and the ten shot sped on their way the splinters flew from the luggers foremast in two places but a cry of disappointment rose as it was seen that it was practically uninjured  look look the captain shouted hurrah lads and a cloud of white canvas fell over to leeward of the lugger  her two masts were nearly in line and the shot that had narrowly missed the foremast and passed through the foresail had struck the mainmast and brought it and its sail overboard the crew of the brig raised a general cheer a minute before a french prison had stared them in the face and now they were free the helm was instantly put up and the brig bore straight away from her pursuer  what do you say probert shall we turn the tables now and give her a pounding  i should like to sir nothing better but it would be dangerous work directly she gets free of that hamper she will be under command and will be able to bring her broadside to play on us and if she had luck and knocked away one of our spars she would turn the tables upon us besides even if we made her strike her colours we could never take her into port strong handed as she is we should not dare to send a prize crew on board  you are right probertthough it does seem a pity to let her go scot free when we have got her almost at our mercy  not quite sir look there  the lugger had managed to bring her head sufficiently up into the wind for her broadside guns to bear and the shot came hurtling overhead the yard of the maintopsail was cut in sunder and the peak halliard of the spanker severed and the peak came down with a run they could hear a faint cheer come across the water from the lugger  leave the guns lads and repair damages the captain shouted  throw off the throat halliards of the spanker get her down and send a hand up to reef a fresh rope through the blocks mr probert  joe take eight men with you and stow away the topsail send the broken yard down  carpenter see if you have got a light spar that will do instead of it if not get two small ones and lash them so as to make a splice of it  in a minute the guns of the lugger spoke out again but although a few ropes were cut away and some more holes made in the sails no serious damage was inflicted and before they were again loaded the spanker was rehoisted the lugger continued to fire but the brig was now leaving her fast as soon as the sail was up the pivot gun was again set to work and the lugger was hulled several times but seeing that her chance of disabling the brig was small she was again brought before the wind  in half an hour a new topsail yard was ready and that sail was again hoisted the antelope had now got three miles away from the lugger as the sail sheeted home the second mate shouted from aloft  there is a sail on the weather bow sir she is close hauled and sailing across our head  i see her the captain replied  we ought to have noticed her before mr probert we have all been so busy that we havent been keeping a lookout  what do you make her to be joe he said to the second mate  i should say she was a french frigate sir  the captain ascended the shrouds with his glass remained there two or three minutes watching the ship and then returned to the deck  she is a frigate certainly mr probert and by the cut of her sails i should say a frenchman we are in an awkward fix she has got the weather gage of us do you think if we put up helm and ran due north we should come out ahead of her  the mate shook his head  not if the wind freshens sir as i think it will i should say we had best haul our wind and make for one of the spanish ports we might get into santander  yes that would be our best chance  all hands bout ship  the vessels head was brought up into the wind and payed off on the other tack heading souththe frigate being now on her weather quarter this course took the brig within a mile and a half of the lugger which fired a few harmless shots at her when she had passed beyond the range of her guns she shaped her course southeast by east for santander the frigate being now dead astern the men were then piped to dinner  is she likely to catch us sir bob asked as they sat down to table  i hope not lad i dont think she will unless the wind freshens a good deal if it did she would come up hand over hand  i take it she is twelve miles off now it is four bells and she has only got five hours daylight at most however fast she is she ought not to gain a knot and a half an hour in this breeze and if we are five or six miles ahead when it gets dark we can change our course there is no moon  they were not long below  the lugger is under sail again sir the second mate who was on duty said as they gained the deck  they havent been long getting up a jury mast captain lockett said that is the best of a lug rig still they have a smart crew on board  he directed his glass towards the lugger which was some five miles away  it is a goodsized spar he said nearly as lofty as the foremast she is carrying her mainsail with two reefs in it and with the wind on her quarter is travelling pretty nearly as fast as she did before still she cant catch us and she knows it  do you see mr probert she is bearing rather more to the north she reckons i fancy that after it gets dark we may try to throw the frigate out and may make up that way in which case she would have a good chance of cutting us off that is awkward for the frigate will know that and will guess that instead of wearing round that way we shall be more likely to make the other  that is so the mate agreed still we shall have the choice of either hauling our wind and making south by west or of running on and she cant tell which we shall choose  that is right enough it is just a toss up if we run and she runs she will overtake us if we haul up close into the wind and she does the same she will overtake us again but if we do one thing and she does the other we are safe  then again we may give her more westing after it gets dark and bear the same course the lugger is taking she certainly wont gain on us and i fancy we shall gain a bit on her then in the morning if the frigate is out of sight we can make for santander which will be pretty nearly due south of us then or if the lugger is left well astern we can make a leg north and then get on our old course again for cape ortegal the lugger would see it was of no use chasing us any further  yes i think that is the best plan of the three captain  i see the frigate is coming up i can just make out the line of her hull she must be a fast craft  the hours passed on slowly fortunately the wind did not freshen and the vessels maintained their respective positions towards each other the frigate was coming up but when it began to get dusk she was still some six miles astern the lugger was five miles away on the lee quarter and three miles northeast of the frigate she was still pursuing a line that would take her four miles to the north of the brigs present position the coast of spain could be seen stretching along to the southward another hour and it was perfectly dark and even with the night glasses the frigate could no longer be made out  starboard your helm the captain said to the man at the wheel lay her head due east  i fancy the wind is dying away sir mr probert said  so long as it dont come a stark calm i dont care the captain replied that would be the worst thing that could happen for we should have the frigates boats after us but a light breeze would suit us admirably  two hours later the wind had almost died out  we will take all the sails off her mr probert if the frigate keeps on the course she was steering when we last saw her she will go two miles to the south of us and the lugger will go more than that to the north if they hold on all night they will be hull down before morning and we shall be to windward of them and with the wind light the frigate would never catch us and we know the lugger wouldnt with her reduced sails  in a few minutes all the sails were lowered and the brig lay motionless for the next two hours the closest watch was kept but nothing was seen of the pursuing vessels  i fancy the frigate must have altered her course more to the south the captain said thinking that as the lugger was up north we should be likely to haul our wind in that direction we will wait another hour and then get up sail again and lay her head for cape ortegal  when the morning broke the brig was steering west no sign of the lugger was visible but from the tops the upper sails of the frigate could be seen close under the land away to the southeast  just as i thought the captain said rubbing his hands in high glee she hauled her wind as soon as it was dark and stood in for the coast thinking we should do the same  we are well out of that scrape  two days later the brig dropped her anchor in the tagus where three english ships of war were lying a part of the cargo had to be discharged here and the captain at once went ashore to get a spar to replace the topmast carried away in the gale  we may fall in with another frenchman before we are through the straits he said and i am not going to put to sea again like a lame duck  bob went ashore with the captain and was greatly amused at the scenes in the streets of lisbon  you had better keep with me as i shall be going on board in an hour tomorrow you can come ashore and see the sights and spend the day i would let joe come with you but he will be too busy to be spared so you will have to shift for yourself  before landing in the morning the captain advised him not to go outside the town  you dont know the lingo lad and might get into trouble you see there are always sailors going ashore from our ships of war and they get drunk and have sprees and i dont fancy they are favourites with the lower class here although the shopkeepers of course are glad enough to have their moneybut i dont think it would be safe for a lad like you who cant speak a word of the language to wander about outside the regular streets there will be plenty for you to see without going further  as bob was a good deal impressed with the narrow escape he had had from capture he was by no means inclined to run any risk of getting into a scrape and perhaps missing his passage out he therefore strictly obeyed the captains instructions and whenjust as he was going down to the landing stage where the boat was to come ashore for himhe came upon a party of half drunken sailors engaged in a vigorous fight with a number of portuguese civil guards he turned down a side street to avoid getting mixed up in the frayrepressing his strong impulse to join in by the side of his countrymen  on his mentioning this to the captain when he reached the brig the latter said  it is lucky that you kept clear of the row it is all nonsense talking about countrymen it wasnt an affair of nationality at all nobody would think of interfering if he saw a party of drunken sailors in an english port fighting with the constables if he did interfere it ought to be on the side of the law why then should anyone take the part of drunken sailors in a foreign port against the guardians of the peace to do so is an act of the grossest folly  in the first place the chances are in favour of getting your head laid open with a sword cut these fellows know they dont stand a chance against englishmens fists and they very soon whip out their swords in the second place you would have to pass the night in a crowded lockup where you would be half smothered before morning and lastly if you were lucky enough not to get a weeks confinement in jail you would have a smart fine to pay  there is plenty of fighting to be done in days like these but people should see that they fight on the right side and not be taking the part of every drunken scamp who gets into trouble simply because he happens to be an englishman  you showed plenty of pluck lad when the balls were flying about the other day and when i see your uncle i am sure he will be pleased when i tell him how well you behaved under fire but i am equally certain he would not have been by any means gratified at hearing that i had had to leave you behind at lisbon either with a broken head or in prison through getting into a street row in which you had no possible concern between drunken sailors and the portuguese civil guards  bob saw that the captain was perfectly right and said so frankly  i see i should have been a fool indeed if i had got into the row captain and i shall remember what you say in future still you know i didnt get into it  no i give you credit for that lad but you acknowledge your strong impulse to do so now in future you had better have an impulse just the other way and when you find yourself in the midst of a row in which you have no personal concern let your first thought be how to get out of it as quickly as you can i got into more than one scrape myself when i was a young fellow from the conduct of messmates who had got too much liquor in them but it did them no good and did me harm  so take my advice fight your own battles but never interfere to fight other peoples unless you are absolutely convinced that they are in the right if you are stick by them as long as you have a leg to stand upon    chapter 6 the rock fortress   on the third day after her arrival at lisbon the antelopes anchor was hove up and she dropped down the river half an hour later a barque and another brig came out and joined her the three captains having agreed the day before that they would sail in company as they were all bound through the straits captain lockett had purchased two 14pounder guns at lisbon and the brig therefore now carried three guns on each side besides her long 18 pounder the barque carried fourteen guns and the other brig ten so that they felt confident of being able to beat off any french privateer they might meet on the way  one or two suspicious sails were sighted as they ran down the coast but none of these approached within gunshot the three craft being evidently too strong to be meddled with rounding cape st vincent at a short distance they steered for the mouth of the straits after the bold cliffs of portugal bob was disappointed with the aspect of the spanish coast  ah it is all very well the first mate replied when he expressed his opinion give me your low sandy shores and let those who like have what you call the fine bold rocks  mind i dont mean coasts with sandbanks lying off them but a coast with a shelving beach and pretty deep water right up to it if you get cast on a coast like that of portugal it is certain death your ship will get smashed up like an eggshell against those rocks you are talking of and not a soul gets a chance of escape while if you are blown on a flat coast you may get carried within a ships length of the beach before you strike and it is hard if you cant get a line on shore besides it is ten to one the ship wont break up for hours  no you may get a landsman to admire your bold cliffs but you wont get a sailor to agree with him  we seem to be going along fast although there is not much wind  yes there is a strong current you see the rivers that fall into the mediterranean aint sufficient to make up for the loss by evaporation and so there is always a current running in here it is well enough for us going east but it is not so pleasant when you want to come out then you have got to wait till you can get a breeze from somewhere about east to carry you out i have been kept waiting sometimes for weeks and it is no unusual thing to see two or three hundred ships anchored waiting for the wind to change  are there any pirates over on that side bob asked looking across at the african coast  not about here ceuta lies over there they are good friends with us and gibraltar gets most of its supplies from there but once through the straits we give that coast a wide berth for the algerine pirates are nearly as bad as ever and would snap up any ship becalmed on their coast or that had the bad luck to be blown ashore i hope some day we shall send a fleet down and blow the place about their ears it makes ones blood boil to think that there are hundreds and hundreds of englishmen working as slaves among the moors  there do you see that projecting point with a fort on it and a town lying behind that is tarifa that used to be a great place in the time when the moors were masters in spain  yes the captain who had just joined them said tarif was a great moorish commander i have heard and the place is named after him gibraltar is also named after a moorish chief called tarik ibn zeyad  bob looked surprised  i dont see that it is much like his name captain  no master repton it doesnt sound much like it now the old name of the place was gebel tarik which means tanks hill and it is easy to see how gebel tarik got gradually changed into gibraltar  in another two hours the straits were passed and the rock of gibraltar appeared rising across a bay to the left  illustration view of gibraltar from the mediterranean  view of gibraltar from the mediterranean  there is your destination lad the captain said it is a stronglooking place isnt it  it is indeed captain bob said taking the captains glass from the top of the skylight and examining the rock  you see the captain went on the rock is divided from the mainland by that low spit of sand it is only a few hundred yards wide and the sea goes round at the back of the rock and along the other side of that spitthough you cant see it from hereso anything coming to attack it must advance along the spit under the fire of the guns  there do you see that building standing up on the hill above the town that is the old moorish castle and there are plenty of modern batteries scattered about near it though you cant see them you see the rock rises sheer up from the spit and it is only on this side close to the waters edge that the place can be entered  the weak side of the place is along this sea face on the other side the rock rises right out of the water but on this side as you see it slopes gradually down there are batteries all along by the waters edge but if the place were attacked by a fleet strong enough to knock those batteries to pieces and silence their guns a landing could be effected  at the southern end you see the rocks are bolder and there is no landing there that is called europa point and there is a battery there though you cant make it out from here  the scene was a very pretty one and bob watched it with the greatest interest a frigate and two menofwar brigs were anchored at some little distance from the rock and around them were some thirty or forty merchantmen waiting for a change in the wind to enable them to sail out through the straits whitesailed boats were gliding about among them  at the head of the bay were villages nestled among trees while the country behind was broken and hilly on the opposite side of the bay was a town of considerable size which the captain told him was algeciras it was he said a large town at the time of the moors very much larger and more important than gibraltar the ground rose gradually behind it and was completely covered with foliage orchards and orange groves  the captain said  you see that rock rising at the end of the bay from among the trees lads that is called the queen of spains chair it is said that at a certain siege when the moors were here the then queen of spain took her seat on that rock and declared she would never go away till gibraltar was taken she also took an oath never to change her linen until it surrendered i dont know how she managed about it at last for the place never did surrender i suppose she got a dispensation and was able to get into clean clothes again some day  i have heard tell that the spaniards have a colour that is called by her namea sort of dirty yellow it came out at that time of course it would not have been etiquette for other ladies to wear white when her majesty was obliged to wear dingy garments so they all took to having their things dyed so as to match hers and the tint has borne her name ever since  it is a very nasty idea bob said and i should think she took pretty good care afterwards not to take any oaths it is hot enough now and i should think in summer it must be baking here  it is pretty hot on the rock in summer you know they call the natives of the place rock scorpions scorpions are supposed to like heat though i dont know whether they do you generally find them lying under pieces of loose rock but whether they do it for heat or to keep themselves cool i cant say  now mr probert you may as well take some of the sail off her we will anchor inside those craft close to the new mole they may want to get her alongside to unload the government stores we have brought out and the nearer we are in the less trouble it will be to warp her alongside tomorrow morning of course if the landing place is full they will send lighters out to us  illustration view of gibraltar from the bay  view of gibraltar from the bay  the sails were gradually got off the brig and she had but little way on when her anchor was dropped a cables length from the end of the mole scarcely had she brought up when a boat shot out from the end of the pier  hooray bob shouted there are my sister and gerald  i thought as much the captain said we hoisted our number as soon as we came round the point and the signal station on the top of the rock would send down the news directly they made out our colours  well bob it gave me quite a turn his sister said after the first greetings were over when we saw how the sails were all patched and everyone said that the ship must have been in action i was very anxious till i saw your head above the bulwarks  yes we have been in a storm and a fight and we came pretty near being taken did you get out all right  yes we had a very quiet voyage  the captain then came up and was introduced  i have a box or two for you madam in addition to your brothers kit mr bale sent them down a couple of days before we sailed  at one time it didnt seem likely that you would ever see their contents for we had a very close shave of it in the first place we had about as bad a gale as i have met with in crossing the bay and were blown into the bight with the loss of our bowsprit foretopmast and four of our guns that we had to throw overboard to lighten her  then a french lugger that would have been a good deal more than a match for her at any time came up we might have out sailed her if we could have carried all our canvas but with only a jury topmast she was too fast for us as you may see by our sails we had a smart fight but by the greatest good fortune we knocked the mainmast out of her  then we were chased by a french frigate with the lugger to help her however we gave them the slip in the night and here we are  i am afraid you wont get your brothers boxes till tomorrow nothing can go ashore till the port officer has been on board and the usual formalities gone through i dont know yet whether we shall discharge into lighters or go alongside but i will have your boxes all put together in readiness for you the first thing in the morning whichever way it is  we shall be very glad if you will dine with us tomorrow captain ohalloran said we dine at one oclock or if that would be inconvenient for you come to supper at seven  i would rather do that if you will let me captain lockett replied i shall be pretty busy tomorrow and you military gentlemen do give us such a lot of troublein the way of papers documents and signaturesthat i never like leaving the ship till i get rid of the last bale and box with the government brand on it  very well then we shall expect you to supper  i shall come down first thing in the morning captain bob said so i need not say goodbye to anyone now  you had better bring only what you may want with you for the night bob his sister put in as he was about to run below the cart will take everything else up together in the morning  then i shall be ready in a minute bob said running below and it was not much more before he reappeared with a small handbag  i shall see you again tomorrow mr probert i shall be here about our luggage and he took his place in the boat beside the others who had already descended the ladder  and you have had a pleasant voyage bob captain ohalloran asked  very jolly gerald first rate captain lockett was as kind as could be and the first mate was very good too though i did not think he would be when i first saw him and joe lockett the second mate is a capital fellow  but how was it that you did not take that french privateer bob with a fellow like you on boardthe capturer of a gang of burglars and all that sort of thingi should have thought that instead of running away you would have gone straight at her that you would have thrown yourself on her deck at the head of the boarders would have beaten the frenchmen below killed their captain in single combat and hauled down their flag  there is no saying what i might have done bob laughed if it had come to boarding but as it was i did not feel the least wish for a closer acquaintance with the privateer it was too close to be pleasant as it wasa good deal too close it is a pity you were not there to have set me an example  i am going to do that now bob and i hope you will profit by it  now then you jump out first and give carrie your hand that is it  and having settled with the boatman captain ohalloran followed the others steps it was a busy scene three ships were discharging their cargoes and the wharf was covered with boxes and bales piles of shot and shell guns and cases of ammunition fatigue parties of artillery and infantry men were piling the goods or stowing them in handcarts goods were being slung down from the ships and were swinging in the air or run down to the cry of look below  mind how you go carrie captain ohalloran said or you will be getting what brains you have knocked out  if that is all the danger gerald she laughed you are safe anyhow  now bob do look out she broke off as while glancing round he tripped over a hawser and fell are you hurt  never mind him carrielook out for yourself a boy never gets hurt  now keep your eyes about you bob you can come and look at all this any day  at last they got to the end of the mole then they passed under an archway with a massive gate at which stood a sentry then they found themselves in a sort of yard surrounded by a high wall on the top of which two cannon were pointed down upon them crossing the yard they passed through another gateway the ground here rose sharply and a hundred yards further back stood another battery completely commanding the mole and the defences through which they had passed  the ground here was comparatively level rising gradually to the foot of the rock which then rose steeply up a few houses were scattered about surrounded by gardens hedges of cactus lined the road parties of soldiers and sailors natives with carts and women in picturesque costumes passed along the vegetation on the low ground was abundant and bob looked with delight at the semitropical foliage  turning to the right they followed the road passed under an archway in a strong wall and were in the town itself  we are not living in barracks carrie said fortunately there was no room there and we draw lodging allowance and have taken the upper portion of a spanish house it is much more pleasant besides if we had had to live in quarters we should have had no room for you  the streets are steep bob said i cant make out how these little donkeys keep their feet on the slippery stones with those heavy loads  oh i say there are two rumlooking chaps what are theymoors  yes you will see lots of them here bob they come across from ceuta and there are some of them established here as traders what with the moors and spaniards and jews and the sailors from the shipping you can hear pretty nearly every european language spoken in one walk through the streets  oh i say isnt this hot bob exclaimed mopping his face and isnt there a glare from all these white walls and houses how much higher is it  about another hundred yards bob there you see we are getting beyond the streets now  they had now reached a flat shoulder and on this the houses were somewhat scattered standing in little inclosures with hedges of cactus and geranium and embowered in shrubs and flowers  this is our house carrie said stopping before a rickety wooden gateway hung upon two massive posts of masonry you see we have got a flight of steps outside and we are quite cut off from the people below  they ascended the stairs at the top there was a sort of wide porch with a wooden roof which was completely covered with creepers growing from two wooden tubs four or five plants covered with blossoms stood on the low walls and two or three chairs showed that the little terrace was used as an openair sitting room  in another hour when the sun gets lower bob we can come and sit here it is a lovely view isnt it  beautiful bob said leaning on the wall  below them lay the sea front with its gardens and bright foliage and pretty houses with europa point and the sea stretching away beyond it a little to the right were the african hills and then turning slightly round the spanish coast with algeciras nestled in foliage and the bay with all its shipping the head of the bay was hidden for the ground behind was higher than that on which the house stood  come in bob captain ohalloran said you had better get out of the sun of course it is nothing to what it will be but it is hot now and we are none of us acclimatized yet  the rooms were of a fair size but the lightcoloured walls gave them a bare appearance to bobs eyes they were however comfortably furnished matting being laid down instead of carpets  it is cooler and cheaper carrie said seeing bob looking at them  this is your room and this is the kitchen and she opened the door into what seemed to bob a tiny place indeed  across one end was a mass of brickwork rather higher than an ordinary table several holes a few inches deep were scattered about over this in some of these small charcoal fires were burning and pots were placed over them there were small openings from the front leading to these tiny fireplaces and a spanish girl was driving the air into one of these with a fan when they entered  this is my brother manola mrs ohalloran said  the girl smiled and nodded and then continued her work  she speaks english bob said as they went out  she belongs to the rock bob almost all the natives here talk a little english  where do these steps lead to i thought we were at the top of the house  come up and see carrie said leading the way  following her bob found himself on a flat terrace extending over the whole of the house several orange treesin tubsand many flowers and small shrubs in pots stood upon it and three or four light canework lounging chairs stood apart  here is where we come when the sun is down bob there is no finer view we flatter ourselves anywhere in gib here we receive our guests in the evening we have only begun yet but we mean to make a perfect garden of it  it is splendid bob said as he walked round by the low parapet and gazed at the view in all directions and we can see what everyone else is doing on their roofs and no one can look down on usexcept from the rock over there behind us and there are no houses there  no the batteries commanding the neutral ground lie over that crest bob we are quite shut in on two sides but we make up for it by the extent of our view on the others we are very lucky in getting the place a regiment went home in the transport that brought us out gerald knew some of the officers and one of them had been staying here and told gerald of it and we took it at once the other officers wives are all quite jealous of me and though some of them have very nice quarters it is admitted that as far as the view goes this is by far the best besides it is a great thing being out of the town and it does not take gerald more than three or four minutes longer to get down to the barracks  but now let us go downstairs i am sure you must want something to eat and we shant have supper for another three hours  i dined at twelve bob said just before we rounded the point and i could certainly hold on until supper time still i daresay i could eat something now  oh it is only a snack it is some stewed chicken and some fruit that wont spoil your supper bob  you will be glad to hear bob captain ohalloran said as the lad was eating his meal that i have secured the services of a spanish professor for you he is to begin next monday  bobs face fell  i dont see that there was need for such a hurry he said ruefully laying down his knife and fork i dont see there was need for any hurry at all besides of course i want to see the place  you will be able to see a good deal of it in four days bob and your time wont be entirely occupied when you do begin the days are pretty long here everyone gets up early  he is to come at seven oclock in the morning you have a cup of coffee and some bread and butter and fruit before that he will go at nine then we have breakfast then you will have your time to yourself till dinner at half past two the assistant surgeon of our regimenthe is a dublin manwill come to you for latin and what i may call general knowledge for two hours that is all except i suppose that you will work a bit by yourself of an evening  that is not so bad is it  what sort of man is the assistant surgeon bob replied cautiously it all depends how much he is going to give me to do in the evening  i dont think he will give you anything to do in the evening bob of course the spanish is the principal thing and i told him that you will have to work at that  i dont think you need be afraid bob his sister laughed you wont find dr burke a very severe kind of instructor nobody but gerald would ever have thought of choosing him  sure and didnt you agree with me carrie her husband said in an aggrieved voice that as we were not going to make the boy a parson and as it was too much to expect him to learn spanish and a score of other things at once that we ought to get someone who would make his lessons pleasant for him and not be worrying his soul out of his body with all sorts of useless balderdash  yes we agreed that gerald but there was a limit and when you told me you had spoken to teddy burke about it and arranged the matter with him i thought you had gone beyond that limit altogether  he is just the man for bob carrie that boy will find it mighty dull here after a bit and will want someone to cheer him up i promised the old gentleman i would find him someone who could push bob on in his humanities and teddy burke has taken his degree at dublin and i will venture to say will get him on faster than a stiff starched man will do bob would always be playing tricks with a fellow like that and be getting into rows with him there will be no playing tricks with teddy burke for he is up to the whole thing himself  i should think he is gerald well we will see how it works anyhow  go on with your fowl bob you will see all about it in good time  bob felt satisfied that the teacher his brotherinlaw had chosen for him was not a very formidable personage and his curiosity as to what he would be like was satisfied that evening after he had finished his meal he went for a stroll with captain ohalloran through the town and round the batteries at that end of the rock returning to supper after the meal was over they went up to the terrace above there was not a breath of wind and a lamp on a table there burned without a flicker  they had scarcely taken their seats when manola announced dr burke and a minute later an officer in uniform made his appearance on the terrace he wore a pair of blue spectacles and advanced in a stiff and formal manner  i wish you a good evening mrs ohalloran so this is our young friend  you are well i hope master repton and are none the worse for the inconveniences i hear you have suffered on your voyage  carrie to bobs surprise burst into a fit of laughter  what is the matter mrs ohalloran dr burke asked looking at her with an air of mild amazement  i am laughing at you teddy burke how can you be so ridiculous  the doctor removed his spectacles  now mrs ohalloran he said with a strong brogue do you call that acting fairly by me didnt you talk to me yourself half an hour yesterday and impress upon me that i ought to be grave and steady now that i was going to enter upon the duties of a pedagogue and aint i trying my best to act up to your instructions and there you burst out laughing in my face and spoil it all entirely  gerald said to me now mind teddy it is a responsible affair the boy is up to all sorts of divarsions and divil a bit will he attend to ye if he finds that you are as bad if not worse than he is himself  but said i its latin and such like that you are wanting me to teach him and not manners at all at all  and he says it is all one it is quiet and well behaved that you have got to be teddy the missis has been houlding out about the iniquity of taking a spalpeen like yourself and it is for you to show her that she is mistaken altogether  so i said you trust me gerald i will be as grave as a doctor of divinity  so i got out these glasseswhich i bought because they told me that they would be wanted here to keep out the glare of the sunand i came here and spoke as proper as might be and then mrs ohalloran you burst out laughing in my face and destroy the whole effect of these spectacles and all  well we must make the best of a bad business and we will try for a bit anyhow if he wont mind me gerald must go to the chaplain as he intended to and i pity the boy then i would rather be had up before the colonel any day than have any matter in dispute with him  you are too bad teddy burke mrs ohalloran said still laughing it was all very well for you to try and look sensible but to put on that face was too absurd you know you could not have kept it up for five minutes  no i dont think it will do and she looked serious now i always thought that it was out of the question but this bad beginning settles it  but bob who had been immensely amused now broke in  why not carrie i am sure i should work better for dr burke than i should for anyone who was very strict and stiff one is always wanting to do something with a man like that to play tricks with his wig or pigtail or something of that sort you might let us try anyhow and if dr burke finds that i am not attentive and dont mind him then you can put me with somebody else  sure we shall get on first rate mrs ohalloran gerald says the boy is a sensible boy and that he has been working very well under an old uncle of yours he knows for himself that its no use his having a master if he isnt going to try his best to get on when i was at school i used to get larrupped every day and used to think to myself what a grand thing it would be to have a master just like what dr burke md dublin is now and i expect it is just about the same with him we shant work any the worse because maybe we will joke over it sometimes  very well then we will try teddy though i know the whole regiment will think gerald and i have gone mad when they hear about it but i shall keep my eye upon you both  the more you keep your eye upon me the better i shall be plazed mrs ohalloran saving your husbands presence the doctor said insinuatingly  do sit down and be reasonable teddy there are cigars in that box on the table  the tobacco here almost reconciles one to living outside ireland dr burke said as he lit a cigar and seated himself in one of the comfortable chairs just about a quarter the price they are at home and brandy at one shilling per bottle it is lucky for the country that we dont get them at that price in ireland for it is mighty few boys they would get to enlist if they could get tobacco and spirits at such prices at home  i have been telling gerald that it will be much better for him to drink claret out here mrs ohalloran said  and you are not far wrong the doctor agreed but the native wines here are good enough for me and you can get them at sixpence a quart i was telling them at mess yesterday that we must not write home and tell them about it or faith there would be such an emigration that the rock wouldnt hold the peoplenot if you were to build houses all over it sixpence a quart and good sound tipple  sure and it was a mighty mistake of providence that ireland was not dropped down into the sea off the coast of spain what a country it would have been  i dont know teddy captain ohalloran said as the people dont kill themselves with overwork now i doubt if they would ever work at all if they had the excuse of a hot climate for doing nothing  there would not have been so much need gerald they neednt have bothered about the thatch when it only rains once in six months or so while as for clothes it is little enough they would have needed and the bogs would all have dried up and they would have had crops without more trouble than just scratching the ground and sowing in the seed and they would have grown oranges instead of praties oh it would have been a great country entirely  the doctors three listeners all went off into a burst of laughter at the seriousness with which he spoke  but you would have had trouble with your pigs mrs ohalloran said the spanish pigs are wild fiercelooking beasts and would never be content to share the cottages  ah but we would have had irish pigs just the same as now well what do you think and he broke off suddenly sitting upright and dropping the brogue altogetherthey were saying at mess that the natives declare there are lots of spanish troops moving down in this direction and that a number of ships are expected with stores at algeciras  well what of that mrs ohalloran asked we are at peace with spain what does it matter where they move their troops or land stores  that is just the thing we are at peace with them sure enough but that is no reason why we should be always at peace you know how they hate seeing our flag flying over the rock and they may think that now we have got our hands full with france and the american colonists it will be the right time for them to join in the scrimmage and see if they cant get the rock back again  but they would never go to war without any ground of complaint  i dont know mrs ohalloran when one wants to pick a quarrel with a man it is always a mighty easy thing to do so you can tread on his toe and ask him what he put it there for or sit down on his hat and swear that he put it on the chair on purpose or tell him that you do not like the colour of his hair or that his nose isnt the shape that pleases you it is the easiest thing in the world to find something to quarrel about when you have a mind for it  are you quite serious teddy  never more serious in my life  have you heard about it gerald  i heard them saying something about it when we were waiting for the colonel on parade this morning but i did not think much of it  well of course it maynt be true gerald but the colonel and major both seemed to think that there was something in it it seems from what they said that the governor has had letters that seemed to confirm the news that several regiments are on the march south and that stores are being collected at cadiz and some of the other seaports there is nothing as far as we know specially said about gibraltar but what else can they be getting ready for unless it is to cross the straits and attack the moorsand they are at peace with them at present just as they are with us i mean to think that they are coming here till we are downright sure they are not the news is so good i mean to believe that it is true as long as i can  for shame teddy mrs ohalloran said you cant be so wicked as to hope that they are going to attack us  and it is exactly that point of wickedness i have arrived at the doctor said again dropping into the brogue in the first place shant we need something to kape us from dying entirely of nothing to do at all at all in this wearisome old place we are fresh to it and we are not tired yet of the oranges and the wine and the cigars and the quare people you see in the streets but the regiments that have been here some time are just sick of their lives then in the second place how am i going to learn my profession if we are going to stop here quiet and peaceful for years didnt i come into the army to study gunshot wounds and barring duels divil a wound have i seen since i joined its getting rusty i am entirely and there is the elegant case of instruments my aunt gave me that have never been opened by the same token i will have them out and oil them in the morning  dont talk in that way teddy you ought to be ashamed of yourself it seems to me that you are making a great todo about nothing some soldiers have been marched somewhere in spain and all this talk is made up about it they must know very well they cant take the rock they tried it once and i should have thought they would not be in a hurry to try it again i shall believe in it when i see it  you need not look so delighted bob if there should be any troubleand it seems nonsense even to think about such a thingbut if there should be any we should put you on board the very first vessel sailing for england and get you off our minds  bob laughed  i should go down and ship as a powder monkey on one of the ships of war or enlist as a drummer in one of the regiments and then i should be beyond your authority altogether  i begin to think you are beyond my authority already bob  gerald i am afraid we did a very foolish thing in agreeing to have this boy out here  well we have got him on our hands now carrie and it is early yet for you to find out your mistake  well if there should be a siege  you know there is no chance of it gerald  well i only say if and we are cut off from all the world he will be a companion to you and keep you alive while i am in the batteries  i wont hear such nonsense talked any more gerald and if teddy burke is going to bring us every bit of absurd gossip that may be picked up from the peasants he can stay away altogether  except when he comes to instruct his pupil mrs ohalloran  oh that is not likely to last long dr burke  that is to be seen mrs ohalloran it is a nice example you are setting him of want of respect for his instructor i warn you that before another six months have passed you will have to confess that it has been just the very best arrangement that could have been made and will thank your stars that dr edward burke md of dublin happened to be here ready to your hand    chapter 7 troubles ahead   when dr burke had left bob broke into an indian war dance expressive of the deepest satisfaction and captain ohalloran burst into a shout of laughter at the contrast between the boys vehement delight and the dissatisfaction expressed in his wifes face  i am not at all pleased gerald not at all and i dont see that it is any laughing matter i never heard a more ridiculous thing  uncle intrusted bob to our care believing that we should do what was best for him and here you go and engage the most featherheaded irishman in the garrisonand that is saying a good deal geraldto look after him  it was so seldom that carrie took matters seriously that her husband ceased laughing at once  well carrie there is no occasion to put yourself out about it the experiment can be tried for a fortnight and if at the end of that time you are not satisfied we will get someone else but i am sure it will work well  so am i carrie bob put in i believe dr burke and i will get on splendidly you see i have been with two people both of whom looked as grave as judges and one of them as cross as a bear and yet they were both firstrate fellows it seems to me that dr burke is just the other way he turns everything into fun but i expect he will be just as sharp when he is at lessons as anyone else at any rate you may be sure that i will do my best with him so as not to get put under some stiff old fellow instead of him  well we shall see bob i hope that it will turn out well i am sure  of course it will turn out well carrie why didnt your uncle at first think i was the most harumscarum fellow he ever saw and now he sees that i am a downright model husband with only one fault and that is that i let you have your own way altogether  it looks like it on the present occasion gerald his wife laughed i will give it as you say a fortnights trial i only hope that you have made a better choice for bobs spanish master  i hope so my dearthat is if it is possible the professor as i call him has been teaching his language to officers here for the last thirty years he is a queer wizenedup little old chap and has got out of the way of bowing and scraping that the senors generally indulge in but he seems a cheery little old soul and he has got to understand english ways and at any rate there is no fear of his leading bob into mischief the spaniards dont understand that and if you were to ruffle his dignity he would throw up teaching him at once and i have not heard of another man on the rock who would be likely to suit  on the following monday bob began work with the professor who called himself on his card don diaz martos he spoke english very fairly and after the first half hour bob found that the lessons would be much more pleasant than he expected the professor began by giving him a long sentence to learn by heart thoroughly and when bob had done this parsed each word with him so that he perfectly understood its meaning then he made the lad say it after him a score of times correcting his accent and inflection and when he was satisfied with this began to construct fresh sentences out of the original one again making bob repeat them and form fresh ones himself  thus by the time the first lesson was finished the lad to his surprise found himself able without difficulty to frame sentences from the words he had learned then the professor wrote down thirty nouns and verbs in common use  you will learn them this evening he said and in the morning we shall be able to make up a number of sentences out of them and by the end of a week you will see we shall begin to talk to each other after that it will be easy thirty fresh words every day will be ample in a month you will know seven or eight hundred and seven or eight hundred are enough for a man to talk with on common occasions  he is first rate bob reported to his sister as they sat down to dinner at one oclock you would hardly believe that i can say a dozen little sentences already and can understand him when he says them he says in a week we shall be able to get to talk together  i wonder they dont teach latin like that why i shall know in two or three months as much spanishand more ever so much morethan i do latin after grinding away at it for the last seven or eight years  well that is satisfactory i only hope the other will turn out as well  as mrs ohalloran sat that evening with her work in her hand on the terrace with her husband smoking a cigar beside her she paused several times as she heard a burst of laughter  that doesnt sound like master and pupil she said sharply after an unusually loud laugh from below  more the pity carrie why on earth shouldnt a master be capable of a joke do you think one does not learn all the faster when the lecture is pleasant i know i would myself i never could see why a man should look as if he was going to an execution when he wants to instil knowledge  but it is not usual gerald carrie remonstrated no other argument occurring to her  but that doesnt prove that its wrong why a boy should be driven worse than a donkey and thrashed until his life is a burden to him and he hates his lessons and hates his master beats me entirely some day they will go more sensibly to work  you see in the old times carrie men used to beat their wives and you dont think the women were any the better for it do you  of course they werent carrie said indignantly  but it was usual you know carrie just as you say that it is usual for masters to beat boysas if they would do nothing without being thrashed i cant see any difference between the two things  i can see a great deal of difference sir  well what is the difference carrie  but carrie disdained to give any answer still as she sat sewing and thinking the matter over she acknowledged to herself that she really could not see any good and efficient reason why boys should be beaten any more than women  but women dont do bad things like boys she said breaking silence at last  dont they carrie i am not so sure of that i have heard of women who are always nagging their husbands and giving them no peace of their lives i have heard of women who think of nothing but dress and who go about and leave their homes and children to shift for themselves i have heard of women who spend all their time spreading scandal i have heard of  there that is enough carrie broke in hastily but you dont mean to say that they would be any the better for beating gerald  i dont know carrie i should think perhaps they might be sometimes at any rate i think that they deserve a beating quite as much as a boy does for neglecting to learn a lesson or for playing some prankwhich comes just as naturally to him as mischief does to a kitten for anything really bad i would beat a boy as long as i could stand over him for lying or thieving or any mean dirty trick i would have no mercy on him but that is a very different thing to keeping the cane always going at school as they do now  but here comes bob well bob is the doctor gone didnt you ask him to come up and have a cigar  yes but he said he had got two or three cases at the hospital he must see and would wait until this evening  how have you got on bob  splendidly i wonder why they dont teach at school like that  it didnt sound much like teaching carrie said severely  i dont suppose it did carrie but it was teaching for all that why i have learned as much this evening as i did in a dozen lessons in school he explains everything so that you seem to understand it at once and he puts things sometimes in such a droll way and brings in such funny comparisons that you cant help laughing but you understand it for all that and are not likely to forget it  dont you be afraid carrie if dr burke teaches me for the two years that i am going to be here i shall know more than i should have done if i had stopped at tullochs till i was an old man i used to learn lessons there and get through them somehow but i dont think i ever understood why things were so while dr burke explains everything so that you seem to understand all about it at once and he is pretty sharp too he takes a tremendous lot of pains himself but i can see he will expect me to take a tremendous lot of pains too  at the end of a fortnight carrie made no allusion to the subject of a change of masters the laughing downstairs still scandalized her a little but she saw that bob really enjoyed his lessons and although she herself could not test what progress he was making his assurances on that head satisfied her  the brilliant had sailed on a cruise the morning after bobs arrival but as soon as he heard that she had again dropped anchor in the bay he took a boat and went out to her and returned on shore with jim sankey who had obtained leave for the afternoon the two spent hours in rambling about the rock and talking of old times at tullochs both agreed that the most fortunate thing that ever happened had been the burglary at admiral langtons which had been the means of jims getting into the navy and bobs coming out to gibraltar to his sister  jim had lots to tell of his shipmates and his life on board the brilliant he was disposed to pity bob spending half his day at lessons and was astonished to find that his friend really enjoyed it and still more that he should already have begun to pick up a little spanish  you cant help it with don diaz bob said he makes you go over a sentence fifty times until you say it in exactly the same voice he doesi mean the same accent he says it slow at first so that i can understand him and then faster and faster till he speaks in his regular voice then i have to make up another sentence in answer it is good fun i can tell you and yet one feels that one is getting on very fast i thought it would take years before i should be able to get on anyhow in spanish but he says if i keep on sticking to it i shall be able to speak pretty nearly like a native in six months time i quite astonish manolathat is our servantby firing off sentences in spanish at her my sister carrie says she shall take to learning with the don too  have you had any fun since you landed bob  no not regular fun you know it has been very jolly i go down with geraldcarries husband you knowto the barracks and i know most of the officers of his regiment now and i walk about a bit by myself but i have not gone beyond the rock yet  you must get a long days leave bob and we will go across the neutral ground into spain together  gerald said that as i was working so steadily i might have a holiday sometimes if i did not ask for it too often i have been three weeks at it now i am sure i can go for a day when i like so it will depend on you  i shant be able to come ashore for another four or five days after having got away this afternoon let us see this is wednesday i will try to get leave for monday  have you heard jim there is a talk about spanish troops moving down here and that they think spain is going to join france and try to take this place  no i havent heard a word about it jim said opening his eyes you dont really mean it  yes that is what the officers say of course they dont know for certain but there is no doubt the country people have got the idea into their heads and the natives on the rock certainly believe it  hooray that would be fun jim said we have all been grumbling on board the frigate at being stuck down here without any chance of picking up prizes or of falling in with a frenchman except we go on a cruise why you have seen twice as much fun as we have though you only came out in a trader except that we chased a craft that we took for a french privateer we havent seen an enemy since we came out from england and we didnt see much of her for she sailed right away from us while you have had no end of fighting and a very narrow escape of being taken to a french prison  too narrow to be pleasant jim i dont think there would be much fun to be got out of a french prison  i dont know bob i suppose it would be dull if you were alone but if you and i were together i feel sure we should have some fun and should make our escape somehow  well we might try bob said doubtfully but you see not many fellows do make their escape and as sailors are up to climbing ropes and getting over walls and all that sort of thing i should think they would do it if it could be managed anyhow  upon the following daywhen bob was in the anteroom of the mess with captain ohalloran looking at some papers that had been brought by a ship that had come in that morningthe colonel entered accompanied by captain langton the officers all stood up and the colonel introduced them to captain langtonwho was he told them going to dine at the mess that evening after he had done this captain langtons eye fell upon bob who smiled and made a bow  i ought to know you the captain said i have certainly seen your face somewhere  it was at admiral langtons sir my name is bob repton  of course it is the officer said shaking him cordially by the hand but what on earth are you doing here i thought you had settled down somewhere in the city with an uncle wasnt it  yes sir but i have come out here to learn spanish  have you seen your friend sankey  yes sir i went on board the frigate to see him yesterday afternoon and he got leave to come ashore with me for two or three hours  he ought to have let me know that you were here the captain said who are you staying with lad  with captain ohalloran sir my brotherinlaw bob said indicating gerald who had already been introduced to captain langton  i daresay you are surprised at my knowing this young gentleman he said turning to colonel cochrane but he did my father the admiral a great service he and three other lads under his leadership captured four of the most notorious burglars in london when they were engaged in robbing my fathers house it was a most gallant affair i can assure you and the four burglars swung for it a couple of months later i have one of the lads as a midshipman on board my ship and i offered a berth to repton but very wisely he decided to remain on shore where his prospects were good  why ohalloran you never told me anything about this the colonel said  no sir bob asked me not to say anything about it i think he is rather shy of having it talked about and it is the only thing of which he is shy as far as i have discovered  well we must hear the story the colonel said i hope you will dine at mess this evening and bring him with you he shall tell us the story over our wine i am curious to know how four boys can have made such a capture  after mess that evening bob told the story as modestly as he could  there colonel captain langton said when he had finished you see that if these stories i hear are true and the spaniards are going to make a dash for gibraltar you have got a valuable addition to your garrison  yes indeed the colonel laughed we will make a volunteer of him he has had some little experience of standing fire for ohalloran told me that the brig he came out in had fought a sharp action with a privateer of superior force and indeed when she came in here her sails were riddled with shot holes  better and better captain langton laughed  well repton remember whenever you are disposed for a cruise i shall be glad to take you as passenger sankey will make you at home in the midshipmens berth if the spaniards declare war with us we shall have stirring times at sea as well as on shore and though you wont get any share in any prize money we may win while you are on board you will have part of the honour and you see making captures is quite in your line  the next day captain ohalloran and bob dined on board the brilliant captain langton introduced the lad to his officers telling them that he wished him to be considered as being free on board the ship whether he himself happened to be on board or not when he came off  but you must keep an eye on him mr hardy while he is on board he said to the first lieutenant  mr sankey and he nodded at jim who was among those invited is rather a pickle but from what i hear repton is worse so you will have to keep a sharp eye upon them when they are together and if they are up to mischief do not hesitate to masthead both of them a passenger on board one of his majestys ships is amenable to discipline like anyone else  i will see to it sir the lieutenant said laughing sankey knows the way up already  yes i think i observed him taking a view of the shore from that elevation this morning  jim coloured hotly  yes sir the lieutenant said the doctor made a complaint that his leeches had got out of their bottle and were all over the ship and i fancy one of them got into his bed somehow he had given mr sankey a dose of physic in the morning and remembered afterwards that while he was making up the medicine sankey had been doing something in the corner where his bottles were when i questioned sankey about it he admitted that he had observed the leeches but declined to criminate himself farther so i sent him aloft for an hour or two to meditate upon the enormity of wasting his majestys medical stores  i hope captain ohalloran the captain said that you have less trouble with your brotherinlaw than we have with his friend  bob hasnt had much chance yet captain ohalloran said laughing he is new to the place as yet and besides he is really working hard and hasnt much time for mischief but i dont flatter myself that it is going to last  well mr sankey you may as well take your friend down and introduce him formally to your messmates the captain said and jim who had been feeling extremely uncomfortable since the talk had turned on the subject of mastheading rose and made his escape with bob leaving the elders to their wine  the proposed excursion to the spanish lines did not come off as the brilliant put to sea again on the day fixed for it she was away a fortnight and on her return the captain issued orders that none of the junior officers when allowed leave were to go beyond the lines for the rumours of approaching troubles had become stronger and as the peasantry were assuming a somewhat hostile attitude any act of imprudence might result in trouble jim often had leave to come ashore in the afternoon and as this was the time that bob had to himself they wandered together all over the rock climbed up the flagstaff and made themselves acquainted with all the paths and precipices  their favourite place was the back of the rock where the cliff in many places fell sheer away for hundreds of feet down into the sea they had many discussions as to the possibility of climbing up on that side though both agreed that it would be impossible to climb down  i should like to try awfully bob said one day early in june as they were leaning on a low wall looking down to the sea  but it would never do to risk getting into a scrape here it wouldnt indeed bob they dont understand jokes at gib one would be had up before the big wigs and courtmartialled and goodness knows what of course it is jolly being ashore but one never gets rid of the idea that one is a sort of prisoner there are the regulations about what time you may come off and what time the gate is closed and if you are a minute late there you are until next morning whichever way one turns there are sentries and you cant pass one way and you cant go back another way and there are some of the batteries you cant go into without a special order it never would do to try any nonsense here  look at that sentry up there i expect he has got his eye on us now and if he saw us trying to get down he would take us for deserters and fire there wouldnt be any fear of his hitting us but the nearest guard would turn out and we should be arrested and reported and all sorts of things it wouldnt matter so much for you but i should get my leave stopped altogether and should get into the captains black books  no no i dont mind running a little risk of breaking my neck but not here on the rock i would rather get into ten scrapes on board the frigate than one here  yes i suppose it cant be done bob agreed but i should have liked to swing myself down to one of those ledges there would be such a scolding and shrieking among the birds  yes that would be fun but as it might bring on the same sort of row among the authorities i would rather leave it alone  i expect we shall soon get leave to go across the lines again there doesnt seem to be any chance of a row with the dons i expect it was all moonshine from the first why they say spain is trying to patch up the quarrel between us and france she would not be doing that if she had any idea of going to war with us herself  i dont know jim gerald and dr burke were talking it over last night and gerald said just what you do and then dr burke said  you are wrong entirely gerald that is just the dangerous part of the affair why should spain want to put a stop to the war between us and the frog eaters sure wouldnt she look on with the greatest pleasure in life while we cut each others throats and blew up each others ships and put all the trade of the mediterranean into her hands why it is the very thing that suits her best  then what is she after putting herself forward for teddy gerald said  because she wants to have a finger in the pie gerald it wouldnt be dacent for her to say to england  it is in a hole you are at present wid your hands full and so i am going to take the opportunity of pitching into you  so she begins by stipping forward as the dear friend of both parties and she says  what are you breaking each others heads for boys make up your quarrel and shake hands  then she sets to and proposes termswhich she knows mighty well we shall never agree to for the letters we had the other day said that it was reported that the proposals of spain were altogether unacceptableand then when we refuse she turns round and says  you have put yourself in the wrong entirely i gave you a chance of putting yourself in the right and it is a grave insult to me for you to refuse to accept my proposals so there is nothing for me to do now but just to join with france and give you the bating you desarve  that is teddy burkes idea jim and though he is so full of fun he is awfully clever and has got no end of sense and id take his opinion about anything you see how he has got me on in these four months in latin and things why i have learnt more with him than i did all the time i was at tullochs he says most likely the negotiations will be finished one way or the other by the middle of this month and he offered to bet gerald a gallon of whisky that there would be a declaration of war by spain before the end of the month  did he jim said in great delight well i do hope he is right we are all getting precious tired i can assure you of broiling down there in the harbour the decks are hot enough to cook a steak upon when we started today we didnt see a creature in the streets everyone had gone off to bed for two or three hours and the shops were all closed as if it had been two oclock at night instead of two oclock in the day even the dogs were all asleep in the shade i think we shall have to give up our walks till august is over it is getting too hot for anything in the afternoon  well it is hot bob agreed carrie said i was mad coming out in it today and should get sunstroke and all sort of things and gerald said at dinner that if it were not against the regulations he would like to shave his head instead of plastering it all over with powder  i call it disgusting jim said heartily that is the one thing i envy you in i shouldnt like to be grinding away at books as you do and you dont have half the fun i do on shore here without any fellows to have larks with but not having to powder your hair almost makes up for it i dont mind it in winter because it makes a sort of thatch for the head but it is awful now i feel just as if i had got a pudding crust all over my head  well that is appropriate jim laughed bob and then jim chased him all along the path till they got within sight of a sentry in a battery and then his dignity as midshipman compelled them to desist and the pair walked gravely down into the town  that evening after lessons were over dr burke as usual went up on to the terrace to smoke a cigar with captain ohalloran  it is a pity altogether mrs ohalloran he said as he stood by her side looking over the moonlit bay with the dark hulls of the ships and the faint lights across at algeciras that we cant do away with the day and have nothing but night of it for four or five months in the year i used to think it must be mighty unpleasant for the esquimaux but faith i envy them now fancy five or six months without catching a glimpse of that burning old sun  i dont suppose they think so mrs ohalloran laughed but it would be pleasant here the heat has been dreadful all day and it is really only after sunset that one begins to enjoy life  you may well say that mrs ohalloran faith i wish they would let me take off my coat and do my work in my shirtsleeves down at the hospital sure it is a strange idea these military men have got in their heads that a man isnt fit for work unless he is buttoned so tightly up to the chin that he is red in the face if nature had meant it we should have been born in a suit of scale armour like a crocodile  well there is one consolationif there is a siege i expect there will be an end of hair powder and cravats its the gineral rule on a campaign and it is worth standing to be shot at to have a little comfort in ones life  do you think that there is any chance at all of the spaniards taking the place if they do besiege us bob asked as dr burke took his seat  none of taking the place by force bob it has been besieged over and over again and it is pretty nearly always by hunger that it has fallen that is where the pinch will come if they besiege us in earnest its living on mice and grass you are like to be before it is over  but the fleet will bring in provisions surely dr burke  the fleet will have all it can do to keep the sea against the navies of france and spain they will do what they can you may be sure but the enemy well know that it is only by starving us out that they can hope to take the place and i expect they will put such a fleet here that it will be mighty difficult for even a boat to find its way in between them  do you know about the other sieges mrs ohalloran asked of course i know something about the last siege but i know nothing about the history of the rock before that and of course gerald doesnt know  and why should i carrie you dont suppose that when i was at school at athlone they taught me the history of every bit of rock sticking up on the face of the globe i had enough to do to learn about the old romansbad cess to them and all their bothering doings  i can tell you about it mrs ohalloran teddy burke said bobs professor who comes to have a talk with me for half an hour every day has been telling me all about it and if gerald will move himself and mix me a glass of grog to moisten my throat i will give you the whole story of it  you know no doubt that it was called mount calpe by geralds friends the romans who called the hill opposite there mount abyla and the two together the pillars of hercules but beyond giving it a name they dont seem to have concerned themselves with it nor do the phoenicians or carthaginians though all of them had cities out in the low country  it was when the saracens began to play their games over here that we first hear of it roderic you know was king of the goths and seems to have been a thundering old tyrant and one of his nobles julianwho had been badly treated by himwent across with his family into africa and put up mousa the saracen governor of the province across there to invade spain they first of all made a little expeditionthat was in 711with one hundred horse and four hundred foot they landed over there at algeciras and after doing some plundering and burning sailed back again with the news that the country could be conquered so next year twelve thousand men under a chief named tarik crossed and landed on the flat between the rock and spain he left a party here to build the castle and then marched away defeated roderic and his army at xeres and soon conquered the whole of spain except the mountains of the north  we dont hear much more of gibraltar for another six hundred years algeciras had become a fortress of great strength and magnificence and gibraltar was a mere sort of outlying post ferdinand the fourth of spain besieged algeciras for years and could not take it but a part of his army attacked gibraltar and captured it the african moors came over to help their friends and ferdinand had to fall back but the spaniards still held gibraltara chap named vasco paez de meira being in command  in 1333 abomelique son of the emperor of fez came across with an army and besieged gibraltar vasco held out for five months and was then starved into surrender just as alonzo the eleventh was approaching to his assistance he arrived before the town five days after it surrendered and attacked the castle but the moors encamped on the neutral ground in his rear and cut him off from his supplies and he was obliged at last to negotiate and was permitted to retire he was not long away next time he attacked algeciras which after a long siege he took in 1343  in 1349 there were several wars in africa and he took advantage of this to besiege gibraltar he was some months over the business and the garrison were nearly starved out when pestilence broke out in the spanish camp by which the king and many of his soldiers died and the rest retired  it was not until sixty years afterwards in 1410 that there were fresh troubles and then they were what might be called family squabbles the africans of fez had held the place till then but the moorish king of grenada suddenly advanced upon it and took it a short time afterwards the inhabitants rose against the spanish moors and turned them out and the emperor of morocco sent over an army to help them but the moors of grenada besieged the place and took it by famine  in 1435 the christians had another slap at it but henry de guzman who attacked by sea was defeated and killed in 1462 the greater part of the garrison of gibraltar was withdrawn to take part in some civil shindy that was going on at grenada and in their absence the place was taken by john de guzman duke of medinasidonia and son of the henry that was killed in 1540 gibraltar was surprised and pillaged by one of barossas captains but as he was leaving some christian galleys met him and the corsairs were all killed or taken  this was really the only affair worth speaking of between 1462 when it fell into the hands of the spaniards and 1704 when it was captured by us sir george rooke who had gone out with a force to attack cadizfinding that there was not much chance of success in that directionresolved with prince george of hesse and darmstadtwho commanded the troops on board the fleetto make an attack on gibraltar  on the 21st of july 1704 the english and dutch landed on the neutral ground and at daybreak on the 23rd the fleet opened fire the spaniards were driven from their guns on the molehead battery the boats landed and seized the battery and held it in spite of the spaniards springing a mine which killed two lieutenants and about forty men the marquis de salines the governor was then summoned and capitulated so you see we made only a days work of taking a place which the spaniards thought that they had made impregnable the professor made a strong point of it that the garrison consisted only of a hundred and fifty men which certainly accounts for our success for it is no use having guns and walls if you havent got soldiers to man them  the prince of hesse was left as governor and it was not long before his mettle was tried for in october the spanish army with six battalions of frenchmen opened trenches against the town admiral sir john leake threw in reinforcements and six months provisions at the end of the month a forlorn hope of five hundred spanish volunteers managed to climb up the rock by ropes and ladders and surprised a battery but were so furiously attacked that they were all killed or taken prisoners a heavy cannonade was kept up for another week when a large number of transports with reinforcements and supplies arrived and the garrison being now considered strong enough to resist any attack the fleet sailed away  the siege went on till the middle of march when sir john leake again arrived drove away the french fleet and captured or burnt five of them and the siege was then discontinued having cost the enemy ten thousand men so you see there was some pretty hard fighting over it  the place was threatened in 1720 and in the beginning of 1727 twenty thousand spaniards again sat down before it the fortifications had been made a good deal stronger after the first siege and the garrison was commanded by lieutenant governor clayton the siege lasted till may when news arrived that the preliminaries of a general peace had been signed there was a lot of firing but the spaniards must have shot mighty badly for we had only three hundred killed and wounded you would think that that was enough but when i tell you that the cannon were so old and rotten that seventy cannon and thirty mortars burst during the siege it seems to me that every one of those three hundred must have been damaged by our own cannon and that the spaniards did not succeed in hitting a single man  that is mighty encouraging for you mrs ohalloran for i dont think that our cannon will burst this time and if the spaniards do not shoot better than they did before it is little work enough that is likely to fall to the share of the surgeons  thank you mrs ohalloran said you have told that very nicely teddy burke i did not know anything about it before and i had some idea that it was when the english were besieged here that the queen of spain sat on that rock which is called after her but i see now that it was ferdinands isabella and that it was when the moors were besieged here hundreds of years before  well i am glad i know something about it it is stupid to be in a place and know nothing of its history you are rising in my estimation fast dr burke  mistress ohalloran the doctor said rising and making a deep bow you overwhelm me entirely and now i must say goodnight for i must look in at the hospital before i turn in to my quarters    chapter 8 the siege begins   on the 19th of june general eliott accompanied by several of his officers paid a visit to the spanish lines to congratulate general mendoza who commanded there on the promotion that he had just received the visit lasted but a short time and it was remarked that the spanish officer seemed ill at ease scarcely had the party returned to gibraltar than a swedish frigate entered the bay having on board mr logie hm consul in barbary who had come across in her from tangier he reported that a swedish brig had put in there she reported that she had fallen in with the french fleet of twentyeight sail of the line off cape finisterre and that they were waiting there to be joined by the spanish fleet from cadiz  the news caused great excitement but it was scarcely believed for the spanish general had given the most amicable assurances to the governor on the 21st however the spaniards at their lines across the neutral ground refused to permit the mail to pass and a formal notification was sent in that intercourse between gibraltar and spain would no longer be permitted this put an end to all doubt and discussion war must have been declared between spain and england or such a step would never have been taken  in fact although the garrison did not learn it until some time later the spanish ambassador in london had presented what was virtually a declaration of war on the 16th a messenger had been sent off on the same day from madrid ordering the cessation of intercourse with gibraltar and had he not been detained by accident on the road he might have arrived during general eliotts visit to the spanish lines a fact of which mendoza had been doubtless forewarned and which would account for his embarrassment at the governors call  captain ohalloran brought the news home when he returned from parade  get ready your sandbags carrie examine your stock of provisions prepare a store of lint and plaster  what on earth are you talking about gerald  it is war carrie the dons have refused to accept our mail and have cut off all intercourse with the mainland  carrie turned a little pale she had never really thought that the talk meant anything or that the spaniards could be really intending to declare war without having any ground for quarrel with england  and does it really mean war gerald  there is no doubt about it the spaniards are going to fight and as their army cant swim across the bay of biscay i take it it is here they mean to attack us faith we are going to have some divarshun at last  divarshun you ought to be ashamed of yourself gerald  well my dear what have i come into the army for to march about for four hours a day in a stiff stock and powder and pigtail and a cocked hat and a red coat not a bit of it didnt i enter the army to fight and here have i been without a chance of smelling powder for the last ten years it is the best news i have had since you told me that you were ready and willing to become mrs ohalloran  and to think that we have got bob out here with us his wife said without taking any notice of the last words what will uncle say  faith and it makes mighty little difference what he says carrie seeing that he is altogether beyond shouting distance  as for bob he will be just delighted why he has been working till his brain must all be in a muddle and it is the best thing in the world for him or he would be mixing up the spaniards and the romans and the xs and ys and the tangents and all the other things into a regular jumbleand it is a nice business that would have been it is the best thing in the world for him always supposing that he dont get his growth stopped for want of victuals  you dont mean really and seriously gerald that we are likely to be short of food  and that is exactly what i do mean you may be sure that the dons know mighty well that they have no chance of taking the place on the land side they might just as well lay out their trenches against the moon it is just starvation that they are going to try and when they get the eighteen french sail of the line that mr logie brought news of and a score or so of spanish menofwar in the bay you will see that it is likely you wont get your mutton and your butter and vegetables very regularly across from tangier  well it is very serious gerald  very serious carrie  i dont see anything to laugh at at all gerald  i didnt know that i was laughing  you were looking as if you wanted to laugh which is just as bad i suppose there is nothing to be done gerald  well yes i should go down to the town and lay in a store of things that will keep you see if nothing comes of it we should not be losers the regiment is likely to be here three or four years so we should lose nothing by laying in a big stock of wine and so on while if there is a siege you will see everything will go up to ten times its ordinary price that room through ours is not used for anything and we might turn that into a storeroom  i dont mean that there is any hurry about it today but we ought certainly to lay in as large a store as we can of things that will keep some things we may get cheaper in a short time than we can now a lot of the jew and native traders will be leaving if they see there is really going to be a siege for you see the town is quite open to the guns of batteries on the other side of the neutral ground  it was a mighty piece of luck we got this house you see that rising ground behind will shelter us from shot they may blaze away as much as they like as far as we are concerned  ah there is bob coming out of his room with the professor  well take him out and tell him gerald i want to sit down and think my head feels quite in a whirl  bob was of course greatly surprised at the news and the professor himself was a good deal excited  illustration the professor gets excited  we have been living here for three hundred years he said my fathers and grandfathers when the english came and took this placeseventyfive years agomy grandfather became a british subject like all who remained here my father who was then but a boy has told me that he remembers the great siege and how the cannons roared night and day it was in the year when i was born that the spaniards attacked the rock again and a shell exploded in the house and nearly killed us all i was born a british subject and shall do my duty in what way i can if the place is attacked they call us rock scorpions well they shall see we can live under fire and will do our best to sting if they put their finger on us ha ha  the little man is quite excited captain ohalloran said as the professor turned away and marched off at a brisk pace towards his home it is rather hard on these rock people of course as he says they are british subjects and were born so still you see in race and language they are still spaniards and their sympathies must be divided at any rate at present when the shot and shell come whistling into the town and knocking their houses about their ears they will become a good deal more decided in their opinions than they can be now  come along bob and let us get all the news i came off as soon as i heard that our communication with spain was cut off and therefore it was certain war was declared there will be lots of orders out soon it is a busy time we shall have of it for the next month or two  there were many officers in the anteroom when they entered  any fresh news captain ohalloran asked  lots of it ohalloran all the irish officers of the garrison are to be formed into an outlying force to occupy the neutral ground it is thought their appearance will be sufficient to terrify the spaniards  get out with you grant if they were to take us at all it would be because they knew that we were the boys to do the fighting  and the drinking ohalloran another young officer put in  and the talking said another  now drop it boys and be serious what is the news really  there is a council of war going on at the governors ohalloran boyd of course and de la motte colonel green the admiral mr logie and two or three others they say the governor has been gradually getting extra stores across from tangier ever since there was first a talk about this business and of course that is the most important question at present i hear that green and the engineers have been marking out places for new batteries for the last month and i suppose fatigue work is going to be the order of the day it is too bad of them choosing this time of the year to begin for it will be awfully hot work  everyone is wondering what will become of the officers who are living out with their families at san roque and the other villages across the spanish lines and besides there are a lot of officers away on leave in the interior of course they wont take them prisoners that would be a dirty trick but it is likely enough they may ship them straight back to england instead of letting them return here  well it is lucky that we have got a pretty strong garrison we have just been adding up the last field state these are the figuresofficers noncommissioned officers and menartillery 485 12th regiment 599 39th 586 56th 587 58th 605 72nd 1046 the hanoverian brigadeof hardenbergs redens and de la mottes regiments1352 and 122 engineers under colonel green which makes up altogether 5382 officers and men  that is strong enough for anything but it would have been better if there had been five hundred more artillerymen but i suppose they will be able to lend us some sailors to help work the heavy guns  they will turn you into a powder monkey repton  i dont care what they turn me into bob said so long as i can do something  i think it is likely captain ohalloran said gravely that all women and children will be turned out of the place before fighting begins except of course wives and children of officers  there was a general laugh at bob  well he said quietly it will lessen the ranks of the subalterns for there must be a considerable number who are not many months older than i am i am just sixteen and i know there are some not older than that  this was a fact for commissions werein those daysgiven in the army to mere lads and the ensigns were often no older than midshipmen  late in the afternoon a procession of carts was seen crossing the neutral ground from the spanish lines and it was soon seen that these were the english officers and merchants from san roque and the other villages they had that morning received peremptory orders to leave before sunset some were fortunate enough to be able to hire carts to bring in their effects but several were compelled from want of carriage to leave everything behind them  the guards had all been reinforced at the northern batteries pickets had been stationed across the neutral ground the guard at the work known as the devils tower were warned to be specially on the alert and the artillery in the battery on the rock above it were to hold themselves in readiness to open fire upon the enemy should they be perceived advancing towards it  it was considered improbable in the extreme that the enemy would attack until a great force had been collected but it was possible that a body of troops might have been collected secretly somewhere in the neighbourhood and that an attempt would be made to capture the place by surprise before the garrison might be supposed to be taking precautions against attack  the next morning orders were issued and large working parties were told off to go on with the work of strengthening the fortifications and notice was issued that all empty hogsheads and casks in the town would be bought by the military authorities  these were to be filled with earth and to take the places of fascines for which there were no materials available on the rock  parties of men rolled or carried these up to the heights other parties collected earth and piled it to be carried up in sacks on the back of mulesthere being no earth on the rocks where the batteries would be establisheda fact which added very largely to the difficulties of the engineers  on the 24th the childers sloop of war brought in two prizes from the west one of which an american she had captured in the midst of the spanish fleet some of the spanish menofwar had made threatening demonstrations as if to prevent the sloop from interfering with her but they had not fired a gun and it was supposed that they had not received orders to commence hostilities two english frigates had been watching the fleet and it was supposed to be on its way to join the french fleet off cape finisterre  the spaniards were seen now to be at work dragging down guns from san roque to arm their two fortssaint philip and saint barbarawhich stood at the extremities of their lines saint philip on the bay and saint barbara upon the seashore on the eastern side of the neutral side in time of peace only a few guns were mounted in these batteries  illustration the rock and bay of gibraltar  admiral duff moved the menofwar under his command consisting of the pantherof sixty gunsthree frigates and a sloop from their usual anchorage off the water portwhere they were exposed to the fire of the enemys fortsto the new mole more to the southward  bob would have liked to be out all day watching the busy preparations and listening to the talk of the natives who were greatly alarmed at the prospect of the siege knowing that the guns from the spanish forts and especially from fort saint philip could throw their shot and shell into the town but captain ohalloran agreed with his wife that it was much better he should continue his lessons with don diaz of a morning for that it would be absurd for him to be standing about in the sun the whole day the evening lessons were however discontinued from the first as dr burke had his hands full in superintending the preparations making at the hospitals for the reception of large numbers of wounded  bob did not so much mind this for he had ceased to regard the time spent with the professor as lessons after he had once mastered the conjugation of the verbs and had learned an extensive vocabulary by heart books had been laid aside altogether and the three hours with the professor had for the last two months been spent simply in conversation they were no longer indoors but sat in the garden on the shady side of the house or when the sky happened to be clouded and the morning was cool walked together out to europa point and would sit down there looking over the sea but always talking sometimes it was historyroman english or spanishsometimes bobs schooldays and life in london sometimes general subjects it mattered little what they talked about so that the conversation was kept up  sometimes when it was found that topics failed them the professor would give bob a spanish book to glance through and its subject would serve as a theme for talk on the following day and as it was five months since the lad had landed he was now able to speak in spanish almost as fluently as in english as he had learnt almost entirely by ear and any word mispronounced had had to be gone over again and again until don diaz was perfectly satisfied his accent was excellent and the professor had told him a few days before the breaking out of the war that in another month or two he should discontinue his lessons  it would be well for you to have one or two mornings a week to keep up your accent you can find plenty of practice talking to the people i see you are good at making friends and are ready to talk to labourers at work to boys to the market women and to anyone you come across but their accent is bad and it would be well for you to keep on with me but you speak at present much better spanish than the people here and if you were dressed up as a young spaniard you might go about spain without anyone suspecting you to be english  indeed by the professors method of teachingassisted by a natural aptitude and three hours daily conversation for five monthsbob had made surprising progress especially as he had supplemented his lesson by continually talking spanish with manola with the spanish woman and children living below them and with everyone he could get to talk to  he had seen little of jim since the trouble began as leave was for the most part stoppedthe ships of war being in readiness to proceed to sea at a moments notice to engage an enemy or to protect merchantmen coming in from the attacks of the spanish ships and gunboats across at algeciras  bob generally got up at five oclock now and went out for two or three hours before breakfast for the heat had become too great for exercise during the day he greatly missed the market for it had given him much amusement to watch the groups of peasant womenwith their baskets of eggs fowls vegetables oranges and fruit of various kindsbargaining with the townspeople and joking and laughing with the soldiers the streets were now almost deserted and many of the little traders in vegetables and fruit had closed their shops the fishermen however still carried on their work and obtained a ready sale for their catch there had indeed been a much greater demand than usual for fish owing to the falling off in the fruit and vegetable supplies  the cessation of trade was already beginning to tell upon the poorer part of the population but employment was found for all willing to labour either at collecting earth for the batteries or out on the neutral groundwhere three hundred of them were employed by the engineers in levelling sand hummocks and other inequalities in the ground that might afford any shelter to an enemy creeping up to assault the gates by the waterside  dr burke came in with captain ohalloran to dinner ten days after the gates had been closed  you are quite a stranger teddy mrs ohalloran said  i am that he replied but you are going to be bothered with me again now we have got everything in apple pie order and are ready to take half the garrison under our charge there has been lots to do all the medical stores have been overhauled and lists made out and sent home of everything that can be requiredmedicines and comforts and lint and bandages and splints and wooden legs and goodness knows what besides we hope they will be out in the first convoy  there is a privateer going to sail tomorrow so if you want to send letters home or to order anything to be sent out to you you had better take the opportunity have you got everything you want for the next two or three years  two or three years carrie repeated in tones of alarm you mean two or three months  indeed and i dont if the french and the dons have made up their mind to take this place and once set to fairly to do it they are bound to stick to it for a bit i should say you ought to provide for three years  but that is downright nonsense teddy why in three months there ought to be a fleet here that would drive all the french and spaniards away  well if you say there ought to be there ought the doctor said but where is it to come from i was talking to some of the naval men yesterday and they all say it will be a long business if the french and spanish are in earnest the french navy is as strong as ours and the spaniards have got nearly as many ships as the french we have got to protect our coasts and our trade to convoy the east indian fleets and to be doing something all over the world and they doubt whether it would be possible to get together a fleet that could hope to defeat the french and spanish navies combined  well have you been laying in stores mrs ohalloran  yes we have bought two sacks of flour and fifty pounds of sugar ten pounds of tea and a good many other things  if you will take my advice the doctor said earnestly you will lay in five times as much say ten sacks of flour two hundredweight of sugar and everything else in proportion those sort of things havent got up in price yet but you will see everything will rise as soon as the blockade begins in earnest  no the prices of those things have not gone up much but fruit is three times the price it was a fortnight ago and chickens and eggs are double and vegetables are hardly to be bought  that is the worst of it the doctor said its the vegetables that i am thinking of  well we can do without vegetables mrs ohalloran laughed as long as we have plenty of bread  it is just that you cant do you see we shall be cut off from tangiermaybe tomorrow maybe a fortnight hencebut we shall be cut off a ship may run in sometimes at night but you cant count upon that and it is salt meat that we are going to live upon and if you live on salt meat you have got to have vegetables or fruit to keep you in health  now i tell you what i should do gerald and i am not joking with you in the first place i would make an arrangement with the people downstairs and i would hire their garden from them i dont suppose they would want much for it for they make no use of it except to grow a few flowers then i would go down the town and i would buy up all the chickens i could get there are plenty of them to be picked up if you look about for them for most of the people who have got a bit of ground keep a few fowls get a hundred of them if you can and turn them into the garden buy up twenty sacks if you like of damaged biscuits you can get them for an old song the commissariat have been clearing out their stores and there are a lot of damaged biscuits to be sold by auction tomorrow you would get twenty sacks for a few shillings  that way you will get a good supply of eggs if the siege lasts ever so long and you can fence off a bit of the garden and raise fowls there that will give you a supply of fresh meat and any eggs and poultry you cant eat yourselves you can sell for big prices you could get a chicken three weeks ago at threepence never mind if you have to pay a shilling for them now they will be worth five shillings before long  if you can rent another bit of garden anywhere near i would take it if not i would hire three or four men to collect earth and bring it up here this is a good big place i suppose it is thirty feet by sixty well i would just leave a path from the door there up to this end and a spare place here for your chairs and i would cover the rest of it with earth nine inches or a foot deep and i would plant vegetables  do you mane we are to grow cabbages here teddy captain ohalloran asked with a burst of laughter  no i wouldnt grow cabbages i would just grow mustard and cress and radishes if you eat plenty of them they will keep off scurvy and all you dont want for yourselves i will guarantee you will be able to sell at any price you like to ask for them and if nobody else will buy them the hospitals will they would be the saving of many a mans life  but they would want watering captain ohalloran said more seriously for he saw how much the doctor was in earnest  they will that you will have no difficulty in hiring a man to bring up water and to tend to them and to look after the fowls men will be glad enough to work for next to nothing  i tell you gerald if i wasnt in the service i should hire every bit of land i could lay hands on and employ as many labourers as it required and i should look to be a rich man before the end of the siege i was speaking to the chief surgeon today about it and he is going to put the convalescents to work on a bit of spare ground there is at the back of the hospital and to plant vegetables  i was asking down the town yesterday and i found that at blounts store you can get as much vegetable seed as you like you lay in a stock today of mustard and cress and radish dont be afraid of the expenseget twenty pounds of each of them you will be always able to sell what you dont want at ten times the price you give for it now if you can get a piece more garden ground take it at any price and raise other vegetables but keep the top of the house here for what i tell you  well i said nine inches deep of earth that is more than necessary four and a half will do for the radishes and two is enough for the mustard and cress that will grow on a blanketit is really only water that it wants  what do you think carrie captain ohalloran asked  well gerald if you really believe the siege is going to last like that i should think that it would be really worth while to do what teddy burke advises of course you will be too busy to look after things but bob might do so  of course i would bob broke in it will give me something to do  well we will set about it at once then i will speak to the man downstairs you know he has got two or three horses and traps down in the town and lets them to people driving out across the lines but of course he has nothing to do now and i should think that he would be glad enough to arrange to look after the fowls and the things up here  the garden is a good size i dont think anything could get out through that prickly pear hedge but anyhow any gaps there are can be stopped up with stakes i think it is a really good idea and if i can get a couple of hundred fowls i will i should think there was plenty of room for them in the garden i will set up as a poultry merchant  you might do worse gerald i will bet you a gallon of whisky they will be selling at ten shillings a couple before this business is over and there is no reason in the world why you should not turn an honest pennyit will be a novelty to you  well i will go down the town at once gerald said and get the seeds and the extra stores you advise teddy and tomorrow i will go to the commissariat sale and buy a ton or two of those damaged biscuits we will take another room from them downstairs as a storeroom for that and the eggs and i will get a carpenter to come up and put a fence and make some runs and a bit of a shelter for the sitting hens and the chickens bob shall do the purchasing  you had better get a boy with a big basket to go with you bob and go round to the cottages to buy up fowls mind dont let them sell you nothing but cocksone to every seven or eight hens is quite enough and dont let them foist off old hens on youthe younger they are the better i should say that at first you had better take manola with you if carrie can spare her then you wont get taken in and you will soon learn to tell the difference between an old hen and a young chicken  when you are buying the seed ohalloran said dr burke you would do well to get a few cucumbers and melons and pumpkins they will grow on the roof splendidly and you can plant them near the parapet where they will grow down over the sides so they wont take up much room and you can pick them with a ladder the pumpkin is a good vegetable and the fowls will thank you for a bit to pick when you can spare one they will all want manure but you get plenty of that from the fowl yard  why teddy there seems no end to your knowledge mrs ohalloran said first of all you turn out to be a schoolmaster and now you are a gardener and poultry raiser and to think i never gave you credit for knowing anything except medicine  you havent got to the bottom of it yet mrs ohalloran my head is just stored with knowledge only it isnt always that i have a chance of making it useful i would be just the fellow to be cast on a desert island there is no saying what i wouldnt do towards making myself comfortable there  but i do know about scurvy for i made a voyage in a whaler before i got his majestys commission to kill and slay in the army and i know how necessary vegetables are i only wish we had known what the spaniards were up to a month since we would have got a cargo of oranges and lemons they would have been worth their weight in silver  but they wouldnt have kept teddy  no not for long but we would have squeezed them and put sugar into the juice and bottled it off if the general had consulted me that is what he would have been after instead of seeing about salt meat and biscuits we shall get plenty of them from ships that run ini have no fear of thatbut it is the acids will be wanting  as soon as dinner was over captain ohalloran went downstairs and had no difficulty in arranging with the man below for the entire use of his garden an inspection was made of the hedge and the man agreed to close up all gaps that fowls could possibly creep through he was also quite willing to let off a room for storage and his wife undertook to superintend the management of the young broods and sitting hens having arranged this captain ohalloran went down into the town to make his purchases  a quarter of an hour later bob started with manola carrying a large basket and both were much amused at their errand going among the cottages scattered over the hill above the town they had no difficulty in obtaining chickens and fowlsthe former at about five pence apiece the latter at seven pencesuch prices being more than double the usual rates manolas basket was soon full and while she was taking her purchases back to the house bob hired two boys with baskets and before evening nearly a hundred fowls were running in the garden  the next day bob was considered sufficiently experienced to undertake the business alone and in two more days the entire number of two hundred had been made up three of the natives had been engaged in collecting baskets of earth among the rocks and in a week the terrace was converted into a garden ready for the seeds as yet vegetables although very dear had not risen to famine prices for although the town had depended chiefly upon the produce of the mainland many of the natives had grown small patches of vegetables in their gardens for their own use and these they now disposed of at prices that were highly satisfactory to themselves  ohallorans farmas they called it as soon as they heard from him what he was doingbecame quite a joke in the regiment but several of the other married officers who had similar facilities for keeping fowls adopted the idea to some extent and started with a score or so of fowls  i wonder you didnt think of pigs ohalloran one of the captains said laughing as they were talking over the farm in the mess anteroom pigs and potatoes the idea of you and burke both from the sod starting a farm and not thinking first of the two chief national products  there is not room for praties sinclair and as for pigs there are many reasons against it in the first place i doubt whether i could buy any in the second there isnt room for them in the third what should i give them to keep them alive in the fourth pigs are illigant bastes but in a hot country like this i should not care for a stye of them under my drawing room window in the fifth  that will do that will do ohalloran we give way we allow that you could not keep pigs but it is a pity  it is that sinclair there is nothing would please me better than to see a score of nice little pigs with a nate stye and a magazine of food big enough to keep them say for a year  three months ohalloran would be ample  well we shall see sinclair teddy burke says three years but i do hope it is not going to be as long as that  begorra another irish officer captain omoore exclaimed if it is three years we are going to be here we had best be killed and buried at once i have been all the morning in the queens battery where my company has been slaving like haythens with the sun coming down as if it would fry your brain in your skull pan and if that is to go on day after day for three years i should be dead in a month  that is nothing omoore if the siege goes on they say the officers will have to help at the work  i shall protest against it there is not a word in the articles of war about officers working i am willing enough to be shot by the spaniards but not to be killed by inches no sir there is not an omoore ever did a stroke of work since the flood and i am not going to demean myself by beginning  what are you laughing at young repton  i was only wondering captain omoore how your ancestors got through the flood unless indeed noah was an omoore  there is reason to believe that he was the captain said seriously it must have been that if he hadnt a boat of his own or found a mountain that the water didnt cover i have got the tree of the family at home and an old gentleman who was learned in these things came to the house when i was a boy and i remember right well that he said to my father after reckoning them up that the first of the house must have had a place there in ireland wellnigh a thousand years before adam  i dont think my father quite liked it but for the life of me i couldnt see why it was just what i should expect from the omoores didnt they give kings to ireland for generations and what should they want to be doing out among those rivers in the east when there was ireland ready to receive them  captain omoore spoke so seriously that bob did not venture to laugh but listened with an air of gravity equal to that of the officer  you will kill me altogether phelim captain ohalloran exclaimed amid a great shout of laughter in which all the others joined  the omoore looked round speechless with indignation  gentlemen he said i shall expect satisfaction for this insult the word of an omoore has never been doubted  captain ohalloran my friend will call upon you first  he may call as often as he likes omoore and i shall be happy to converse with any friend of yours but at present that is all the satisfaction you will get out of me duelling is strictly forbidden on the rock and there is no getting across the spanish lines to fightunless indeed you can persuade the governor to send out a flag of truce with us so we must let the matter rest till the siege is over and then if both of us are alive and you have the same mind we will talk about it  i think omoore dr burke who had entered the room two or three minutes before said persuasively you will see that you are the last man who ought to maintain that the first of your race lived here as far back as adam you see we are all direct descendants of adami mean all the rest of us  no doubt you are captain omoore said stiffly  and one has just as much right as another to claim that he is the heir in a direct line  i suppose so burke the officer said though for the life of me i cant see what you are driving at  what i mean is this suppose adam and the omoore started at the same time one in ireland and the other in eden and they had an equal number of children as was likely enough half the people in the world would be descendants of adam and the other half of the omoore and you see instead of your being the omoorethe genuine descendant in the direct line from the first of the familyhalf the world would have an equal claim to the title  captain omoore reflected for a minute or two  you are right dr burke he said i never saw it in that light it is clear enough that you are right and that the less we say about the omoores before the first irish king of that name the better there must have been some mistake about that tree i spoke of  captain ohalloran i apologize i was wrong  the two officers shook hands and peace was restored but captain omoore was evidently a good deal puzzled and mortified by the problem the doctor had set before him and after remaining silent for some time evidently in deep thought he left the room some of the others watched him from the window until he had entered the door of his own quarters and then there was a general shout of laughter  the omoore will be the death of me teddy burke exclaimed as he threw himself back in a chair exhausted he is one of the best fellows going but you can lead him on into anything i dont suppose he ever gave a thought to the omoores anywhere further back than those kings he had a vague idea that they must have been going on simply because it must have seemed to him that a world without an omoore in it would be necessarily imperfect it was bob reptons questions as to what they were doing at the time of the flood that brought him suddenly up then he didnt hesitate for a moment in taking them back to adam or before him just on the ancestry of the omoores phelim has got a tile a little loose but on all other points he is as sensible as anyone in the regiment  i wonder you didnt add and that is not saying much doctor one of the lieutenants said  i may have thought it youngster but you see i must have made exceptions in favour of myself and the colonel so i held my tongue the fact that we are all here under a sun hot enough to cook a beefsteak and that for the next two or three years we are going to have to work like niggers and to be shot at by the spaniards and to be pretty wellif not quitestarved speaks for itself as to the amount of sense we have got between us  there go the drums now gentlemen you have got the pleasure of a couple of hours drill before you and i am due at the hospital    chapter 9 the antelope   on the 3rd of july a hundred and eighty volunteers from the infantry joined the artillery who were not numerous enough to work all the guns of the batteries and two days later a spanish squadron of two menofwar five frigates and eleven smaller vessels hove in sight from the west and lay to off the entrance to the bay three privateers came in and one of the spanish schooners stood across to reconnoitre them and a shot was fired at her from the batteries on europa point  the enterprise frigate had gone across to tetuan to bring mr logie over again on her return she was chased by the enemys squadron but succeeded in giving them the slip in the dark as she neared the rock the captain fearing to be discovered by the enemy did not show the usual lights and several shots were fired at the ship but fortunately without effect  on the following day letters were received from england with the official news that hostilities had commenced between great britain and spain and the same evening a proclamation was published authorizing the capture of spanish vessels and letters of marque were given to the privateers in the bay permitting them to capture spanish as well as french vessels  among the privateers was the antelope which was one of those that had come in on the previous afternoon bob had not heard of her arrival when he ran against captain lockett in the town next morning they had not met since bob had landed six months before  well master repton the captain said after they had shaken hands i was coming up to see you after i had managed my business i have letters from mr bale for you and mrs ohalloran  you are all well on board i hope captain  joe is well he is first mate now poor probert is on his back in hospital at portsmouth we had a sharp brush with a french privateer but we beat her off we had five men killed and probert had his leg taken off by an eighteen pound shot we clapped on a tourniquet but he had a very narrow escape of bleeding to death fortunately it was off ushant and the wind being favourable we got into portsmouth on the following morning and the doctors think that they will pull him round  you have grown a good bit since i saw you last  not much i am afraid bob replied dolefully for his height was rather a sore point with him i get wider but i dont think i have grown half an inch since i came here  and how goes on the spanish  first rate i can get on in it almost as well as in english  so you are in for some more fighting  so they say bob replied but i dont think i am likely to have as close a shave of a spanish prison as i had of a french one coming out here  no we had a narrow squeak of it that time  was war declared when you came away  no the negotiations were broken off and everyone knew that war was certain and that the proclamation might be issued at any hour i have not had a very fast run and expected to have learned the news when i got here but you are sure to hear it in a day or two that was why i came here freights were short for with the ports of france and spain both closed there was little enough doing so the owners agreed to let me drop trading and make straight for gibraltar so as to be ready to put out as soon as we get the declaration of war  there ought to be some firstrate pickings along the coast it isnt here as it is with france where they have learned to be precious cautious and where one darent risk running in close to their coast on the chance of picking up a prize for the waters swarm with their privateers the spaniards are a very slow set and there is not much fear of their fitting out many privateers for months to come and the coasters will be a long time before they wake up to the fact that spain is at war with us and will go lumbering along from port to port without the least fear of being captured so it is a rare chance of making prize money  if you like a cruise i shall be very happy to take you with me i have seen you under fire you know and know that you are to be depended upon  i should like to go above all things bob said but i dont know what my sister would say i must get at her husband first if i can get him on my side i think i shall be able to manage it with her  well will you come up to dinner  no i shall be busy all day here are the letters i was speaking of  well we have supper at seven will you come then  with pleasure  will joe be able to come too  no it wouldnt do for us both to leave the brig the spanish fleet may be sending in their boats to try and cut some of our vessels out and i should not feel comfortable if we were both ashore but he will be very glad to see you on board we are anchored a cable length from the water port you are pretty sure to see one of our boats alongside  the steward came off with me to buy some soft tack and fresh meat i saw him just before i met you he told me he had got some bread but that meat was at a ruinous price i told him that he must get it whatever price it was and i expect by this time he has done so so if you look sharp you will get to the boat before it puts off with him  the steward was in the act of getting into the boat as bob ran down  glad to see you mister repton the man said touching his hat have you seen the captain sir  yes i have just left him he told me i should catch you here  thinking of having another cruise with us sir  i am thinking about it parker but i dont know whether i shall be able to manage it  they were soon alongside the antelope  i thought it was you mister repton when i saw you run down to the boat joe lockett said as he shook hands with bob  i am glad to see you again joe and i am glad to hear you are first mate now though of course i am sorry for mr probert  yes a bad job for him a very bad job but it wont be so bad in his case as in some he has been talking for the last two or three voyages of retiring an old uncle of his died and left him a few acres of land down in essex and he has saved a bit of money out of his pay and his share of the prizes we have made and he talked about giving up the sea and settling down on shore so now he will do it he said as much as that the night he was wounded  well he said there wont be any more trouble about making up my mind joe if i do get over this job i have got to lay up as a dismantled hulk for the rest of my life i have been talking of it to you but i doubt whether i should ever have brought myself to it if it had not been for them frenchmens shot  well will you come into the cabin and take something  no thank you joe  have they got the news about the declaration of war yet mister repton  no it hasnt arrived yet  i expect we shall get some good pickings along the coast directly it comes we have been trading regularly this last year and we all of us want the chance of earning a bit of prize money so i can tell you we were very glad when we heard that we were going to take to that again for a bit  yes the captain was telling me about it and he has asked me to go for a trip with you  well i hope that you will be able to come mister repton  i hope so joe but there is one thingif i do come you must call me bob i hate being called mister repton  well it would be different if you come with us like that the young mate said you see you were a passenger before but if you came like this you will be here as a friend like so it will come natural to call you bob  and how do you like the place  oh i like it well enough i have been working very hardat least pretty hardso i havent had time to feel it dull and of course i know all the officers in my brotherinlaws regiment but i shall be very glad indeed of a cruise especially as we are likely presently by all they say to be cut off heresome say for months some say for years  but still i expect there will be some lively work the mate said if the spaniards really mean to try and take this place  they will never take it bob said unless they are able to starve us out and they ought not to be able to do that ships ought to be able to run in from the east at any time for the spaniards dare not come across within range of the guns and if the wind was strong they could not get out from their side of the bay  that is true enough and i expect you will find fastsailing craftprivateers and such likewill dodge in and out but a merchantman wont like to venture over this side of the straits but will keep along the moorish coasts you see they cant keep along the spanish side without the risk of being picked up by the gunboats and galleys with the blockading fleet there are a dozen small craft lying over there now with the menofwar  still i dont say none of them will make their way in here because i daresay they will they well know they will get big prices for their goods if they can manage to run the blockade we are safe to pick up some of the native craft and bring them in and so will the other privateers i expect there will be a good many down here before long the worst of it is there wont be any sale for the craft we capture  except for firewood joe that is one of the things i have heard we are sure to run very short of if there is a long siege  well that will be something and of course any prizes we take laden with things likely to be useful and sell here we shall bring in but the rest we shall have to send over to the other side so as to be out of sight of their fleet and then take them straight back to england  you see we have shipped twice as many hands as we had on the voyage when you were with us we had only a traders crew then now we have a privateers  look there there is a craft making in from the south it is like enough she has got the despatches on board there are two or three of those small spanish craft getting under sail to cut her off but they wont do it they could not head her without getting under the fire of the guns of those batteries on the point  well i will go ashore now joe if you will let me have the boat the captain is going to have supper with us tonight i wanted you to come too but he said you could not both come on shore together i hope we shall see you tomorrow  on landing bob made his way to the barrack so as to intercept gerald when he came off duty  look here gerald he said when captain ohalloran came out of the orderly room i want you to back me up  oh you do then i am quite sure that you are up to some mischief or other bob or you wouldnt want me to help you with carrie  it is not mischief at all gerald the antelope came in last night and i saw captain lockett this morning and i have asked him to come to supper  well that is all right bob we have plenty of food at present  yes but that is not it gerald he has invited me to go for a cruise with him he is going to pick up some prizes along the spanish coast  oh that is it is it well you know very well carrie wont let you go  well why shouldnt i gerald you know that i have been working very well here and i am sure i have learnt as much spanish in six months as uncle expected me to learn in two yearsbesides lots of latin and other things from the doctor now i do think that i have earned a holiday a fellow at school always has a holiday i am sure i have worked as hard as i did at school i think it only fair that i should have a holiday besides you see i am past sixteen now and being out here i think i ought to have the chance of any fun there is especially as we may be shut up here for ever so long  well there may be something in that bob you certainly have stuck at it well and you have not got into a single scrape since you came out which is a deal more than i expected of you  besides you see gerald if i had not made up my mind to stick to uncles business i might have been on board the brilliant now with jim sankey and i think after my giving up that chance it would be only fair that i should be allowed to have a cruise now that there is such a splendid opportunity  well bob i will do my best to persuade carrie to let you go but as far as you are concerned you know she is commanding officer  bob laughed for he knew well enough that not only in that but in all other matters his sister generally had her own way  well i am very much obliged to you gerald i am sure i should enjoy it awfully  dont thank me too soon bob you have your sister to manage yet  oh we ought to be able to manage her between us bob said confidently look how you managed to have dr burke for me and you know how well that turned out  yes that was a triumph bob well we will do our best  why bob where have you been all the morning his sister said the professor came at ten oclock he said he had arranged with you that he should be an hour later than usual as he had another engagement early  i forgot all about him carrie he never came into my mind once since breakfast i met captain lockett down in the town as soon as i went out and i wanted him to come here to dinner i knew you would be glad to see him for you said you liked him very much but he said he should be too busy but he is coming up to supper at seven then i went on board the antelope and had a chat with his cousin joe who is first mate now  when dinner was finished bob said  dont you think carrie i am looking pale what with the heat and what with my sticking in and working so many hours a day i begin to feel that it is too much for me  his sister looked anxiously at him  well bob you are looking a little pale but so is everybody else and no wonder with this heat but i have not been noticing you particularly what do you feel bob  i think bob feels as if he wants a holiday captain ohalloran put in  well then we must tell the professor that we dont want him to come for a bit of course teddy burke has given up coming already  but if you have a holiday bob what will you do with yourself  i dont think i shall get any better here carrie i think i want change of air  nonsense bob you cant be as bad as all that and you never said anything about it before  if he is not well you must ask teddy burke to come up to see him gerald besides how can he have change of air the only place he could go to would be tetuan and it would be hotter there than it is here  i think carrie captain ohalloran said i can prescribe for him without calling teddy burke in i fancy the very thing that would get bob set up would be a sea voyage  a sea voyage his wife repeated do you mean that he should go back to england i dont see anything serious the matter with him surely there cannot be anything serious enough for that  no not so serious as that carrie just a cruise for a biton board the antelope for example  mrs ohalloran looked from one to the other and then catching a twinkle in bobs eye the truth flashed across her  you ought to be ashamed of yourself gerald she said laughing in spite of herself you have quite frightened me i see now captain locket has invited bob to go for a cruise with him and all this about his being ill is nonsense from beginning to end you dont mean to say that you have been encouraging bob in this ridiculous idea  i dont know about encouraging carrie but when he put it to me that he had been working very steadily for the last six months and that he had got into no scrapes and that he had really earned a holiday and that this would be a very jolly one i did not see any particular reason why he shouldnt have it  no particular reason why the antelope is a privateer and if she is going to cruise about that means that she is going to fight and he may get shot  so he may here carrie if a ball happens to come the right way  i think bob certainly deserves a reward for the way he has stuck to his lessons you know you never expected he would do as he has done and i am sure his uncle would be delighted if he heard how well he speaks spanish  as to his health the boy is well enough but there is no denying that this hot weather we are having takes it out of us all and that it would be a mighty good thing if every soul on the rock had the chance of a months cruise at sea to set him up  but seriously carrie i dont see any reason whatever why he should not go we didnt bring the boy out here to make a mollycoddle of him he has got to settle down some day in a musty old office and it seems to me that he ought to have his share in any fun and diversion that he has a chance of getting at now as to danger sure you are a soldiers wife and why shouldnt he have a share of it just the same as if he had gone into the navy you wouldnt have made any hullabaloo about it if he had done that  this is bobs good time let him enjoy it you are not going to keep a lad of his age tied to your apron strings he has just got the chance of having two or three years of fighting and adventure it will be something for him to talk about all his life and my opinion is that you had best let him go his own way there are hundreds and hundreds of lads his age knocking about the world and running all sorts of risks without having elder sisters worrying over them  very well gerald if you and bob have made up your minds about it it is no use my saying no i am sure i dont want to make a mollycoddle as you call it of him of course uncle will blame me if any harm comes of it  no he wont carrie your uncle wants the boy to be a gentleman and a man of the world if you had said that a year ago i would have agreed with you but we know him better now and i will be bound he will like him to see as much life as he can during this time he has sent him out into the world  i will write to your uncle myself and tell him it is my doing entirely and that i think it is a good thing bob should take every chance he gets and that i will answer for it that he wont be any the less ready when the time comes for buckling to at business  well if you really think that gerald i have nothing more to say you know i should like bob to enjoy himself as much as he can only i seem to have the responsibility of him  i dont see why you worry about that carrie if he had gone out to cadiz or oporto as your uncle intended you dont suppose the people there would have troubled themselves about him he would just have gone his own way you went your own way didnt you and it is mighty little you troubled yourself about what your uncle was likely to say when you took up with an irishman in a marching regiment and i dont see why you should trouble now  the old gentleman means well with the boy but after all he is not either his father or his mother you are his nearest relation and though you are a married woman you are not old enough yet to expect that a boy of bobs age is going to treat you as if you were his mother instead of his sister there is not one boy in fifty would have minded us as he has done  well bob there is nothing more for me to say after that carrie said half laughingthough there were tears in her eyes  no no carrie i wont go if you dont like bob said impetuously  yes you shall go bob gerald is quite right it is better you should begin to think for yourself and i am sure i should like you to see things and to enjoy yourself as much as you can i dont know why i should fidget about you for you showed you had much more good sense than i credited you with when you gave up your chance of going to sea and went into uncles office  i am sure i am the last person who ought to lecture you after choosing to run about all over the world and to take the risk of being starved here and she smiled at her husband  you do as you like bob she went on i wont worry about you in futureonly if you have to go back to england without a leg or an arm dont blame me and be sure you tell uncle that i made as good a fight against it as i could  and so it was settled  by the way bob exclaimed presently i have got a letter from uncle to you in my pocket and one for myself also captain lockett gave them to me this morning but i forgot all about them  well you are a boy his sister exclaimed  this is a nice sample gerald of bobs thoughtfulness  well give me the letter perhaps he writes saying you had better be sent home by the first chance that offers itself  bobs face fell he had indeed himself had some misgiving ever since the troubles began that his uncle might be writing to that effect  well look here carrie he said here is the letter but i think you had better not open it till i have started on this cruise of course if he says i must go back i must but i may as well have this trip first  carrie laughed  what do you think gerald shall i leave it till bob has gone  no open it at once carrie if he does say send bob on by the first vessel there is not likely to be one before he goes in the antelope besides that is all the more reason why he should go for a cruise before he starts back for that grimy old place in philpot lane we may as well see what the old gentleman says  i wont open mine till you have read yours carrie bob said i mean to go the cruise anyhow but if he says i must go after that i will go if he had been the old bear i used to think him i would not mind it a snap but he has been so kind that i shall certainly do what he wants  bob sat with his hands deep in his pockets watching his sisters face with the deepest anxiety as she glanced through the letter gerald standing by and looking over her shoulder  illustration the old gentleman is a brick exclaimed gerald  the old gentleman is a brick gerald who was the first to arrive at the end exclaimed i wish i had had such a sensible old relative myself butbarring an aunt who kept three parrots and a cat and who put more store on the smallest of them than she did on menever a relative did i have in the world  oh tell me that afterwards bob broke in  do tell me what uncle says carrie  his sister turned to the beginning again and read aloud  my dear niece  where does he write from bob interrupted is it from philpot lane or from somewhere else  he writes from matlock derbyshire  that is all right bob said i thought by what gerald said he could not have written from philpot lane  my dear niece carrie began again i duly received your letter saying that bob had arrived out safely and also his more lengthy epistle giving an account of the incidents of the voyage i should be glad if you would impress upon him the necessity of being more particular in his punctuation as also in the crossing of his ts and the dotting of his is i have also received your letter bearing date june 1st and note with great satisfaction your statement that he has been most assiduous in his studies and that he is already able to converse with some fluency in spanish  since that time the state of affairs between the two countries has much occupied my attentionboth from its commercial aspect which is serious and in connection with bob as the issue of a declaration of war is hourly expected as i write the period of uncertainty may be considered as over and the two countries may be looked upon as at war i have reason to congratulate myself upon having followed the advice of my correspondent and of having laid in a very large supply of spanish wine from which i shall under the circumstances reap considerable profits i have naturally been debating with myself whether to send for bob to return to england or to proceed to lisbon and thence to oporto to the care of my correspondent there i have consulted in this matter my junior partner mr medlin who is staying with me here for a few days and i am glad to say that his opinion coincides with that at which i had finally arrivednamely to allow him to remain with you  his conduct when with me and the perseverance with whichas you reporthe is pursuing his studies has shown me that he will not be found wanting in business qualities when he enters the firm i am therefore all the more willing that he should use the intervening time in qualifying himself generally for a good position in the city of london especially for that of the head of a firm in the wine trade in which an acquaintance with the world and the manners of a gentleman if not of a man of fashiona matter in which my firm has been very deficient heretoforeare specially valuable it is probable from what i hear that gibraltar will be besieged and the event is likely to be a memorable one it will be of advantage to him and give him a certain standing to have been present on such an occasion  and if he evinces any desire to place any services he is able to render either as a volunteer or otherwise at the disposal of the military authoritiesand i learn from mr medlin that it is by no means unusual for the civil inhabitants of a besieged town to be called upon to aid in its defencei should recommend that you should place no obstacle in his way as a lad of spirit he would naturally be glad of any opportunity to distinguish himself i gathered from him that one of his schoolfellows was serving as a midshipman in a ship of war that would not improbably be stationed at gibraltar and bob would naturally dislike remaining inactive when his schoolfellow and many other lads of the same age were playing mens parts in an historical event of such importance therefore you will fully understand that you have my sanction beforehand to agree with any desire he should express in this direction if it seems reasonable and proper to you and captain ohalloran  as it is probable that the prices of food and other articles will be extremely high during the siege i have written by this mail to messieurs james and william johnston merchants of gibraltarwith whom i have had several transactionsauthorizing them to honour drafts duly drawn by captain ohalloran upon me to the extent of 500 pounds such sum being of course additional to the allowance agreed upon between us for the maintenance and education of your brother  i remain my dear niece your affectionate uncle john bale  now i call that being a jewel of an uncle captain ohalloran said while bob was loud in his exclamations of pleasure  now you see what you brought on yourself bob by your forgetfulness here we have had all the trouble in life to get carrie to agree to your going while had she read this letter first she would not have had a leg to stand uponat least metaphorically speaking practically no one would doubt it for a minute  practically you are a goose gerald metaphorically uncle is an angel but i am very very glad that has relieved me from the responsibility altogether and you know at heart i am just as willing that bob should enjoy himself as you are  now what does your uncle say to you bob  bob opened and read his uncles letter and then handed it to his sister  it is just the same sort of thing carrie i can see mr medlins hand in it everywhere he says that for the time i must regard my connection with the firm as of secondary importance and take any opportunity that offers to show the spirit of an english gentleman by doing all in my power to uphold the dignity of the british flag and taking any becoming part that may offer in the defence of the town of course he says he has heard with pleasure of my progress in spanish and that he and his junior partner look forward with satisfaction to the time when i shall enter the firm  my dear carrie captain ohalloran said i will get a bottle of champagne from the mess and this evening at supper we will drink your excellent uncles health with all the honours i will ask teddy burke to come up and join us  then i think gerald his wife said smiling that as captain lockett will be here too one bottle of champagne will not go very far  i put it tentatively my dear we will say two bottles and we will make the first inroad on our poultry yard we had twenty eggs this morning and the woman downstairs reports that two of the hens want to sit though how they explained the matter to her is more than i know anyhow we can afford a couple of chickens  it was a very jovial supper especially as it was known that the news of the proclamation of war had been brought in by the ship that had arrived that morning  by the way mrs ohalloran captain lockett said i have a consignment for you i will land it the first thing in the morning for i shall sail in the evening we are to get our letters of marque authorizing the capture of spanish vessels at ten oclock in the morning  what is the consignment captain  it is from mr bale madam i saw him in town a week before i sailed and told him i was likely to come on here direct and he sent off at once three cases of champagne and six dozen of port directed to you and an eighteen gallon cask of irish whisky for captain ohalloran  my dear captain ohalloran said solemnly i believe that you expressed today the opinion that your uncle was metaphorically an angel i beg that the word metaphorically be omitted if there was ever an angel in a pigtail and a stiff cravat that angel is mr john bale of philpot lane  it is very good of him carrie agreed we could have done very well without the whisky but the port wine and the champagne may be very useful if this siege is going to be the terrible thing you all seem to fancy  a drop of the craytur is not to be despised mrs ohalloran dr burke said taken with plenty of water it is a fine digestive and when we run short of wine and beer you will not be despising it yourself  i did not know teddy burke that you had any experience whatever of whisky mixed with plenty of water  you are too hard on me altogether the doctor laughed there is no soberer man in the regiment than your humble servant  well it will do you all good if you get on short allowance of wine for a time i cant think why men want to sit after dinner and drink bottle after bottle of port wine it is all very well to say that everyone does it but that is a very poor excuse why should they do it women dont do it and i dont see why men should i hope the time will come when it is considered just as disgraceful for a man to drink as it is for a woman  and now captain lockett about bob what time must he be on board  he must be on board before gunfire mrs ohalloran unless you get a special order from the town major i was obliged to get one myself for this evening the orders are strict now all the gates are closed at gunfire  yes and mighty strict they are captain ohalloran said there was major corcoran of the 72nd and the doctor of the regiment were out fishing yesterday and the wind fell and the gun went just as they were landing and divil a bit could they get in the major is a peppery little man and i would have given anything to have seen him one of the hanoverian regiments furnished the guard at the water batteries and the sentry told him if he came a foot nearer in the boat they would fire and in the end he and the doctor had to cover themselves up with a sail and lie there all night i hear the major went to lodge a complaint when he landed but of course the men were only doing their duty and i hear eliott gave him a wigging for endeavouring to make them disobey orders  i will be on board before gunfire captain lockett there is no fear of my missing it  how long do you expect to be away captain lockett mrs ohalloran asked  that depends on how we get on if we are lucky and pick up a number of prizes we may bring them in in a week if not we may be three weeks especially if this calm weather lasts  i am sure i hope you wont be too lucky at first captain bob put in i dont want the cruise to finish in a week  oh i shant consider the cruise is finished merely because we come in bob the captain said we shall be going out again and only put in here to bring in our prizes the cruise will last as long as captain ohalloran and your sister will allow you to remain on board  i expect that i shall be able to make you very useful i shall put you down in the ships books as third mate you wont be able to draw prize money as an officer because the number of officers entitled to prize money was entered when the crew signed articles but if i put you down as supercargo you will share with the men in any prizes we take while you are away with us  that will be jolly captain not because of the money you know but because it will give one more interest in the cruise besides i shall like something to do  oh i will give you something to do i shall put you in joes watch and then you will learn something it is always as well to pick up knowledge when you get a chance and if we do take any prizes it will be your duty as supercargo to take an inventory of what they have on board  the next morning bob packed his trunks the first thing then he went round to the professors and told him that he was going away for a fortnight or so for a cruise then he went down to the port and met joe lockett when he landed and brought him up to breakfast as had been arranged with the captain the night before after that he went with him up the rock to look at the spaniardswhose tents were a good deal more numerous than they had been and who were still at work arming the forts  if i were the general joe said i would go out at night with two or three regiments and spike all those guns and blow up the forts the dons wouldnt be expecting it and it would be a good beginning and would put the men in high spirits  do you see the spanish fleet has drifted away almost out of sight to the east i thought what it would be at sunset yesterday when i saw that they did not enter the bay for the current would be sure to drive them away if the wind didnt spring up  well i hope we shall get a little this evening and now i must be going down for there is a good deal to do before we sail    chapter 10 a cruise in a privateer   bob was on board the antelope a quarter of an hour before gunfire no movement was made until after sunset for some of the gunboats over at algeciras might have put out had they seen any preparations for making sail but as soon as it became dark the anchor was hove the sails dropped and sheeted home and the brig began to move slowly through the water as she breasted europa point her course was altered to east by north and the rock faded from sight in the darkness  the first mate was on watch and bob walked up and down the deck with him  there is no occasion for you to keep up joe lockett said you may just as well turn  oh no i mean to keep the watch with you bob said the captain said that i was to be in your watch and i want you to treat me just the same way as if i were a midshipman under you  well if you were a midshipman there wouldnt be anything for you to do now still if you like to keep up of course you can do so i shall be glad of your company and you will help keep a sharp lookout for ships  there is no chance of our coming across any spanish traders tonight i suppose joe  not in the least they would keep a deal farther out than we shall if they were bound either for algeciras or through the straits we are not likely to meet anything till we get near malaga after that of course we shall be in the line of coasters there are almeria and cartagena and alicante and a score of small ports between alicante and valencia  we dont seem to be going through the water very fast joe  no not more than two or two and a half knots an hour however we are in no hurry with a light wind like this we dont want to get too close to the shore or we might have some of their gunboats coming out after us i expect that in the morning if the wind holds light the captain will take in our upper sails and just drift along then after it gets dark he will clap on everything and run in so as to strike the coast a few miles above malaga then we will take in sail and anchor as close in as we dare anything coming along then will take us for a craft that has come out from malaga  at midnight the second mate whose name was crofts came up to relieve watch and bob who was beginning to feel very sleepy was by no means sorry to turn in it hardly seemed to him that he had closed an eye when he was aroused by a knocking at the cabin door  its two bells sir and mr lockett says you are to turn out  bob hurried on his things and went up knowing that he was an hour late  i thought you wanted to keep watch bob you ought to have been on deck at eight bells  so i should have been if i had been woke bob said indignantly i am not accustomed to wake up just after i go to sleep it doesnt seem to me that i have been in bed five minutes if you wake me tomorrow morning you will see i will be up sharp enough  there is hardly any wind  no we have been only crawling along all night there is gib you see behind us  why it doesnt look ten miles off bob said in surprise  it is twice that it is two or three and twenty i should say  now the best thing you can do is to go down to the waist slip off your togs and have a few buckets of water poured over you that will wake you up and you will feel ever so much more comfortable afterwards i have just told the steward to make us a couple of cups of coffee they will be ready by the time you have had your wash  bob followed the advice and after a bath a cup of coffee and a biscuit he no longer felt the effects from the shortness of the night the sun had already risen and there was not a cloud upon the sky  what are those over there he asked pointing to the southeast they look like sails  they are sails they are the upper sails of the spanish fleet i expect they are trying to work back into the bay again but they wont do it unless they get more wind you see i have taken the topgallant sails off the brig so as not to be seen  there is the spanish coast you see twelve or fourteen miles away to port if you like you can take the glass and go up into the maintop and see if you can make anything out on shore  bob came down in half an hour  there are some fishing boats he said at least they look like fishing boats close inshore just abreast of us  yes there are two or three little rivers on this side of malaga there is not water in them for craft of any size but the fishing boats use them there is a heavy swell sets in here when the wind is from the east with a bit south in it and they run up there for shelter  captain lockett now came up on deck  good morning bob i did not see you here when watch was changed  no sir i wasnt woke but i mean to be up another morning  that is right bob joe and i agreed to give you an extra hour this morning four hours are very short measure to one who is not accustomed to it but you will soon find that you can turn in and get a sleep when your watch is over whatever the time of day  it seems to me that this watch has the worst of it captain lockett we had from eight to twelve and now from four to eight and the other had only four hours on deck  yours is considered the best watch bob the middle watch as the one that comes on at twelve oclock is called is always the most disliked you see at eight bells you go off and have your breakfast comfortably and can then turn in till twelve oclock and you can get another caulk from five or six till eight in the evening of course if there is anything to do bad weather or anything of that sort both watches are on deck all day  well i am almost sure i should like the other watch best bob said  you are wrong lad especially in summer you see it is not fairly dark till nine and you wouldnt turn in till ten anyhow so that really you are only kept two hours out of your bunk at that watch it is getting light when you come up at four and at five we begin to wash decks and there is plenty to occupy you so that it doesnt seem long till eight bells the others have to turn out at twelve oclock just when they are most sleepy and to be on watch for the four dark hours and then go down just as it is getting light  on a cold night in winter in the channel i think perhaps the advantage is the other way but in fact men get so accustomed to the four hours in and the four hours out that it makes very little difference to them how it goes  all day the brig kept on the same course moving very slowly through the water and passing the coast as much by aid of the current as by that of her sails  we are pretty well off malaga captain lockett said in the afternoon if there had been any wind we should have had a chance of picking up something making from there to the straits but there is no chance of that today people like making quick voyages when there is a risk of falling in with an enemy and they wont be putting out from port until there is some change in the weather however it looks to me as if there is a chance of a little breeze from the south when the sun goes down i have seen a flaw or two on the water that way  yes it seems to me darker over there the mate said i will go up and have a look round  yes sir there is certainly a breeze stirring down to the south he shouted from aloft  that will just suit us the captain said we must be twenty miles off the coast at least and even if they had noticed us from above the town we are too far off for them to make us out at all so it will be safe for us to run in to the land  we shall rely upon you bob if we are hailed  i will do my best to throw dust in their eyes captain you must tell me beforehand all particulars so that i can have the story pat  we will wait till we see what sort of craft is likely to hail us a tale may be good enough for the skipper of a coaster that might not pass muster with the captain of a gunboat  what are the coasters likely to be laden with  there is never any saying mostly fruit and wine grain and olives then some of them would be taking goods from the large ports to the small towns and villages along the coast some of the coasters are well worth picking up but of course the craft we shall be chiefly on the lookout for will be those from abroad some of these have very valuable cargoes they bring copper and lead and sometimes silver from the mines of mexico and south america some of them carry a good lot of silver but it is too much to hope that we should run across such a prize as that they bring over hides too they are worth money then of course there are ships that have been trading up the mediterranean with france and italy or the levant  so you see there is a considerable variety in the chances of what we may light upon coasters are of course the staple so to speak if we have anything like luck we shall not do badly with them the others we must look upon as the prizes in the lottery  before the sun set the breeze came up to them and the brig was at once headed for the land at ten oclock the lights of malaga were made out on the port beam and the brig bore away a little to the east two hours later the land was looming not far ahead  sail was got off her and a man placed in the chains and soundings taken this was continued until the water shoaled to eight fathoms when the brig was brought up head to wind and the anchor let go then an anchor watch of four men was set and the rest of the crew allowed to turn in  at daybreak the officers were out again and it was found that the brig was lying within a quarter of a mile of the land in a slight indentation of the coast the wind had died away and the sails were loosed and suffered to fall against the masts  it could not be better captain lockett said we look now as if we had been trying to make up or down the coast and had been forced to come to anchor here fortunately there dont seem to be any villages near so we are not likely to have anyone coming out to us  how far do you think we are from malaga captain  about ten miles i should say bob why do you ask  i was only thinking whether it would be possible for me to make my way there and find out what vessels there are in harbour and whether any of them are likely to be coming this way but if it is ten miles i am afraid it is too far i should have to pass through villages and i might be questioned where i came from and where i was going i dont know that my spanish would pass muster if i were questioned like that  i should be all right if i were once in a seaport no one would be likely to ask me any questions then i could stroll about and listen to what was said and certainly i could talk quite well enough to go in and get a meal and all that sort of thing  i couldnt let you do that bob the captain said it is a very plucky idea but it wouldnt be right to let you carry it out you would get hung as a spy if you were detected  i dont think there is the least fear in the world of my being detected in a seaport bob said and i should think it great fun but i shouldnt like to try to cross the country perhaps we may have a better chance later on  the captain shook his head  you might go on board some ship if one brings up at anchor anywhere near us bob if you got detected there we would take her and rescue you but that is a different thing to letting you go ashore  presently the sails of two fishing boats were seen coming out from beyond a low point three miles to the east  i suppose there is a fishing village there the mate said i am glad they are no nearer  he examined the boats with a glass  they are working out with sweeps i expect they hope to get a little wind when they are in the offing  just as they were at breakfast the second mate who was on deck called down the skylight  there are three craft to the west sir they have just come out from behind the point there they are bringing a little breeze with them  what are they like mr crofts  one is a polacre another a xebec and the third looks like a fullrigged craft but as she is end on i cant say for certain  all right mr crofts i will be up in five minutes we can do nothing until we get the wind anyhow  breakfast was speedily finished and they went on deck the spanish flag was already flying from the peak the three craft were about two miles away  how are they sailing mr crofts  i fancy the xebec is the fastest sir she was astern just now and she is abreast of the polacre now as near as i can make out the ship or brigwhichever it isseems to me to be dropping astern  heave away at the anchor joe get in all the slack so as to be ready to hoist as soon as the breeze reaches us i dont want them to come up to us the line they are taking now will carry them nearly half a mile outside us which is fortunate run in six of the guns and throw a tarpaulin over the eighteen pounder three guns on each side are about enough for us to show  the breeze caught them when the three spanish craft were nearly abeam  they have more wind out there than we shall have here the captain said which is an advantage for i dont want to run away from them  now get up the anchor joe dont take too many hands  the watch below had already been ordered to sit down on the deck and half the other watch were now told to do the same  twelve or fourteen hands are quite enough to show the captain said  the anchors up sir joe shouted  let it hang there we will get it aboard presently  now haul that forestaysail across ease off the spanker sheet  now as she comes round haul on the braces and sheets one by one do it in as lubberly a way as you can  the brig which had been riding with her head to the west came slowly round the yards being squared in a slow fashion in strong contrast to the active way in which they were generally handled the captain watched the other craft carefully  the xebec and polacre are gaining on us but we are going as fast through the water as the three master when we get the wind a little more we shall have the heels of them all  get a sail overboard joe and tow it under her port quarter dont give her too much rope or they might catch sight of it on board the ship that will bring us down to her rate of sailing  i want to keep a bit astern of them we dare not attack them in the daylight they mount too many guns for us altogether that big fellow has got twelve on a side the polacre has eight and the xebec six so between them they have fiftytwo guns we might try it if they were well out at sea but it would never do here there may be galleys or gunboats within hearing so we must bide our time  i think we are in luck this time joe that ship must have come foreign at least i should say so by her appearance though she may be from cadiz as to the other two they may be anything the xebec no doubt is a coast trader the polacre may be one thing or another but i should hardly think she has come across the atlantic likely enough she is from bilbao or santander the ship is the fellow to get hold of if we get a chance i shall be quite content to leave the others alone  i should think so joe agreed the ship ought to be a valuable prize wherever she comes from if she is sound and pretty new she would fetch a good sum if we can get her into an english port  the wind continued to hold light and the four vessels made but slow progress through the water the two leaders however gradually improved their position they were nearly matched in point of sailing and their captains were evidently making a race of it hoisting every stitch of canvas they were able to show by the afternoon they were fully two miles ahead of the ship which was half a mile on the starboard bow of the brig  the wind died away to nothing as the sun set the three spanish vessels had all been edging in towards shore and the polacre anchored just before sunset the ship held on for another hour but was a mile astern of the other two when she also dropped her anchor  the sail that had been towing overboard from the brig had been got on board again when the wind began to drop and she had come up to within little more than a quarter of a mile of the ship the anchor was let go as soon as it was seen that the crew of the ship were preparing to anchor so that the brig should be first to do so whether there had been any suspicions on board the spaniards as to the character of the brig they could not tell but watching her closely captain lockett saw that the order to anchor was countermanded as soon as it was seen that the brig had done so  a few minutes after the men again went forward and the anchor was dropped for the vessel was making no way whatever through the water  well joe there we are close to her now the question is what are we to do next if there was any wind it would be simple enough we would drop alongside in the middle watch and carry her by boarding before the dons had time to get out of their hammocks but as it is that is out of the question and of course we cant think of towing her up on such a still night as this will be they would hear the slightest noise  we might attack her in the boats the mate said  yes that would be possible but their watch would hear the oars the instant we began to row you see by the number of guns she carries she must be strongly manned  i expect most of them are small joe said and meant for show rather than use it is likely enough she may have taken half of them on board at cadiz or malaga so as to give her a formidable appearance in case she should fall in with any craft of our description if she has come across the atlantic she would never have carried anything like that number of guns for spain was not at war with anyone  no but craft flying the black flag are still to be found in those waters joe and she might carry her guns for defence against them but it is not a question of guns at present it is a question of the crew it isnt likely that she carries many more than we do and if we could but get alongside her there would be no fear about it at all but i own i dont like the risk of losing half my men in an attack on a craft like that unless we can have the advantage of a surprise  what do you say to my swimming off to her as soon as it gets quite dark captain bob said i am a very good swimmer we used to bathe regularly at putney where i was at school and i have swum across the thames and back lots of times there is sure to be a little mist on the water presently and they wont be keeping a very sharp lookout till it gets later i can get hold of a cable and climb up and get in over the bow if there is no lookout there and see what is going on there is no danger in the thing for if i am discovered i have only got to dive and swim back again there is no current to speak of here and there wouldnt be the least chance of their hitting me in the dark i should certainly be able to learn something by listening to their talk  it would be a very risky thing bob captain lockett said shaking his head i shouldnt like to let you do it though of course it would be a great thing if we could learn something about her i own i dont like her appearance though i cant say why somehow or other i dont think she is all right either all those guns are a mere pretence and she is weak handed or she must carry a very big crew  well i dont see there can be any possible harm in my trying to get on board her captain of course if i am hailed as i approach her i shall turn and come back again the night will be dark but i shall have no difficulty in finding her from the talking and noise on board  well joe what do you think the captain said doubtfully  i think you might let bob try joe said i should not mind trying at all but as i cant speak spanish i should be able to learn nothing they are not likely to be setting a watch and keeping a sharp lookout for some time and i should think that he might possibly get on board unobserved if they do make him out he has only to keep on diving and in the dark there would be little chance of their hitting him besides they certainly couldnt make out that it was a swimmer if they noticed a ripple in the water they would be sure to think it was a fish of some sort  bob continued to urge that he should be allowed to try it and at last captain lockett agreed to his doing so it was already almost dark enough for the attempt to be made and bob prepared at once for the swim he took off his coat waistcoat and shirt and put on a dark knitted jersey fastened a belt tightly round his waist over his breeches and took off his shoes  if i am seen he said you are sure to hear them hailing or shouting and then please show a lantern over the stern for slight as the current was it sufficed to make the vessel swing head to west  a rope was lowered over the side and by this he slipped down quietly into the water which was perfectly warm then he struck off noiselessly in the direction of the ship he kept the two masts of the brig in one as long as he could make them out but owing to the mist on the water he soon lost sight of her but he had no difficulty in keeping a straight course as he could plainly hear the sound of voices ahead of him taking the greatest pains to avoid making the slightest splash and often pausing to listen bob swam on until he saw a dark mass looming up in front of him  illustration bob swims off to the spanish warship  he now did little more than float giving a gentle stroke occasionally and drifting towards it until he grasped the cable  he now listened intently there were voices on the focastle above him and he determined before trying to climb up there to swim round the vesselkeeping close to her side so that he could not be seen unless someone leaned far over the bulwark halfway along he came upon a projection and looking up saw that slabs of wood three inches wide were fixed against the side at intervals of a foot apart so as to form an accommodation ladder when it was not considered necessary to lower a gangway two hand ropes hung by the side of it  his way was now easy he drew himself out of the water by the ropes and ascended the ladder then crawled along outside the bulwark until he came to a porthole from which a gun projected then he crawled in there and lay under the cannon  two or three lanterns were suspended above the deck and by their light bob could at once see that he was on board a ship of war groups of sailors were sitting on the deck among the guns and he saw that most of these were run in and that they were of heavy calibre several of them being 32pounders  as the captain and joe had both agreed that the guns were only 14pounders bob had no difficulty in arriving at the fact that these must have been mere dummies thrust out of the portholes to deceive any stranger as to her armament he lay listening for some time to the talk of the sailors and gathered that the ship had been purposely disguised before putting out from malaga in order to deceive any english privateers she might come across as to her strength he learned also that considerable doubts were entertained as to the brig and that the xebec and polacre had been signalled to go on ahead so as to induce the brigif she should be an enemyto make an attack  the reason why she had not been overhauled during the day was that the captain feared she might escape him in a light wind for the watch had been vigilant and had made out that she was towing something to deaden her way it was considered likely that taking the ship for a merchantman an attack would be made in boats during the night and the men joked as to the surprise their assailants would get boarding pikes were piled in readiness shot had been placed in the racks ready to throw down into the boats as they came alongside and the ships boats had been swung out in readiness for loweringas it was intended to carry the brig by boarding after the repulse and destruction of her boats  we have had a narrow escape of catching a tartar bob said to himself it is very lucky i came on board to reconnoitre the spaniards are not such duffers as we thought them we fancied we were taking them in and very nearly fell into a trap ourselves  very quietly he crawled back under the porthole made his way along outside the bulwark until his hand touched the rope and then slid down by it into the water as he knew there was more chance of a sharp watch being kept in the eyes of the ship than elsewhere he swam straight out from her side until she became indistinct and then headed for the brig the lights on board the spaniard served as a guide to him for some time but the distance seemed longer to him than it had before and he was beginning to fancy he must have missed the brig when he saw her looming up on his right in three or four minutes he was alongside  the brig there he hailed drop me a rope overboard  there was a stir overhead at once  where are you bob captain lockett asked leaning over the side  just below you sir  a rope was dropped bob grasped it and was hauled up  thank god you are back again the captain said i have been blaming myself ever since you started though as all was quiet we felt pretty sure they hadnt made you out well have you any news did you get on board  you will get no prize money this time captain the spaniard is a ship of war mounting twentyfour guns none of them smaller than eighteens and ten of them thirtytwos  impossible bob we could not have been so mistaken joe and i were both certain that they were fourteens  yes sir but those things you saw were dummies the guns themselves are almost all drawn in all the thirtytwos are and most of the eighteens she has been specially disguised at malaga in hopes of tempting a craft like yours to attack her and what is more she has a shrewd suspicion of what you are and he related the whole of the conversation he had heard and described the preparations for repulsing a boat attack and in turn carrying the brig in the ships boats  captain lockett was thunderstruck  the spanish officer who commands her must be a smart fellow he said and we have had a narrow escape of running our head into a noosethanks to you bob for joe and i had quite made up our minds to attack her in the middle watch  well the only thing for us to do is to get away from here as soon as we can if she finds we dont attack her tonight she is sure to send a boat to us in the morning and then if we have an engagement we could hardly hope to get off without losing some of our sparseven if we were not sunkwith such heavy metal as she carries we should have the other two craft down on us too and our chances of getting away would be worth nothing  well i suppose joe our best plan will be to tow her away  i should think so sir when they hear us at it they may send their boats out after us but we can beat them off and i should hardly think that they would try it for they will be sure that if we are a privateer we have been playing the same game as they have and hiding our guns and will guess that we carry a strong crew  send the crew aft joe i will tell them how matters stand  we have had a narrow escape of catching a tartar my lads he said when the men went aft you all know mr repton swam off an hour ago to try and find out what the ship was like well he has been on board and brings back news that she is no trader but a ship of war disguised and that she carries twentyfour gunseighteenpounders and thirtytwos if we met while out at sea we might make a fight of it but it would never do here especially as her two consorts would be down upon us she suspects what we are although she is not certain and everything is in readiness to repel a boat attackher captains intention being if we tried to sink or cripple the boats and then to attack us with her guns  so you may thank mr repton that you have had a narrow escape of seeing the inside of a spanish prison  now what i propose to do is to tow her out get the four boats in the water as quietly as you can we have greased the falls already we will tow her straight ahead at any rate for a bit that craft wont be able to bring any guns to bear upon us except perhaps a couple of bow chasers and as she wont be able to see us there is not much chance of our being hit pass the hawser along from boat to boat and row in a line ahead of her the hull will shelter you then lay out heartily but be ready if you are hailed to throw off the hawser and get back on board again as soon as you can for they may send their boats out after us we shall get a start anyhow for when they hear you rowing they will think you are putting off to attack them and it will be some minutes before they will find out their mistake  joe do you go in charge of the boats i will take the helm you must cut the cable they would hear the clank of the windlass  the operation of lowering boats was conducted very silently bob had taken his place at the taffrail and stood listening for any sound that would show that the spaniards had heard what was doing the oars were scarcely dipped in the water when he heard a sudden lull in the distant talking a minute later it broke out again  they have orders to pay no attention to the noises captain lockett said so as to lead us to think that we shall take them unawares  there she is moving now he added as he looked down into the water  four or five minutes elapsed and then in the stillness of the evening they could hear a loud hail in spanish  what ship is that cease rowing or we will sink you  dont answer captain lockett said they have nothing but the confused sound of the oars to tell them where we are  the hail was repeated and a minute later there was the flash of a gun in the darkness and a shot hummed through the air  fire away the captain muttered you are only wasting ammunition  for some minutes the spaniard continued to fire her two bow guns then after a pause there was a crash and twelve guns were discharged together  we are getting farther off every minute the captain said and unless an unlucky shot should strike one of her spars we are safe  the broadside was repeated four times and then all was silent  we are a mile away from them now bob and though i daresay they can hear the sound of the oars it must be mere guesswork as to our position  he went forward to the bows and hailed the boats  take it easy now mr lockett i dont think she will fire any more when the men have got their wind row on again i shall head her out now we must give her a good three miles offing before we stop  the men in the four boats had been exerting themselves to their utmost and it was five minutes before they began rowing again for an hour and a half they continued their work and then captain lockett said to the second mate  you can go forward and hail them to come on board i think we have been moving through the water about two knots an hour so we must be three miles seaward of him  as soon as the men came on board a tot of grog was served out all round then the watch below turned in  you wont anchor i suppose captain  no there is a considerable depth of water here and a rocky bottom i dont want to lose another anchor and it would take us something like half an hour to get it up again besides what current there is will drift us eastward  there is more of it here than we had inshore i should say there must be nearly a knot an hour which will take us a good distance away from those gentlemen before morning  now bob you had better have a glass of grog and then turn in joe will excuse you keeping watch tonight  oh i feel all right bob said the water was quite warm and i slipped down and changed my clothes directly they left off firing  never mind you turn in as you are told you have done us good service tonight and have earned your keep on board the brig if you were to stop here till she fell to pieces of old age  when bob went up in the morning at five oclock the three spanish vessels were still lying at anchor under the land seven or eight miles away  there is a breeze coming joe said and it is from the south so we shall get it long before they do we shall see no more of them  as soon as the breeze reached them the sails were braced aft and the brig kept as close to the wind as she would sail lying almost directly off from the land  i want them to think that we are frightened captain lockett said in answer to a question from bob as to the course and that we have decided to get away from their neighbourhood altogether i expect they are only going as far as alicante we will run on till we are well out of sight then hold on for the rest of the day east and in the night head for land again beyond alicante it would never do to risk those fellows coming upon us again when we are quietly at anchor we might not be so lucky next time  an hour later the lookout in the top hailed the deck and said that there was a sail in sight  what does she look like halkett joe lockett shouted for the captain was below  as far as i can make out she is a two masteri should say a brig  how is she heading  about northeast sir i should say if we both hold on our courses she will pass ahead of us  the captain was now on deck and he and the first mate went up to the top  starboard your helm a bit the captain shouted after examining the distant sail through his telescope keep her about east  what do you think she is captain bob asked when the two officers came down again to the poop  i should say that she was a craft about our own size bob and i fancy she has come through the straits keeping well over the other side so as to avoid our cruisers from gib and is now heading for alicante now we are on our course again parallel to the coast there is no reason why she should suspect us of being anything but a trader if she doesnt take the alarm i hope we shall be alongside her in a few hours    chapter 11 cutting out a prize   the distant sail was anxiously watched from the antelope it closed in with them fast running almost before the wind in two hours her hull could be seen from the deck  efforts had been made by slacking the ropes and altering the set of the sails to give the brig as slovenly an appearance as possible the guns had been run in and the portholes closed and as the spaniard approached the crewwith the exception of five or six menwere ordered to keep below the bulwarks  the course that the spaniard was taking would have brought her just under the stern of the antelope when suddenly she was seen to change her course and to bear up into the wind  too late my lady the captain said you have blundered on too long  there is something in our cut that she doesnt like haul down that spanish flag and run the union jack up  open ports lads and show them our teeth fire that bow gun across her forefoot  the guns were already loaded and as soon as they were run out a shot was fired as a message to the spaniard to heave to a minute later as she paid no attention a broadside followed three of the shots went crashing into the side of the spaniard and one of her boats was smashed  a moment later the spanish flag fluttered down and a hearty cheer broke from the crew of the antelope the spaniard was thrown up into the wind and in a few minutes the brig ranged up alongside within pistol shot the gig was lowered and the captain rowed alongside her taking bob with him as interpreter  the prize proved to be a brig of about the same tonnage as the antelope she was from cadiz bound first to alicante and then to valencia she carried only six small guns and a crew of eighteen men her cargo consisted of grain and olive oil  not a bad prize captain lockett said as bob read out the items of her bill of lading it is a pity that it is not full up instead of only half laden still it is not a bad beginning and the craft herself is of a handy size and if she wont sell at gibraltar will pay very well to take on to england i should say she was fast  an hour later the two brigs parted company the second mate and twelve hands being placed on board the spaniard there was some discussion as to the prisoners but it was finally agreed to leave them on board their ship  keep them down in the hold mr crofts see that you dont leave any knives with them keep a couple of sentries over the hatchway if the wind holds you will be in the bay by tomorrow evening keep pretty well inshore and slip in as close to the point as you can if you do that you need not have much fear of their gunboats  i dont suppose the authorities will want to keep the prisoners but of course you will report them on your arrival and can give them one of the boats to land across the bay if they are not wanted if the governor wants to buy the cargo for the garrison let him have it at once dont stand out for exorbitant terms but take a fair price it is just as well to be on good terms with the authorities we might have to put in to refit and want spars etc from the naval yard if the governor doesnt want the cargo dont sell it to anyone else till we return there is no fear of prices going down the longer we keep it the more we shall get for it  hadnt i better bring the ships papers on board with us captain lockett  what for bob i dont see that they would be any use to us and the bills of lading will be useful for selling the cargo  i can copy them sir for mr crofts  what i thought was this the brig is just our own size and if we should get becalmed anywhere near the shore and a boat put off we might possibly be able to pass with her papers  that is a capital idea bob capital i will have a bit of canvas painted alonzo cadiz in readiness to nail over our stern should there be any occasion for it  well goodbye mr crofts and a safe journey to you i neednt tell you to keep a sharp lookout  you may trust us for that sir we have no desire to rot in one of their prisons till the end of the war  the captains gig took him back to the antelope the weather sheets of the forestaysail were eased off and the square sails swung round as they drew the two brigs got under way heading in exactly opposite directions  before nightfall the captain pronounced that they were now abreast of alicante and under easy sail the vessels head was turned towards the land and the next morning she was running along the shore at a distance of three miles beyond fishing boats and small craft hugging the land nothing was met with until they neared cartagena then the sound of firing was heard ahead and on rounding a headland they saw a vessel of war chasing some five or six craft nearer inshore  that is a british frigate the captain exclaimed but i dont think she will get them there is cartagena only three or four miles ahead and the frigate will not be able to cut them off before they are under the guns of the batteries  they are not above a mile ahead of her the first mate said if we could knock away a spar with our long eighteen we might get one of them  we shouldnt make much prize money if we did joe for the frigate would share and as she has five or six times as many men and officers as we have got it is not much we should get out of it  hallo he broke out as a shot came ricochetting along the water she is trying a shot at us i forgot we had the spanish colours up  get that flag down and run up the union jack joe  one moment captain bob said  well what is it bob  well it seems to me sir that if we keep the spanish flag up  we may be sunk the captain broke in  we might sir but it is very unlikely especially if we run in more to the shore but you see if we are fired at by the frigate it will never enter the minds of the spaniards that we are anything but what we seem and if we like we can anchor right under their batteries in the middle of their craft it will be dark by the time we get in and we might take our pick of them  that is a splendid idea bob  this boy is getting too sharp for us altogether joe he is as full of ideas as a ships biscuit is of weevils  keep her off helmsman that will do  again and again the frigate fired but she was two miles away and though the shot went skipping over the water near the brig none of them struck her the men unable to understand why they were running the gauntlet of the frigates fire looked inquiringly towards the poop  it is all right lads the captain said there is not much fear of the frigate hitting us and it is worth risking it the spaniards on shore will never dream that we are english and we can bring up in the thick of them  there was a good deal of laughing and amusement among the men as they understood the captains motive in allowing the brig to be made a target of as she drew in towards shore the frigates fire ceased and her course was changed off shore  no nearer the captain said to the helmsman keep her a little farther off shore  there is not much water here joe for a man had been heaving the lead ever since they had changed their course we have not got a fathom under her keel you see the frigate did not like to come any closer she would have cut us off if there had been deep water right up  an hour later the brig dropped anchor off cartagena at little more than a quarter of a mile from one of the batteries that guarded the entrance to the port and close to two or three of the craft that had been first chased by the frigate these as they were going on in the morning had not entered the harbour with their consorts for it was already getting dusk  not much fear of their coming to ask any questions this evening joe lockett said the spaniards are not given to troubling themselves unnecessarily and as we are outside the port we are no ones business in particular  at this moment a hail came from the vessel anchored ahead of them bob went to the bulwark the brig had swung head to wind and was broadside on with the other craft  you have not suffered from the fire of that accursed ship i hope the captain of the barque shouted  no senor not a shot struck us  you were fortunate we were hulled twice and had a man killed by a splinter  this is a rough welcome home to us we have just returned from lima and have heard nothing about the war till we anchored off alicante yesterday we heard some firing as we came through the straits but thought it was only one of the ships or forts practising at a mark it was lucky we put in at alicante or we should have had no suspicion and should have let that frigate sail up alongside of us without trying to escape  you were fortunate indeed bob shouted back we had ourselves a narrow escape of being captured by a ship of war near malaga the alonzo is only from cadiz with grain and olive oil  do you think there is any fear of that rascally englishman trying to cut us out with his boats tonight  not the slightest bob replied confidently they would never venture on that those batteries on shore would blow them out of the water and they would know very well they would not have a shadow of chance of taking us out for even if they captured us the batteries would send us to the bottom in no time oh no you are perfectly safe from the frigate here  the spanish captain raised his hat bob did the same and both left the side of their ships  well what does he say bob the captain asked  i think you are in luck this time captain and no mistake  how is that bob  she is from lima  you dont say so the captain and joe exclaimed simultaneously then she is something like a prize she has got hides no doubt but the chances are she has a lot of lead too and maybe some silver  ah he is getting one of his boats in the water i hope he is not coming off here  if he does joe bob must meet him at the gangway and take him into the cabin as he comes in you and i will catch him by the throat gag and bind him and then bob must go and tell the men to return to their ship that the captain is going to spend the evening with us and that we will take him back in our boat  that would be the best thing that could happen joe said for in that way we could get alongside without suspicion  so we could joe i didnt think of that yes i hope he is coming now  they saw however the boat row to a large polacre lying next to the spaniard on the other side it remained there two or three minutes and then rowed away towards the mouth of the harbour  going to spend the evening on shore the captain observed i am not surprised at that it is likely enough they have been six months on their voyage from lima it is unlucky though i wish he had come here  well bob as you have got the best head among us what scheme do you suggest for our getting on board that craft  i think we could carry out joes idea though in a different way bob said i should say we had better get a boat out and put say twenty men on board it is getting dark but they might all lie down in the bottom except six oarsmen then we should pull in towards the mouth of the harbour just as they have done and lay up somewhere under the rocks for a couple of hours then row off again and make for the barque of course they would think it was the captain returning  then ten of the men should spring on board and they ought to be able to silence any men on deck before they could give the alarm directly the ten men got out the boat would row across to the polacre as there is no doubt her captain went ashore with the other they would take her in the same way  you ought to be made lord high admiral of the fleet bob that will succeed if anything will only we must be sure to put off again before the spaniards do  well joe you had better take charge of this expedition you see however quietly it is done there is almost sure to be some shouting and they will take the alarm at the batteries and when they make out three of us suddenly getting up sail they will be pretty certain that something is wrong and will open fire on us that of course we must risk but the thing to be really afraid of is their gunboats they are sure to have a couple of them in the port they may be some little time in getting out but they will come out  the wind has died away now but the land breeze is just springing up but we shall hardly get off before the gunboats can come to us they row a lot of oars you know you must clap on all sail on the prizes and i shall hang behind a bit and tackle the gunboats you will see what guns there are on board the prizes and may perhaps be able to lend me a hand but that you will see of course you will take bob with you to answer the hails from the two spaniards  be careful when you bring up ashore let the men row very gently after they once get away so as not to attract any attention let them take cutlasses but no pistols if a shot were fired the batteries would be sure at once there was some mischief going on a little shouting wont matter so much it might be merely a quarrel of course the instant you are on board you will cut the cables and get up sail  you will remain on board the barque joe bob will have command of the party that attack the polacre you had better take the jolly boat and pick out twenty active fellows tell them to leave their shoes behind them the less trampling and noise there is the better tell them not to use their cutlasses unless driven to it there are not likely to be above four or five men on deck they ought to be able to knock them down and bind them almost before they know what has happened  in a few minutes the boat was lowered and manned and rowed away for the shore as soon as they got well past the ships the men were ordered to row as quietly and noiselessly as possible joe had brought with him six strips of canvas and handed these to the men and told them to wrap them round the oars so as to muffle them in the rowlocks  this was done and the boat glided along silently keeping in the middle of the channel they passed through the passage between the shore and the rocky island that protects the harbour and then sweeping round stole up behind the latter and lay to close to the rocks  so far so good joe said in a low voice i dont think the sharpest eyes could have seen us now the question is how long to wait here the longer we wait the more of the spaniards will have turned into their bunks but upon the other hand there is no saying how long the captains will remain on shore  there is a heavy dew falling and that will help to send the sailors below i should think an hour would be about the right time the dons are not likely to be off again before that it is some distance up the harbour to the landing place and they would hardly have taken the trouble to go ashore unless they meant to stay a couple of hours  what time is it now bob  bob opened his watch case and felt the hands  it is just a quarter past nine  well we will move at ten joe said  the threequarters of an hour passed very slowly and bob consulted his watch several times before the minute hand got to twelve  ten oclock he said at last  the oars had not been got in so the boat glided off again noiselessly out through the entrance there were lights burning at the sterns of the two spanish ships as a guide to the boat coming off and when the boat had traversed half the distance joe ordered the oars to be unmuffled and they rowed straight for the barque there was no hail at their approach but a man appeared at the top of the ladder  as the boat came alongside ten of the men rose noiselessly from the bottom of the boat and followed the first mate up the ladder as he reached the top joe sprang on the spanish sailor and seized him by the throat the two sailors following thrust a gag into the mans mouth bound his arms and laid him down  this was effected without the slightest noise the other sailors had by this time clambered up from the boat and scattered over the deck a group of seven or eight spaniards were seated on the deck forward smoking by the light of a lantern which hung above the focastle they did not notice the approach of the sailors with their naked feet and the latter sprang upon them threw them down bound and gagged them without a soundsave a few short exclamations of surprise being uttered  illustration they found the two spanish mates playing at cards  three or four of the sailors now coiled a rope against the focastle door to prevent its being opened in the meantime joe with two men entered the cabin aft where they found the two spanish mates playing at cards the sudden apparition of three men with drawn cutlasses took them so completely by surprise that they were captured without any attempt at resistance and were like the rest bound and gagged  you take the helm halkett joe said and then hurried forward  have you got them all he asked as he reached the focastle  every man jack one of the sailors said  is there nobody on watch in the bows  no sir not a man  very well now then to work  cut the cable thompson  the rest of you let fall the sails  as these had only been loosely furled when the vessel came to anchor this was done in a very short time and the vessel began to move through the water before the light breeze which was dead aft  the capture of the polacre had not been effected so silently bob had allowed the boatswain who accompanied him to mount the ladder first but the man at the top of the gangway had a lantern and as its light fell upon the sailors face he uttered an exclamation of surprise which called the attention of those on deck and as the sailors swarmed up the ladder shouts of alarm were raised but the spaniards could not withstand the rush of the english who beat them to the deck before they had time to seize their arms  the noise however alarmed the watch below who were just pouring up from the hatchway when they were attacked by the sailors with drawn cutlasses and were speedily beaten below and the hatches secured over them bob had posted himself with two of the men at the cabin door and as the officers rushed out on hearing the noise they were knocked down and secured as soon as this was effected bob looked round over the side  hurrah he said the barque is under way already get the sails on her lads and cut the cable  while this was being done bob mounted the poop placed one of the sailors at the helm and then turned his eyes towards the battery astern he heard shouts and had no doubt that the sound of the scuffle had been heard then lights appeared in several of the casements and just as the sails were sheeted home and the polacre began to move through the water a rocket whizzed up from the battery and burst overhead by its light bob saw the antelope and the spanish barque two or three hundred yards ahead with their crews getting up all sail rapidly  a minute later twelve heavy guns flashed out astern one after another they were pointed too high and the shot flew overhead one or two passing through the sails the boatswains voice was heard shouting  never mind the shot lads look alive now then up with those topgallant sails the quicker you get them up the quicker we shall be out of range  another battery higher up now opened fire but the shot did not come near them then rocket after rocket was sent up and the battery astern again fired one of the shot cut away the maintopsail yard another struck the deck abreast of the foremast and then tore through the bulwarks but the polacre was now making good way they felt the wind more as they got farther from the shore and had decreased their distance from the craft ahead  the boatswain now joined bob upon the poop  we have got everything set that will draw now he said she is walking along well another ten minutes and we shall be safe if they dont knock away a spar  she is a fast craft mr repton she is overhauling the other two hand over hand  we had better bear away a bit boatswain the captain said we were to scatter as much as we could so as to divide their fire  all right sir and the boatswain gave the orders to the helmsman and slightly altered the trim of the sails  i suppose we can do nothing with that broken yard boatswain  no sir and it dont matter much going pretty nearly before the wind as we are the sails on the foremast draw all the better so it dont make much difference  look out below he shouted as there was a crash above and the mizzenmast was cut in sunder by a shot that struck it just above the topsail blocks and the upper part came toppling down striking the bulwark and falling overboard  lay aft lads and out knives the boatswain shouted cut away the wreck  it is lucky it wasnt two feet lower he said to bob or it would have brought the topsail down and that would have been a serious loss now the maintopsail is of no use  he sprang to assist the men when a round shot struck him and almost carried off his head bob caught at the knife that fell from his hand and set to work with the men  that is it lads cut away he shouted we shant have many more of them on board we are a good mile away now  just as the work of getting rid of the wreck was accomplished one of the men said as a rocket burst overhead  there are two of their gunboats coming out of the harbour sir  we had better close with the others then bob said the brig will engage them when they come up we shall be well beyond reach of the batteries before they do  now lads see what guns she carries break open the magazine and get powder and ball up we must lend the captain a hand if we can  the polacre mounted eight guns all 14 pounders and in a few minutes these were loaded the batteries continued to fire but their shooting was no longer accurate and in another ten minutes ceased altogether the craft had now closed to within hailing distance of the brig  hallo the polacre captain lockett shouted what damages  the boatswain is killed sir bob shouted back and we have lost two spars but in spite of that i think we are sailing as fast as you  what guns have you got  eight fourteenpounders sir we are loaded and ready  keep a little ahead of me the captain shouted i am going to shorten sail a bit we have got to fight those gunboats  as he spoke a heavy gun boomed out from the bow of one of the gunboats and the shot went skipping between the two vessels directly after the other gunboat fired and the shot struck the quarter of the brig then there was a creaking of blocks as the sheets were hauled upon and as the yards swung round she came up into the wind and a broadside was fired at the two gunboats then the helm was put down and she payed off before the wind again  the gunboats ceased rowing for a minute the discharge had staggered them for they had not given the brig credit for carrying such heavy metal  then they began to row again the swivel gun of the brig kept up a steady fire on them two of the guns of the polacre had been by this time shifted to the stern and these opened fire while the first mates crew on board the barque were also at work a fortunate shot smashed many of the oars of one of the gunboats and while she stopped rowing in disorder the brig was again rounded to and opened a steady fire with her broadside guns upon them  as the gunboats were now little more than a quarter of a mile away the effect of the brigs fire aided by that of the two prizes was very severe and in a short time the spaniards put round and rowed towards the shore while a hearty cheer broke from the brig and her prizes  there had been no more casualties on board the polacre the fire of the gunboats having been directed entirely upon the brig as the spaniards knew that if they could but destroy or capture her they would be able to recover the prizes the polacre was soon brought close alongside of the brig  have you suffered much captain lockett  i am sorry to say we have had six men killed and five wounded we have got a dozen shot in our stern they were evidently trying to damage the rudder but beyond knocking the cabin fittings to pieces there is no more harm done than the carpenter can repair in a few hours work  you have not been hit again have you  no sir none of their shots came near  well examine the papers and have a talk with the officers you made prisoners and then come on board to report i shall want you to go on board the barque with me and see what she is laden with  bob went below the two spanish mates were unbound  i am sorry senors bob said that we were obliged to treat you rather roughly but you see we were in a hurry and there was no time for explanations i shall be obliged if you will show me which is the captains cabin and hand me over the ships papers and manifesto what is her name  the braganza  where are you from and what do you carry  we are from cadiz and are laden principally with wine we were bound for barcelona  you took us in nicely senor who could have dreamt that you were english when that frigate chased you under the guns of the battery  she thought we were spanish as you did bob said  by this time the other spaniard had brought the papers out of the captains cabin bob ran his eye down over the bill of lading and was well satisfied with the result she contained a very large consignment of wine  i am going on board the brig he said as he put the papers together i must ask you to give me your parole not to leave the cabin until i return i do not know whether my captain wishes you to remain here or will transfer you to his own craft  well master bob what is your prize the captain asked  it is a valuable one sir the polacre herself is as i see by her papers only two years old and seems a fine craft she is laden with wine from cadiz to barcelona  capital bob we are in luck indeed how many prisoners have you got  the crew is put down at eighteen sir and there are the two mates  you had better send them on board here presently where are they now  they are in the cabin captain they gave me their promise not to leave it till i return but i put a man on sentry outside so as to make sure of them  well perhaps you had better go back again now and we will shape our course for gibraltar at once all this firing would have attracted the attention of any spanish war vessel there might be about we must leave the barques manifesto till the morning  as you have lost the boatswain i will send one of my best hands back with you to act as your first mate he must get that topsail yard of yours repaired at once it does not matter about the mizzenmast but the yard is of importance we may meet with spanish cruisers outside the rock and may have to show our heels  yes i shall be glad of a good man captain you see i know nothing about it and dont like giving any orders it was all very well getting on board and knocking down the crew but when it comes to sailing her it is perfectly ridiculous my giving orders when the men know that i dont know anything about it  the men know you have plenty of pluck bob and they know that it was entirely due to your swimming off to that spanish ship that we escaped being captured before and they will obey you willingly as far as you can give them orders still of course you do want somebody with you to give orders as to the setting and taking in of the sails  as soon as the last gun had been fired the three vessels had been laid head to wind but when bobs boat reached the side of the polacre they were again put on their course and headed southwest keeping within a short distance of each other  bobs new first mate an old sailor named brown at once set the crew to work to get up a fresh spar in place of the broken yard the men all worked with a will they were in high spirits at the captures they had made and the news which brown gave them that the polacre was laden with wine assured to each of them a substantial sum in prize money  before morning the yard was in its place and the sail set and except for the shortened mizzen and a ragged hole through the bulwark forward the polacre showed no signs of the engagement of the evening before two or three men were slung over the stern of the brig plugs had been driven through the shot holes and over these patches of canvas were nailed and painted black  nothing however could be done with the sails which were completely riddled with holes the crew were set to work to shift some of the worst cutting them away from the yards and getting up spare sails from below bob had put a man on the lookout to give him notice if any signal was made to him from the brig which was a quarter of a mile ahead of him the polacres topgallant sails having been lowered after the maintopsail had been hoisted as it was found that with all sail set she sailed considerably faster than the brig  presently the man came aft and reported that the captain was waving his hat from the taffrail  we had better get up the maintopgallant sail brown and run up to her bob said  the sail was soon hoisted and in a quarter of an hour they were alongside the brig  that craft sails like a witch captain lockett said as they came abreast of him  yes sir she seems very fast  it is a pity she is rigged as she is the captain said it is an outlandish fashion if she were barque rigged i should be tempted to shift on board her  we will leave the barque alone at present mr repton our curiosity must keep a bit i dont want to lose any of this breeze we will keep right on as long as it lasts if it drops we will overhaul her  the barque was the slowest craft of the three and joe lockett had every stitch of canvas set to enable him to keep up with the others at noon a large craft was seen coming off from the land bob examined her with the telescope and then handed the glass to brown  she is a frigate the sailor said its the same that blazed away at us yesterday its the brilliant i think  you are sure she is the same that chased us yesterday  quite sure  captain lockett was evidently of the same opinion as no change was made in the course he was steering  we may as well speak the captain again bob said and the polacre closed again with the brig  brown says that is the same frigate that fired at us yesterday captain lockett bob said when they were within hailing distance  yes there is no doubt about that i dont want to lose time or i would stand out and try our speed with her  why sir  because i am afraid she will want to take some of our hands those frigates are always short of hands still she may not as we have got twelve men already away in a prize and ten in each of these craft  i dont think you need be uneasy sir i know the captain of the brilliant and all the officers if you like i will keep the polacre on that side so that they will come up to us first and will go on board and speak to the captain i dont think then he would interfere with us  very well mr repton we will arrange it so  the polacre had now taken its place to leeward of the other two vessels and they held on in that order until the frigate was within half a mile when she fired a gun across their bows as signal for them to heave to the brig was now flying the british colours her prizes the british colours with the spanish underneath them at the order to heave to they were all thrown up into the wind  the frigate reduced her sail as she came up and as she neared the polacre the order was shouted  send a boat alongside  the boat was already prepared for lowering four seamen got into her and rowed bob alongside the frigate the first person he encountered as he stepped on to the deck was jim sankey who stared at him in astonishment  hullo bob what in the world are you doing here  i am in command of that polacre mr sankey bob replied  ehwhat jim stammered in astonishment when the captains voice from the quarterdeck came sharply down  now mr sankey what are you waiting for bring that gentleman here  jim led the way up to the poop  bob saluted  good morning captain langton  why its repton the captain exclaimed in surprise why where do you spring from and what craft are these  i am in command at present sir of the polacre which with the barque is a prize of the brig the antelope privateer  but what are you doing on board repton and how is it that you are in command  well sir i was out on a cruise in the antelope the second mate was sent with a prize crew back to gibraltar in a craft we picked up off malaga we cut out the other two prizes from under the guns of cartagena the first mate was in command of the party that captured the barque and as there was no one else to send the captain put me in command of the party that captured the polacre  but how on earth did you manage it the captain asked i see the brig has been cut up a good deal about the sails and rigging you dont mean to say that she sailed right into cartagena why they would have blown her out of the water  we didnt go in sir we anchored outside the port we were not suspected because one of his majestys frigates fired at us as we were going in and the consequence was the dons never suspected that we were anything but a spanish trader  why you dont mean to say the captain exclaimed that this was the brig flying spanish colours which we chased in under the guns of cartagena yesterday  it is sir bob said smiling you did us a very good turn although your intentions were not friendly we were under spanish colours when you made us out and it struck us that running the gauntlet of your fire for a little while would be an excellent introduction for us to the spaniards  so it proved we brought up close to those other two vessels and i had a talk with the captain of one of them the two captains both went ashore after dark so we put twenty men into a boat and rowed in to the mouth of the port waited there for a bit and then rowed straight out to the ships they thought of course it was their own officers returning so we took them by surprise and captured them pretty easily  unfortunately there was some noise made and they took the alarm on shore however we were under way before the batteries opened it was rather unpleasant for a bit but we got safely out two gunboats came out after us but the brig beat them off and we helped as well as we could the brig had five men killed we had one and there are several wounded  well it was a very dashing affair the captain said very creditable indeed i hope you will get a share of the prize money  i only count as a hand bob said laughing and i am sure that is as much as i deserve  but here comes the captain sir he will tell you more about it  captain lockett now came on board and bob seeing that he was not farther required went off with jim down to the cockpit the captain had a long talk with captain lockett when the latter had related in full the circumstances of his capture of his two prizes he said  there is a spanish ship of war sir somewhere off alicante at present she is got up as a merchantman and took us in thoroughly and we should probably have been caught if it had not been for mr repton and he then related how bob had swum on board and discovered the supposed merchantman to be a ship of war  thank you captain lockett i will go in and have a look after her it is fortunate that you told me for if i had seen her lying at anchor under the land i might have sent some boats in to cut her out and might as you nearly did have caught a tartar  he is an uncommonly sharp young fellow that repton i offered him a midshipmans berth here when i first came out but he refused it by what you say he must be a good officer lost to the service  he would have made a good officer sir he has his wits about him so thoroughly it was his doing our keeping the spanish flag flying when you came upon us i had ordered the colours to be run down when he suggested our keeping them up and running boldly in to cartagena  i suppose you cant spare us a few hands captain lockett  well sir i shall be very short as it is you see i have a score away in a prize i have had six killed and some of the wounded wont be fit for work for some time and i mean to take these two prizes back with me to england they are both valuable and i should not get anything like a fair price for them at gibraltar i dont want to run the risk of their being picked up by privateers on the way back so i shall convoy them and i certainly shant have a man too many to fight my guns when i have put crews on board them  no i suppose not the captain said well i must do without them then  now as i suppose you want to be on your way i will not detain you any longer  bob was sent for  captain lockett has been telling me that you were the means of preventing his getting into a nasty scrape with that spanish manofwar mr repton i consider there is great credit due to you it is a pity you didnt come on to my quarterdeck  i should not have got the chances then sir bob said  well no i dont know that you would lad there is something in that  well goodbye i shall write and tell the admiral all about it i know he will be glad to hear of your doings  a few minutes later the privateer and her prizes were on their way towards gibraltar while the frigate was standing inshore again to search for the spanish ship of war    chapter 12 a rich prize   in the evening the wind died away and the three vessels were becalmed captain lockett rowed to the polacre and examined his prize and then taking bob in his boat rowed to the barque  well joe have you made out what you have got on board the captain said when he reached the deck  no sir neither of the officers can speak a word of english i have opened the hatches and she is chockfull of hides but what there is underneath i dont know  come along bob we will overhaul the papers the captain said and going to the cabin they examined the bill of lading  here it is sir bob said triumphantly two hundred tons of lead  splendid the captain exclaimed that is a prize worth having of course that is stowed away at the bottom and then she is filled up with hides and they are worth a lot of moneybut the lead alone is worth six thousand pounds at twenty pounds per ton  is there anything else bob  yes sir there are fifty boxes it doesnt say what is in them  you dont say so bob perhaps it is silver let us ask the officers  the spanish first mate was called down  where are these boxes bob asked and what do they contain  they are full of silver the man said sullenly they are stowed in the lazaretto under this cabin  we will have one of them up and look into it the captain said  joe call a couple of hands down  the trapdoor of the lazaretto was lifted joe and the two sailors descended the ladder and with some difficulty one of the boxes was hoisted up  that weighs over two hundredweight im sure joe said  illustration they find boxes of silver in the lazaretto  the box was broken open and it was found to be filled with small bars of silver  are they all the same size joe the captain asked  yes as far as i can see  the captain took out his pocketbook and made a rapid calculation  then they are worth between thirtytwo and thirtythree thousand pounds joe  why lad she is worth forty thousand pounds without the hides or the hull that is something like a capture and the two men shook hands warmly  the best thing to do joe will be to divide these boxes between the three ships then even if one of them gets picked up by the spaniards or french we shall still be in clover  i think that would be a good plan joe agreed  we will do it at once there is nothing like making matters safe just get into the boat alongside and row to the brig and tell them to lower the jolly boat and send it alongside we will get some of the boxes up by the time you are back  in an hour the silver was divided between the three ships and the delight of the sailors was great when they heard how valuable had been the capture  how do you divide bob asked captain lockett as they were watching the boxes lowered into the boat  the ship takes half he said of the other half i take twelve shares joe eight the second mate six the boatswain three and the fifty hands one share each so you may say there are eighty shares and if the half of the prize is worth twenty thousand pounds each mans share will be two hundred and fifty  it will be worth having bob though it is a great shame you should not rate as an officer  i dont want the money bob laughed i should have no use for it if i had it my uncle has taken me in hand and i am provided for  yes i understand that the captain said if it were not so i should have proposed to the crew that they should agree to your sharing the same as the second officer i am sure they would have agreed willingly seeing that it is due to you that we were not captured ourselves in the first place and entirely to your suggestion that we should keep the spanish flag flying and run into cartagena that we owe the capture of the prizes  oh i would much rather not captain i only came for a cruise and it has been a splendid one and it seems to be quite absurd that i should be getting anything at all still it will be jolly because i shall be able to make carrie and gerald nice presents with my own money and to send some home to mr medlin and his family and something to uncle too if i can think of anything he would like  yes it is all very well bob for you but i feel that it is not fair however as you really dont want the money and are well satisfied we will say nothing more about it now  the ships lay becalmed all night but a brisk breeze from the east sprang up in the morning and at noon the rock was visible in the distance they held on for four hours and then lay to till after midnight after that sail was again made and soon after daybreak they passed europa point without having been seen by any of the spanish cruisers they were greeted by a hearty cheer from the vessels anchored near the new mole as they brought up amongst them with the british flags flying above the spanish on board the prizes  as soon as the morning gun was fired and the gates opened bob landed and hurried up to his sisters she and her husband were just partaking of their early coffee  hallo bob captain ohalloran exclaimed what back again why i didnt expect you for another fortnight you must have managed very badly to have brought your cruise to an end so soon  well i am very glad you are back bob his sister said i have been fidgetting about you ever since you were away  i am as glad to see you as your sister can be gerald put in if she has fidgetted when you had only gone a week you can imagine what i should have to bear before the end of a month i should have had to move into barracks life would have been insupportable here  i am sure i have said very little about it gerald his wife said indignantly  no carrie you have not said much but your aspect has been generally tragic you have taken but slight interest in your fowls and there has been a marked deterioration in the meals my remarks have been frequently unanswered and you have got into a sister anne sort of way of going upon the roof and staring out to sea  your sister is a most estimable woman bobi am the last person who would deny itbut i must admit that she has been a little trying during the last week  carrie laughed  well it is only paying you back a little in your own coin gerald  but what has brought you back so soon bob we heard of you three days ago for gerald went on board a brig that was brought in as he heard that it was a prize of the antelopes and the officer told him about your cruise up to when he had left you  well there wasnt much to tell up till then bob said except that i was well and my appetite was good but there has been a good lot since we have come in with two more good prizes this morning and the brig is going to convoy them back to england  oh that is all right carrie said in a tone of pleasure  so far she had been afraid that bobs return was only a temporary one and that he might be setting out again in a day or two  well let us hear all about it bob her husband said i could see carrie was on thorns lest you were going off again now that she is satisfied she may be able to listen to you comfortably  well we really had some adventures gerald we had a narrow escape from being captured by a spanish ship of war ever so much stronger than we were she was got up as a merchantman and regularly took us in we anchored close to her intending to board her in the dark i thought i would swim off and reconnoitre a bit before we attacked her and of course i saw at once what she was and we cut our cable and were towed out in the dark she fired away at us but didnt do us any damage  the next day late in the afternoon we came upon the brilliant chasing some spanish craft into cartagena and as we had spanish colours up she took us for one of them and blazed away at us  but why didnt you pull down the spanish colours at once bob i never heard of anything so silly carrie said indignantly  well you see carrie they were some distance off and werent likely to damage us much and we ran straight in and anchored with the rest under the guns of the battery outside cartagena seeing us fired at of course they never suspected we were english then at night we captured the two vessels lying next to us and put out to sea the batteries blazed away at us and it was not very pleasant till we got outside their range they did not do us very much damage two gunboats came out after us but the brig beat them back and we helped  who were we captain ohalloran asked  we were the prizes of course i was in command of one  hooray bob gerald exclaimed with a great laugh while carrie uttered an exclamation of horror  well you see the second mate had been sent off in the first prize and there was only joe lockett and me so he took the biggest of the two ships we cut out and the captain put me in command of the men that took the other i had the boatswain with me and of course he was the man who really commanded in getting up the sails and all that sort of thing he was killed by a shot from the battery and was the only man hit on our vessel but there were five killed on board the brig in the fight with the gunboats  we fell in with the brilliant on the way back and i went on board and you should have seen how jim sankey opened his eyes when i said that i was in command of the prize they are awfully good prizes too i can tell you the one i got is laden with wine and the big one was a barque from lima with hides and two hundred tons of lead and fifty boxes of silverabout thirtythree thousand pounds worth  just think of that the captain said she was worth altogether at least forty thousand pounds that is something like a prize isnt it  yes that is  what do you think carrie i propose that i sell my commission raise as much as i can on the old place in ireland and fit out a privateer bob will of course be captain you shall be first mate and i will be content with second mates berth and we will sail the salt ocean and pick up our fortythousandpound prizes  oh what nonsense you do talk to be sure gerald just when bobs news is so interesting too  i have told all my news carrie now i want to hear yours the spaniards havent began to batter down the rock yet  we have been very quiet bob on the 11th a great convoy of about sixty sailprotected by five xebecs of from twenty to thirty guns eachcame along they must have come out from malaga the very night you passed there they were taking supplies for the use of the spanish fleet and the privateers captured three or four small craft and the panther the enterprise and the childers were kept at their anchor all day why no one but the admiral could say we were all very much disappointed for everyone expected to see pretty nearly all the spanish vessels brought in  yes captain ohalloran said it has caused a deal of talk i can tell you the navy were furious there they were sixty vessels all laden with the very things we wanted pretty well becalmed not more than a mile off europa point with our batteries banging away at them and nothing in the world to hinder the panther and the frigates from fetching them all in half the town were out on the hill and every soul who could get off duty at the point and there was the admiral wasting the whole mortal day in trying to make up his mind if you had heard the bad language that was used in relation to that old gentleman it would have made your hair stand on end  of course just as it got dark the ships of war started and equally of course the convoy all got away in the dark except six bits of prizes which were brought in in the morning we have heard since that it was on purpose to protect this valuable fleet that the spanish squadron arrived before you went away but as it didnt turn up the squadron went off again and we had nothing to do but just to pick it up  after breakfast captain ohalloran went off with bob to the antelope he found all hands busy bending on sails in place of those that had been damaged taking those of the brig first captured for the purpose  they fit very well joe lockett said and we have not time to lose we sail again this afternoon the captain says there is nothing to prevent our going out now and as the spanish squadron may be back any day we might have to run the gauntlet to get out if we lost the present chance so he is not going to waste an hour  crofts has already sold the grain and discharged it the hull is worth but little and the captain has sold her as she stands to a trader for two hundred pounds i expect he has bought her to break up for firewood if the siege goes on if it doesnt he will sell her again afterwards at a good profit of course it is a ridiculous price but the captain wanted to get her off his hands and would have taken a ten pound note rather than be bothered with her  so by tonight we shall be across at ceuta and if the wind holds east but another day we shall be through the straits on our way home  they are going to shift two of our 18 pounders on board the barque and i am going to command her and to have fifteen men on board crofts commands the poleacre with ten men the rest of course go in the brig we shall keep together and steer well out west into the atlantic so as to give as wide a berth as possible to spaniards and frenchmen if we meet with a privateer we ought to be able to give a good account of him if we run across a frigate we shall scatter and it will be hard luck if we dont manage to get two out of the three craft into port  we have been shifting some more of the silver again this morning from the barque into the other two vessels otherwise as she has the lead on board she would be the most valuable prize as it is now the three are of about equal value  well we wish you a pleasant voyage captain ohalloran said i suppose we shall see you back here again before long  yes i should think so but i dont know what the captain means to do we have had no time to talk this morning i daresay you will meet him on shore he has gone to the post office to get his papers signed we have been quite pestered this morning by men coming on board to buy wine out of the polacre but the captain wouldnt have the hatches taken off the spaniards may turn up at any moment and it is of the greatest importance our getting off while the coast is clear it is most unfortunate now that we did not run straight in yesterday instead of laying to to wait for night  they did not meet the captain in the town and from the roof bob saw the three vessels get up sail early in the afternoon and make across for the african coast  the doctor came in in the evening  well bob so i hear you have been fighting and commanding ships and doing all sorts of things i saw captain lockett in the town and faith if you had been a dozen admirals rolled into one he couldnt have spoken more highly of you  it seems mrs ohalloran that bob has been the special angel who has looked after poor jack on board the antelope  what ridiculous nonsense doctor bob exclaimed hotly  not at all bob it is too modest you are entirely it is yourself is the boy who has done the business this time and it is a silver tay service or some such trifle as that that the owners will be sending you and small blame to them captain lockett tells me he owns a third of the ship and he reckons the ships share of what they have taken this little cruise wont be less than fiveandtwenty thousand  think of that mrs ohalloran fiveandtwenty thousand pounds and here is edward burke md working his sowl out for a miserable eight or ten shillings a day  but what has bob done  i hadnt time to learn it all mrs ohalloran for the captain was in a hurry it seems to me that the question ought to be what is it that he hasnt done  it all came in a heap together and i am not sure of the exact particulars but it seems to me that he swam out and cut the cable of a spanish sloop of war and took the end in his mouth and towed her out to sea while the guns were blazing in all directions at him never was such an affair  then he humbugged the captain of an english frigate and the commander of the spanish forts and stole a vessel chock full of silver and did i dont know what besides  bob went off into a shout of laughter in which the others joined  but what is the meaning of all this nonsense teddy carrie asked as soon as she recovered her composure is there anything in it or is it all pure invention  is there anything in it havent i been telling you that there is twentyfive thousand pounds in it to the owners and as much more to the crew and didnt the captain vow and declare that if it hadnt been for bob instead of going home to divide all this treasure up between them every man jack of them would be at this moment chained by the leg in a dirty spanish prison at malaga  well what does it all mean bob there is no getting any sense out of dr burke  it is exactly what i told you carrie we anchored close to a craft that we thought was a merchantman and that we meant to attack in our boats i swam on board her in the darkto see if they were keeping a good watch and that sort of thingand when i got on board i found she was a ship of war with a lot of heavy guns and prepared to take us by surprise when we attacked her so of course when i swam back again with the news captain lockett cut his cable and towed the brig out in the dark  as to the other affair that the doctor is talking about i told you that too and it is exactly as i said it was the only thing i had to do with it was that it happened to be my idea to keep the spanish colours flying and let the frigate keep on firing at us the idea turned out well but of course if i had not thought of it somebody else would so there was nothing in it at all  well bob you may say what you like doctor burke said but it is quite evident that the captain thought there was a good deal in it  and i think really gerald that you and mrs ohalloran have good reason to feel quite proud of him i am not joking at all when i say that captain lockett really spoke as if he considered that the good fortune they had had is very largely due to him he said he hoped he should have bob on board for another cruise  i certainly shall not go any more with him bob said indignantly if he talks such nonsense about me afterwards as if there was anything in swimming two or three hundred yards on a dark night or in suggesting the keeping a flag up instead of pulling it down  when the brilliant however came in two days later captain langton called upon mrs ohalloran and told her that he did so in order to acquaint her with the extremely favourable report captain lockett had made to him of bobs conduct and that from what he had said it was evident that the lad had shown great courage in undertaking the swim to the spanish vessel and much promptness and ready wit in suggesting the device that had deceived him as well as the spaniards  captain langton told the story that evening at general eliotts dinner table and said that although it was certainly a good joke against himself that he should have thus assisted a privateer to carry off two valuable prizes that had slipped through the frigates hands the story was too good not to be told thus bobs exploit became generally known among the officers of the garrison and captain ohalloran was warmly congratulated upon the sharpness and pluck of his young brotherinlaw  captain locketts decision to be off without any delay was fully justified by the appearance of a spanish squadron in the bay three days after his departure it consisted of two seventyfours two frigates five xebecs and a number of galleys and small armed vessels the menofwar anchored off algeciras while the rest of the squadron kept a vigilant patrol at the mouth of the bay and formed a complete blockade  towards the end of the month the troops were delighted by the issue of an order that the use of powder for the hair was henceforth to be abandoned  vessels were now continually arriving from algeciras with troops and stores and on the 26th the spaniards began to form a camp on the plain below san roque three miles from the garrison this increased in size daily as fresh regiments arrived by land  orders were now issued that all horses in the garrison except those whose owners had a store of at least one thousand pounds of grain were either to be shot or turned out through the gates  there was much excitement when two dutch vessels laden with rice and dried fruit made their way in at night through the enemys cruisers their cargoes were purchased for the troops and these vessels and a venetian that had also got through carried off with them a large number of jewish genoese and other traders with their families to ports in barbary or portugal indeed from this time every vessel that went out carried away some of the inhabitants  the position of these poor people was indeed serious the standing order on the rock was that every inhabitant even in time of peace should have in store six months provisions but the order had never been enforced and few of them had any supplies of consequence as they could not expect to be supplied from the garrison stores the greater number had no resource but to leave the place some however who were better provided obtained leave to erect wooden huts at the southern end of the rock so as to have a place of shelter to remove to in case the enemy bombarded the town  the spaniards had by this time mounted their cannon in forts st philip and st barbara vast quantities of stores were landed at point mala at the end of the bay some fifteen thousand men were under canvas in their camp and strong parties were constantly employed in erecting works near their forts the garrison on their side were continually strengthening and adding to their batteries erecting palisades and traverses filling the magazines in the works and preparing for an attack and on the 11th of september some of the guns were opened upon the enemys working parties and for a time compelled them to desist  from the upper batteries on the rock a complete view was obtainable of all the enemys operations and as they were seen to be raising mortar batteries preparations were made to diminish the effects of a bombardment of the town for this purpose the pavement of the streets was removed and the ground ploughed up the towers and most conspicuous buildings taken down and traverses carried across the streets to permit communications to be carried on  early in october the engineers and artillery managed with immense labour to mount a gun on the summit of the rock and as from this point an almost birdseye view was obtained of the spanish works the fire of the gun annoyed them greatly at their work this was maintained however steadily but in spite of this interference with their operations the spaniards on the 20th of october opened thirtyfive embrasures in three batteries in a line between their two forts  provisions of every kind were now becoming very dear fresh meat was from three to four shillings a pound chickens twelve shillings a couple ducks from fourteen to eighteen fish was equally dear and vegetables hardly to be bought at any price flour was running very short and rice was served out instead of it  on the 14th of november the privateer buck armed with twentyfour 9 pounders was seen making into the bay two spanish ships of the line a frigate two xebecs and twentyone small craft set out to intercept her the cutterseeing a whole spanish squadron coming outtacked and stood across towards the barbary shore pursued by the spaniards the wind was from the west but the cutter lying close hauled was able just to stem the current and hold her position while the spaniards being square rigged and so unable to stand near the wind drifted bodily away to leeward with the current but the two menofwar perceiving what was happening managed to make back into the bay  as soon as the privateer saw the rest of the squadron drift away to leeward she again headed for the rock the spanish admiral barcelo in a seventyfour gun ship endeavoured to cut her offfiring two broadsides of grape and round shot at herbut with the other manofwar was compelled to retire by the batteries at europa and the cutter made her way in triumphantly insultingly returning the spanish admirals fire with her two little stern guns the spanish menofwar drifted away after their small craft and thus for the time the port was open again thanks to the pluck of the little privateerwhich had it was found on her arrival been some time at sea and simply came in to get provisions  as it could be seen from the african coast that the port was again open two or three small craft came across with bullocks and sheep  four days laterthe wind veering round to the southwardadmiral barcelo with his fleet returned to the bay and the blockade was renewed  already captain ohalloran and his wife had the most ample reasons for congratulating themselves that they had taken dr burkes advice in the matter of vegetables and fowls the little garden on the roof was the envy of all carries female friendsmany of whom indeed began imitations of it on a small scale under the hot sun and with careful watering everything made astonishing progress the cutting of the mustard and cress had of course begun in little more than a week from the time when the garden had been completed and the seeds sown the radishes were fit for pulling three weeks later and as constant successions were sown they had been amply supplied with an abundance of salad and each morning a trader in town came up and took all that they could spareat prices that would before the siege began have appeared fabulous  along the edge of the parapet and trailing over almost to the groundcovering the house in a bower of rich green foliagethe melons cucumbers and pumpkins blossomed and fruited luxuriantly and for these prices were obtained as high as those that the fruit would fetch in covent garden when out of season but as melons cucumbers and pumpkins alike produce great quantities of seed by the end of the year they were being grown on a considerable scale by all who possessed any facilities for cultivating them  later on indeed the governorhearing from the principal medical officer how successful captain ohalloran had beenissued an order recommending all inhabitants to grow vegetables and granting them every facility for so doing all who chose to do so were allowed to fence in any little patches of earth they could discover among the rocks or on unused ground and it was not long before the poorer inhabitants spent much of their time in collecting earth and establishing little garden plots or in doing so for persons who could afford to pay for their labour  the poultry venture was equally satisfactory already a considerable piece of rough and rocky ground next to the garden had been enclosed thereby affording a much larger run for the fowls and enabling a considerable portion of the garden to be devoted to the young broods the damaged biscuits had been sold at a few shillings a ton and at this price captain ohalloran had bought the whole of the condemned lotamounting to about ten tonsand there was consequently an ample supply of food for them for an almost indefinite time after supplying the house amply there were at least a hundred eggs a day to sell and carrie who now took immense interest in the poultry yard calculated that they could dispose of ten couple a week and still keep up their number from the young broods  the only thing you have to be afraid of is disease mrs ohalloran said the doctor who was her greatest adviser but there is little risk of that besides you have only to hire one or two lads of ten or twelve years old and then you can put them out when you like from the farther inclosure and let them wander about  but people dont generally watch fowls mrs ohalloran said surely they would come back at night to roost  i have no doubt they would when chickens are well fed they can be trusted to find their way home at night but you must remember that they are worth from twelve to fourteen shillings a couple and what with the natives and what with soldiers off duty you would find that a good many would not turn up at all unless they were watched a couple of boys at sixpence a day each would keep them from straying too far and prevent their being stolen and would relieve you of a lot of anxiety about them  so after this the fowls were turned out on to the rock where they wandered about narrowly watched by two native boys and were able to gather no small store of sustenance from the insects they found among the rocks or on the low shrubs that grew among them  bob had after his return from his cruise fallen into his former habits spending two hours every morning with don diaz and reading for an hour or two in the evening with the doctor it was now cool enough for exercise and enjoyment in the day and there were few afternoons when he did not climb up to the top of the rock and watch the spanish soldiers labouring at their batteries and wondering when they were going to begin to do something  occasionally they obtained news of what was passing in the enemys lines and the spaniards were equally well informed of what was going on in the fortress for desertions from both sides were not infrequent sometimes a soldier with the working parties out in the neutral ground would steal away and make for the spanish lines pursued by a musketry fire from his comrades and saluted perhaps with a round or two of shot from the batteries above but more frequently they made their escape from the back of the rock letting themselves down by ropes although at least half the number who made the attempt were dashed to pieces among the precipices  the majority of the deserters belonged to the hanoverian regiments but a good many british soldiers also deserted in all cases these were reckless men who having been punished for some offence or other preferred risking death to remaining in the garrison some were caught in the attempt while several by getting into places where they could neither descend further nor return were compelled at last by hunger and thirst to shout for assistancepreferring death by hanging to the slower agony of thirst  the deserters from the spanish lines principally belonged to the walloon regiments in the spanish service or to regiments from biscaya and other northern provinces the troops were raised on the principle of our own militia and objected strongly to service outside their own provinces and it was this discontent that gave rise to their desertions to us some of them made their way at night from the works where they were employed through the lines of sentries others took to the water either beyond fort barbara or at the head of the bay and reached our lines by swimming  bob heartily congratulated himself when he heard of the fate of some of the deserters who tried to make their way down at the back of the rock that he and jim sankey had not carried out their scheme of descending there in search of birds by this time he had come to know most of the young officers of the garrison and although the time passed without any marked events he had plenty of occupation and amusement sometimes they would get up fishing parties and although they could not venture very far from the rock on account of the enemys galleys and rowboats they had a good deal of sport and fish were welcome additions to the food which consisted principally of salt rationsfor bob very soon tired of a diet of chicken  there were some very heavy rains in the last week of the year these they learned from deserters greatly damaged the enemys linesfilling their trenches and washing down their banks one advantage was that a great quantity of wood cork and other floating rubbish was washed down by the rain into the two rivers that fell into the bay and as the wind was from the south this was all blown over towards the rock where it was collected by boats affording a most welcome supply of fuel which had been for some time extremely scarce  on the 8th of january a neapolitan polacre was driven in under the guns by the wind from the other side of the bay and was obliged to drop anchor six thousand bushels of barley were found on board her which was of inestimable value to the inhabitants who were now suffering extremely as were also the wives and children of the soldiers whose rationsscanty for onewere wholly insufficient for the wants of a family fowls had now risen to eighteen shillings a couple eggs were six pence each and small cabbages fetched eighteen pence  on the 12th the enemy fired ten shots into the town from fort saint philip causing a panic among the inhabitants who at once began to remove to their huts at the other end of the rock a woman was wounded by a splinter of stone from one of the houses being the first casualty that had taken place through the siege the next day the admiral gave orders to the menofwar that they should be in readiness in case a convoy appeared to afford protection to any ships that might attempt to come in this order caused great joy among the garrison and inhabitants as it seemed to signify that the governor had received information in some manner that a convoy was on its way out to relieve the town  two days later a brig that was seen passing through the straits to the east suddenly changed her course and made for the rock and although the enemy tried to cut her off she succeeded in getting into port the welcome news soon spread that the brig was one of a large convoy that had sailed late in december for the relief of the town she had parted company with the others in the bay of biscay and on her way had seen a spanish squadron off cadiz which was supposed to be watching for the convoy this caused much anxiety but on the 16th a brig laden with flour arrived with the news that sir george rodney had captured off the coast of portugal six spanish frigates with seventeen merchantmen on their way from bilbao to cadiz and that he had with him a fleet of twentyone sail of the line and a large convoy of merchantmen and transports  the next day one of the prizes came in and the midshipman in charge of her reported that when he had left the convoy on the previous day a battle was going on between the british fleet and the spanish squadron late in the evening the convoy was in sight and the apollo frigate and one or two merchantmen got in after dark with the news that the spaniards had been completely defeatedtheir admirals flagship with three others captured one blown up in the engagement another driven ashore and the rest dispersed  the preparations for relieving the town had been so well concealed that the spaniards had believed that the british menofwar were destined for the west indies and had thought that the merchantmen would have fallen easy prizes to their squadron which consisted of eleven menofwar    chapter 13 oranges and lemons   there was great anxiety in gibraltar that night for the wind was very light and from the wrong direction and in the morning it was seen that the greater portion of the convoy had drifted far away to the east soon after noon however the edgar managed to get in with the spanish admirals flagshipthe phoenix of eighty gunsand in the evening the prince george with eleven or twelve ships worked in round europa point but admiral rodney with the main body of the fleet and the prizes was forced to anchor off marbellaa spanish townfifteen leagues east of gibraltar it was not until seven or eight days later that the whole of the fleet and convoy arrived in the port  on the 29th a transport came in with the 2nd battalion of the 73rd regiment with 944 rank and file a large number of heavy cannon from the prizes were landed and several hundreds of barrels of powder in addition to those brought out with the convoy great stores of salt provisions and supplies of flour had been brought out but unfortunately little could be done towards providing the garrison with a supply of fresh meat had admiral rodney been able to remain with his fleet at gibraltar supplies could have been brought across from the african coast but the british fleet was required elsewhere and the relief afforded was a temporary one the garrison was however relieved by a large number of the soldiers wives and children being put on board the merchantmen and sent home to england many of the poor inhabitants were also taken either to barbary or portugal  while the fleet was in port the spanish blockading squadron was moored close under the guns of algeciras and booms were laid round them to prevent their being attacked by the boats of the british fleet an opportunity was taken of the presence of the spanish admiral in gibraltar to arrange for an exchange of prisoners and on the 13th of february the fleet sailed away and the blockade was renewed by the spaniards  after the departure of the fleet many months passed monotonously the enemy were ever increasing and strengthening their works which now mounted a great number of cannon but beyond an occasional interchange of a few shots hostilities were carried on languidly the enemy made two endeavours to burn the british vessels anchored under the guns of the batteries by sending fire ships down upon them but the crews of the ships of war manned the boats and going out to meet them towed them ashore where they burned out without doing damage and the hulls being broken up afforded a welcome supply of fuel  the want of fresh meat and vegetables operated disastrously upon the garrison even before the arrival of the relieving fleet scurvy had shown itself and its ravages continued and extended as months went on the hospitals became crowded with sufferersa third of the force being unfit for any dutywhile there were few but were more or less affected by it  as soon as it became severe captain ohalloran and his wife decided to sell no more vegetables but sent the whole of their supply beyond what was needed for their personal consumption to the hospitals  during these eight months only a few small craft had managed to elude the vigilance of the enemys cruisers and frequently foe many weeks at a time no news of any kind from without reached the besieged the small supplies of fresh meat that had during the early part of the siege been brought across in small craft from barbary had for some time ceased altogether for the moors of tangiers had under pressure of the spaniards broken off their alliance with us and joined them and in consequence not only did supplies cease to arrive but english vessels entering the straits were no longer able to anchor as they had before done under the guns of the moorish batteries for protection from the spanish cruisers  several times there were discussions between bob his sister and captain ohalloran as to whether it would not be better for him to take the first opportunity that offered of returning to england their argument was that he was wasting his time but to this he would not at all agree  i am no more wasting it here than if i were in philpot lane he said it will be plenty of time for me to begin to learn the routine of the business when i am two or three and twenty uncle calculated i should be four years abroad learning the languages and studying wines well i can study wines at any time besides after all it is the agents out here that choose them i can speak spanish now like a native and there is nothing further to be done in that way i have given up lessons now with the doctor but i get plenty of books from the garrison library and keep up my reading as for society we have twenty times as much here with the officers and their families as i should have in london and i really dont see there would be any advantage whatever in my going back  something must be done here some day and after all the siege does not make much difference in any way except that we dont get fresh meat for dinner everything goes on just the same only i suppose in peace time we should make excursions sometimes into spain the only difference i can make out is that i am able to be more useful to you now with the garden and poultry than i could have been if there had been no siege  there was indeed no lack of society the ohallorans was perhaps the most popular house on the rock they were making quite a large income from their poultry and spent it freely presents of eggs chicken and vegetables were constantly being sent to all their friends where there was any sickness in the family and as even at the high prices prevailing they were able to purchase supplies of wine and such other luxuries as were obtainable they kept almost open house and twice a week had regular gatherings with music and the suppers were vastly more appreciated by their guests than is usually the case at such entertainments  early in september when scurvy was still raging the doctor was one day lamenting the impossibility of obtaining oranges and lemons  it makes ones heart ache he said to see the children suffer it is bad enough that strong men should be scarcely able to crawl about but soldiers must take their chances whether they come from shot or from scurvy but it is lamentable to see the children fading away we have tried everythingacids and drugs of all sortsbut nothing does any good as i told you i saw the scurvy on the whaling trip i went and i am convinced that nothing but lemon juice or an absolutely unlimited amount of vegetables will do any good  a week previously a small privateer had come in with some mailbags which she had brought on from lisbon among them was a letter to bob from the owners of the antelope it had been written months before after the arrival of the brig and her two prizes in england it said that the two vessels and their cargoes had been sold and the prizemoney divided and that his share amounted to three hundred and thirtytwo pounds for which sum an order upon a firm of merchants at gibraltar was inclosed the writers also said that after consultation with captain lockett from whom they had heard of the valuable services he had rendered the owners of the antelope had decidedas a very small mark of their appreciation and gratitudeto present him with a service of plate to the value of five hundred pounds and in such form as he might prefer on his return to england  he had said nothing to his sister of this letter as his intention was to surprise her with some present but the doctors words now determined him to carry into effect an idea that had before occurred to him upon seeing so many sickly children among the families of the officers of their acquaintance  look here doctor he said i mean to go out and try and get a few boxes of oranges and lemons but mind nobody but you and i must know anything about it  how on earth do you mean to do it bob  well i have not settled yet but there cant be any difficulty about getting out i might go down to the old mole and swim from there to the head of the bay or i might get some of the fishermen to go round the point and land me to the east well beyond the spanish lines  you couldnt do that bob there is too sharp a lookout kept on the batteries no craft is allowed to go any distance from the rock as they are afraid of the spaniards learning the state to which we are reduced by illness if you did swim to the head of the bay as you talk about you would be certain to be captured at once by the spaniards and in that case you would as likely as not be shot as a spy  still deserters do get out you know doctor there is scarcely a week that two or three dont manage to get away i mean to try anyhow if you like to help me of course it will make it easier if not i shall try by myself  gerald and your sister would never forgive me if anything happened to you bob  there is no occasion for them to know anything about it anyhow i shall say nothing to them i shall leave a note behind me saying that i am going to make an attempt to get out and bring back a boat full of oranges and lemons i am past seventeen now and am old enough to act for myself i dont think if the thing is managed properly there is any particular risk about it i will think it over by tomorrow and tell you what plan i have fixed on  on the following day bob told the doctor that there were two plans  the first is to be lowered by a rope down at the back of the rock that is ever so much the simplest of course there is no difficulty about it if the rope is long enough some of the deserters have failed because the rope has been too short but i should take care to get one long enough the only fear is the sentries i know that there are lots of them posted about there on purpose to prevent desertion  quite so bob and no one is allowed to go along the paths after dark except on duty  yes  well the other plan is to go out with the party that furnishes the sentries down on the neutral ground choose some dark night manage to get separated from them as they march out and then make for the shore and take to the water of course if one could arrange to have the officer with the party in the secret it would make it easy enough  it might be done that way the doctor said thoughtfully have you quite made up your mind to do this thing bob  i have quite made up my mind to try anyhow  well if you mean to try bob it is just as well that you shouldnt get shot at the start i have just been round to the orderly room our regiment furnishes the pickets on the neutral ground tonight captain antrobus commands the party he is a good fellow and as he is a married man and all four of his children are bad with scurvy he would feel an interest in your attempt  you know him as well as i do if you like i will go with you to his quarters and see what we can do with him  they at once set out  look here antrobus the doctor said after asking that officer to come out for a chat with him if we dont get some lemon juice i am afraid it will go very hard with a lot of the children  yes we have known that for some time doctor  well repton here has made up his mind to try to get out of the place and make his way to malaga and get a boatload of fruit and try to bring it in of course he will go dressed as a native and he speaks spanish well enough to pass anywhere without suspicion so once beyond the lines i dont see much difficulty in his making his way to malaga whether he will get back again is another matter altogether that is his business he has plenty of money to purchase the fruit when he arrives there and to buy a boat and all that sort of thing  the difficulty is in getting out now nobody is going to know how he does this except our three selves  but why do you come to me burke  because you command the guard tonight on the neutral ground what he proposes is that he should put on a soldiers greatcoat and cap and take a firelock and in the dark fall in with your party when you get well out on the neutral ground he could either slip away and take his chance or what would be better still he might be in the party you take forward to post as sentries and you could take him along with you so that he would go with you as far as the shore and could then slip away come back a bit so as to be out of sight of the farthest sentry and then take to the water  he can swim like a fish and what current there is will be with him so that before it began to be light he could land two or three miles beyond the spanish lines he is going to leave a note behind for ohalloran saying he has left but no one will know whether he got down at the back of the rock or swam across the bay or how he has gone  i have tried to dissuade him but he has made up his mind to try it and seeing thatif he succeedsit may save the lives of scores of children i really cannot refuse to help him  well i dont know captain antrobus said there certainly does not seem much risk in his going out as you say i should get a tremendous wigging no doubt if he is discovered and it was known that i had a hand in it but i would not mind risking that for the sake of the children  but dont take a firelock repton the sergeants would be sure to notice that there was an extra man you had better join us just as we set out i will say a word or two to you then do you follow on in the dark the men will suppose you are one of the drummers i am taking with me to serve as a messenger or something of that sort that way you can follow close behind me while i am posting the sentries after leaving the main body at the guardhouse after posting the last man at the seashore i can turn off with you for a few yards as if giving you an order  then i will go back and stay for a time with the last sentry who will naturally think that the drummer has been sent back to the guardhouse i will recommend him to be vigilant and keep by him for some time till i am pretty sure you have taken to the water and swam past so that if the sentry should hear a splash or anything i can say it can only be a fish and that at any rate it would not do to give an alarm as it cannot be anything of consequence  you see you dont belong to the garrison and it is no question of assisting a deserter to escape anyhow i will do it  thanking captain antrobus greatly for his promise of assistance bob went off into the town where he bought a suit of spanish clothes such as would be appropriate for a small farmer or trader he then presented his letter of credit at the merchants and drew a hundred pounds which he obtained in spanish gold this money and the clothes he put in an oilskin bag of which the mouth was securely closed this he left at the doctors  as soon as it became dark he went down again the doctor had a greatcoat and hat in readiness for himthere being plenty of effects of men who had died in the hospitaland as soon as bob had put them on walked acrosswith bob following himto the spot where captain antrobus company were falling in just as they were about to march the doctor went up to the captain who after a word or two with him said to bob in a voice loud enough to be heard by the noncommissioned officer close to him  well you will keep by me  the night was a dark one and the party made their way down to the gate where the passwords were exchanged and the company then moved along by the narrow pathway between the artificial inundation and the foot of the rock they continued their way until they arrived at the building that served as the main guard of the outlying pickets here twothirds of the company were left and the captain led the others out an officer belonging to the regiment whose men he was relieving accompanying him as the sentries were posted the men relieved fell in under the orders of their officer and as soon as the last had been relieved they marched back to the guardhouse  a minute later captain antrobus turned to bob  you need not wait he said go back to the guardhouse mind how you go  bob saluted and turned off leaving the officer standing by the sentry he went some distance back then walked down the sand to the waters edge and waded noiselessly into the water the oilskin bag was he knew buoyant enough to give him ample support in the water  when he was breast deep he let his uniform cloak slip off his shoulders allowed his shoes to sink to the bottom and his threecornered hat to float away the doctor had advised him to do this  if you leave the things at the edge of the water bob it will be thought that somebody has deserted and then there will be a lot of questions and inquiries you had better take them well out into the sea with you and then let them go they will sink and drift along under water and if they are ever thrown up it will be far beyond our lines in that way as the whole of the guard will answer to their names when the roll is called tomorrow no one will ever give a thought to the drummer who fell in at the last moment or if one of them does think of it he will suppose that the captain sent him into the town with a report  the bag would have been a great encumbrance had bob wanted to swim fast as it was he simply placed his hands upon it and struck out with his feet making straight out from the shore this he did for some ten minutes and then being certain that he was far beyond the sight of anyone on shore he turned and as nearly as he could followed the line of the coast the voices of the sentries calling to each other came across the sea and he could make out a light or two in the great fort at the waters edge  it was easy work the water was as nearly as possible the temperature of his body and he felt that he could remain for any time in it without inconvenience the lights in the fort served as a mark by which he could note his progress and an hour after starting he was well abreast of them and knew that the current must be helping him more than he had expected it would do  another hour and he began to swim shorewards as the current might for aught he knew be drifting him somewhat out into the bay when he was able to make out the dark line ahead of him he again resumed his former course it was just eight oclock when the guard had passed through the gate he had started half an hour later he swam what seemed to him a very long time but he had no means of telling how the time passed  when he thought it must be somewhere about twelve oclock he made for the shore he was sure that by this time he must be at least three miles beyond the fort and as the spanish camps lay principally near san roque at the head of the bay and there were no tents anywhere by the seashore he felt sure that he could land now without the slightest danger  here then he waded ashore stripped tied his clothes in a bundle waded a short distance back again and dropped them in the sea then he returned took up the bag and carried it up the sandy beach opening it he dressed himself in the complete set of clothes he had brought with him put on the spanish shoes and round turnedup hat placed his money in his pocket scraped a shallow hole in the sand put the bag in it and covered it and then started walking briskly along on the flat ground beyond the sand hills he kept on until he saw the first faint light in the sky then he sat down among some bushes until it was light enough for him to distinguish the features of the country  inland the ground rose rapidly into hillsin many places covered with woodand half an hours walking took him to one of these looking back he could see the rock rising as he judged from twelve to fourteen miles away he soon found a place with some thick undergrowth and entering this lay down and was soon sound asleep  when he woke it was already late in the afternoon he had brought with him in the bag some biscuits and hardboiled eggs and of a portion of these he made a hearty meal then he pushed up over the hill until after an hours walking he saw a road before him this was all he wanted and he sat down and waited until it became dark a battalion of infantry passed along as he sat there marching towards gibraltar two or three long lines of laden carts passed by in the same direction  he had consulted a map before starting and knew that the distance to malaga was more than twenty leagues and that the first place of any importance was estepona about eight leagues from gibraltar and that before the siege a large proportion of the supplies of fruit and vegetables were brought to gibraltar from this town starting as soon as it became dark he passed through estepona at about ten oclock looked in at a wine shop and sat down to a pint of wine and some bread and then continued his journey until taking it quietly he was in sight of marbella  he slept in a grove of trees until daylight and then entered the town which was charmingly situated among orange groves going into a fondaor tavernhe called for breakfast when he had eaten this he leisurely strolled down to the port and taking his seat on a block of stone on the pier watched the boats as while walking down from the fonda he had passed several shops with oranges and lemons it seemed to him that it would in some respects be better for him to get the fruit here instead of going on to malaga  in the first place the distance to return was but half that from malaga and in the second it would probably be easier to get out from a quiet little port like this than from a large town like malaga the question which puzzled him was how was he to get his oranges on board where could he reasonably be going to take them  presently a sailor came up and began to chat with him  are you wanting a boat senor  i have not made up my mind yet he said i suppose you are busy here now  no the times are dull usually we do a good deal of trade with gibraltar but at present that is all stopped it is hard on us but when we turn out the english hereticos i hope we shall have better times than ever but who can say they have plenty of money the english and are ready to pay good prices for everything  but i suppose you take things to our camp  the fisherman shook his head  they get their supplies direct from malaga by sea there are many carts go through here of course but the roads are heavy and it is cheaper to send things by water if our camp had been on the seashore instead of at san roque we might have taken fish and fruit to them but it is a long way across and of course in small boats we cannot go round the great rock and run the risk of being shot at or taken prisoners  no there is nothing for us to do here now but to carry what fish and fruit we do not want at marbella across to malaga and we get poor prices there to what we used to get at gibraltar and no chance of turning an honest penny by smuggling away a few pounds of tobacco as we come back there was as much profit in that as there was in the sale of the goods but one had to be very sharp for they were always suspicious of boats coming back from there and used to search us so that you would think one could not bring so much as a cigar on shore but you know there are ways of managing things  are you thinking of going across to malaga senor  well i have a little business there i want to see how the new wines are selling and whether it will be better for me to sell mine now or to keep them in my cellars for a few months i am in no hurry tomorrow is as good as today if there had been a boat going across i might have taken a passage that way instead of riding  i dont know senor there was a man asking an hour ago if anyone was going he was wanting to take a few boxes of fruit across but he did not care about hiring my boat for himself that you see was reasonable enough but if the senor wished to go too it might be managed if you took the boat between you i would carry you cheaply if you would be willing to wait for an hour or two so that i could go round to the other fishermen and get a few dozen fish from one and a few dozen from another to sell for them over there that is the way we manage  i could not very well go until the afternoon bob said  if you do not go until the afternoon senor it would be as well not to start until evening the wind is very light and we should have to row if you start in the afternoon we should get to malaga at two or three oclock in the morning when everyone was asleep but if you were to start in the evening we should be in in reasonable time just as the people were coming into the markets that would suit us for the sale of our fish and the man with his fruit the nights are warm and with a cloak and an old sail to keep off the night dew the voyage would be more pleasant than in the heat of the day  that would do for me very well bob said nothing could be better what charge would you make for taking me across and bringing me back tomorrow  at what time would you want to return senor  it would matter little i should be done with my business by noon but i should be in no hurry i could wait until evening if that would suit you better  and we might bring other passengers back and any cargo we might pick up  yes so that you do not fill the boat so full that there would be no room for me to stretch my legs  would the senor think four dollars too much there will be my brother and myself and it will be a long row  it is dear bob said decidedly but i will give you three dollars and if everything passes to my satisfaction maybe i will make up the other dollar  agreed senor i will see if i can find the man who was here asking for a boat for his fruit  i will come back in an hour and see bob said getting up and walking leisurely away  the fisherman was waiting for him  i cant find the man senor though i have searched all through the town he must have gone off to his farm again  that is bad how much did you reckon upon making from him  i should have got another three dollars from him  well i tell you what bob said i have a good many friends and people are always pleased with a present from the country a box of fruit from marbella is always welcome for their flavour is considered excellent it is well to throw a little fish to catch a big one and a present is like oil on the wheels of business how many boxes of fruit will your boat carry i suppose you could take twenty and still have room to row  thirty sir that is the boat and he pointed to one moored against the quay  she was about twenty feet long with a mast carrying a goodsized sail  very well then i will hire the boat for myself i will give you six dollars and another dollar for drink money if all goes pleasantly you must be ready to come back tomorrow evening or the first thing next morning if it should suit you to stay till then you can carry what fish you can get to malaga and may take in a return cargo if you can get one that will be extra profit for yourselves but you and your brother must agree to carry down the boxes of fruit and put them on board here i am not going to pay porters for that  at what time will you start  shall we say six oclock senor  that will suit me very well you can come up with me now and bring the fruit down and put it on board or i will be down here at five oclock and you can go up and get it then  the man thought for a moment  i would rather do it now senor if it makes no difference to you then we can have our evening meals at home with our families and come straight down here and start  very well fetch your brother and we will set about the matter at once as i have to go out to my farm and make some arrangements and tell them they may not see me again for three days  in two or three minutes the fisherman came back with his brother bob went with them to a trader in fruit and bought twenty boxes of lemons and ten of oranges and saw them carried down and put on board then he handed a dollar to the boatman  get a loaf of white bread and a nice piece of cooked meat and a couple of bottles of good wine and put them on board we shall be hungry before morning i will be here at a few minutes before six  highly satisfied with the good fortune that had enabled him to get the fruit on board without the slightest difficulty bob returned into the town it was but eleven oclock now sohaving had but a short sleep the night before and no prospect of sleep the next nighthe walked a mile along the road by the sea then turned off among the sand hills and slept till four in the afternoon after which he returned to marbella and partook of a hearty meal  having finished this he strolled out and was not long in discovering a shop where arms were sold here he bought a brace of long heavy pistols and two smaller ones with powder and bullets and also a long knife they were all made into a parcel together and on leaving the shop he bought a small bag then he went a short distance out of the town again carefully loaded the four pistols and placed them and the knife in the bag  as he went back the thought struck him that the voyage might probably last longer than they expected and buying a basket he stored it with another piece of meat three loaves and two more bottles of wine and gave it to a boy to carry down to the boat  it was a few minutes before six when he got there the two sailors were standing by the boat and a considerable pile of fish in the bow showed that they had been successful in getting a consignment from the other fishermen of the port they looked surprised at the second supply of provisions  why senor we have got the things you ordered  yes yes i do not doubt that but i have heard before now of headwinds springing up and boats not being able to make their passage and being blown off land and i am not fond of fasting i daresay you wont mind eating tomorrow anything that is not consumed by the time we reach port  we will undertake that senor the man said laughing highly satisfied at the liberality of their employer  is there wind enough for the sail bob asked as he stepped into the stern of the boat  it is very light senor but i daresay it will help us a bit we shall get out the oars  i will take the helm if you sail bob said you can tell me which side to push it it will be an amusement and keep me awake  the sun was just setting as they started there was scarcely a breath of wind the light breeze that had been blowing during the day had dropped with the sun and the evening breeze had not yet sprung up the two fishermen rowed and the boat went slowly through the water for the men knew that they had a long row before them and were by no means inclined to exert themselvesespecially as they hoped that in a short time they would get wind enough to take them on their way without the oars  bob chatted with them until it became dark as soon as he was perfectly sure that the boat could not be seen from the land he quietly opened his bag and changed the conversation  my men he said i wonder that you are content with earning small wages here when you could get a lot of money by making a trip occasionally round to gibraltar with fruit it would be quite easy for you could keep well out from the coast till it became dark and then row in close under the rock and keep along round the point and into the town without the least risk of being seen by any of our cruisers you talked about making money by smuggling in tobacco from there but that is nothing to what you could get by taking fruit into gibraltar these oranges cost a dollar and a half a box and they would fetch ten dollars a box easily there indeed i think they would fetch twenty dollars a box why that would give a profit on the thirty boxes of six or seven hundred dollars just think of that  would they give such a price as that the men said in surprise  they would they are suffering from want of fresh meat and there is illness among them and oranges and lemons are the things to cure them it is all very well for men to suffer but no one wants women and children to do so and it would be the act of good christians to relieve them besides making as much money in one little short trip as you would make in a years work  that is true the men said but we might be sunk by the guns going there and we should certainly be hung when we got back if they found out where we had been  why should they find out bob asked you would put out directly it got dark and row round close under the rock and then make out to sea and in the morning you would be somewhere off marbella but eight or ten miles out with your fishing nets down and who is to know that you have been to gibraltar  the men were silent the prospect certainly seemed a tempting one bob allowed them to turn it over in their minds for a few minutes and then spoke again  now my men i will speak to you frankly it is just this business that i am bent upon now i have come out from gibraltar to do a little trade in fruit it is sad to see women and children suffering and there is as i told you lots of money to be made out of it now i will make you a fair offer you put the boats head round now and sail for gibraltar if the wind helps us a bit we shall be off the rock by daylight when we get there i will give you a hundred dollars apiece  it is too much risk one of the men said after a long pause  there is no risk at all bob said firmly you will get in there tomorrow and you can start again as soon as it becomes dark and in the morning you will be able to sail into marbella and who is to know that you havent been across to malaga as you intended  i tell you what i will give you another fifty dollars for your fish or you can sell them there yourselvesthey will fetch you quite that  the men still hesitated and spoke together in a low voice  look here men bob said as he took the two heavy pistols from his bag i have come out from the rock to do this and i am going to do it the question is which do you chooseto earn two hundred and fifty dollars for a couple of days work or to be shot and thrown overboard this boat is going there whether you go in her or not i dont want to hurt youi would rather pay the two hundred and fifty dollarsbut that fruit may save the lives of many women and little children and i am bound to do it  you can make another trip or not just as you please now i think you will be very foolish if you dont agree for you will make three times as much as i offer you every thirty boxes of fruit that you can take in there but the boat has got to go there now and you have got to take your choice whether you go in her or not  how do we know that you will pay us the money when we get there one of the spaniards asked  bob put his hand into his pocket  there he said there are twenty gold pieces that is a hundred dollars that is a proof i mean what i say put them into your pockets you shall have the rest when you get there but mind no nonsense no attempts at treachery if i see the smallest sign of that i will shoot you down without hesitation  now row and ill put her head round  the men said a few words in an undertone to each other  you guarantee that no harm shall come to us at gibraltar and that we shall be allowed to leave again  yes i promise you that faithfully  now you have got to row a good bit harder than you have been rowing up till now we must be past fort santa barbara before daylight  the boats head was round by this time and the men began to row steadily at present they hardly knew whether they were satisfied or not two hundred and fifty dollars was to them an enormous sum but the risk was great it was not that they feared that any suspicion would fall upon them on their return they had often smuggled tobacco from gibraltar and had no high opinion of the acuteness of the authorities what really alarmed them was the fear of being sunk either by the spanish or british guns however they saw that for the present at any rate they had no option but to obey the orders of a passenger possessed of such powerful arguments as those he held in his hands    chapter 14 a welcome cargo   after the men had been rowing for an hour bob felt a slight breeze springing up from off the land and said  you may as well get up the sail it will help you along a bit  the sail was a large one for the size of the boat and bob felt a distinct increase in her pace as soon as the men began to row again he could make out the line of the hills against the sky and had therefore no difficulty in keeping the course they were soon back opposite marbella the lights of which he could clearly make out little by little the breeze gathered strength and the rowers had comparatively easy work of it as the boat slipped away lightly before the wind  what do you make ittwelve leagues from marbella to the rock  about that the man replied if the wind holds like this we shall not be very far from the rock by daylight we are going along about a league an hour  well stretch out to it lads for your own sakes i have no fear of a shot from santa barbara the only thing i am afraid of is that we should be seen by any spanish boats that may be cruising round that side before we get under shelter of the guns of the rock  the fishermen needed no warning as to the danger of being caught and bent again more strongly to their oars after they had rowed two hours longer bob told them to pull the oars in  you had better have a quarter of an hours rest and some supper and a bottle of wine he said you have got your own basket forward i will take mine out of this by my side  as their passenger had paid for it the boatmen had got a very superior wine to that they ordinarily drank after eating their supperbread meat and onionsand drinking half a bottle of wine each they were disposed to look at the situation in a more cheerful light two hundred and fifty dollars was certainly well worth running a little risk for why it would make them independent of bad weather and they would be able to freight their boat themselves with fish or fruit and to trade on their own account  they were surprised at the enterprise of this young trader whom they supposed to be a native of gibraltar for bob thought that it was as well that they should remain in ignorance of his nationality as they might have felt more strongly that they were rendering assistance to the enemy did they know that he was english  hour after hour passed the wind did not increase in force nor on the other hand did it die away there was just enough to keep the sail full and take much of the weight of the boat off the arms of the rowers the men knowing the outline of the hills were able to tell what progress they were making and told bob when they were passing estepona two or three times there was a short pause for the men to have a draught of wine with that exception they rowed on steadily  it will be a near thing senor one of them said towards morning the current counts for three or four miles against us if it hadnt been for that we should certainly have done it as it is it is doubtful  i think we are about a mile off shore are we not bob asked that is about the distance i want to keep if there are any cruisers they are sure to be further out than that and as for santa barbara if they see us and take the trouble to fire at us there is not much chance of their hitting such a mark as this a mile away besides almost all their guns are on the land side  the men made no reply to them the thought of being fired at by big guns was much more alarming than that of being picked up by a cruiser of their own nation although they saw there might be a good deal of difficulty in persuading the authorities that they had taken part perforce in the attempt to get fruit into the beleaguered garrison daylight was just beginning to break when one of the fishermen pointed out a dark mass inshore but somewhat ahead of them  that is santa barbara he said  they had already for some time made out the outline of the rock and bob gazed anxiously seaward but could as yet see no signs of the enemys cruisers  row away lads he said they wont see us for some time and in another half hour we shall be safe  the spaniards bent to their oars with all their strength now from time to time looking anxiously over their shoulders at the fort rapidly the daylight stole across the sky and they were just opposite santa barbara when a gun boomed out and a shot flew over their heads and struck the water a quarter of a mile beyond them with a yell of fear the two spaniards threw themselves at the bottom of the boat  get up you fools bob shouted you will be no safer down there than if you were rowing if a shot strikes her she will be smashed up whether you are rowing or lying down if you stay there it will be an hour before we get out of range of their guns while if you row like men we shall get further and further away every minute and be safe in a quarter of an hour  it was only however after he threatened to shoot them if they did not set to work again that the spaniards resumed their oars but when they did they rowed desperately another shot from the fort struck the water a short distance astern exciting a fresh yell of agony from the men  there you see bob said if you hadnt been sending her faster through the water that would have hit us  ah they are beginning from that sloop out at sea  this was a small craft that bob had made out as the light increased a mile and a half seaward she had changed her course and was heading in their direction  retaining his hold of his pistols bob moved forward put out a spare oar and set to to row shot after shot came from the fort and several from the sloop but a boat at that distance presents but a small mark and although a shot went through the sail none struck her presently a gun boomed out ahead of them high in the air and a shot fell near the sloop which at once hauled her wind and stood out to sea  we have got rid of her bob said and we are a mile and a half from the fort now you can take it easy men they wont waste many more shot upon us  indeed only one more gun was fired by the spaniards and then the boat pursued her course unmolested bob returning to his seat at the helm  they will be on the lookout for us as we go back one of the spaniards said  they wont see you in the dark bob replied besides as likely as not they will think that you are one of the rock fishing boats that has ventured out too far and failed to get back by daylight  once out of reach of the shot from the fort the sailors laid in their oarshaving been rowing for more than ten hoursand the boat glided along quietly at a distance of a few hundred feet from the foot of the cliff  which are you going to do bob asked them take fifty dollars for your fish or sell them for what you can get for them  the fishermen at once said they would take the fifty dollars for although they had collected all that had been brought in by the other fishermenamounting to some five hundred pounds in weightthey could not imagine that fish for which they would not have got more than ten dollarsat the outsideat malaga could sell for fifty at gibraltar  as they rounded europa point there was a hail from above and looking up bob saw captain ohalloran and the doctor  hulloa bob  hulloa bob shouted back and waved his hat  all right bob  all right i have got thirty boxes  hurrah the doctor shouted waving his hat over his head we will meet you at the new mole  that is something like a boy gerald  it is all very well for you captain ohalloran said you are not responsible for him and you are not married to his sister  put yourself in the way of a cannonball gerald and i will be married to her a week afterif she will have me  his companion laughed  it is all very well teddy but it is just as well for you that you did not show your face up at the house during the last three days it is not bob who has been blamed it has been entirely you and me especially you the moment she read his letter she said at once that you were at the bottom of it and that it never would have entered bobs mind to do such a mad thing if you had not put him up to it and of course when i came back from seeing you and said that you admitted that you knew what he was doing it made the case infinitely worse it will be a long time before she takes you into favour again  about an hour the doctor said calmly as soon as she finds that bob has come back again with the fruit and that he has as good as saved the lives of scores of women and children she will be so proud of him that she will greet me as part author of the credit he has gainedthough really as i told you i had nothing to do with it except that when i saw that bob had made up his mind to try whether i helped him or not i thought it best to help him as far as i could to get away  now we must get some porters to carry the boxes up to your house or wherever he wants them sent  ah here is the governor he will be pleased to hear that bob has got safely back  captain ohalloran had when he found bobs letter in his room on the morning after he had left felt it his duty to go to the town majors office to mention his absence and it had been reported to the general who had sent for gerald to inquire about the circumstances of the lads leaving captain ohalloran had assured him that he knew nothing whatever of his intention and that it was only when he found the letter on his table saying that he had made up his mind to get beyond the spanish lines somehow and to bring in a boatload of oranges for the use of the women and children who were suffering from scurvy that he knew his brotherinlaw had any such idea in his mind  it is a very gallant attempt captain ohalloranalthough of course i should not have permitted it to be made had i been aware of his intentions  nor should i sir captain ohalloran said my wife is naturally very much upset  that is natural enough the governor said still she has every reason to be proud of her brother a man could risk his life for no higher object than that for which mr repton has undertaken this expedition  how do you suppose he got away  i have no idea sir he may have got down by ropes from the back of the rockthe way the deserters generally choose  yes but if he got down without breaking his neck he would still have to pass our line of sentries and also through the spaniards  he is a very good swimmer general and may have struck out and landed beyond the spanish forts of course he may have started from the old mole and swam across to the head of the bay he is sure to have thought the matter well out he is very sharp and if anyone could get through i should say bob could he speaks the language like a native  i have heard of him before the governor said smiling captain langton told us of the boys doings when he was away in that privateer brig and how he took in the frigate and was the means of the brig capturing those two valuable prizes and how he had swam on board a spanish sloop of war he said that no officer could have shown greater pluck and coolness  i sincerely hope that no harm will come to him but howeven if he succeeds in getting through the spanish lineshe can manage single handed to get back here in a boat is more than i can see well i sincerely trust that no harm will come to him  as the governor with two or three of his staff now came along captain ohalloran went up to him  i am glad to say sir he said that young repton has just returned and that he has brought in thirty cases of fruit  i am extremely glad to hear it captain ohalloran the governor said warmly when it was reported to me an hour since that the spanish fort and one of their cruisers were firing at a small boat that was making her way in from the east the thought struck me that it might be your brotherinlaw  where is he  he is just coming round to the mole sir doctor burke and myself are going to meet him  i will go down with you the governor said those oranges are worth a thousand pounds a box to the sick  the party reached the mole before the boat came in for after rounding the point she had been becalmed and the fishermen had lowered the sail and betaken themselves to their oars again bob felt a little uncomfortable when as the boat rowed up to the landing stairs he saw general eliott with a group of officers standing at the top he was relieved when on ascending the steps the governor stepped forward and shook him warmly by the hand  i ought to begin by scolding you for breaking out of the fortress without leave but i am too pleased with the success of your venture and too much gratified at the spirit that prompted you to undertake it to say a word captain ohalloran tells me that you have brought in thirty cases of fruit  yes sir i have ten cases of oranges and twenty of lemons i propose with your permission to send half of these up to the hospitals for the use of the sick there the others i intend for the use of the women and children of the garrison and townspeople doctor burke will see for me that they are distributed where they will do most good  well my lad i thank you most cordially for your noble gift to the troops and there is not a man here who will not feel grateful to you for the relief it will afford to the women and children i shall be very glad if you will dine with me today and you can then tell me how you have managed what i thought when i first heard of your absence was a sheer impossibility  captain ohalloran i trust that you and mrs ohalloran will also give me the pleasure of your company at dinner today  if you please sir bob said will you give these two boatmen a pass permitting them to go out after dark tonight i promised them that they should not be detained it is of the greatest importance to them that they should get back before their absence is discovered  certainly the governor said and at once ordered one of the officers of the staff to see that the pass was given and orders issued to the officers of the batteries to allow the boat to pass out in the dark unquestioned  as soon as the governor walked away with his staff bob was heartily greeted by captain ohalloran and the doctor  you have given us a fine fright bob the former said and your sister has been in a desperate way about you however now that you have come back safe i suppose she will forgive you  but what about all those fish are they yours why there must be half a ton of them  no the men say there are five or six hundred pounds  yes they are mine i thought of keeping a few for ourselves and dividing the rest between the ten regiments and sending them up with your compliments to their messes  not with my compliments bob that would be ridiculous send them up with your own compliments it will be a mighty acceptable present but you had better pick out two or three of the finest fish and send them up to the governor  now then let us set to work here are plenty of porters but first of all we had better get ten men from the officer of the guard here and send one off with each of the porters with the fish to the regimentsor the chances are that these baskets will be a good bit lighter by the time they arrive there than when they start i will go and ask the officer while you are getting the fish up here and divided  in a quarter of an hour the ten porters started each with about half a hundredweight and under the charge of a soldier the doctor took charge of the porters with the fifteen boxes of fruit for the various hospitals and thenafter bob had paid the boatmen the two hundred and fifty dollars due to them and had told them they would get the permit to enable them to sail again as soon as it became darkhe and captain ohalloran started for the house with the men in charge of the other fifteen boxes and with one carrying the remaining fishwhich weighed about the same as the other parcels  how did you and the doctor happen to be at europa point gerald bob asked as they went along  the doctor said he felt sure that whenever you did comethat is if you came at allyou would get here somewhere about daylight and he arranged with the officer in charge of the upper battery to send a man down with the news if there was a boat in sight directly he heard that the spaniards were firing at a boat he came over and called me and we went round to the back of the rock we couldnt be sure that it was you from that height but as we could make out the boxes we thought it must be you and so walked down to the point to catch you there  does carrie know that a boat was in sight  no i wouldnt say anything to her about it she had only just dropped off to sleep when i was called she woke up and asked what it was but i said that i supposed i was wanted on duty and she went off again before i was dressed i was glad she did for she hadnt closed her eyes before since you started  carrie was on the terrace when she saw bob and gerald followed by a procession of porters coming up the hill with a cry of joy she ran down into the house and out to meet them  you bad boy she cried as she threw her arms round bobs neck how could you frighten us so it is very cruel and wicked of you bob and i am not going to forgive you though i cant help being glad to see you which is more than you deserve  you mustnt scold him carrie her husband said even the governor didnt scold him and he has thanked him in the name of the whole garrison and he has asked him to dine with him and you and i are to dine there too carrie there is an honour for you but what is better than honour is that there isnt a woman and child on the rock who wont be feeling deeply grateful to bob before the day is over  has he really got some fruit  yes dont you see the boxes carrie  oh i saw something coming along but i didnt see anything clearly but bob what are these boxesoranges  oranges and lemonsfive of oranges and ten of lemonsand there are as many more that have gone up to the hospital for the use of the men  there let us see them taken into the storeroom you can open two of them at once and send manola off with a big basket and tell her to give half a dozen of each with your love to each of the ladies you know the doctor will take charge of the rest and see about their division among all the women on the rock it will be quite a business but he wont mind it  what is all thisfish  well my dear you are to take as much as you want and you are to pick out two or three of the best and send them to the governor with your compliments and the rest you can divide and send out with the fruit to your special friends  but how has bob done it carrie asked quite overwhelmed at the sight of all those welcome stores  ah that he must tell you himself i have no more idea than the man in the moon  it has all been quite simple bob said but see about sending these things off first carrie doctor burke will be here after he has seen the others taken safely to the hospital and i shall have to tell it all over again then  i am very angry with the doctor mrs ohalloran said  then the sooner you get over being angry the better carrie the doctor had nothing whatever to do with my going but when he saw that i had made up my mind to go he helped me and i am extremely obliged to him now you may have an orange for yourself if you are good  that i wont carrie said thanks to our eggs and vegetables we are perfectly well and when there are so many people really in want of the oranges it would be downright wicked to eat them merely because we like them  in a short time manolawith two of the children from downstairs carrying basketsstarted with the presents of fruit and fish to all the ladies of carries acquaintance soon after she had left doctor burke arrived  i was not going to speak to you teddy burke mrs ohalloran said shaking her head at him i had lost confidence in you but with bob back again and all this fruit for the poor creatures who want it i will forgive you  i am glad you have grace enough for that mrs ohalloran it is down on your knees you ought to go to thank me if i had my rights isnt bob a hero and hasnt he received the thanks of the governor and hasnt he saved scores of lives this blessed day and although it is little enough i had to do with it isnt it the thanks of the whole garrison ought to be given me for even the little bit of a share i had in it  we have been waiting for you to come teddy captain ohalloran said to hear bobs story  well then you will have to wait a bit longer the doctor said i have sent orderlies from the hospital to all the regimentsincluding of course the artillery and engineersasking them to send me lists of the numbers of the women and children of the noncommissioned officers and privates and also of officers wives and families and to send with the lists here two orderlies from each regiment with baskets i have been down to the town major and got a list of the number of women and children in the town when we get the returns from the regiments we will reckon up the totals and see how many there will be for each i think that each of the boxes holds about five hundred  the work of counting out the oranges and lemons for the various regiments and the townspeople occupied some time and it was not until the orderlies had started with their supplies that bob sat down to tell his story  nothing could have been easier he said when he finished  it was easy enough as you say bob the doctor said but it required a lot of coolness and presence of mind events certainly turned out fortunately for you but you took advantage of them that is always the point nobody could have done it better and most people would have done worse i have been wondering myself a great deal since you have been gone what plan you could possibly hit on to get the oranges into a boat and how when you had got them in you would manage to get them here it seems all easy enough now you have done it but that is all the more creditable to you for hitting on a plan that worked so well  similar praise was given to bob when he had again to tell his story at the governors  so you managed you say to slip out with the reliefs the governor said  yes sir i had got a military cloak and hat  still it is curious that they did not notice an addition to their party i fancy you must have had a friend there  that general is a point that i would rather not say anything about that is the way that i did go out and when i took to the water i let the coat and hat float away for had they been found it might have been supposed that somebody had deserted  i wish you could have brought in a shipload instead of a boatload of fruit mr repton they will be of immense benefit to the sick but unfortunately there is scarcely a person on the rock that is not more or less affected and if your thirty boxes were multiplied by a hundred it would be none too much for our needs  the oranges and lemons did however for a time have a marked effect in checking the progress of the scurvyespecially among the children who came in for a larger share than that which fell to the sick soldiersbut in another month the condition of those in hospital and indeed of many who still managed to do duty was again pitiable  on the 11th of october however some of the boats of the fleet went out during a fog and boarded a danish craft from malagaladen with oranges and lemonsand brought her in the cargo was at once bought by the governor and distributed  the beneficial effects were immediate cases which had but a few days before appeared hopeless were cured as if by magic and the health of the whole garrison was reestablished heavy rains setting in at the same time the gardensupon which for months great attention had been bestowedcame rapidly into bearing and henceforth throughout the siege the supply of vegetables if not ample for the needs of the garrison and inhabitants was sufficient to prevent scurvy from getting any strong hold again  a few days after the ship with oranges was brought in an orderly came in to captain ohalloran with a message that the governor wished to speak to mr repton bob was out at the time but went up to the castle as soon as he returned and was at once shown in to the governor  illustration bob receives a commission from the governor  mr repton the latter began after the spirit you showed the other day i shall be glad to utilize your services still farther if you are willing  i shall be very glad to be useful in any work upon which you may think fit to employ me sir  i wish to communicate with mr logie at tangiers the governor said it is a month now since we have had any news from him at the time he last wrote he said that the emperor of morocco was manifesting an unfriendly spirit towards us and that he was certainly in close communication with the spaniards and had allowed their ships to take more than one english vessel lying under the guns of the town his own position was he said little better than that of a prisonerfor he was closely watched  he still hoped however to bring the emperor round again to our side as he had for years exercised a considerable influence over him if he would grant him an interview mr logie thought that he might still be able to clear up any doubts of us that the spaniards might have infused in his mind since that letter we have heard nothing from him and we are ignorant how matters stand over there  the matter is important for although while the enemys cruisers are as vigilant as at present there is little hope of our getting fresh meat over from there i am unable to give any directions to such privateers or others as may find their way in here it makes all the difference to them whether the morocco ports are open to them or not until lately when chased they could run in there wait for a brisk east wind and then start after dark and be fairly through the straits before morning  i am very desirous therefore of communicating with mr logie i am also anxious not only about his safety but of that of several english families there among whom are those of some of the officers of the garrison whothinking that they would be perfectly safe in tangiers and avoid the hardships and dangers of the siegedespatched them across the straits by the native craft that came in when first the port was closed  thinking it over it appeared to me that you would be far more fitted than most for this mission if you would accept it you have already shown yourself able to pass as a spaniard and should you find that things have gone badly in tangiers and that the moors have openly joined the spaniards you might be able to get a passage to lisbon in a neutral ship and to return thence in the first privateer or ship of war bound for this port i would of course provide you with a document requesting the officer in command of any such ship to give you a passage should no such neutral ship come along i should trust to you to find your way across to tarifa or algeciras and thence to manage in some way which i must leave to your own ingenuity to make your way in  i do not disguise from you that the commission is a very dangerous as well as an honourable one as were you an englishman detected on spanish soil you would almost certainly be executed as a spy  i am ready to undertake the commission sir and i am much obliged to you for affording me the opportunity of being of service it is irksome for me to remain here in idleness when there are many young officers of my own age doing duty in the batteries as to the risk i am quite prepared to run it it will be exactly such an adventure as i should choose  very well mr repton then i will send you the despatches this evening together with a letter recommending you to all british officers and authorities both will be written on the smallest pieces of paper possible so that you may conceal them more easily  now as to the means there are many of the fishermen here would be glad to leave the firing in the bay has frightened the greater part of the fish away and besides the boats dare not go any distance from the rock i have caused inquiries to be made and have given permits to three men to leave the rock in a boat after nightfall and to take their chance of getting through the enemys cruisers it is likely to be a very dark night i have arranged with them to take a passenger across to tangiers and have given them permission to take two others with them we know that there are many jews and others most anxious to leave the town before the enemy begin to bombard it and the men will doubtless get a good price from two of these to carry them across the straits  you will form an idea for yourself whether these boatmen are trustworthy if you conclude that they are you can make a bargain with them or with any others to bring you back direct i authorize you to offer them a hundred pounds for doing so  come up here at eight oclock this evening i will have the despatches ready for you then you will understand that if you find the moors have become absolutely hostile and have a difficulty in getting at mr logie you are not to run any risk in trying to deliver the despatches as the information you will be able to obtain will be sufficient for me without any confirmation from him  after further conversation bob took his leave of the governor on his return home carrie was very vexed when she heard the mission that bob had undertaken and at first it needed all her husbands persuasions to prevent her going off to the governors to protest against it  why my dear you would make both yourself and bob ridiculous surely he is of an age now to go his own way without petticoat government he has already gained great credit both in his affair with the privateer and in fetching in the oranges the other day this is far less dangerous here he has only got to smuggle himself in there he had to bring back something like a ton of oranges it is a great honour for the governor to have chosen him and as to you opposing it the idea is absurd  i shall go round to major harcourt bob said mrs harcourt is terribly anxious about her daughter and i am sure she will be glad to send a letter over to her  carrie captain ohalloran said gravely i have become a sudden convert to your opinion regarding this expedition suppose that bob instead of coming back were to carry amy harcourt off to england it would be terrible i believe that mr logie as his majestys consul could perform the necessary ceremony before they sailed  bob laughed  i should doubt whether mr logie would have power to officiate in the case of minors besides there is an english church where the banns could be duly published no i think we must put that off gerald  amy harcourt was the daughter of one of the ohallorans most intimate friends and the girl who was about fifteen years old was often at their house with her mother she had suffered much from the heat early in june and her parents had at a time when the spanish cruisers had somewhat relaxed their vigilance sent her across to tangiers in one of the traders she was in the charge of mrs colomb the wife of an officer of the regiment who was also going across for her health they intended to stay at tangiers only for a month or six weeks but mrs colomb had become worse and was when the last news came across too ill to be moved  major and mrs harcourt had consequently become very anxious about amy the feeling being much heightened by the rumours of the hostile attitude of the emperor towards the english mrs harcourt gladly availed herself of the opportunity that bobs mission offered  i shall be glad indeed if you will take a letter mr repton i am in great trouble about her if anything should happen to mrs colomb her position would be extremely awkward i know that mr logie will do the best he can for her but for aught we know he and all the english there may at present be prisoners among the moors i need not say how bitterly her father and i have regretted that we let her go and yet it seemed by far the best thing at the time for she would get an abundance of fresh meat food and vegetables  of course you will see how she is situated when you get there and i am sure you will give her the best advice you can as to what she is to do not knowing how they are placed there we can do literally nothing and you managed that fruit business so splendidly that i feel very great confidence in you  i am sure i shall be glad to do anything that i can mrs harcourt and if it had been a boy i daresay we could have managed something between usbut you see girls are different  oh you wont find any difficulty with her i often tell her she is as much of a boy at present as she is a girl amy has plenty of sense i shall tell her in my letter about your going out to fetch in the fruit for the women and children she is inclined to look up to you very much already owing to the share you had in the capture of those spanish vessels and i am sure she will listen to any advice you give her  well i will do my best mrs harcourt bob said meekly but i have never had anything to do with girls except my sister and she gives the advice always and not me  by what she says bob i dont think you always take it mrs harcourt said smiling  well not quite always bob admitted women are constantly afraid that you are going to hurt yourself or something just as if a boy had got no sense  well i will do what i can mrs harcourt i am sure i hope that i shall find them all right over there  i hope so too mrs harcourt said i will see captain colomb he will be sure to give you a letter for his wife i shall talk it over with him and if he thinks that she had better go straight home if any opportunity offers i shall tell amy to go with her and stay with my sister at gloucester till the siege is over and then she can come out again to us i will bring you down the letters myself at seven oclock  from her bob went to dr burke  i have just come from your house bob i found your sister in a despondent state about you i assured her you had as many lives as a cat and could only be considered to have used up two or three of them yet and were safe for some years to come i hinted that you had more to fear from a rope than either drowning or shooting that made her angry and did her good however it was better for me to be off and i thought most likely that you would be coming round for a talk  so you are going officially this time well what disguise are you going to take  that is what i have been thinking of what would you recommend doctor  well the choice is not a very extensive one you can hardly go as you are because if the moors have joined the spaniards you would be arrested as soon as you landed gerald tells me that probably two of the jew traders will go away with you if so i should say you could not do better than dress in their style there are many of them rock scorpions and talk spanish and english equally well but i should say that you had better take another disguise  that is what i was thinking bob said the boatman will know that i have something to do with the governor and the two jews will certainly know that i dont belong to the rock if they find that the moors have joined the spaniards these jews may try to get through themselves by denouncing me i should say i had better get clothes with which i can pass as a spanish sailor or fisherman there are almost sure to be spanish ships in there there is a good deal of trade between tangiers and spain  then again i shall want my own clothes if i have to take passage in a neutral to lisbon so i should say that i had better go down to the town and get a sort of traders suit and a fishermans at one of the low slop shops then i will go as a trader to start with and carry the other two suits in a bag  that will be a very good plan bob you are not likely to be noticed much when you land there are always ships anchored there waiting for a wind to carry them out they must be accustomed to sailors of all sorts of nationalities in the streets however i hope you will find no occasion for any clothes after you land but your own the moors have always been good friends of ours and the emperor must know that the spaniards are very much more dangerous neighbours than we are and i can hardly believe he will be fool enough to throw us over  i will go down with you to buy these things  bob had no difficulty in procuring the clothes he required at a secondhand shop and then took the lot home with him carrie had by this time become more reconciled to what could not be avoided and she laughed when dr burke came in  you are like a bad penny teddy burke it is no use trying to get rid of you  not the least bit in the world mrs ohalloran fortunately i know that however hard you are upon me you dont mean what you say  i do mean it very much but after you are gone i say to myself it is only teddy burke and think no more of it  that evening at nine oclock bob embarked on board the fishing boat at the new mole one of the governors aidesdecamp accompanied him to pass him through all the guards and orders had been sent to the officers in command of the various batteries that the boat was not to be challenged it was to show a light from a lantern as it went along in order that it might be known the other two passengers and the boatmen had been sitting there since before gunfire and they were glad enough when bob came down and took his seat in the stern taking the tiller ropes  the oars had been muffled and they put off noiselessly when they got past europa point they found a light breeze blowing and at once laid in their oars and hoisted sail a vigilant lookout was kept once or twice they thought they made out the hulls of anchored vessels but they gave these a wide berth and when the morning broke were halfway across the strait heading directly for tangiers in another six hours they entered the port there were half a dozen vessels lying in the harbour four of these were flying spanish colours one was a dane and the other a dutchman  from the time morning broke bob had been narrowly examining his fellow passengers and the boatmen and came to the conclusion that none of them were to be trusted as soon as he stepped ashore with his bag in his hand he walked swiftly away and passing through the principal streets which were crowded with moors held steadily on without speaking to anyone until he reached the outskirts of the town and then struck off among the hedges and gardens    chapter 15 bobs mission   as soon as he found a secluded spot he stripped off the clothes he wore and put on those of a spanish sailor and then placing the others in the bag buried it in the sandy soiltaking particular note of its position in regard to trees and surrounding objects so as to be able to find it again then he turned to the right and skirted the town till he came down to the seashore again and then strolled quietly back to the quays in passing by the ships at anchor he had noticed the names of the four spaniards and after wandering about for a short time he entered a wine shop and seated himself at a table near one at which three spanish sailors sat drinking  from their talk he learned that the british were shortly to be turned out of tangiers that the town was to be given up to the spaniards and that the british consul had the day before been taken to sallee where the emperor now was the english in the town had not yet been made prisoners but it was believed that they would be seized and handed over to the spaniards without delay  having obtained this information bob saw thatat any rate for the presenthe might if he chose appear in his own character and regretted that he had buried his clothes before knowing how matters stood however there was no help for it but to go back again to the place where he had hidden them this he did and having put on his own clothes he went straight to the consulate which was a large house facing the port a clerk was sitting in the office  i understand mr logie is away bob said  the clerk looked surprised for he knew the whole of the small body of british residents well and he could not understand how bob could have arrived  i am the bearer of letters to him from governor eliott bob said i came across by boat and landed two hours ago but i was in disguise not knowing how matters stood here and have but now ascertained that so far the english are not prisoners  not at present the clerk said but will you come into the house sir we may be disturbed here  in the first place bob asked when they were seated in an inner room when do you expect mr logie back and what is the real situation my orders are if i cannot see mr logie himself that i am to obtain as accurate a statement as possible as to how matters are going on here as it is important that the governor should be able to inform vessels sailing from gibraltar east whether they can or can not put safely into the moorish ports of course we know that vessels have been several times taken by the spaniards while at anchor close to the towns but they might risk that if there were no danger from the moors themselves but if the reports last sent by mr logie are confirmed the moors would be openly at war with us and would themselves seize and make prizes of vessels anchoring the danger would of course be vastly greater than that of merely running the risk of capture if a spanish vessel of war happened to come into a port where they were at anchor of course i am merely expressing the views of the governor  i am sorry to say the clerk said that there is no doubt the moors are about to join the spaniards in formal alliance against us englishmen are liable to insult as they go through the street this however would not go for much by itself but last week a number of soldiers rushed into the office seized mr logie violently assaulted him spat upon him and otherwise insulted himacting as they said by the express order of the emperor himself he is now practically a prisoner having been taken under an escort to sallee and at any moment the whole of the british colony here may be seized and thrown into prison and if you know what moorish prisons are you would know that that would mean death to most of themcertainly i should say to all the ladies  but can they not leave in neutral vessels  no the strictest orders have been issued against any englishman leaving they are in fact so far prisoners although nominally at liberty to move about the town  i believe that the greater part of the moors regret extremely the course their emperor has taken many have come in here after dark to assure mr logie how deeply averse they were to this course for that the sympathies of the population in general were naturally with the english in their struggle against the spaniards who had for all time been the deadly foe of the moors unfortunately the emperor has supreme power and anyone who ventured to murmur against his will would have his head stuck up over a gate in no time so that the sympathy of the population does not count for much  how many english are there altogether  a hundred and four we made up the list last week of course that includes men women and children there are some ten merchants most of whom have one or two clerks the rest of the men are small traders and shopkeepers some of them make their living by supplying ships that put in here with necessaries a few at ordinary times trade with the rock in livestock half a dozen or so keep stores where they sell english goods to the natives  i have a mission to discharge to a mrs colomb or at least to a young lady living with her  mrs colomb i regret to say died three weeks ago the clerk said miss harcourtwho is i suppose the young lady you meanis now with mrs colombs servant staying here mr logie had placed them in lodgings in the house of a moorish trader just outside the town but the young lady could not remain there alone after mrs colombs death i will ring the bell and tell the servant to inform her that you are here  two minutes later bob was shown into a large sitting room on the first floor with a verandah overlooking the sea  oh bob repton i am glad to see you amy harcourt exclaimed coming forward impulsively with both hands held out it is dreadfully lonely here mr logie is away and poor mrs colomb is dead and as for mrs williams she does nothing but cry and say we are all going to be shut up and starved in a moorish prison  but first how are father and mother and everyone at the rock  they are all quite well amy though your mother has been in a great state of anxiety about you since she got your letter saying how ill mrs colomb was here is a letter she has given me for you  he handed the girl the letter and went out on to the verandah while she read it  mamma says i am to act upon mr logies advice and that if by any means he should not be in a position to advise me i am to take your advice if mrs colomb is dead  i dont think i am in a position to give you advice amy what did mr logie say about the state of affairs before he went away  he seemed to think things were going on very badly you know the soldiers rushed in here and assaulted him one day last week they said they had orders from the emperor to do so and mr logie said they certainly would not have dared to molest the british consul if it hadnt been by the emperors orders he was talking to me about it the day before they took him away to sallee and he said he would give anything if he could get me away to the rock for that the position here was very precarious and that the emperor might at any moment order all the english to be thrown into prison and i know that the servants expect we shall all be killed by the populace  they have frightened mrs williams nearly out of her senses i never saw such a foolish woman she does nothing but cry she is the wife you know of captain colombs soldier servant  well what do you advise bob  i am sure i dont know what to advise amy this seems a regular fix doesnt it  but you are just as badly off as i am she said if they seize everyone else of course they will seize you now you are here  oh i could get away easily enough bob said i should dress myself up as a spanish sailor i have got the clothes here and should boldly go on board one of the spanish ships and take passage across to any port they are going to and then manage to work round into gibraltar again but of course you cant do that  i couldnt go as a spanish sailor of course the girl said but i might dress up and go somehow anything would be better than waiting here and then being thrown into one of their dreadful prisons they say they are awful places  do take me bob repton i do so want to get back to father and mother again and i am quite well and strong nowas well as ever i was  bob looked at the girl with a puzzled expression of face he had promised her mother to do the best thing he could for her the question was what was the best thing it certainly seemed that the position here was a very perilous one if he left her here and harm befell her what would her parents say to him but on the other hand how on earth was he to get her away  i tell you what amy he said after a time who were the ladies mrs colomb saw most of i suppose she knew some of the people here  oh yes she knew several but she was most intimate with mrs hamber she is the wife of one of the principal merchants and is very kind she offered to take me in when mrs colomb died but her husband lives out of the town and mr logie had promised mrs colomb that he would look after me until he could send me acrossbesides mrs hambers child is very ill with feverand so he brought me here  well i will go and consult her bob said i daresay the clerk downstairs will send a man with me to show me her house  mrs hamber listened to bobs account of his mission asking a question now and again in a straightforward and decided way which gave bob an idea that she was a resolute sort of woman with plenty of common sense  well mr repton she said when he had finished it is a difficult matter for anyone but the girls mother to form an opinion upon i remember hearing from mrs colomb about your going out and bringing in fruit when the scurvy was so bad two months ago she had received the news no doubt from her husband and therefore it seems to me that you must be a very capable young gentleman with plenty of courage and coolness the fact that mrs harcourt gave you such a message as she did regarding her daughter shows that she has every confidence in you if the girl were a year or two older i should say it would be quite out of the question for her to attempt to make her way back to gibraltar under your protection but as she is still a mere child and as you possess her mothers confidence i dont see that this matters so much  if you are both taken prisoners there is no reason for supposing that she would not be treated honourably by the spaniards they must have taken numbers of women in the vessels they have captured lately and i suppose the girl would be placed with them she would at any rate be far better off in a spanish prison than in a moorish one besides i really consider that all our lives are in danger here after the assault on mr logie it is just as likely the emperor may order us all to be massacred as thrown into prison or he might sell us as slaves as they do at algiers there is no saying i think that if i were in the position of the girls mother at gibraltar i should say that it was better for her to run the risk of capture with you than to remain here where there is no saying what may happenshe having every confidence in your honour young gentleman  i thank you mrs hamber i have no idea at present what plan i shall form i may not see any possible way of getting out but if i do we will certainly attempt it major harcourt belongs to the same regiment as my brotherinlaw and his wife and my sister are great friends which is why i suppose she has confidence in me i have known amy now for a year and a half and she is very often at my sisters i will take care of her just the same as if she were a young sister of my own i dont see how i could go back and tell her mother that i left her here with things in the state they are i only hope they may not turn out so badly as you fear and that at the worst the moors will only hand you over as prisoners to the spaniards  bob went back to the consulate and told amy the result of his conversation with mrs hamber  i consider that has taken the responsibility off my shoulders amy you referred me to mrs hamber as the lady you knew best here she is of opinion that if she were your mother she would advise your trying to get away with me so now we have only to decide how it is to be donethat is if you still wish to try  certainly i do the girl said anything is better than waiting here expecting the moors to rush in as they did the other day and carry one off to prison or kill one  mr parrotthat is the gentleman you saw downstairssaid that you would stay here and ordered a room to be prepared for you and dinner is ready i am sure you must be terribly hungry  bob remembered now that he had had nothing to eatsave some biscuits on board the boat and a piece of bread at the wine shopsince he left gibraltar and that he really was desperately hungry amy had already had her dinner but she sat by him and they talked about their friends at the rock  now he said when he had finished let us have a regular council of war it was my intention to get a passage to malaga if i could because i know something of the road back from there but i could not do that with you  why not bob  because the voyage is too long someone would be certain to speak to you before you got across and as you cant talk spanish the cat would be out of the bag directly if possible we must manage to cross to tarifa it is only a few hours across to there even if we go in an open boat and now that the spaniards are friends with the moors there ought to be no difficulty in getting a passage across there or to algeciras  of course you cant go as you are he said looking at her rather ruefully  no of course not she said i am not so silly as that i should think i had better dress up like a boy bob  that would be a great deal the best plan if you would not mind it bob said greatly relieved that the suggestion came from her it is the only thing that i can think of there didnt seem any story one could invent to account for a spanish girl being over here but a ships boy will be natural enough if asked questions of course our story will be that we had been left behind here there could be lots of reasons for that either we might have been on shore and the vessel gone on without us or you might have been sent ashore ill and i might have been left to nurse you that wouldnt be a bad story  what we must do when we get to the other side must depend upon where we land i mean whether we try to get straight in by boat or to wait about until a chance comes once over there you will have to pretend to be deaf and dumb and then you can dress up as a spanish girlof course a peasantwhich will be much more pleasant than going about as a boy and better in lots of ways so if i were you i should take a bundle of things with me so that we should have nothing to buy there it is all very well buying disguises for myself but i could never go into a shop to ask for all sorts of girls clothes  amy went off in a fit of laughter at the thought of bob having to purchase feminine garments  it is all very well to laugh bob said these are the sort of little things that are so difficult to work in it is easy enough to make a general plan but the difficulty is to get everything to fit in  i will have a talk with mr parrot in the morning about the boats he will know what boats have been trading with the rock and what men to trust  you can talk to him now if you like the girl said he and mr logies other clerk have the top storey of the house  oh then i will go up and see him at once the sooner it is arranged the better if things are in the state that everyone says you might all be seized and imprisoned any day  bob went up at once to mr parrots rooms and had a long talk with him the clerk quite agreed that anything would be better than for a young girl to be shut up in a moorish prison but he did not see how it was possible for them to find their way across to gibraltar  many of our fishermen are most courageous fellows and have run great risks in taking letters from mr logie across to gibraltar i do not suppose that the blockade is very much more strict than it was and indeed the fact that you got through shows that with good luck the thing is possible enough but that is not the difficulty the strictest order has been issued that no boat is to take englishmen across to the rock or is to cross the straits on any pretence whatever and that anyone evading this law will be executed and his goods forfeited to the state that is how it is mr logie has been able to send no letters for the last month and why none of the merchants here have tried to get across to the rock no bribe would be sufficient to tempt the boatmen it would mean not only death to themselves if they ever returned but the vengeance of the authorities would fall on their relations here i am afraid that there is nothing to be done that way at all  there are the three men who brought me across this morning bob said they might be bribed to take us back the governor authorized me to offer a hundred pounds i own that i dont like their looks  you would have some difficulty in finding them to begin with mr parrot said and i dont think a hundred pounds would be likely to tempt them to run the risk  i would not mind giving them two hundred more bob said i have got that money of my own at gibraltar and i am sure if it were necessary major harcourt would gladly pay as much more to get his daughter back  three hundred would be ample if they would not run the risk for a hundred apiece nothing would tempt them i should say your best plan would be to go down early tomorrow and see if you can find one of them they are likely to be loitering about by the quays as they have their boat there  the question is are they to be trusted they know that you have been sent out by the governor and that you are here on some special business and they may very well think that the spaniards will give a higher reward for you than you can give to be taken back they will by this time know of the order against boats crossing and might betray you to the moors if you were going by yourself of course you could take all sorts of risks but with this young lady under your protection it would be different  yes i see that mr parrot rather than run any risk i should prefer being put ashore at any spanish port by one of the ships in the harbour if you give me the name of any spanish merchantman who was here say a fortnight ago my story that we were left behind owing to one of us being ill would be so simple that there need be no suspicion whatever excited tarifa or algeciras would of course be the best places as we should only be on board a few hours and miss harcourt could very well pretend to be still ill and weak and could lie down in a corner and i could cover her up with a blanket till we got there  once across i dont so much mind even if we were detected we should simply be two fugitives from here trying to make our way to gibraltar and i dont think there would be any question of my being a spy we should probably be sent to wherever they keep the english prisoners they have taken in ships and there would be nothing very dreadful in that even for her we should probably be exchanged before long there have been several batches sent in to the rock in exchange for prisoners taken in prizes brought in by privateers  well i really think that that would be the best way mr repton as you say there will be nothing very dreadful in detention for a while with the spaniards while there is no saying what may happen here if you like i will send one of the consulate servants out the first thing in the morning to inquire what ports the spanish craft are bound for and when they are likely to sail they seldom stop more than two or three days here most of them are taking livestock across for the use of the spanish army and though algeciras would be an awkward place for you to land at because if detected there you would be more likely to be treated as a spy still in a busy place like that no one would notice a couple of young sailors and it would be no great distance for you to walk over to tarifa or any of the villages on the straits  but how do you propose to get in from there that is what seems to me the great difficulty  well i got in before bob said and do not think that there ought to be much difficulty in getting hold of a boat if i did i should sail round the point and keeping well outside the line of cruisers come down on the coast the other side of gibraltar and so work along at night just as i did before if i found it absolutely impossible to get a boat of course i could notwith the girl with metry to swim across from the head of the bay to the rock which is what i should have done had i been alone so i should then go to the authorities and give myself up and say that being afraid that the moors intend to massacre all the english at tangiers i had come across with this young lady who is the daughter of an officer of the garrison to put her into spanish hands knowing that there she would receive honourable treatment till she could be passed in at the next exchange of prisoners  i think that would be your very best course to pursue unless you find everything turn out just as you would wish mr repton  when bob came down in the morning he at once went into the office below and mr parrot told him that one of the spanish craft would start for algeciras at noon  then i must ask you to send one of the servants out to buy some clothes such as are worn by a spanish sailor boy mr parrot i have my own suit upstairs and will go off and arrange for a passage across directly after breakfast  i will see to it mr parrot said the ships decks will be crowded up with cattle she is a small craft and i hear she will take as many as can be packed on her deck she is alongside now taking them in there is not much likelihood of any attention whatever being paid to you and your companion  amy turned a little pale when bob told her that the attempt was to be made at once but she said bravely  i am glad there is to be no waiting i do so long to be out of this town i daresay i shall be a little nervous at first but i shall try not to show it and i shant be really frightened for i know that you will take care of me  as soon as breakfast was over bob changed his things and went down to the quay he stopped at the vessel taking cattle on board she was a polacre brig of about a hundred and fifty tons the captain was smoking a cigar aft while the mate was seeing to the storing of the cattle bob went on board and told his story to the captain  i was left behind in charge of a cabin boy from the esmeralda a fortnight ago the boy had fever and the captain thought it might be infectious and put him ashore but he soon got well we want to be taken across as our friends live not many miles from tarifa we will pay a dollar apiece for our passage  the captain nodded  be on board by noon we shall not be a minute later  bob went ashore and told amy that everything was arranged without the slightest difficulty he then went down to inspect the clothes  they will do very well he said except that they are a great deal cleaner than anything ever seen on a spanish sailor those canvas trousers will never do as they are  he accordingly took some ashes and rubbed them well into the canvas got some grease from the kitchen and poured two or three large patches over the trousers  that is more like it he said the shirt will do well enough but there must be a patch or two of grease upon the jacket and some smears of dirt of some kind  when he had done them to his satisfaction he took them upstairs  what horrid dirty looking things amy exclaimed in disgust  they are clean enough inside child they are quite new but i have been dirtying them outside to make them look natural  you must be dressed by half past eleven and you can tuck your hair up under that red nightcap but you must manage to dirty your face neck and hands you really ought to have some brown stain but i dont suppose it is to be got i will speak to mr parrot  there is no stain that i know of mr parrot said but i know mr logie paints a little i think you will find a box of colours upstairs if you mix some vandyke brown in water and paint her with it and let it dry on i should think it would do very well though of course it wouldnt stand washing  bob found the paintbox and soon mixed some paint at half past eleven amy came into the room laughing a little shyly  that will do very well bob said encouragingly except that you are a great deal too fair and clean  look here i have been mixing some paint i think a wash of that will make all the difference now sit down while i colour you  that will do capitally he said when he finished i think when it dries it will be just about the right shade for a spanish sailor boy  have you got your bundle  that is right now here is my bag and a couple of black moorish blankets i will bring mr parrot up to say goodbye  have you told your servant  no i said nothing to her about it she would make such a terrible fuss there would be no getting away from her we must ask mr parrot to tell her after the vessel has set sail  mr parrot pronounced the disguise excellent and said that he should not have the slightest suspicion that she was anything but what she seemed to be amy felt very shy as she sallied out with bob but she gained courage as she saw that no one noticed her  when they arrived at the brig the cattle were nearly all on board bob led the way across the gangway and went up on to the focastle there he laid one of the blankets down against a stanchion wrapped amy in the other so that her face was almost hidden and told her to sit down and close her eyes as if weak or asleep then he took up his post beside her  in a quarter of an hour the last bullock was on board the gangway was at once hauled in the hawsers thrown off and the sails let drop and in another minute the vessel was gliding away from the wharf the wind was nearly due west and the sheets were hauled in as she was headed across the straits it was half an hour before the sailors work was all done several of them came up on to the focastle and began twisting cigarettes and one at once entered into conversation with bob  is the boy ill he said  yes he has been ill but is better now it would have been better if he could have stopped a few days longer but he was pining to get home he wont have far to go when we get to algeciras and no doubt i shall be able to get him a lift in some cart that will be bringing provisions to the camp  the talk at once turned on the siege the sailors expressing their certainty that the rock would soon be taken bob had moved away from amy as if to allow her to sleep undisturbed by the conversation  there is a brig running down the straits at a good speed one of the sailors said when they were half way across it is a nice breeze for her  bob looked at the craft she was about a mile away and by the course they were steeringalmost at right angleswould come very near to them there was something familiar in her appearance and he looked at her intently examining every sail and shroud then doubt became certainty as his eye fell upon a small patch in one of the cloths of the topgallant sail  it was the antelope one of the spanish shot had passed through the topgallant sail andas that was the only injury that sail had receivedthe bit had been cut out and a fresh one put in before she sailed again from gibraltar she was flying spanish colours  his heart beat fast would she overhaul them or pass without taking notice of themseeing that the polacre was a small one and not likely to be a valuable prize  the vessels approached each other quickly the course the antelope was taking would carry her some length or two behind the spaniard bob hesitated whether to hail her as she came along if his hail was not heard he would of course be detected and his plans entirely spoilt and with the wind blowing straight across and he in the bow it would be by no means certain that his hail would be distinguished suddenly to his delight when the brig was within a hundred yards of the polacre he saw her head come up while the crew began to haul upon the sheets  an exclamation of surprise and alarm broke from the spaniards as in another minute the antelope was running parallel with them a cables length to windward then the portholes were opened and eight guns run out the spanish flag was run down and the british hoisted to the peak and a summons to strike their flag shouted to the spaniards as the latter carried only four small guns resistance was out of the question the spanish flag was lowered and in obedience to the gesticulations rather than the words of an officer on board the english brig the halliards were thrown off and the sails came down with a run  the spanish sailors were frantic with rage swearing by all the saints in the calendar bob had moved at once across to amy  lie still amy we are going to be captured by an english ship it is the same privateer that i was in before dont make any sign until they come on board in the fury that these spaniards are in they might stick their knives into us if they knew we were english  the brig had been thrown up into the wind as soon as the polacres sails had been lowered and in three minutes a boat came alongside then joe lockett followed by half a dozen sailors armed with pistol and cutlass scrambled on board  now follow me amy and descending the ladder bob made his way along the narrow gangway between the lines of cattle and then mounted to the poop  well joe how are you  the first mate of the antelope started back in astonishment  why bob repton he exclaimed what on earth are you doing here masquerading as a spanish sailor  i am trying to get across to gibraltar he said  why is this fellow bound for gibraltar in that case we have not got a prize as we fancied  she is a fair prize joe she is bound for algeciras i was going to make my way in from there as best i could  that is all right then what has she got on board  nothing beyond these cattle and some vegetables i expect but they are worth a lot of money on the rock  well you will be able to tell us all about things bob i will hail the captain to send crofts on board with a dozen men to take charge here and then i will take you on board  i have a friend here bob said turning to amy who was standing timidly behind him so you must take him with me  all right joe said carelessly  in five minutes bob stood again on the deck of the antelope and a hearty greeting was exchanged between him and captain lockett  before i tell you anything captain which cabin am i to have i will tell you why afterwards i suppose it will be my old one  yes that is our one spare cabin bob but i dont know why you are in such a hurry about it  i will tell you presently bob laughed and led the way below  there amy he said you can go in there and put on your own things again i thought it would be more comfortable for you for them not to know it until you are properly dressed in your own clothes you have brought a frock of course  yes i thought i had better bring one in case we should be made prisoners  that is all right when you are dressed come upon deck i will explain all about it before you appear  bob as briefly as possible told his story to captain lockett and joe who were much amused to find that bobs friend was a young lady  you are coming out in quite a new light bob as a squire of dames but i wont laugh at you now i want to hear the last news i overhauled that craft not so much to capture her as to get the last news there were reports before i started that the moors were joining the spaniards and that their ports were closed to us and what you say confirms that that was one of the points i wanted to know as i could not tell whether i could run in there safely were i chased now as to getting into the rock are their cruisers active at present  well there are lots of them about i think your best plan will be to run in close to the point and hold on as if you were going into algeciras in that way they wont suspect you then when you get right up the bay haul across to the town the wind is in your favour because you will have to tack to work up the bay and if you make pretty long tacks they wont suspect you when you start across until you have got pretty well away and with this breeze there will be no chance of their catching you before you are under our guns  that seems hopeful enough at any rate we will try it i will send six more men on board the polacre they will want to be handy with her sails i will go myself and give crofts orders he had better keep ahead of us for if we are chased by their gunboats we can protect him  just as sail was again got up and the two vessels were under way amy harcourt came on deck and was soon laughing and chatting merrily with the captain at four in the afternoon they rounded the point the polacre a few hundred yards ahead and both flying spanish colours there were several spanish cruisers and some gunboats outside them but these paid no attention to their movements and both beat up the bay keeping close into the spanish shore but holding somewhat farther out at each tack  now captain lockett said when they were within half a mile of algeciras we will run out this tack there are two gunboats in our way i see but we must take our chance of them  go and wave a handkerchief from the bow joe mr crofts will be on the lookout for the signal  the two vessels held away on the port tack as the polacre approached the gunboats a sudden bustle was observed on board them  they begin to smell a rat captain lockett said  hoist the topgallant sails for the brig had been under easy sail to enable her to hold her place with the polacre  the men were already at quarters and the ports were opened and the guns run out just as the gunboat nearest the polacrefinding the hail for her to bring to unheededfired a shot into her the brigs head paid off and she poured a broadside into the two gunboats one of them was struck amidships for a minute there was great confusion on board and then she made for her companion evidently in a sinking condition  several shots were now fired from the forts but though they fell near the brig was uninjured the second gunboat did not venture to attack so formidable an opponent and half an hour later the antelope and her prize dropped anchor off the mole  bob had already run down and put on his usual clothes and he and amy were at once rowed ashore and made their way to major harcourts quarters the delight of amys father and mother as she rushed into the room was extreme bob did not enter with her but left her to tell her own story and proceeded straight to the governors to whom he reported the state of affairs at tangier  it is bad news the governor said however i am extremely obliged to you for the valuable service that you have rendered and as i had the pleasure of before doing when you brought in the oranges i shall place your name in the orders of the day for having as a volunteer rendered signal service by carrying despatches at great risk across to the barbary coast  bob then returned home captain lockett had already been to the house and informed the ohallorans of his arrival  there you see carrie bob said after his sisters first greetings were over there was nothing to have been so terribly alarmed about  it isnt because you got through it safely bob that there was no danger his sister replied it was a very foolish thing to do and nothing will change my opinion as to that  captain lockett tells me you brought amy harcourt back with you dressed up as a boy i never heard of such a thing bob the idea of a boy like younot eighteen yettaking charge in that way of a young girl  well there was nothing else to do carrie that i could see i went to mrs hamber who was mrs colombs most intimate friend and asked her opinion as to what i had better do and she advised me to get amy away if i possibly could do so i cant see what difference it makes whether it is a boy or a girl it seems to me that people are always so stupid about that sort of thing  carrie laughed  well never mind bob amy harcourt is a very nice girl a little too boyish perhaps but i suppose that is natural being brought up in the regiment i am very glad that you have brought her back again and it will be an immense relief to her father and mother her mother has been here three or four times during these two days you have been away and i am in no way surprised at her anxiety they will be in here this evening certainly to thank you  very well then i shall be round smoking a cigar with the doctor bob said i am very glad to have been of use to them and to have got amy back again but i dont want to be thanked and you tell them so i hate being made a fuss about  and so beyond a warm grasp of the hand on the part of major harcourt and two or three words of hearty thanks on that of his wife the next time they met bob escaped any expression of gratitude but the occurrence drew the two families together more closely and amy often came round with her father and mother in the evening and there were many little confidential talks between carrie and mrs harcourt  it was some time before the anxiety as to the fate of the english inhabitants at tangier was allayed they were at the beginning of december forced to remove to marteen a few miles from tetuanabandoning their houses and all their property which was estimated at the value of sixty thousand poundsand three days afterwards were handed over as prisoners to the spaniards they were then put on board a ship and taken to algeciraswhere they were kept for nearly a month prisoners on board shipbut were on the 11th of january 1781 sent across to gibraltar  the next five months passed slowly and heavily occasionally privateers and other craft ran through the blockade of the spanish cruisers and succeeded in getting into port some of these brought wine and sugarof both of which the garrison were extremely shortand occasionally a few head of cattle and other provisions all of these were sold by public auction the governor considering that to be the fairest way of disposing of them  on the 12th of april another great convoy under admiral darby entered the port it consisted of about a hundred merchantmen under the protection of a powerful fleet the joy of the garrison and inhabitants was intense although among the latter this was mingled with a certain feeling of uneasiness deserters had at various times brought in reports that should gibraltar be again relieved it was the purpose of the spaniards to bombard the town hopes were entertained that so wanton an act of cruelty would not be carried out for the entire destruction of the town would not advance in the smallest degree the progress of the siege  at a quarter to eleven just as the van of the convoy came to an anchor off the new mole fort san philip opened fire upon the town and at the signal the whole of the batteries in the forts and lines followed suit a hundred and fourteen guns and mortars rained their shot and shell upon the town and the guns of the batteries of the garrison at once responded  several of the officers of the 58th and their wives had come up to captain ohallorans to enjoy from the terrace the view of the great convoy entering the port all were in the highest spirits at the thought of the abundant supplies that would now be at their disposal and in the belief that the spaniards seeing that the garrison was again amply provisioned would abandon the siege which had now lasted for twentytwo months suddenly there came upon the air the deep sound of the guns of san philip followed by a prolonged roar as the whole of the spanish batteries opened fire the hum of shot could be heard followed by the explosion of shells the fall of masonry and screams and cries  the bombardment has begun at last captain ohalloran exclaimed  the greatest consternation reigned among the ladies several of them had left children in their quarters and although the barracks were so placed as to be to a great extent sheltered from the enemys fire from the land side they were still terribly anxious as to their safety two of them had like the ohallorans quarters in the town itself and the husbands of these ladies accompanied by captain ohalloran and bob at once set out to bring the children up to the house which was perfectly sheltered  the scene in the town was a pitiful one men women and children were flying in the wildest alarm towards the gate looking south and thence out to the huts that the more prudent ones had erected many months before near europa point shot and shell were raining down while chimneys and portions of masonry fell clattering in the streets sick people were being carried out on doors or planks and most of the inhabitants were laden with what few articles of value they could snatch up at the first alarm the children were soon brought up to the ohallorans and then for a time there was nothing to do but to listen to the roar of artillery  the officers and bob ascended the rock to a point near one of the batteries whence they could command a view of the spanish lines the flashes of smoke were bursting forth almost incessantly but were answered shot for shot from the english batteries which had already almost silenced the san carlos battery which mounted a large number of mortars and against which the fire of the english guns was concentrated  between one and two oclock the spanish fire abated and soon ceased altogether the inhabitants took advantage of the lull to hurry back to their houses whence they removed the lighter and more portable articles but the heavy storesof which it now appeared many of them had large quantities concealedthey were of course unable to take away  the discovery of these stores excited much indignation among the troops the inhabitants had been constantly representing themselves as reduced to the last point of hunger and had frequently received provisions from the scanty supplies of the garrison and the soldiers were exasperated on finding that all this time they possessed great stores of wine flour and other articles which they were hoarding to produce and sell when prices should rise to even more exorbitant heights than they had already reached  at five oclock the enemys batteries opened again and the firing continued without intermission all that night as several casualties had taken place in the barracks and quarters marquees were on the following morning served out to all the officers whose quarters were exposed to fire and these were pitched near europa point as were also a large number of tents for the use of the inhabitants  a considerable body of troops were kept under arms near the northern gate in case the spaniards should attempt to make an assault under cover of their fire and five hundred officers and men were told off to assist in the work of getting the supplies up from the wharves as fast as they were landed from the transports  the bombardment continued during the whole of the next two days the mortars still poured their shells upon the town but the guns were now directed at our batteries and their fire was remarkably accurate  on the 14th the unloading parties were increased to a thousand men and strong detachments of troops were told off to extinguish the fires in the town as the enemy were now discharging shell filled with a composition that burned with great fury igniting everything with which it came in contact the troops engaged upon this duty were not long in broaching the casks of wine found in such abundance in many of the ruined houses for two years they had been living almost entirely on salt provisions and wine had been selling at prices vastly beyond their means it was scarcely surprising then that they should take advantage of this opportunity  the stores were practically lost for the whole town was crumbling to pieces beneath the fire of the enemys mortars and was on fire in several places and little if any of the liquor and stores consumed could in any case have been saved however for a time insubordination reigned the troops carried off liquor to their quarters barricaded themselves there and got drunk and it was two or three days before discipline was restored up to this time the conduct of the soldiers had been most exemplary and they had borne their prolonged hardships without a murmur and this outbreak was due as much to a spirit of revenge against the inhabitants for hiding away great stores of provisions and liquor with a view to making exorbitant profits as from a desire to indulge in a luxury of which they had been so long deprived  on the 15th the enemys fire was hotter than ever and the guns were withdrawn from our batteries as they produced but little effect upon the spanish batteries and the men working them suffered a good deal from the besiegers fire two officers were dangerously wounded in one of the casemates of the kings bastion and the fire was so heavy around some of the barracks that all the troops who could not be disposed of in the casemates and bombproofs were sent out of the town and encamped southward and the next day all the women and children who had gone with their husbands and fathers into the casemates were also removed and placed under canvas all this gave incessant work to the troops for there was no level ground upon which the tents could be pitched and as it was therefore necessary to level all the ground into terraces it was some days before the camps were ranged in anything like order  each day the enemy sent out their gunboats to harass the merchantmen but these were always driven back by the guns of the fleet on the 17th the besiegers shells set fire to the spanish church which had been used as a storehouse strong parties were sent down to remove the provisions which consisted largely of barrels of flour these were carried up and piled so as to afford protection to the casemates which had been frequently entered by the enemys shotsseveral men having been killed there they proved a valuable defence and afforded moreover great amusement to the soldiers who whenever a barrel was smashed by a shell carried off the contents and quickly converted them into pancakes until so many casks had been emptied that the whole structure came toppling down  on the 18th a shell came through the arch of one of the casemates killing two and wounding four men and in consequence a good many more of the troops were sent under canvas  on the 20th the work of unloading the greater portion of the transports was completed and the admiral who was most anxious to take advantage of the easterly wind that was blowing to sail out of the straits gave the signal for departure many of the merchantmen whose cargoes were consigned to merchants and traders on the rock carried them back to england as the merchants having no place whatever in which to store goodsfor the town was now almost entirely destroyedrefused to accept them the transports with ordnance stores were brought in behind the new mole to be discharged at leisure while several colliers were run close in and scuttled so that their cargoes could be removed as required  a great many of the inhabitants and of the officers wives and families embarked on board the fleet before it left the enemys fire still continued very heavy and their guns and mortar boats on the 23rd came boldly out and opened fire upon the working parties who were stacking the barrels and stores at the south end of the rock the wife of a soldier was killed and several men wounded  on the 26th the governor determined sternly to repress the drunkenness that still prevailed owing to the soldiers going down among the ruins of the town where they occasionally discovered uninjured casks of wine an order was therefore issued on that day that any soldier convicted of being drunk asleep at his post or marauding should be immediately shot  on the 27th a convoy of twenty ships in charge of the brilliant and three other frigates came in from minorca where the governor had ordered provisions to be purchased in case the convoy expected from england did not arrive the arrival of these ships largely added to the stores at the disposal of the garrison    chapter 16 a cruise in the brilliant   while the bombardment continued bob had been constantly occupied he had some time before put down his name as a volunteer for service if required and he and several others who had similarly enrolled themselves had been appointed to assist in looking after the removal of the soldiers wives and children to the tents erected for them and to seeing to their comfort there he had also been in charge of bodies of labourers employed by the governor in the work of levelling the ground and transporting stores  captain ohalloran was constantly away on duty and soon after the bombardment began it was found necessary to drive the whole of the poultry into the lower part of the house the spaniards retaining only one room for their own accommodation had not this step been taken the chickens would speedily have been stolen by marauders as in the absence of captain ohalloran and bob there was no one to protect them after the issue of the governors proclamation discipline was speedily restored and there was no longer any occasion to keep them under shelter  the bombardment was followed by heavy rains which caused very great discomfort to the troops the water pouring in torrents down the face of the hills swept away the newly raised banks and brought down the tents the soldiers having to turn out in the wetand as the troops owing to their heavy duties were only one night out of three in bed the discomfort and annoyance were very great great quantities of the provisions too were damaged as these were all stacked in the open air with no other covering than that afforded by the sails of the colliers which were cut off and used for the purpose until the end of the month the downfall of rain was incessant and was accompanied with heavy storms of thunder and lightning the batteries required constant repair and the labours of the troops were very severe  since the departure of admiral darbys fleet the enemy appeared to have given up all hopes of compelling the place to surrender by hunger the convoy from minorca had not been interfered with and on the 2nd of may two native craft came in from algiers with sheep wine and brandy unmolested by the enemys cruisers  the enemys fire had never entirely ceased since the commencement of the bombardment and now amounted to about fifteen hundred rounds every twentyfour hours the gunboats generally coming out every day and sending their missiles into the town and batteriesthe latter being specially the mark of the enemys land guns which reached even the highest batteries on the rock all through may and june the enemys fire continued dropping towards the end of the latter month to about five hundred shot and shell a day the gunboats were specially annoying directing their fire against the south end of the rock and causing great alarm and distress among the fugitives from the town encamped there occasionally they directed their fire towards the houses that had escaped the fire of the land batteries and several shot and shell fell near the ohallorans but fortunately without hitting the house  the volunteers had now been released from duty and bob was free to wander about as he pleased as since his exploit in fetching in the fruit he had become known to every officer in the garrison he was a privileged person and was able to enter any of the batteries and to watch the effects of their fire against the enemys forts and lines he often spent the day on board the brilliant at the end of june the frigate went away for a fortnights cruise and the captain invited bob to accompany them  we shall all expect great things from you mr repton as you managed to capture some fifty thousand pounds worth of prizes when you were on board that privateer brig you ought to put the frigate into the way of taking at least four times as much  it is easy to turn a brig into anything captain langton but there is no making one of his majestys frigates look other but what she is the mere sight of your topsails is enough to send every spanish craft into port  for three or four days the frigate sailed along the coast keeping well out during the day and closing with the land in the evening two or three small coasters were picked up by the boats but they were scarcely worth sending into gibraltar on the fifth day a large barque was seen making in from the south all sail was made but the barque had the weather gage and crossing her ran into the shore and anchored under the shelter of a battery  that would be a prize worth having bob jim sankey said i wonder what she has got on board perhaps she is like that craft you captured chokefull of lead and silver from lima  i think i can tell you what she is full of bob who had been examining her through a glass he had borrowed from the third lieutenant replied  how do you mean you can tell bob she has not got her bill of lading stuck upon her broadside i suppose  she has not jim but i can tell you without that  well what has she got on board  she has got a very strong crew jim and twentyfour guns  why how on earth did you know that bob he asked staring at his friend in surprise  because jim i have been on board and counted the guns that is the craft i swam off to nearly two years ago you hunted for her then you know but i suppose she had gone into one of the ports but that is her i can almost swear  i dont know whether there is a better glass than this on board but if there is i should be glad to have a look through it yet i feel certain without that her stern is of rather peculiar shape and that stern gallery looks as if it was pinched out of her instead of being added on we particularly noticed that when we were sailing with her i cant be mistaken about it  i think the captain ought to know then jim said i will speak to mr rawdon he is in charge of the watch  jim went up on to the quarterdeck touched his hat and informed the second lieutenant what bob had told him mr rawdon went up at once to the captain who was talking to the first lieutenant and examining the barque and battery through his glass  mr sankey has reported to me sir that mr repton is very strongly of opinion that the barque there is the spanish ship of war he boarded by night just after the beginning of hostilities he told us about it sir and we spent two or three days in looking for her  of course i remember the captain said have the kindness to pass the word for mr repton to come aft  bob soon stood before the captain  mr rawdon tells me that you are of opinion that the barque in there is the disguised spanish sloop you boarded two years ago  yes sir i am almost sure of it but i should like to have another look at her through your glass before i speak with certainty  the captain handed his glass which was a remarkably good one to bob  that is her bob said after a minutes examination i could swear to her anywhere and he then pointed out to the captain the peculiarities he had noticed  i can make out her figurehead too he said it is a saint though i dont know what saint but if you notice sir you will see that instead of standing nearly upright he leans much more forward than usual i remember the captain saying he looked as if he was going to take a header so with that and the stern gallery there is no possibility of mistaking her  the captain again examined the barque through his glass  yes i notice both the points you mention well i am much obliged to you for the news it is very important i was thinking of cutting her out tonight and should have fallen into the same error you so nearly did in the privateer  bob bowed and retired  we should have caught a tartar mr lyons if we had sent the force we were talking about to cut her out but i think we must have her somehow  i hope so sir we have had a very dull time of it with nothing to do but to exchange shots occasionally with those gunboats and to get under sail now and then to escort some craft or other into port the navy hasnt done much to boast of during this siege and it has been very hard on us being cooped up there in gibraltar while the fleet all over the world are picking up prizes and fighting the french and spanish why we havent made enough prize money in the last two years to pay for pipe clay and powder  yes we all feel that mr lyons we have certainly been terribly out of luck that privateer mr repton was on board did more in her weeks cruise than all his majestys ships in gibraltar have done in the last two years  we must take that craft inshore if we can there is no doubt she is ably commanded for she is so well disguised that we never suspected her for a moment therefore there is not the least chance of our catching her napping she is a formidable craft to cut out with the boats even if she hadnt the aid of the battery  there is no doubt about that sir i think mr repton reported before that she carried twentyfour guns and all heavy metal as far as i can make out with the glass the battery mounts twelve guns  yes that is the number besides you see we dare not take the frigate in nearer than a mile and a mile and a quarter would be safer so that we could not be of any assistance beyond annoying the battery with long shot it seems to me that there is only one chance  what is that sir  we must land a strong party some distance along the shore and make an attack upon the battery and carry it by surprise i can make out some huts behind it i suppose they wouldnt have less than a hundred soldiers thereperhaps a hundred and fifty if we can drive them off and capture the battery we can open fire down upon the ship at that distance we could fairly sweep her deck with grape  the rest of our boats would be lying ahead and astern of her and as soon as the battery opened they could make a dash for her the crew of the barque would be so disorganized by the fire of the battery that they should hardly be able to make very much of a fight of it  that seems a capital plan sir the only question is the number of hands suppose you send eighty to take the battery we should only have as many more to spare for the boat attack on the ship and that would leave us with only a hundred on board i should think she would carry a fighting crew of two hundred at least these spaniards are always very strongly manned  i should think that would be about it they are long odds but not too long i think mr lyons at any rate we will try  lay her off the land mr lyons then we will go into my cabin and make all the arrangements  there was much talk and excitement among the crew for the general opinion was that the captain would try to cut out the craft lying under the spanish battery the navy had for a long time been very sore at their inactivity and had fretted that no attempts had been made to cut out the spanish vessels across the bay the admiral had steadily set his face against all such attempts considering that the benefits to be gained did not justify the risks for had any of his small squadron been damaged or sunk by the guns of the batteries the consequences would have been very serious as the spanish gunboats would then have been able to carry on their operations without check and it would have been next to impossible for vessels to run the blockade  the information bob had given was soon known to all the officers and was not long before it permeated through the crew and added to their anxiety to cut the spaniard out for although the prize money would be less than if she had been a richly laden merchantman the honour and glory was proportionately greater the undertaking would be a serious one but the prospect of danger is never deterrent to a british sailor  there was great satisfaction when presently it became known that the crews of the whole of the boats were to muster arms were inspected cutlasses ground and everything prepared it was early in the morning when the spanish barque had been first discovered and ten oclock when the frigate had sailed away from land as if considering the spanish craft too strongly protected to be attacked when five miles away from land her course was laid east and under easy sail she maintained the same distance on the coast  the plan of operations was that the first lieutenant with thirty marines and as many sailors should land at a spot some two miles from the battery and should make their way inland and come down upon the position from the rear a hundred men in the rest of the boats should make for the barque direct this party was to act in two divisions under the second and third lieutenants respectively and were to lie one to the east and the other to the west of the barque and remain there until the guns of the battery opened upon her then they were to row for her at all speed a blue light being burned by each division when they were within a hundred yards of the enemy as a warning to their friends in the battery who were then to fire round shot instead of grape the frigate was to venture in as closely as she dared anchor broadside on and open fire at the enemy  jim sankey was told off to the landing party and bob went up to the captain and requested leave to accompany him as a volunteer  you see sir he said we may fall in with peasants or be challenged by sentries as we approach the battery and my ability to speak spanish might be an advantage  it would undoubtedly the captain said well mr repton i shall be very glad to accept your services  at four in the afternoon the frigates head was again turned west and at ten oclock the boats for the landing party were lowered and the men taking their places in them rowed away for the shore which was some two miles distant the night was dark but mr lyons had with him a pocket compass and had before embarking taken the exact bearings of the battery from the spot where they would land he was therefore able to shape his course to a point half a mile in its rear  the strictest silence had been enjoined and the little body of sailors made their way inland until they came upon a road running parallel with the shore they followed this for about half a mile and then struck off inland again the country was highly cultivated with orchards vineyards and orange groves their progress was slow for they had many times to cut a passage through the hedges of prickly pear at last they reached a spot where they believed themselves to be directly behind the battery here there was a path leading in the direction which they wished to follow  in a quarter of an hour they made out some lights ahead of them and the lieutenant halted his men and again repeated the orders they had before received  you are to go straight at the huts as you approach them you are to break up into parties of ten as already formed each party is to attack one hut cut down all who resist seize and carry away all arms never mind the men if you have once got their arms they cannot trouble us afterwards waste no time but directly you have got all the firelocks in one hut make for another as soon as all have been cleared out make for the battery  now let the officers told off to command parties each fall in at the head of his ten men  mr repton you will keep beside me to answer a challenge  they were within fifty yards of the huts when a sentinel challenged  who goes there  soldiers of the king bob answered in spanish with reinforcements for you  halt till i call an officer the sentry said  but the lieutenant gave the word and the whole party dashed forward at a run the sentry hesitated in surprise for a moment and then discharged his piece the sailors gave a cheer and rushed at the huts taken utterly by surprise the spaniards at first offered no resistance whatever as the sailors rushed in indeed few of them attempted to get out of bed the blue lights with which one man in each party was provided were lighted as they entered and the arms were collected without a moments delay and they were off again before the spaniards were fairly awake to what had happened  there were ten huts each containing twenty men two or three shots were fired as they entered the last two huts but the spaniards were overpowered in an instant as they were here vastly outnumbered the officers were made prisoners and ten men being placed over them the rest of the force now carrying three muskets each ran down into the battery the sentries here threw down their arms at once and were allowed to go where they pleased  pile the arms you have captured lieutenant lyons ordered run the ramrods down them and see if they are loaded the spaniards are not likely to rally but if they do we can give them a hot reception  now gunner break open the magazine there and load with grape  by this time the drum was beating to arms in the vessel belowthe shots fired having given the alarmand lights were seen to flash along the deck in two minutes the guns were loaded and these opened with a fire of grape upon the deck of the vessel which was near enough to be distinctly seen by the glare of the blue lights as the first gun was fired an answering flash came from sea as the frigate also opened fire for five minutes the guns were worked fast then two lights burst out in close succession ahead and astern of the barque  cease firing grape load with round shot the lieutenant shouted but a moment later a loud cheer broke from the sailors as by the lights in the boats the spanish ensign was seen to run up to the peak of the barque and then at once to fall again to the deck the barque had surrendered  now gunner spike the guns the lieutenant ordered and then tumble them off the carriages  this was soon done  now let each man take one of the muskets and throw the rest of them over the parapet down the rocks  that is right now fall in  the sailors fell in and marched back to the huts the spanish officers were placed in the midst and twenty men were told off to fire the huts this was soon done the lieutenant waited until they were well alight and then gave the order to march they took the coast road this time for two miles and then struck off to the shore and saw a few hundred yards away the lantern that had been hoisted on one of the boats as a signal  they were challenged by the boat keeper who had moored the boats twenty yards from the shore a cheer broke out as the answer was given the grapnels were pulled up and the boats were soon alongside the party embarking rowed out in the direction where they knew the frigate to be and as soon as they were fairly out from the shore they saw the three lights she had hoisted as a signal in half an hour they were alongside  i need not ask if you have succeeded mr lyons the captain said as the boats came up for we have seen that you have not had many casualties i hope  only one sir one of the marines has a ball in his shoulder there were only five or six shots fired in all and no one else has as much as a scratch  i am truly glad to hear it the captain said it has been a most successful surprise i dont think the boats can have suffered either  i dont think there was a shot fired at them sir the lieutenant said the spaniard ran up his colours and dropped them again directly the boats showed their lights i fancy they must have suffered very heavily from our fire you see they were almost under our guns and we must have pretty well torn up their decks  we shall soon hear the captain said the boats are towing the spaniard out she will be alongside in a few minutes  the wind had entirely dropped now and in a short time the spaniard was brought close alongside the frigate and mr rawdon came on board to report  the ship is the san joaquin mounting twentyfour guns with a crew of two hundred and twenty men sir her casualties are very heavy the men had just poured up on deck it seems when the battery opened fire the captain first lieutenant and fiftysix men are killed and there are fortythree wounded we have no casualties their flag came down just as we got alongside  then as far as we are concerned the captain said this is one of the most bloodless victories on record there will be no death promotions this time gentlemen but i am sure you wont mind that it has been a most admirably managed affair altogether and i am sure that it will be appreciated by my lords of the admiralty  you will take command of her at present mr lyons with the crew now on board dr colfax and his assistant will go off with you to attend to the wounded and will remain on board until we get into gibraltar  mr rawdon you will be acting first and i can only say that i hope you will be confirmed  the frigate and her prize at once sailed for gibraltar on their arrival there the captain took some painsby sending up larger yards and by repainting the broad white streaks showing the portholesto restore the prize to its proper appearance as a ship of war  we should not get half so much credit for her capture if you took her into portsmouth looking like a lubberly merchantman the captain said to mr lyons i dont care about patching up all those shot holes in the bulwarks that gives her the appearance of having been taken after a sharp action and the deck looks almost like a ploughed field  i shall give you fifty men mr lyons i cant spare more than that  that will do sir nothing smaller than ourselves is likely to interfere with us and if a large frigate engaged us we should not have more chance with a hundred men on board than with fifty in that case we shall have to trust to our legs of course if we fall in with two or three of the enemys ships i should run up the spanish flag i will find out if i can from the prisoners what is her private number if i hoist that and a spanish flag it ought to deceive them i will get her back to england if possible sir  you will of course take home my report mr lyons it is sure to give you your step i think  next day the san joaquin sailed and six weeks later a sloop of war brought despatches to the admiral among them was a letter from the admiralty to captain langton expressing their gratification at the very able arrangements by which he had captured and silenced a spanish battery and cut out the sloop of war san joaquin anchored under its guns without any loss of life it was they said a feat almost without parallel they stated that they had in accordance with his recommendation promoted mr lyons to the rank of commander and they confirmed mr rawdon in rank of first lieutenant the third lieutenant becoming second and the senior passed midshipman mr outram being promoted to that of third lieutenant  no change of any importance had taken place at gibraltar during the absence of the brilliant except that the governor had determined to retaliate for the nightly annoyance of the gunboats and accordingly six guns were fixed at a very considerable elevation behind the old mole and shells fired from them these reached the enemys camp and caused as could be seen from the heights great alarm and confusion it was determined that in future when the enemys gunboats bombarded our camps and huts we should retaliate by throwing shells into their camp  the day after the brilliant returned the helena sloop of warwith fourteen small gunswas seen working in towards the rock the wind however was so light that she scarcely moved through the water fourteen spanish gunboats came out to cut her off for a time she maintained a gallant contest against odds that seemed overwhelming although the garrison gave her up as lost but when the wind suddenly freshened she sailed through her opponents into the port where she was received with ringing cheers by the soldiers lining the batteries  week after week passed in minor hostilities there was a constant exchange of fire between our batteries and those of the enemy the gunboats continued their operations and we in return shelled their camp fresh works were erected on both sides casualties took place almost daily but both troops and inhabitants were now so accustomed to the continual firing that they went about their ordinary avocations without paying any attention to the shot and shell unless one of the latter fell close at hand  november came in and in spite of the heavy fire maintained by our batteries the enemys works continually advanced towards the rock and when in the middle of the month it was seen that the new batteries were being armed and placed in readiness to open fire the governor determined to take the offensive accordingly after gunfire on the evening of the twentysixth an order was issued for all the grenadier and light infantry companieswith the 12th and hardenbergs regimentto assemble at twelve oclock at nightwith a party of engineers and two hundred workmen from the line regimentsfor a sortie upon the enemys batteries the 39th and 59th regiments were to parade at the same hour to act as support to the attacking party a hundred sailors from the ships of war were to accompany them the attacking party numbered 1014 rank and file besides officers and noncommissioned officers this was exclusive of the two regiments forming the supports the attacking force was divided into three columns  at a quarter to three in the morning the column moved out the enemys pickets discovered the advance as soon as it passed the outlying work known as forbes barrier and after firing fell back lieutenant colonel hugos column which was in front pushed on rapidly and entered the enemys lines without opposition when the pioneers began to dismantle the work hardenbergs regiment and the central column attacked and carried the tremendous work known as the san carlos battery the enemy were unable to withstand for a moment the fierce attack of the troops and in a very short time the whole of the advanced works were in our hands  the leading corps formed up to resist any attempt the enemy might make to repel the sortie and the working parties began to destroy the enemys work faggots dipped in tar were laid against the fascines and gabions and in a short time columns of fire and smoke rose from all parts of the works occupied in an hour the object of the sortie was effected trains were laid to the magazines and the troops fell back just as they reached the town the principal magazine blew up with a tremendous explosion  the enemy appeared to have been wholly confounded at this sudden attack upon their advanced worksthe fugitives from which created a panic throughout the whole armyand although the main spanish lines mounting a hundred and thirtyfive heavy pieces of artillery were but a few hundred yards behind the works attacked not a single shot was fired at the troops engaged the batteries continued burning for three days and when they ceased to smoke nothing but heaps of sand remained of the works that had cost the enemy months of labour to erect  it was some days before the spaniards appeared to come to any definite conclusion as to their next step then large numbers of men set to work to reestablish their batteries and things fell into their old routine again every day shots were exchanged occasionally vessels made their way in and out being sometimes briskly chased by the enemys gunboats sometimes passing in with little interferencefor by this time the spaniards must have recognized that there was no hope whatever of reducing gibraltar by blockade there was a great deal of sickness in the garrison but comparatively little of this was due to scurvy for every available corner of ground was now cultivated and the supply of vegetablesif not absolutely sufficient to counteract the effects of so long and monotonous a diet of salt meatwas yet ample to prevent any serious outbreak of scurvy recurring  in february fresh activity was manifested among the besiegers vast numbers of mules were seen bringing fascines to their works at the end of march the vernon store ship arrived and a few hours later four transports with the 97th regiment under the convoy of two frigates came in  a singular series of casualties was caused by a single shot which entered an embrasure in williss battery took both legs off two men one leg off another and wounded another man in both legs thus four men had seven legs taken off or wounded by one shot these casualties were caused by the inattention of the men to the warning of a boy who was looking out for shot there were two boys in the garrison whose eyesight was so keen that they could see the enemys shot coming and both were employed in the batteries especially exposed to the enemys fire to warn the men to withdraw themselves into shelter when shot were coming  this quickness of eyesight was altogether exceptional standing behind a gunand knowing therefore the exact course the shot will takeit is comparatively easy for a quicksighted man to follow it but there are few indeed who can see a shot coming towards them in this respect the ear is a far better index than the eye a person possessed of a fair amount of nerve can judge to within a few yards the line that a shot coming towards him will take when first heard the sound is as a faint murmur increasing as it approaches to a sound resembling the blowing off of steam by an express engine as it rushes through a station at first the keenest ear could not tell the direction in which the shot is travelling but as it approaches the difference in the angle becomes perceptible to the ear and a calm listener will distinguish whether it will pass within twenty or thirty yards to the right or left it would require an extraordinary acute ear to determine more closely than this the angle of flight being so very small until the shot approaches almost within striking distance  the garrison had been trying experiments with carcasses and redhot shot a carcass is a hollow shot or shell pierced with holes but instead of being charged with powder to explode it either by means of a fuse or by percussion it is filled with a fierceburning composition so that upon falling it will set on fire anything inflammable near it redhot shot are fired by putting a wet wad in over the dry wad next to the powder the redhot shot is then run into the gun and rammed against the wet wad and the gun fired in the usual way the carcasses several times set fire to the enemys works but the use of the redhot shot was reserved for a pressing emergency a number of furnaces were constructed in the various batteries for heating the shot which necessarily required a considerable amount of time to bring them to a white heat  news came in april that great preparations were making at cadiz and other mediterranean ports for a fresh and vigorous attack on gibraltar and that the duc de crillonwho had lately captured minorcawould bring twenty thousand french and spanish troops in addition to those at present engaged in the siege that a large fleet would also be present and that the principal attack would be made by means of ships turned into floating batteries and protected by an immense thickness of cork or other wood  on the 9th of may the ships began to arrive among them were seven large vessels which appeared to be old menofwar a large number of workmen immediately went on board them and began to lower the topmasts this confirmed the news in respect to the floating batteries  about this time three store ships fortunately arrived from england with powder shell and other stores as there could be no longer any doubt that the attack was this time to be delivered on the sea face strong working parties were employed in strengthening the water batteries in erecting lines of palisades to prevent a landing from boats and in building furnaces for the heating of shot in these batteries also at this time the engineers began to drive a gallery through the rock facing the neutral ground in order to place guns there this work was carried on to the end of the siege and the batteries thus erected are now among the strongest of the defences of gibraltar  at the end of the month a great fleet consisting of upwards of a hundred sail entered the bay and anchored off algeciras some nine or ten thousand troops were landed and from that time scarce a day passed without fresh vessels laden with stores and materials for the siege arriving in the bay  early in may twelve gunboats that had been sent out in pieces from england were completed and launched each carried one gun and was manned by twentyone men six of these drew their crews from the brilliant five from the porcupine and one from the speedwell cutter these craft had been specially designed for the purpose of engaging the enemys gunboats and for convoying ships into the port  on the 11th of june a shell from the enemy burst just at the door of one of the magazines of williss battery this instantly blew up and the explosion was so violent that it seemed to shake the whole rock fourteen men were killed and fifteen wounded and a great deal of injury done to the battery but strong parties at once set to work to repair it a few days later a french convoy of sixty sail and three frigates anchored in the bay and from these another five thousand french troops landed  at the end of the month the duc de crillon arrived and took command of the besiegers a private letter that was brought in by a privateer that had captured a merchantman on her way gave the garrison an idea of the method in which the attack was to be made it stated that ten ships were to be fortified six or seven feet thick with green timber bolted with iron and covered with cork junk and raw hides they were to carry guns of heavy metal and to be bombproof on the top with a descent for the shells to slide off these vessels which they supposed would be impregnable were to be moored within half gunshot of the walls with iron chains and large boats with mantlets were to lie off at some distance full of troops ready to take advantage of occurrences that the mantlets of these boats were to be formed with hinges to fall down to facilitate their landing there would by that time be forty thousand men in camp but the principal attack was to be made by sea to be covered by a squadron of menofwar with bomb ketches floating batteries gun and mortar boats etc and that the comte dartoisbrother to the king of francewith other great personages was to be present at the attack  at this time the enemy fired but little and the garrison were able to turn their whole attention to strengthen the points most threatened the activity of the enemy on their offensive works on the neutral ground continued and in one night a strong and lofty work five hundred yards long with a communication thirteen hundred yards long to the works was raised it was calculated that ten thousand men at least must have been employed upon it and no less than a million and a half sandbags used in its construction  there could be no doubt now that the critical moment was approaching and that ere long the garrison would be exposed to the most tremendous fire ever opened upon a besieged place    chapter 17 the floating batteries   in spite of the unremitting work of the daily cannonade of illness and hardship life on the rock had not been unpleasant to the ohallorans although many of the officers wives had at one time or another taken advantage of ships sailing from the port to return homeor rather to endeavour to do so for a considerable number of the vessels that left were captured by the spaniards before getting through the straitsthere still remained sufficient for agreeable society and the ohallorans was more than any other house the general meeting place  from its position in the hollow it was sheltered from the fire of all the shore batterieswhose long distance shots searched all the lower parts of the rockwhile the resources of the establishment enabled the ohallorans to afford an openhanded hospitality that would have been wholly beyond the means of others they had long since given up selling any of their produce distributing all their surplus eggs among families where there was illness or sending them up to the hospitals and doing the same with their chickens and vegetables the greatest care was bestowed upon the poultry fresh broods being constantly raised so that they could kill eight or ten couple a week and still keep up their stock to its full strength thus with gatherings two evenings a week at their own house and usually as many at the houses of their friends while captain ohalloran and bob frequently dined at the mess of their own or other regiments the time passed pleasantly  while carrie was fully occupied with the care of the house and a general superintendence of what they called their farm bob was never at a loss for amusement there was always something to see some fresh work being executed some fresh development in the defences while he was on terms of friendship with almost every officer in the garrison it was two years and a half since he had come out and he was now eighteen his constant intercourse with people older than himself and with the officers of the garrison together with the exceptional position in which he found himself made him in some respects seem older than he was but he still retained his liveliness and love of fun his spirits never flagged and he was a general favourite with all who knew him  on the 19th of august a boat with a flag of truce brought in a complimentary letter from the duc de crillon to the governor informing him of the arrival of the comte dartois and the duc de bourbon in his camp and sending him a present of ice fruit partridges and other delicacies the governor returned a letter in similar complimentary terms thanking the duke for his letter and the presents but declining with thanks the supplies that had been offered saying that he never received for himself anything beyond what was common to the garrison  the sailors of the ships of war now pitched tents ashore for their use when they should be ordered to land to take part in the defence and the heavy guns were for the most part moved down from the upper batteries to the sea lines day after day passed the bombardment being constantly expected but the damage inflicted by fire on the enemys works by our carcasses delayed the attack  on the 8th of september a tremendous fire was suddenly opened with red hot shot and carcasses upon the enemys works the mahon battery was burned while the san carlos and san marten batteries were so damaged that they had almost to be rebuilt the enemy as on previous occasions showed extreme bravery in their efforts to extinguish the fire and to repair damages and it was afterwards known that the french troops alone had a hundred and forty killed and wounded the damage done probably convinced the duc de crillon that no advantage could be hoped for by trying further to increase his works and at half past five next morning a volley of sixty shells was fired by their mortar batteries followed by the discharge of one hundred and seventy pieces of heavy artillery  this tremendous fire was kept up for some time while nine lineofbattle ships supported by fifteen gun and mortar boats passed to and fro along the sea face pouring in their fire upon us at nightfall the enemys guns ceased firing but their mortars kept up their shell fire all night the next day the ships of war renewed their attack as did the land batteries in the course of the day the brilliant and porcupine frigates were scuttled by the navy alongside the new mole and their crews landed  on the following day the enemys fire was principally directed against the barrier and chevaux de frise in front of the land port and in the afternoon these barriers and palisades were all in flames and the troops at that end of the rock got under arms in case an attack should be made  on the morning of the 12th the combined fleets of france and spain consisting of thirtyeight menofwar three frigates and a number of smaller craft sailed into the bay and anchored near algeciras their fleet now consisted of fortyseven menofwar ten battering shipsconsidered invincible and carrying two hundred and twelve gunsand innumerable frigates and small ships of war while on the land side were batteries mounting two hundred heavy guns and an army of forty thousand men tremendous odds indeed against a fortress whose garrison consisted of seven thousand effective men including the marine brigade  for some days past bob had been engaged with their landlord and some hired labourers in bringing in earth and filling up the lower rooms four feet deep in order to render the cellars bomb proof some beds and furniture were taken below so that carrie the servants and the spanish family could retire there in case the enemys shells fell thickly round the house  it was noticed as a curious incident that just as the combined fleet entered the bay an eagle after circling round it perched for a few minutes upon the summit of the flag post on the highest point of the rock an omen of victory which would have been considered decisive by the romans and which did in fact help to raise the spirits and confidence of the garrison  on the morning of the 13th the enemys battering ships got under way with a gentle breeze from the northwest and at a little past nine oclock anchored in admirable order in line of the sea face the nearest was about nine hundred yards from the kings bastion the most distant being about eleven hundred yards not a shot was fired before the enemy anchored and then the whole of the batteries that commanded them opened fire to which the battering ships and the artillery in their lines at once replied  bob was standing on the roof of the house with his sister  what a magnificent sight carrie he exclaimed it is well worth all the waiting to be here to see it  it is terrible carrie said it is like one great roar of thunder how awfully the men must be suffering in the batteries  i dont suppose it is as bad as it looks bob said at any rate you neednt be uneasy about gerald all the troops except those working the guns are in shelter and wont be called out unless the enemy attempt to land  i wonder their fleet dont come across to help their batteries i suppose they are afraid of the carcasses and red hot shot  well there is one comfort carrie none of their shot are coming this way their floating batteries evidently are firing only at our batteries by the water as to the others we know that we are safe enough from them though certainly the shot do make a most unpleasant noise as they fly overhead  i wish there was a little more wind to blow away the smoke so that we could see what effect our fire is having on those hulks i shouldnt think that we had begun with red hot shot yet it takes three hours to get them hot enough as far as i can see whenever the wind blows the smoke away a little our shot and shell roll off the roofs and sides without doing any damage to speak of  about noon the enemys mortar boats and ketches attempted to come across and assist their battering ships but the wind had changed and had worked round to the southwest blowing a smart breeze and bringing in a heavy swell so that they were prevented from taking part in the action our own gunboats were hindered by the same cause from putting out and opening a flanking fire upon the battering ships  the northern batteries by the water suffered heavily from the fire of the spanish lines which took them in flank and indeed some of the batteries in reverse causing many casualties the artillery however refused to let their attention be diverted from the battering ships  by two oclock the furnaces had heated the shot in all the batteries and although some of them had been firing these missiles for upwards of an hour it was not until two that their use became general soon afterwardswhen the wind cleared away the smoke from the shipsmen could be seen on their sloping roofs directing streams of water from the pumps upon small wreaths of smoke that curled up here and there up to this time the defenders had begun to fear that the craft were indeed as invulnerable as the spaniards believed them to be but these evidences that the red hot shot were doing their work greatly roused their spirits and cheers frequently rose as the men toiled at their heavy guns  as the afternoon went on the smoke from the upper part of the spanish admirals flagship rose more and more thickly and although numbers of men continued to bring up and throw water over the roofworking with extraordinary bravery in spite of the hail of projectiles poured upon themit was clear that the fire was making steady progress  bob had long before this gone down to the works by the sea facewhere considerable bodies of troops were lying in the bombproof casemates in readiness for action if called uponand from time to time he went out with captain ohalloran and other officers to see how matters were going on  in sheltered places behind the batteries some of the surgeons were at work temporarily binding up the wounds of artillerymen struck with shell or splinters after which they were carried by stretcher parties of the infantry up to the hospitals dr burke was thus engaged in the battery where his regiment was stationed he had since the first bombardment commenced ceased to complain of the want of opportunities for exercising himself in his professional work and had been indefatigable in his attendance on the wounded among them he was an immense favourite he had a word and a joke for every man who came under his hands while his confident manner and cheery talk kept up the spirits of the men he was too a very skilful operator and many of the poor fellows in hospital had urgently requested that if they must lose a limb it should be under the hands of dr burke  it is much better to make men laugh than to make them cry he would say to bob it is half the battle gained when you can keep up a patients spirit it is wonderful how some of them stand pain the hard work they have been doing is all in their favour  bob several times went out to him and assisted him as far as he could by handing him bandages sponges etc  you ought to have been an assistant from the beginning bob he said by this time you would have been quite a decent surgeononly you have a silly way of turning pale there hand me that bandage  all right my man we will have you patched up in no time  no i dont think you can go back to your gun again you will have to eat and drink a bit and make fresh blood before you will be much use at a thirtytwo pounder again  what is thisa scalp wound splinter of a shell eh well it is lucky for you lad that you have been hardening your skull a bit before you enlisted a few clips from a blackthorn are capital preparation i dont think you will come to much harm you are not more hurt than you would be in a good lively faction fight  there you had better put down that sponge bob and go into the casemate for a bit you are getting white again  i think we are over the worst now for if as you tell me the smoke is beginning to come up from some of those floating batteries their fire will soon slacken a bit as long as they keep out the shot those defences of theirs are first rate but as soon as the shot begin to embed themselves in the roof they are worse than nothingfor they can neither dig out the shot nor get at them with the water once establish a fire and it is pretty sure to spread  bob was glad to get back again into the bombproof casemates for there was comparative quiet while outside the constant roar of the guns the howl of shot the explosion of shell and the crash of masonry created a din that was almost bewildering  presently a cheer was heard in the battery and bob went out to see what it was and returned with the news that the ship next to the spanish admirals was also smoking in several places as the afternoon went on confusion was apparent on board several of the battering ships and by the evening their fire had slackened considerably before eight oclock it had almost entirely ceased except from one or two ships to the northward of the line which being somewhat farther from the shore had suffered less than the others  at sunset the artillery in our batteries were relievedthe naval brigade taking their placeand the fire was continued without relaxation as soon as it became dark rockets were fired by several of the battering ships these were answered by the spanish menofwar and many boats rowed across to the floating batteries by ten oclock the flames began to burst out from the admirals battering ship and by midnight she was completely in flames the light assisted our gunnerswho were able to lay their cannon with as much accuracy as during the daytimeand the whole rock was illuminated by the flames these presently burst out vigorously from the next ship and between three and four oclock points of light appeared upon six of the other hulks  at three oclock brigadier curtiswho commanded the naval brigade encamped at europa pointfinding that the sea had gone down manned the gunboats and rowing out for some distance opened a heavy flanking fire upon the battering ships compelling the boats that were lying in shelter behind them to retire as the day broke he captured two of the enemys launches and finding from the prisoners that there were still numbers of men on board the hulks rowed out to rescue them while he was employed at this work at five oclock one of the battering ships to the northward blew up with a tremendous explosion and a quarter of an hour later another in the centre of the line also blew up the wreck was scattered over a wide extent of water  one of the gunboats was sunk and another seriously injured and the brigadier fearing other explosions ordered the boats to draw off towards the town on the way however he visited two of the other burning ships and rescued some more of those left behindlanding in all nine officers two priests and three hundred and thirtyfour soldiers and seamen besides these one officer and eleven frenchmen had floated ashore the evening before on the shattered fragments of a launch  while the boats in the navy were thus endeavouring to save their foes the land batterieswhich had ceased firing on the previous eveningagain opened on the garrison but as from some of the camps the boats could be perceived at their humane work orders were despatched to the batteries to cease fire and a dead silence succeeded the din that had gone on for nearly twentyfour hours  of the six battering ships still in flames three blew up before eleven oclock the other three burned to the waters edgethe magazines having been drowned by the spaniards before they left the ships in their boats the garrison hoped that the two remaining battering ships might be saved to be sent home as trophies of the victory but about noon one of them suddenly burst into flames and presently blew up the other was examined by the menofwar boats and found to be so injured that she could not be saved she was accordingly set fire to and also destroyed thus the whole of the ten vessels that were considered by their constructors to be invincible were destroyed  the loss of the enemy in killed and prisoners was estimated at two thousand while the casualties of the garrison were astonishingly small consisting only of one officer and fifteen noncommissioned officers and men killed and five officers and sixtythree men wounded very little damage was done to the works it is supposed that the smoke enveloping the vessels prevented accurate aim the chief object of the attack was to silence the kings bastion and upon this two of the largest ships concentrated their fire while the rest endeavoured to effect a breach in the wall between that battery and the battery next to it  the enemy had three hundred heavy cannon engaged while the garrison had a hundred and six cannon and mortars the distance at which the batteries were moored from the shore was greatly in favour of the efforts of our artillery as the range was almost point blank and the guns did not require to be elevated thus the necessity for using two wads between the powder and the redhot balls was obviated and the gunners were able to fire much more rapidly than they would otherwise have done the number of the spanish soldiers on board the battery ships was 5260 in addition to the sailors required to work the ships  great activity was manifested by the spaniards on the day following the failure of their bombardment and large numbers of men were employed in bringing up fresh ammunition to their batteries many of the menofwar also got under way major harcourt doctor burke and two or three other officers stood watching the movements from the ohallorans terrace  i should have thought that they had had enough of it doctor burke said if those battering ships couldnt withstand our fire what chance would their menofwar have  see they are just as busy on the land side and the 71st has been ordered to send down extra guards to the land port i should have thought they had given it up as a bad job this time  i have no doubt they have given it up doctor major harcourt said but they are not likely to say so just yet after all the preparations that have been made and the certainty expressed about our capture by the allied armies and navies of france and spain and having two or three royal princes down here to grace the victory you dont suppose they are going to acknowledge to the world that they are beaten i should have thought you would have known human nature better than that doctor  you will see de crillon will send a pompous report of the affair saying that the battering ships were found owing to faults in their construction to be of far less utility than had been expected and that therefore they had been burned they had however inflicted enormous loss upon the garrison and defences and the siege would now be taken up by the army and fleet and vigorously pushed to a successful termination  that will be the sort of thing i would bet a months pay the last thing a spanish commander will confess is that he is beaten and i think it likely enough that they will carry on the siege for months yet so as to keep up appearances in fact committed as they are to it i dont see how they can give it up without making themselves the laughingstock of europe but now that they find they have no chance of getting the object for which they went to war i fancy you will see before very long they will begin to negotiate for peace  the majors anticipations were verified for some time the siege was carried on with considerable vigourfrom a thousand to twelve hundred shots being fired daily into the fortress their works on the neutral ground were pushed forward and an attempt was made at night to blow out a portion of the face of the rock by placing powder in a cavebut the attempt was detected  the position of the garrison became more comfortable after a british fleet arrived with two more regiments and a large convoy of merchantmen but nothing of any importance took place till on the 2d of february 1782 the duc de crillon sent in to say that the preliminaries of a general peace had been signed by great britain france and spain and three days later the blockade at sea was discontinued and the port of gibraltar again open  bob repton however was not present at the concluding scenes of the great drama satisfied after the failure of the bombardment that there would be no more serious fighting and that the interest of the siege was at an end he took advantage of the arrival of the antelope in the bay a few days after the engagement to return in her to england he had now been two years and eight months on the rock and felt that he ought to go home to take his place with his uncle  he had benefited greatly by his stay in gibraltar he had acquired the spanish language thoroughly and in other respects had carried on his studies under the direction of doctor burke and had employed much of his leisure time with instructive reading mixing so much with the officers of the garrison he had acquired a good manner and address he had been present at the most memorable siege of the times and had gained the credit of havingthough but a volunteerhis name twice placed in general orders for good services he had landed a school boy he was now a wellbuilt young fellow of medium height and powerful frame but he had retained his boyish frank good humour and his love of fun  i trust that we shall be back in england before long his sister said to him everyone expects that spain will make peace before many months are over and it is likely that the regiments who have gone through the hardships of the siege will soon be relieved so i hope that in a year or two we may be ordered home again  there was a great deal of regret expressed when it was known that bob repton was going home for he had always been ready to do any acts of kindness in his powerespecially to children of whom he was very fondand it was not forgotten that his daring enterprise in going out alone to fetch in fruit had saved many of their lives amy harcourts eyes were very red when he went up to say goodbye to her and her mother an hour before he sailed and the farewells were spoken with quivering lips  the antelope evaded the enemys cruisers near the rock and made a quick passage to england without adventure she had made two or three good prizes up the spanish coast before she put into gibraltar on her way home captain lockett therefore did not go out of his way to look for more  on arriving at portsmouth bob at once went up to london by coach he had no lack of clothes having purchased the effects of an officer of nearly his own build and stature who had been killed a short time before on alighting from the coach he walked to philpot lane and went straight into the counting house his old acquaintance jack medlin was sitting on the stool his father had formerly occupied and bob was greatly amused at the air of gravity on his face  do you wish to see mr bale or mr medlin sir he asked or can i take your orders  you are a capital imitator of your father jack bob said as he brought his hand down heavily on the shoulder of the young clerk who stared at him in astonishment  why it is bobi mean mr repton he exclaimed  its bob repton jack sure enough and glad i am to see you why it is nearly three years since we met and we have both altered a good bit since then  well is my uncle in  no he is out at present but my father is in the inner office  bob strode into the inner office and greeted mr medlin as heartily as he had done his son and mr medlin for the first time since he had entered philpot lane as a boy forgot that he was within the sacred precincts of the city and for at least ten minutes laughed and talked as freely and unrestrainedly as if he had been out at highgate  your uncle will be delighted to see you back he said he is for ever talking about you and there wasnt a prouder man in the city of london than he was when the despatches were published and your name appeared twice as having rendered great service he became a little afraid at one time that you might take to soldiering altogether but i told him that i thought there was no fear of that after you had once refused to take a midshipmans berthwith its prospect of getting away from schooli did not think it likely that you would be tempted now  no the general told captain ohalloran that he would get me a commission if i liked but i had not the least ambition that way i have had a fine opportunity of seeing war and have had a jolly time of it and now i am quite ready to settle down here  mr bale was delighted on his return to find bob it was just the hour for closing and he insisted upon mr medlin stopping to take supper with him bob had written whenever there was an opportunity of sending letters but many of these had never come to hand and there was much to tell and talk about  well i am thoroughly satisfied with the success of our experiment mr medlin mr bale said next day bob has turned out exactly what i hoped he woulda fine young fellow and a gentleman he has excellent manners and yet there is nothing foppish or affected about him  i had no fear of that with bob mr bale and indeed gibraltar during the siege must have been a bad school for anyone to learn that sort of thing military men may amuse themselves with follies of that kind when they have nothing better to do but it is thrown aside and their best qualities come out when they have such work to do as they have had there  yes i agree with you sir the experiment has turned out capitally and your nephew is in every respect a far better man than he would have been if he had been kept mewed up here these three years he is a young fellow that anyonei dont care who he ismight feel proud of  so bob took up his duties in the office and his only complaint there was that he could hardly find enough to do mr bale had relaxed his close attention to the business since he had taken mr medlin into the firm but as that gentleman was perfectly capable of carrying it on single handed bobs share of it was easy enough it was not long before he complained to his uncle that he really did not find enough to do  well bob you shall come down with me to a place i have bought out by chislehurst it is a tidy little estate i bought it a year ago it is a nice distance from townjust a pleasant ride or drive up i am thinking of moving my establishment down there altogether and as you will have it some day i should like your opinion of it it isnt quite ready yet i have been having it thoroughly done up but the men will be out in a week or two  bob was greatly pleased with the house which was a fine one and very pleasantly situated in large grounds  there are seventy or eighty acres of land mr bale said they are let to a farmer at present he only has them by the year and i think it will be an amusement to you to take them in hand and look after them yourself i know a good many people living about here and i have no doubt we shall have quite as much society as we care for  another month and they were established at chislehurst and bob found the life there very pleasant he generally drove his uncle up to town in the morning getting to the office at ten oclock and leaving it at five in the afternoon on his return home there was the garden to see about and the stables very often his uncle brought a city friend or two home with him for the night and they soon had a large circle of acquaintances in the neighbourhood  i should like you to marry young bob mr bale said to him one day i did not marry young and so you see i have never married at all and have wasted my life shockingly in consequence when you are ready to marry i am ready to give you the means dont forget that  i wont forget it sir bob said smiling and i will try to meet your wishes  mr bale looked at him sharply carries letters were long and chatty and it may be that mr bale had gleaned from them some notion of an idea that carrie and mrs harcourt had in their heads  three years later mr bale remarked as they were driving home  by the way bob i was glad to see in the paper today that the 58th is ordered home  is it sir bob asked eagerly i have not looked at the paper today i am glad to hear that i thought it wouldnt be long but there is never any sayingthey might have been sent somewhere else instead of being sent home  i hope they will be quartered somewhere within reach mr bale said if they are stationed at cork or some outlandish place in ireland they might almost as well be at gibraltar for anything we shall see of them  oh we can manage to run over to cork uncle  there will be no occasion to do that bob captain ohalloran will be getting leave soon after he comes over and then he can bring carrie here  and he smiled slily to himself  he maynt be able to get leave for some time bob said i think uncle i shall run over directly they arrive  perhaps the firm wont be able to spare you mr bale remarked  it is my opinion the firm would get on just as well without me or an indefinite time uncle  not at all bob mr medlin was saying only a few days ago that you do quite your share of the work and that he generally leaves it to you now to see country customers when i am out and thinks the change has been an advantage to the business however if the regiment does go to irelandas is likely enoughi suppose we must manage to spare you  it was indeed soon known that the 58th were in the first place to be disembarked at cork and one day mr bale came into the office  i have just seen your friend lockett bob i mean the younger one he commands the antelope now you know his uncle has retired and bought a place near southampton and settled down there young lockett came up from portsmouth by the night coach he put in at gibraltar on his way home and the 58th were to embark three days after he left so if you want to meet them when they arrive at cork you had better lose no time but start by the night coach for bristol and cross in the packet from there  it was a month before bob returned the evening that he did so he said to his uncle  i think uncle you said that you were anxious that i should marry young  that is so bob mr bale said gravely  well uncle i have been doing my best to carry out your wishes  you dont mean to say bob mr bale said in affected alarm that you are going to marry a soldiers daughter  well yes sir bob said a little taken aback but i dont know how you guessed it it is a young lady i knew in gibraltar  what bob not that girl who went running about with you dressed up as a boy  as this was a portion of his adventures upon which bob had been altogether reticent he sat for a moment confounded  dont be ashamed of it bob mr bale said with a smile laying his hand kindly on his shoulder your sister carrie is an excellent young woman and it is not difficult to read her thoughts in her letters of course she told me about your adventure with miss harcourt and she has mentioned her a good many times since and it did not need a great deal of discernment to see what carries opinion was regarding the young lady carrie has her weak pointsas for example when she took up with that wild irishmanbut she has plenty of good sense and i am sure by the way she wrote about this miss harcourt that she must be a very charming girl and i think bob i have been looking forward almost as much to the regiment coming home as you have  regarding you as i do as my son there is nothing i should like so much as having a bright pretty daughterinlaw so you have my hearty consent and approval even before you ask for it  and you found her very nice bobeh  very nice sir bob said smiling  and very pretty bob  very pretty sir i never thought that she would have grown up so pretty  and her head has not been turned by the compliments that she has of course received  i dont think so sir she said her mind has been made up ever since i brought her back to gibraltar so you see the compliments did not go for much  well bob i will write to major harcourt i shall hand you over this place altogether and settle down in my old quarters in philpot lane  no no sir bob said  but i say yes bob i shall keep a room here and i dare say i shall often use it but i have been rather like a fish out of water since i came here and shall be well content to fall into my old ways again knowing that if i want any change and bright society i can come down here if i find i am restless therewhich is not likelyi can buy a little place and settle down beside you as i told you long ago i am a rich mani have been doing nothing but save money all my lifeand though as i then said i should like you to carry on the firm after i am gone there will as far as money goes be no occasion for you to do so  two months later the three members of the firm went over to cork and there a gay wedding was celebrated and when at the termination of the honeymoon bob returned to chislehurst he found captain ohalloran and carrie established there on a months leave and a day or two later the party was increased by the arrival of doctor burke  mr bale lived for twenty years after bobs marriage the last fifteen of which were passed in a little place he bought adjoining that of the reptons and before he died he saw four grandchildrenas he called themfast growing up  general and mrs harcourt also settled down in the neighbourhood to be near their only daughter a few years before mr bales death  doctor burke remained with the regiment for some years and then bought a practice in dublin but to the end of his life he paid a visit every three or four years to his former pupil  captain ohalloran obtained the rank of colonel but losing an arm at the capture of martinique in 1794 he retired from the army and settled at woolwichwhere carrie was within easy reach of chislehursthaving his pension and a comfortable income which mr bale settled upon carrie at mr bales death it was found that he had left his house at chislehurst to carrie and she and her husband accordingly established themselves there  bob to the end of his life declared thatalthough in all things he had been an exceptionally happy and fortunate manthe most fortunate occurrence that ever happened to him was that he should have taken part in the famous siege of gibraltar
