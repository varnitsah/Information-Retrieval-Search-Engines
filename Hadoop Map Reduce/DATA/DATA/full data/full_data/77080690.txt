77080690	the mutiny of the elsinore   by jack london  mills  boon limited 49 rupert street london w  published 1915  copyright in the united states of america by jack london     chapter i   from the first the voyage was going wrong  routed out of my hotel on a bitter march morning i had crossed baltimore and reached the pierend precisely on time  at nine oclock the tug was to have taken me down the bay and put me on board the elsinore and with growing irritation i sat frozen inside my taxicab and waited  on the seat outside the driver and wada sat hunched in a temperature perhaps half a degree colder than mine  and there was no tug  possum the foxterrier puppy galbraith had so inconsiderately foisted upon me whimpered and shivered on my lap inside my greatcoat and under the fur robe  but he would not settle down  continually he whimpered and clawed and struggled to get out  and once out and bitten by the cold with equal insistence he whimpered and clawed to get back  his unceasing plaint and movement was anything but sedative to my jangled nerves  in the first place i was uninterested in the brute  he meant nothing to me  i did not know him  time and again as i drearily waited i was on the verge of giving him to the driver  once when two little girlsevidently the wharfingers daughterswent by my hand reached out to the door to open it so that i might call to them and present them with the puling little wretch  a farewell surprise package from galbraith he had arrived at the hotel the night before by express from new york  it was galbraiths way  yet he might so easily have been decently like other folk and sent fruit    or flowers even  but no his affectionate inspiration had to take the form of a yelping yapping two months old puppy  and with the advent of the terrier the trouble had begun  the hotel clerk judged me a criminal before the act i had not even had time to meditate  and then wada on his own initiative and out of his own foolish stupidity had attempted to smuggle the puppy into his room and been caught by a house detective promptly wada had forgotten all his english and lapsed into hysterical japanese and the house detective remembered only his irish while the hotel clerk had given me to understand in no uncertain terms that it was only what he had expected of me  damn the dog anyway  and damn galbraith too  and as i froze on in the cab on that bleak pierend i damned myself as well and the mad freak that had started me voyaging on a sailingship around the horn  by ten oclock a nondescript youth arrived on foot carrying a suitcase which was turned over to me a few minutes later by the wharfinger  it belonged to the pilot he said and gave instructions to the chauffeur how to find some other pier from which at some indeterminate time i should be taken aboard the elsinore by some other tug  this served to increase my irritation  why should i not have been informed as well as the pilot  an hour later still in my cab and stationed at the shore end of the new pier the pilot arrived  anything more unlike a pilot i could not have imagined  here was no bluejacketed weatherbeaten son of the sea but a softspoken gentleman for all the world the type of successful business man one meets in all the clubs  he introduced himself immediately and i invited him to share my freezing cab with possum and the baggage  that some change had been made in the arrangements by captain west was all he knew though he fancied the tug would come along any time  and it did at one in the afternoon after i had been compelled to wait and freeze for four mortal hours  during this time i fully made up my mind that i was not going to like this captain west  although i had never met him his treatment of me from the outset had been to say the least cavalier  when the elsinore lay in erie basin just arrived from california with a cargo of barley i had crossed over from new york to inspect what was to be my home for many months  i had been delighted with the ship and the cabin accommodation  even the stateroom selected for me was satisfactory and far more spacious than i had expected  but when i peeped into the captains room i was amazed at its comfort  when i say that it opened directly into a bathroom and that among other things it was furnished with a big brass bed such as one would never suspect to find at sea i have said enough  naturally i had resolved that the bathroom and the big brass bed should be mine  when i asked the agents to arrange with the captain they seemed noncommittal and uncomfortable  i dont know in the least what it is worth i said  and i dont care  whether it costs one hundred and fifty dollars or five hundred i must have those quarters  harrison and gray the agents debated silently with each other and scarcely thought captain west would see his way to the arrangement  then he is the first sea captain i ever heard of that wouldnt i asserted confidently  why the captains of all the atlantic liners regularly sell their quarters  but captain west is not the captain of an atlantic liner mr harrison observed gently  remember i am to be on that ship many a month i retorted  why heavens bid him up to a thousand if necessary  well try said mr gray but we warn you not to place too much dependence on our efforts  captain west is in searsport at the present time and we will write him today  to my astonishment mr gray called me up several days later to inform me that captain west had declined my offer  did you offer him up to a thousand i demanded  what did he say  he regretted that he was unable to concede what you asked mr gray replied  a day later i received a letter from captain west  the writing and the wording were oldfashioned and formal  he regretted not having yet met me and assured me that he would see personally that my quarters were made comfortable  for that matter he had already dispatched orders to mr pike the first mate of the elsinore to knock out the partition between my stateroom and the spare stateroom adjoining  furtherand here is where my dislike for captain west beganhe informed me that if when once well at sea i should find myself dissatisfied he would gladly in that case exchange quarters with me  of course after such a rebuff i knew that no circumstance could ever persuade me to occupy captain wests brass bed  and it was this captain nathaniel west whom i had not yet met who had now kept me freezing on pierends through four miserable hours  the less i saw of him on the voyage the better was my decision and it was with a little tickle of pleasure that i thought of the many boxes of books i had dispatched on board from new york  thank the lord i did not depend on sea captains for entertainment  i turned possum over to wada who was settling with the cabman and while the tugs sailors were carrying my luggage on board i was led by the pilot to an introduction with captain west  at the first glimpse i knew that he was no more a sea captain than the pilot was a pilot  i had seen the best of the breed the captains of the liners and he no more resembled them than did he resemble the blufffaced gruffvoiced skippers i had read about in books  by his side stood a woman of whom little was to be seen and who made a warm and gorgeous blob of colour in the huge muff and boa of red fox in which she was wellnigh buried  my godhis wife i darted in a whisper at the pilot  going along with him      i had expressly stipulated with mr harrison when engaging passage that the one thing i could not possibly consider was the skipper of the elsinore taking his wife on the voyage  and mr harrison had smiled and assured me that captain west would sail unaccompanied by a wife  its his daughter the pilot replied under his breath  come to see him off i fancy  his wife died over a year ago  they say that is what sent him back to sea  hed retired you know  captain west advanced to meet me and before our outstretched hands touched before his face broke from repose to greeting and the lips moved to speech i got the first astonishing impact of his personality  long lean in his face a touch of race i as yet could only sense he was as cool as the day was cold as poised as a king or emperor as remote as the farthest fixed star as neutral as a proposition of euclid  and then just ere our hands met a twinkle ofohsuch distant and controlled geniality quickened the many tiny wrinkles in the corner of the eyes the clear blue of the eyes was suffused by an almost colourful warmth the face too seemed similarly to suffuse the thin lips harsh set the instant before were as gracious as bernhardts when she moulds sound into speech  so curiously was i affected by this first glimpse of captain west that i was aware of expecting to fall from his lips i knew not what words of untold beneficence and wisdom  yet he uttered most commonplace regrets at the delay in a voice provocative of fresh surprise to me  it was low and gentle almost too low yet clear as a bell and touched with a faint reminiscent twang of old new england  and this is the young woman who is guilty of the delay he concluded my introduction to his daughter  margaret this is mr pathurst  her gloved hand promptly emerged from the foxskins to meet mine and i found myself looking into a pair of gray eyes bent steadily and gravely upon me  it was discomfiting that cool penetrating searching gaze  it was not that it was challenging but that it was so insolently business like  it was much in the very way one would look at a new coachman he was about to engage  i did not know then that she was to go on the voyage and that her curiosity about the man who was to be a fellowpassenger for half a year was therefore only natural  immediately she realized what she was doing and her lips and eyes smiled as she spoke  as we moved on to enter the tugs cabin i heard possums shivering whimper rising to a screech and went forward to tell wada to take the creature in out of the cold  i found him hovering about my luggage wedging my dressingcase securely upright by means of my little automatic rifle  i was startled by the mountain of luggage around which mine was no more than a fringe  ships stores was my first thought until i noted the number of trunks boxes suitcases and parcels and bundles of all sorts  the initials on what looked suspiciously like a womans hat trunk caught my eyemw  yet captain wests first name was nathaniel on closer investigation i did find several nws but everywhere i could see mws  then i remembered that he had called her margaret  i was too angry to return to the cabin and paced up and down the cold deck biting my lips with vexation  i had so expressly stipulated with the agents that no captains wife was to come along  the last thing under the sun i desired in the pet quarters of a ship was a woman  but i had never thought about a captains daughter  for two cents i was ready to throw the voyage over and return on the tug to baltimore  by the time the wind caused by our speed had chilled me bitterly i noticed miss west coming along the narrow deck and could not avoid being struck by the spring and vitality of her walk  her face despite its firm moulding had a suggestion of fragility that was belied by the robustness of her body  at least one would argue that her body must be robust from her fashion of movement of it though little could one divine the lines of it under the shapelessness of the furs  i turned away on my heel and fell moodily to contemplating the mountain of luggage  a huge packingcase attracted my attention and i was staring at it when she spoke at my shoulder  thats what really caused the delay she said  what is it i asked incuriously  why the elsinores piano all renovated  when i made up my mind to come i telegraphed mr pikehes the mate you know  he did his best it was the fault of the piano house  and while we waited today i gave them a piece of my mind theyll not forget in a hurry  she laughed at the recollection and commenced to peep and peer into the luggage as if in search of some particular piece  having satisfied herself she was starting back when she paused and said  wont you come into the cabin where its warm  we wont be there for half an hour  when did you decide to make this voyage i demanded abruptly  so quick was the look she gave me that i knew she had in that moment caught all my disgruntlement and disgust  two days ago she answered  why  her readiness for give and take took me aback and before i could speak she went on  now youre not to be at all silly about my coming mr pathurst  i probably know more about longvoyaging than you do and were all going to be comfortable and happy  you cant bother me and i promise you i wont bother you  ive sailed with passengers before and ive learned to put up with more than they ever proved they were able to put up with so there  let us start right and it wont be any trouble to keep on going right  i know what is the matter with you  you think youll be called upon to entertain me  please know that i do not need entertainment  i never saw the longest voyage that was too long and i always arrive at the end with too many things not done for the passage ever to have been tedious and    i dont play chopsticks     chapter ii   the elsinore freshloaded with coal lay very deep in the water when we came alongside  i knew too little about ships to be capable of admiring her lines and besides i was in no mood for admiration  i was still debating with myself whether or not to chuck the whole thing and return on the tug  from all of which it must not be taken that i am a vacillating type of man  on the contrary  the trouble was that at no time from the first thought of it had i been keen for the voyage  practically the reason i was taking it was because there was nothing else i was keen on  for some time now life had lost its savour  i was not jaded nor was i exactly bored  but the zest had gone out of things  i had lost taste for my fellowmen and all their foolish little serious endeavours  for a far longer period i had been dissatisfied with women  i had endured them but i had been too analytic of the faults of their primitiveness of their almost ferocious devotion to the destiny of sex to be enchanted with them  and i had come to be oppressed by what seemed to me the futility of arta pompous legerdemain a consummate charlatanry that deceived not only its devotees but its practitioners  in short i was embarking on the elsinore because it was easier to than not yet everything else was as equally and perilously easy  that was the curse of the condition into which i had fallen  that was why as i stepped upon the deck of the elsinore i was half of a mind to tell them to keep my luggage where it was and bid captain west and his daughter goodday  i almost think what decided me was the welcoming hospitable smile miss west gave me as she started directly across the deck for the cabin and the knowledge that it must be quite warm in the cabin  mr pike the mate i had already met when i visited the ship in erie basin  he smiled a stiff crackfaced smile that i knew must be painful but did not offer to shake hands turning immediately to call orders to halfadozen frozenlooking youths and aged men who shambled up from somewhere in the waist of the ship  mr pike had been drinking  that was patent  his face was puffed and discoloured and his large gray eyes were bitter and bloodshot  i lingered with a sinking heart watching my belongings come aboard and chiding my weakness of will which prevented me from uttering the few words that would put a stop to it  as for the halfdozen men who were now carrying the luggage aft into the cabin they were unlike any concept i had ever entertained of sailors  certainly on the liners i had observed nothing that resembled them  one a most vividfaced youth of eighteen smiled at me from a pair of remarkable italian eyes  but he was a dwarf  so short was he that he was all seaboots and souwester  and yet he was not entirely italian so certain was i that i asked the mate who answered morosely  him  shorty  hes a dago halfbreed  the other halfs jap or malay  one old man who i learned was a bosun was so decrepit that i thought he had been recently injured  his face was stolid and oxlike and as he shuffled and dragged his brogans over the deck he paused every several steps to place both hands on his abdomen and execute a queer pressing lifting movement  months were to pass in which i saw him do this thousands of times ere i learned that there was nothing the matter with him and that his action was purely a habit  his face reminded me of the man with the hoe save that it was unthinkably and abysmally stupider and his name as i was to learn of all names was sundry buyers  and he was bosun of the fine american sailingship elsinorerated one of the finest sailingships afloat  of this group of aged men and boys that moved the luggage along i saw only one called henry a youth of sixteen who approximated in the slightest what i had conceived all sailors to be like  he had come off a training ship the mate told me and this was his first voyage to sea his face was keencut alert as were his bodily movements and he wore sailorappearing clothes with sailorseeming grace  in fact as i was to learn he was to be the only sailorseeming creature fore and aft  the main crew had not yet come aboard but was expected at any moment the mate vouchsafed with a snarl of ominous expectancy  those already on board were the miscellaneous ones who had shipped themselves in new york without the mediation of boardinghouse masters  and what the crew itself would be like god alone could tellso said the mate  shorty the japanese or malay and italian halfcaste the mate told me was an able seaman though he had come out of steam and this was his first sailing voyage  ordinary seamen mr pike snorted in reply to a question  we dont carry landsmenforget it  every clodhopper an cowwalloper these days is an able seaman  thats the way they rank and are paid  the merchant service is all shot to hell  there aint no more sailors  they all died years ago before you were born even  i could smell the raw whiskey on the mates breath  yet he did not stagger nor show any signs of intoxication  not until afterward was i to know that his willingness to talk was most unwonted and was where the liquor gave him away  itd aben a grace had i died years ago he said rather than to a lived to see sailors an ships pass away from the sea  but i understand the elsinore is considered one of the finest i urged  so she is    today  but what is shea damned cargocarrier  she aint built for sailin an if she was there aint no sailors left to sail her  lord  lord  the old clippers  when i think of emthe gamecock shootin star flyin fish witch o the wave staghound harvey birch canvasback fleetwing sea serpent northern light  an when i think of the fleets of the teaclippers that used to load at hong kong an race the eastern passages  a fine sight  a fine sight  i was interested  here was a man a live man  i was in no hurry to go into the cabin where i knew wada was unpacking my things so i paced up and down the deck with the huge mr pike  huge he was in all conscience broadshouldered heavyboned and despite the profound stoop of his shoulders fully six feet in height  you are a splendid figure of a man i complimented  i was i was he muttered sadly and i caught the whiff of whiskey strong on the air  i stole a look at his gnarled hands  any finger would have made three of mine  his wrist would have made three of my wrist  how much do you weigh i asked  two hundred an ten  but in my day at my best i tipped the scales close to twoforty  and the elsinore cant sail i said returning to the subject which had roused him  ill take you even anything from a pound of tobacco to a months wages she wont make it around in a hundred an fifty days he answered  yet ive come round in the old flyin cloud in eightynine dayseightynine days sir from sandy hook to frisco  sixty men forard that was men an eight boys an drive drive drive  three hundred an seventyfour miles for a days run under tgallantsails an in the squalls eighteen knots o line not enough to time her  eightynine daysnever beat an tied once by the old andrew jackson nine years afterwards  them was the days  when did the andrew jackson tie her i asked because of the growing suspicion that he was having me  in 1860 was his prompt reply  and you sailed in the flying cloud nine years before that and this is 1913why that was sixtytwo years ago i charged  and i was seven years old he chuckled  my mother was stewardess on the flyin cloud  i was born at sea  i was boy when i was twelve on the herald o the morn when she made around in ninetynine dayshalf the crew in irons most o the time five men lost from aloft off the horn the points of our sheathknives broken square off knuckledusters an belayinpins flyin three men shot by the officers in one day the second mate killed dead an no one to know who done it an drive drive drive ninetynine days from land to land a run of seventeen thousand miles an east to west around cape stiff  but that would make you sixtynine years old i insisted  which i am he retorted proudly an a better man at that than the scrubby younglings of these days  a generation of em would die under the things ive been through  did you ever hear of the sunny southshe that was sold in havana to run slaves an changed her name to emanuela  and youve sailed the middle passage i cried recollecting the old phrase  i was on the emanuela that day in mozambique channel when the brisk caught us with nine hundred slaves betweendecks  only she wouldnt a caught us except for her having steam  i continued to stroll up and down beside this massive relic of the past and to listen to his hints and muttered reminiscences of old mankilling and mandriving days  he was too real to be true and yet as i studied his shoulderstoop and the agedrag of his huge feet i was convinced that his years were as he asserted  he spoke of a captain sonurs  he was a great captain he was saying  an in the two years i sailed mate with him there was never a port i didnt jump the ship goin in an stay in hiding until i sneaked aboard when she sailed again  but why  the men on account of the men swearin blood an vengeance and warrants against me because of my ways of teachin them to be sailors  why the times i was caught and the fines the skipper paid for meand yet it was my work that made the ship make money  he held up his huge paws and as i stared at the battered malformed knuckles i understood the nature of his work  but all thats stopped now he lamented  a sailors a gentleman these days  you cant raise your voice or your hand to them  at this moment he was addressed from the pooprail above by the second mate a mediumsized heavily built cleanshaven blond man  the tugs in sight with the crew sir he announced  the mate grunted an acknowledgment then added come on down mr mellaire and meet our passenger  i could not help noting the air and carriage with which mr mellaire came down the poopladder and took his part in the introduction  he was courteous in an oldworld way softspoken suave and unmistakably from south of mason and dixon  a southerner i said  georgia sir  he bowed and smiled as only a southerner can bow and smile  his features and expression were genial and gentle and yet his mouth was the cruellest gash i had ever seen in a mans face  it was a gash  there is no other way of describing that harsh thinlipped shapeless mouth that uttered gracious things so graciously  involuntarily i glanced at his hands  like the mates they were thickboned brokenknuckled and malformed  back into his blue eyes i looked  on the surface of them was a film of light a gloss of gentle kindness and cordiality but behind that gloss i knew resided neither sincerity nor mercy  behind that gloss was something cold and terrible that lurked and waited and watchedsomething catlike something inimical and deadly  behind that gloss of soft light and of social sparkle was the live fearful thing that had shaped that mouth into the gash it was  what i sensed behind in those eyes chilled me with its repulsiveness and strangeness  as i faced mr mellaire and talked with him and smiled and exchanged amenities i was aware of the feeling that comes to one in the forest or jungle when he knows unseen wild eyes of hunting animals are spying upon him  frankly i was afraid of the thing ambushed behind there in the skull of mr mellaire  one so as a matter of course identifies form and feature with the spirit within  but i could not do this with the second mate  his face and form and manner and suave ease were one thing inside which he an entirely different thing lay hid  i noticed wada standing in the cabin door evidently waiting to ask for instructions  i nodded and prepared to follow him inside  mr pike looked at me quickly and said  just a moment mr pathurst  he gave some orders to the second mate who turned on his heel and started forard  i stood and waited for mr pikes communication which he did not choose to make until he saw the second mate well out of ear shot  then he leaned closely to me and said  dont mention that little matter of my age to anybody  each year i sign on i sign my age one year younger  i am fiftyfour now on the articles  and you dont look a day older i answered lightly though i meant it in all sincerity  and i dont feel it  i can outwork and outgame the huskiest of the younglings  and dont let my age get to anybodys ears mr pathurst skippers are not particular for mates getting around the seventy mark and owners neither  ive had my hopes for this ship and id agot her i think except for the old man decidin to go to sea again  as if he needed the money  the old skinflint  is he well off i inquired  well off  if i had a tenth of his money i could retire on a chicken ranch in california and live like a fighting cockyes if i had a fiftieth of what hes got salted away  why he owns more stock in all the blackwood ships    and theyve always been lucky and always earned money  im getting old and its about time i got a command  but no the old cuss has to take it into his head to go to sea again just as the berths ripe for me to fall into  again i started to enter the cabin but was stopped by the mate  mr pathurst  you wont mention about my age  no certainly not mr pike i said     chapter iii   quite chilled through i was immediately struck by the warm comfort of the cabin  all the connecting doors were open making what i might call a large suite of rooms or a whale house  the maindeck entrance on the port side was into a wide wellcarpeted hallway  into this hallway from the port side opened five rooms first on entering the mates next the two staterooms which had been knocked into one for me then the stewards room and adjoining his completing the row a stateroom which was used for the slopchest  across the hall was a region with which i was not yet acquainted though i knew it contained the diningroom the bathrooms the cabin proper which was in truth a spacious livingroom the captains quarters and undoubtedly miss wests quarters  i could hear her humming some air as she bustled about with her unpacking  the stewards pantry separated by crosshalls and by the stairway leading into the chartroom above on the poop was placed strategically in the centre of all its operations  thus on the starboard side of it were the staterooms of the captain and miss west forard of it were the diningroom and main cabin while on the port side of it was the row of rooms i have described two of which were mine  i ventured down the hall toward the stern and found it opened into the stern of the elsinore forming a single large apartment at least thirty five feet from side to side and fifteen to eighteen feet in depth curved of course to the lines of the ships stern  this seemed a store room  i noted washtubs bolts of canvas many lockers hams and bacon hanging a stepladder that led up through a small hatch to the poop and in the floor another hatch  i spoke to the steward an old chinese smoothfaced and brisk of movement whose name i never learned but whose age on the articles was fiftysix  what is down there i asked pointing to the hatch in the floor  him lazarette he answered  and who eats there i indicated a table with two stationary seachairs  him second table  second mate and carpenter him eat that table  when i had finished giving instructions to wada for the arranging of my things i looked at my watch  it was early yet only several minutes after three so i went on deck again to witness the arrival of the crew  the actual coming on board from the tug i had missed but forard of the amidship house i encountered a few laggards who had not yet gone into the forecastle  these were the worse for liquor and a more wretched miserable disgusting group of men i had never seen in any slum  their clothes were rags  their faces were bloated bloody and dirty  i wont say they were villainous  they were merely filthy and vile  they were vile of appearance of speech and action  come  come  get your dunnage into the focsle  mr pike uttered these words sharply from the bridge above  a light and graceful bridge of steel rods and planking ran the full length of the elsinore starting from the poop crossing the amidship house and the forecastle and connecting with the forecastlehead at the very bow of the ship  at the mates command the men reeled about and glowered up at him one or two starting clumsily to obey  the others ceased their drunken yammerings and regarded the mate sullenly  one of them with a face mashed by some mad god in the making and who was afterwards to be known by me as larry burst into a guffaw and spat insolently on the deck then with utmost deliberation he turned to his fellows and demanded loudly and huskily  who in hells the old stiff anyways  i saw mr pikes huge form tense convulsively and involuntarily and i noted the way his huge hands strained in their clutch on the bridgerailing  beyond that he controlled himself  go on you he said  ill have nothing out of you  get into the focsle  and then to my surprise he turned and walked aft along the bridge to where the tug was casting off its lines  so this was all his high and mighty talk of kill and drive i thought  not until afterwards did i recollect as i turned aft down the deck that i saw captain west leaning on the rail at the break of the poop and gazing forard  the tugs lines were being cast off and i was interested in watching the manoeuvre until she had backed clear of the ship at which moment from forard arose a queer babel of howling and yelping as numbers of drunken voices cried out that a man was overboard  the second mate sprang down the poopladder and darted past me along the deck  the mate still on the slender whitepainted bridge that seemed no more than a spider thread surprised me by the activity with which he dashed along the bridge to the midship house leaped upon the canvascovered long boat and swung outboard where he might see  before the men could clamber upon the rail the second mate was among them and it was he who flung a coil of line overboard  what impressed me particularly was the mental and muscular superiority of these two officers  despite their agethe mate sixtynine and the second mate at least fiftytheir minds and their bodies had acted with the swiftness and accuracy of steel springs  they were potent  they were iron  they were perceivers willers and doers  they were as of another species compared with the sailors under them  while the latter witnesses of the happening and directly on the spot had been crying out in befuddled helplessness and with slow wits and slower bodies been climbing upon the rail the second mate had descended the steep ladder from the poop covered two hundred feet of deck sprung upon the rail grasped the instant need of the situation and cast the coil of line into the water  and of the same nature and quality had been the actions of mr pike  he and mr mellaire were masters over the wretched creatures of sailors by virtue of this remarkable difference of efficiency and will  truly they were more widely differentiated from the men under them than were the men under them differentiated from hottentotsay and from monkeys  i too by this time was standing on the big hawserbitts in a position to see a man in the water who seemed deliberately swimming away from the ship  he was a darkskinned mediterranean of some sort and his face in a clear glimpse i caught of it was distorted by frenzy  his black eyes were maniacal  the line was so accurately flung by the second mate that it fell across the mans shoulders and for several strokes his arms tangled in it ere he could swim clear  this accomplished he proceeded to scream some wild harangue and once as he uptossed his arms for emphasis i saw in his hand the blade of a long knife  bells were jangling on the tug as it started to the rescue  i stole a look up at captain west  he had walked to the port side of the poop where hands in pockets he was glancing now forard at the struggling man now aft at the tug  he gave no orders betrayed no excitement and appeared i may well say the most casual of spectators  the creature in the water seemed now engaged in taking off his clothes  i saw one bare arm and then the other appear  in his struggles he sometimes sank beneath the surface but always he emerged flourishing the knife and screaming his addled harangue  he even tried to escape the tug by diving and swimming underneath  i strolled forard and arrived in time to see him hoisted in over the rail of the elsinore  he was stark naked covered with blood and raving  he had cut and slashed himself in a score of places  from one wound in the wrist the blood spurted with each beat of the pulse  he was a loathsome nonhuman thing  i have seen a scared orang in a zoo and for all the world this bestialfaced mowing gibbering thing reminded me of the orang  the sailors surrounded him laying hands on him withstraining him the while they guffawed and cheered  right and left the two mates shoved them away and dragged the lunatic down the deck and into a room in the midship house  i could not help marking the strength of mr pike and mr mellaire  i had heard of the superhuman strength of madmen but this particular madman was as a wisp of straw in their hands once into the bunk mr pike held down the struggling fool easily with one hand while he dispatched the second mate for marlin with which to tie the fellows arms  bughouse mr pike grinned at me  ive seen some bughouse crews in my time but this ones the limit  what are you going to do i asked  the man will bleed to death  and good riddance he answered promptly  well have our hands full of him until we can lose him somehow  when he gets easy ill sew him up thats all if i have to ease him with a clout of the jaw  i glanced at the mates huge paw and appreciated its anaesthetic qualities  out on deck again i saw captain west on the poop hands still in pockets quite uninterested gazing at a blue break in the sky to the northeast  more than the mates and the maniac more than the drunken callousness of the men did this quiet figure hands in pockets impress upon me that i was in a different world from any i had known  wada broke in upon my thoughts by telling me he had been sent to say that miss west was serving tea in the cabin     chapter iv   the contrast as i entered the cabin was startling  all contrasts aboard the elsinore promised to be startling  instead of the cold hard deck my feet sank into soft carpet  in place of the mean and narrow room built of naked iron where i had left the lunatic i was in a spacious and beautiful apartment  with the bawling of the mens voices still in my ears and with the pictures of their drinkpuffed and filthy faces still vivid under my eyelids i found myself greeted by a delicate faced prettilygowned woman who sat beside a lacquered oriental table on which rested an exquisite teaservice of canton china  all was repose and calm  the steward noiselessfooted expressionless was a shadow scarcely noticed that drifted into the room on some service and drifted out again  not at once could i relax and miss west serving my tea laughed and said  you look as if you had been seeing things  the steward tells me a man has been overboard  i fancy the cold water must have sobered him  i resented her unconcern  the man is a lunatic i said  this ship is no place for him  he should be sent ashore to some hospital  i am afraid if we begin that wed have to send twothirds of our complement ashoreone lump  yes please i answered  but the man has terribly wounded himself  he is liable to bleed to death  she looked at me for a moment her gray eyes serious and scrutinizing as she passed me my cup then laughter welled up in her eyes and she shook her head reprovingly  now please dont begin the voyage by being shocked mr pathurst  such things are very ordinary occurrences  youll get used to them  you must remember some queer creatures go down to the sea in ships  the man is safe  trust mr pike to attend to his wounds  ive never sailed with mr pike but ive heard enough about him  mr pike is quite a surgeon last voyage they say he performed a successful amputation and so elated was he that he turned his attention on the carpenter who happened to be suffering from some sort of indigestion  mr pike was so convinced of the correctness of his diagnosis that he tried to bribe the carpenter into having his appendix removed  she broke off to laugh heartily then added they say he offered the poor man just pounds and pounds of tobacco to consent to the operation  but is it safe    for the    the working of the ship i urged to take such a lunatic along  she shrugged her shoulders as if not intending to reply then said  this incident is nothing  there are always several lunatics or idiots in every ships company  and they always come aboard filled with whiskey and raving  i remember once when we sailed from seattle a long time ago one such madman  he showed no signs of madness at all just calmly seized two boardinghouse runners and sprang overboard with them  we sailed the same day before the bodies were recovered  again she shrugged her shoulders  what would you  the sea is hard mr pathurst  and for our sailors we get the worst type of men  i sometimes wonder where they find them  and we do our best with them and somehow manage to make them help us carry on our work in the world  but they are low    low  as i listened and studied her face contrasting her womans sensitivity and her soft pretty dress with the brute faces and rags of the men i had noticed i could not help being convinced intellectually of the rightness of her position  nevertheless i was hurt sentimentallychiefly i do believe because of the very hardness and unconcern with which she enunciated her view  it was because she was a woman and so different from the seacreatures that i resented her having received such harsh education in the school of the sea  i could not help remarking your fatherser er sang froid during the occurrence  i ventured  he never took his hands from his pockets she cried  her eyes sparkled as i nodded confirmation  i knew it  its his way  ive seen it so often  i remember when i was twelve years oldmother was alonewe were running into san francisco it was in the dixie a ship almost as big as this  there was a strong fair wind blowing and father did not take a tug  we sailed right through the golden gate and up the san francisco waterfront  there was a swift flood tide too and the men both watches were taking in sail as fast as they could  now the fault was the steamboat captains  he miscalculated our speed and tried to cross our bow  then came the collision and the dixies bow cut through that steamboat cabin and hull  there were hundreds of passengers men women and children  father never took his hands from his pockets  he sent the mate forard to superintend rescuing the passengers who were already climbing on to our bowsprit and forecastle head and in a voice no different from what hed use to ask some one to pass the butter he told the second mate to set all sail  and he told him which sails to begin with  but why set more sails i interrupted  because he could see the situation  dont you see the steamboat was cut wide open  all that kept her from sinking instantly was the bow of the dixie jammed into her side  by setting more sail and keeping before the wind he continued to keep the bow of the dixie jammed  i was terribly frightened  people who had sprung or fallen overboard were drowning on each side of us right in my sight as we sailed along up the waterfront  but when i looked at father there he was just as i had always known him hands in pockets walking slowly up and down now giving an order to the wheelyou see he had to direct the dixies course through all the shippingnow watching the passengers swarming over our bow and along our deck now looking ahead to see his way through the ships at anchor  sometimes he did glance at the poor drowning ones but he was not concerned with them  of course there were numbers drowned but by keeping his hands in his pockets and his head cool he saved hundreds of lives  not until the last person was off the steamboathe sent men aboard to make suredid he take off the press of sail  and the steamboat sank at once  she ceased and looked at me with shining eyes for approbation  it was splendid i acknowledged  i admire the quiet man of power though i confess that such quietness under stress seems to me almost unearthly and beyond human  i cant conceive of myself acting that way and i am confident that i was suffering more while that poor devil was in the water than all the rest of the onlookers put together  father suffers she defended loyally  only he does not show it  i bowed for i felt she had missed my point     chapter v   i came out from tea in the cabin to find the tug britannia in sight she was the craft that was to tow us down chesapeake bay to sea strolling forard i noted the sailors being routed out of the forecastle by sundry buyers for ever tenderly pressing his abdomen with his hands another man was helping sundry buyers at routing out the sailors  i asked mr pike who the man was  nancymy bosun aint he a peach was the answer i got and from the mates manner of enunciation i was quite aware that nancy had been used derisively  nancy could not have been more than thirty though he looked as if he had lived a very long time  he was toothless and sad and weary of movement his eyes were slatecoloured and muddy his shaven face was sickly yellow  narrowshouldered sunkenchested with cheeks cavernously hollow he looked like a man in the last stages of consumption  little life as sundry buyers showed nancy showed even less life  and these were bosunsbosuns of the fine american sailingship elsinore  never had any illusion of mine taken a more distressing cropper  it was plain to me that the pair of them spineless and spunkless were afraid of the men they were supposed to boss  and the men  dore could never have conjured a more delectable hells broth  for the first time i saw them all and i could not blame the two bosuns for being afraid of them  they did not walk  they slouched and shambled some even tottered as from weakness or drink  but it was their faces  i could not help remembering what miss west had just told methat ships always sailed with several lunatics or idiots in their crews  but these looked as if they were all lunatic or feebleminded  and i too wondered where such a mass of human wreckage could have been obtained  there was something wrong with all of them their bodies were twisted their faces distorted and almost without exception they were undersized  the several quite fairly large men i marked were vacantfaced  one man however large and unmistakably irish was also unmistakably mad  he was talking and muttering to himself as he came out  a little curved lopsided man with his head on one side and with the shrewdest and wickedest of faces and pale blue eyes addressed an obscene remark to the mad irishman calling him osullivan  but osullivan took no notice and muttered on  on the heels of the little lopsided man appeared an overgrown dolt of a fat youth followed by another youth so tall and emaciated of body that it seemed a marvel his flesh could hold his frame together  next after this perambulating skeleton came the weirdest creature i have ever beheld  he was a twisted oaf of a man  face and body were twisted as with the pain of a thousand years of torture  his was the face of an illtreated and feebleminded faun  his large black eyes were bright eager and filled with pain and they flashed questioningly from face to face and to everything about  they were so pitifully alert those eyes as if for ever astrain to catch the clue to some perplexing and threatening enigma  not until afterwards did i learn the cause of this  he was stone deaf having had his eardrums destroyed in the boiler explosion which had wrecked the rest of him  i noticed the steward standing at the galley door and watching the men from a distance  his keen asiatic face quick with intelligence was a relief to the eye as was the vivid face of shorty who came out of the forecastle with a leap and a gurgle of laughter  but there was something wrong with him too  he was a dwarf and as i was to come to know his high spirits and low mentality united to make him a clown  mr pike stopped beside me a moment and while he watched the men i watched him  the expression on his face was that of a cattlebuyer and it was plain that he was disgusted with the quality of cattle delivered  something the matter with the last mothers son of them he growled  and still they came one pallid furtiveeyed that i instantly adjudged a drug fiend another a tiny wizened old man pinchfaced and wrinkled with beady malevolent blue eyes a third a small wellfleshed man who seemed to my eye the most normal and least unintelligent specimen that had yet appeared  but mr pikes eye was better trained than mine  whats the matter with you he snarled at the man  nothing sir the fellow answered stopping immediately  whats your name  mr pike never spoke to a sailor save with a snarl  charles davis sir  what are you limping about  i aint limpin sir the man answered respectfully and at a nod of dismissal from the mate marched off jauntily along the deck with a heodlum swing to the shoulders  hes a sailor all right the mate grumbled but ill bet you a pound of tobacco or a months wages theres something wrong with him  the forecastle now seemed empty but the mate turned on the bosuns with his customary snarl  what in hell are you doing  sleeping  think this is a rest cure  get in there an rustle em out  sundry buyers pressed his abdomen gingerly and hesitated while nancy his face one dogged longsuffering bleakness reluctantly entered the forecastle  then from inside we heard oaths vile and filthy urgings and expostulations on the part of nancy meekly and pleadingly uttered  i noted the grim and savage look that came on mr pikes face and was prepared for i knew not what awful monstrosities to emerge from the forecastle  instead to my surprise came three fellows who were strikingly superior to the ruck that had preceded them  i looked to see the mates face soften to some sort of approval  on the contrary his blue eyes contracted to narrow slits the snarl of his voice was communicated to his lips so that he seemed like a dog about to bite  but the three fellows  they were small men all and young men anywhere between twentyfive and thirty  though roughly dressed they were well dressed and under their clothes their bodily movements showed physical wellbeing  their faces were keen cut intelligent  and though i felt there was something queer about them i could not divine what it was  here were no illfed whiskeypoisoned men such as the rest of the sailors who having drunk up their last paydays had starved ashore until they had received and drunk up their advance money for the present voyage  these three on the other hand were supple and vigorous  their movements were spontaneously quick and accurate  perhaps it was the way they looked at me with incurious yet calculating eyes that nothing escaped  they seemed so worldly wise so indifferent so sure of themselves  i was confident they were not sailors  yet as shoredwellers i could not place them  they were a type i had never encountered  possibly i can give a better idea of them by describing what occurred  as they passed before us they favoured mr pike with the same indifferent keen glances they gave me  whats your nameyou mr pike barked at the first of the trio evidently a hybrid irishjew  jewish his nose unmistakably was  equally unmistakable was the irish of his eyes and jaw and upper lip  the three had immediately stopped and though they did not look directly at one another they seemed to be holding a silent conference  another of the trio in whose veins ran god alone knows what semitic babylonish and latin strains gave a warning signal  oh nothing so crass as a wink or a nod  i almost doubted that i had intercepted it and yet i knew he had communicated a warning to his fellows  more a shade of expression that had crossed his eyes or a glint in them of sudden lightor whatever it was it carried the message  murphy the other answered the mate  sir mr pike snarled at him  murphy shrugged his shoulders in token that he did not understand  it was the poise of the man of the three of them the cool poise that impressed me  when you address any officer on this ship youll say sir mr pike explained his voice as harsh as his face was forbidding  did you get that  yes    sir murphy drawled with deliberate slowness  i gotcha  sir mr pike roared  sir murphy answered so softly and carelessly that it irritated the mate to further bullyragging  well murphys too long he announced  noseyll do you aboard this craft  got that  i gotcha    sir came the reply insolent in its very softness and unconcern  nosey murphy goes    sir  and then he laughedthe three of them laughed if laughter it might be called that was laughter without sound or facial movement  the eyes alone laughed mirthlessly and coldbloodedly  certainly mr pike was not enjoying himself with these baffling personalities  he turned upon the leader the one who had given the warning and who looked the admixture of all that was mediterranean and semitic  whats your name  bert rhine    sir was the reply in tones as soft and careless and silkily irritating as the others  and youthis to the remaining one the youngest of the trio a dark eyed oliveskinned fellow with a face most striking in its cameolike beauty  americanborn i placed him of immigrants from southern italyfrom naples or even sicily  twist    sir he answered precisely in the same manner as the others  too long the mate sneered  the kidll do you  got that  i gotcha    sir  kid twistll do me    sir  kidll do  kid    sir  and the three laughed their silent mirthless laugh  by this time mr pike was beside himself with a rage that could find no excuse for action  now im going to tell you something the bunch of you for the good of your health  the mates voice grated with the rage he was suppressing i know your kind  youre dirt  dye get that  youre dirt  and on this ship youll be treated as dirt  youll do your work like men or ill know the reason why  the first time one of you bats an eye or even looks like batting an eye he gets his  dye get that  now get out  get along forard to the windlass  mr pike turned on his heel and i swung alongside of him as he moved aft  what do you make of them i queried  the limit he grunted  i know their kidney  theyve done time the three of them  theyre just plain sweepings of hell  here his speech was broken off by the spectacle that greeted him on number two hatch  sprawled out on the hatch were five or six men among them larry the tatterdemalion who had called him old stiff earlier in the afternoon  that larry had not obeyed orders was patent for he was sitting with his back propped against his seabag which ought to have been in the forecastle  also he and the group with him ought to have been forard manning the windlass  the mate stepped upon the hatch and towered over the man  get up he ordered  larry made an effort groaned and failed to get up  i cant he said  sir  i cant sir  i was drunk last night an slept in jefferson market  an this mornin i was froze tight sir  they had to pry me loose  stiff with the cold you were eh the mate grinned  its well ye might say it sir larry answered  and you feel like an old stiff eh  larry blinked with the troubled querulous eyes of a monkey  he was beginning to apprehend he knew not what and he knew that bending over him was a manmaster  well ill just be showin you what an old stiff feels like anyways mr pike mimicked the others brogue  and now i shall tell what i saw happen  please remember what i have said of the huge paws of mr pike the fingers much longer than mine and twice as thick the wrists massiveboned the armbones and the shoulderbones of the same massive order  with one flip of his right hand with what i might call an openhanded lifting upward slap save that it was the ends of the fingers only that touched larrys face he lifted larry into the air sprawling him backward on his back across his seabag  the man alongside of larry emitted a menacing growl and started to spring belligerently to his feet  but he never reached his feet  mr pike with the back of same right hand open smote the man on the side of the face  the loud smack of the impact was startling  the mates strength was amazing  the blow looked so easy so effortless it had seemed like the lazy stroke of a goodnatured bear but in it was such a weight of bone and muscle that the man went down sidewise and rolled off the hatch on to the deck  at this moment lurching aimlessly along appeared osullivan  a sudden access of muttering on his part reached mr pikes ear and mr pike instantly keen as a wild animal his paw in the act of striking osullivan whipped out like a revolver shot whats that  then he noted the sensestruck face of osullivan and withheld the blow  bug house mr pike commented  involuntarily i had glanced to see if captain west was on the poop and found that we were hidden from the poop by the midship house  mr pike taking no notice of the man who lay groaning on the deck stood over larry who was likewise groaning  the rest of the sprawling men were on their feet subdued and respectful  i too was respectful of this terrific aged figure of a man  the exhibition had quite convinced me of the verity of his earlier driving and killing days  whos the old stiff now he demanded  tis me sir larry moaned contritely  get up  larry got up without any difficulty at all  now get forard to the windlass  the rest of you  and they went sullenly shamblingly like the cowed brutes they were     chapter vi   i climbed the ladder on the side of the forard house which house contained as i discovered the forecastle the galley and the donkey engine room and went part way along the bridge to a position by the foremast where i could observe the crew heaving up anchor  the britannia was alongside and we were getting under way  a considerable body of men was walking around with the windlass or variously engaged on the forecastlehead  of the crew proper were two watches of fifteen men each  in addition were sailmakers boys bosuns and the carpenter  nearly forty men were they but such men  they were sad and lifeless  there was no vim no go no activity  every step and movement was an effort as if they were dead men raised out of coffins or sick men dragged from hospital beds  sick they werewhiskeypoisoned starved they were and weak from poor nutrition  and worst of all they were imbecile and lunatic  i looked aloft at the intricate ropes at the steel masts rising and carrying huge yards of steel rising higher and higher until steel masts and yards gave way to slender spars of wood while ropes and stays turned into a delicate tracery of spiderthread against the sky  that such a wretched muck of men should be able to work this magnificent ship through all storm and darkness and peril of the sea was beyond all seeming  i remembered the two mates the superefficiency mental and physical of mr mellaire and mr pikecould they make this human wreckage do it they at least evinced no doubts of their ability  the sea  if this feat of mastery were possible then clear it was that i knew nothing of the sea  i looked back at the misshapen starved sick stumbling hulks of men who trod the dreary round of the windlass  mr pike was right  these were not the brisk devilish ablebodied men who manned the ships of the old clippership days who fought their officers who had the points of their sheathknives broken off who killed and were killed but who did their work as men  these men these shambling carcasses at the windlassi looked and looked and vainly i strove to conjure the vision of them swinging aloft in rack and storm clearing the raffle as kipling puts it with their clasp knives in their teeth  why didnt they sing a chanty as they hove the anchor up  in the old days as i had read the anchor always came up to the rollicking sailor songs of seachested men  i tired of watching the spiritless performance and went aft on an exploring trip along the slender bridge  it was a beautiful structure strong yet light traversing the length of the ship in three aerial leaps  it spanned from the forecastlehead to the forecastlehouse next to the midship house and then to the poop  the poop which was really the roof or deck over all the cabin space below and which occupied the whole afterpart of the ship was very large  it was broken only by the halfround and halfcovered wheelhouse at the very stern and by the charthouse  on either side of the latter two doors opened into a tiny hallway  this in turn gave access to the chartroom and to a stairway that led down into the cabin quarters beneath  i peeped into the chartroom and was greeted with a smile by captain west  he was lolling back comfortably in a swing chair his feet cocked on the desk opposite  on a broad upholstered couch sat the pilot  both were smoking cigars and lingering for a moment to listen to the conversation i grasped that the pilot was an exseacaptain  as i descended the stairs from miss wests room came a sound of humming and bustling as she settled her belongings  the energy she displayed to judge by the cheerful noises of it was almost perturbing  passing by the pantry i put my head inside the door to greet the steward and courteously let him know that i was aware of his existence  here in his little realm it was plain that efficiency reigned  everything was spotless and in order and i could have wished and wished vainly for a more noiseless servant than he ashore  his face as he regarded me had as little or as much expression as the sphinx  but his slant black eyes were bright with intelligence  what do you think of the crew i asked in order to put words to my invasion of his castle  buggyhouse he answered promptly with a disgusted shake of the head too much buggyhouse  all crazy  you see  no good  rotten  down to hell  that was all but it verified my own judgment  while it might be true as miss west had said that every ships crew contained several lunatics and idiots it was a foregone conclusion that our crew contained far more than several  in fact and as it was to turn out our crew even in these degenerate sailing days was an unusual crew in so far as its helplessness and worthlessness were beyond the average  i found my own room in reality it was two rooms delightful  wada had unpacked and stored away my entire outfit of clothing and had filled numerous shelves with the library i had brought along  everything was in order and place from my shaving outfit in the drawer beside the wash basin and my seaboots and oilskins hung ready to hand to my writing materials on the desk before which a swing armchair leatherupholstered and screwed solidly to the floor invited me  my pyjamas and dressinggown were out  my slippers in their accustomed place by the bed also invited me  here aft all was fitness intelligence  on deck it was what i have describeda nightmare spawn of creatures assumably human but malformed mentally and physically into caricatures of men  yes it was an unusual crew and that mr pike and mr mellaire could whip it into the efficient shape necessary to work this vast and intricate and beautiful fabric of a ship was beyond all seeming of possibility  depressed as i was by what i had just witnessed on deck there came to me as i leaned back in my chair and opened the second volume of george moores hail and farewell a premonition that the voyage was to be disastrous  but then as i looked about the room measured its generous space realized that i was more comfortably situated than i had ever been on any passenger steamer i dismissed foreboding thoughts and caught a pleasant vision of myself through weeks and months catching up with all the necessary reading which i had so long neglected  once i asked wada if he had seen the crew  no he hadnt but the steward had said that in all his years at sea this was the worst crew he had ever seen  he say all crazy no sailors rotten wada said  he say all big fools and bime by much trouble  you see he say all the time  you see you see  he pretty old manfiftyfive years he say  very smart man for chinaman  just now first time for long time he go to sea before he have big business in san francisco  then he get much troublepolice  they say he opium smuggle  oh big big trouble  but he catch good lawyer  he no go to jail  but long time lawyer work and when trouble all finish lawyer got all his business all his money everything  then he go to sea like before  he make good money  he get sixtyfive dollars a month on this ship  but he dont like  crew all crazy  when this time finish he leave ship go back start business in san francisco  later when i had wada open one of the ports for ventilation i could hear the gurgle and swish of water alongside and i knew the anchor was up and that we were in the grip of the britannia towing down the chesapeake to sea  the idea suggested itself that it was not too late  i could very easily abandon the adventure and return to baltimore on the britannia when she cast off the elsinore  and then i heard a slight tinkling of china from the pantry as the steward proceeded to set the table and also it was so warm and comfortable and george moore was so irritatingly fascinating     chapter vii   in every way dinner proved up beyond my expectations and i registered a note that the cook whoever or whatever he might be was a capable man at his trade  miss west served and though she and the steward were strangers they worked together splendidly  i should have thought from the smoothness of the service that he was an old house servant who for years had known her every way  the pilot ate in the charthouse so that at table were the four of us that would always be at table together  captain west and his daughter faced each other while i on the captains right faced mr pike  this put miss west across the corner on my right  mr pike his dark sack coat put on for the meal bulging and wrinkling over the lumps of muscles that padded his stooped shoulders had nothing at all to say  but he had eaten too many years at captains tables not to have proper table manners  at first i thought he was abashed by miss wests presence  later i decided it was due to the presence of the captain  for captain west had a way with him that i was beginning to learn  far removed as mr pike and mr mellaire were from the sailors individuals as they were of an entirely different and superior breed yet equally as different and far removed from his officers was captain west he was a serene and absolute aristocrat  he neither talked ship nor anything else to mr pike  on the other hand captain wests attitude toward me was that of a social equal  but then i was a passenger  miss west treated me the same way but unbent more to mr pike  and mr pike answering her with yes miss and no miss ate goodmanneredly and with his shaggybrowed gray eyes studied me across the table  i too studied him  despite his violent past killer and driver that he was i could not help liking the man  he was honest genuine  almost more than for that i liked him for the spontaneous boyish laugh he gave on the occasions when i reached the points of several funny stories  no man could laugh like that and be all bad  i was glad that it was he and not mr mellaire who was to sit opposite throughout the voyage  and i was very glad that mr mellaire was not to eat with us at all  i am afraid that miss west and i did most of the talking  she was breezy vivacious tonic and i noted again that the delicate almost fragile oval of her face was given the lie by her body  she was a robust healthy young woman  that was undeniable  not fatheaven forbidnot even plump yet her lines had that swelling roundness that accompanies long live muscles  she was fullbodied vigorous and yet not so fullbodied as she seemed  i remember with what surprise when we arose from table i noted her slender waist  at that moment i got the impression that she was willowy  and willowy she was with a normal waist and with in addition always that informing bodily vigour that made her appear rounder and robuster than she really was  it was the health of her that interested me  when i studied her face more closely i saw that only the lines of the oval of it were delicate delicate it was not nor fragile  the flesh was firm and the texture of the skin was firm and fine as it moved over the firm muscles of face and neck  the neck was a beautiful and adequate pillar of white  its flesh was firm its skin fine and it was muscular  the hands too attracted menot small but wellshaped fine white and strong and well cared for  i could only conclude that she was an unusual captains daughter just as her father was an unusual captain and man  and their noses were alike just the hinttouch of the beak of power and race  while miss west was telling of the unexpectedness of the voyage of how suddenly she had decided to comeshe accounted for it as a whimand while she told of all the complications she had encountered in her haste of preparation i found myself casting up a tally of the efficient ones on board the elsinore  they were captain west and his daughter the two mates myself of course wada and the steward and beyond the shadow of a doubt the cook  the dinner vouched for him  thus i found our total of efficients to be eight  but the cook the steward and wada were servants not sailors while miss west and myself were supernumeraries  remained to work direct do but three efficients out of a total ships company of fortyfive  i had no doubt that other efficients there were it seemed impossible that my first impression of the crew should be correct  there was the carpenter  he might at his trade be as good as the cook  then the two sailmakers whom i had not yet seen might prove up  a little later during the meal i ventured to talk about what had interested me and aroused my admiration namely the masterfulness with which mr pike and mr mellaire had gripped hold of that woeful worthless crew  it was all new to me i explained but i appreciated the need of it  as i led up to the occurrence on number two hatch when mr pike had lifted up larry and toppled him back with a mere slap from the ends of his fingers i saw in mr pikes eyes a warning almost threatening expression  nevertheless i completed my description of the episode  when i had quite finished there was a silence  miss west was busy serving coffee from a copper percolator  mr pike profoundly occupied with cracking walnuts could not quite hide the wicked little halfhumorous halfrevengeful gleam in his eyes  but captain west looked straight at me but from oh such a distancemillions and millions of miles away  his clear blue eyes were as serene as ever his tones as low and soft  it is the one rule i ask to be observed mr pathurstwe never discuss the sailors  it was a facer to me and with quite a pronounced fellowfeeling for larry i hurriedly added  it was not merely the discipline that interested me  it was the feat of strength  sailors are trouble enough without our hearing about them mr pathurst captain west went on as evenly and imperturbably as if i had not spoken  i leave the handling of the sailors to my officers  thats their business and they are quite aware that i tolerate no undeserved roughness or severity  mr pikes harsh face carried the faintest shadow of an amused grin as he stolidly regarded the tablecloth  i glanced to miss west for sympathy she laughed frankly and said  you see father never has any sailors  and its a good plan too  a very good plan mr pike muttered  then miss west kindly led the talk away from that subject and soon had us laughing with a spirited recital of a recent encounter of hers with a boston cabdriver  dinner over i stepped to my room in quest of cigarettes and incidentally asked wada about the cook  wada was always a great gatherer of information  his name louis he said  he chinaman too  no only half chinaman other half englishman  you know one island napoleon he stop long time and bime by die that island  st helena i prompted  yes that place louis he born  he talk very good english  at this moment entering the hall from the deck mr mellaire just relieved by the mate passed me on his way to the big room in the stern where the second table was set  his good evening sir was as stately and courteous as any southern gentleman of the old days could have uttered it  and yet i could not like the man  his outward seeming was so at variance with the personality that resided within  even as he spoke and smiled i felt that from inside his skull he was watching me studying me  and somehow in a flash of intuition i knew not why i was reminded of the three strange young men routed last from the forecastle to whom mr pike had read the law  they too had given me a similar impression  behind mr mellaire slouched a selfconscious embarrassed individual with the face of a stupid boy and the body of a giant  his feet were even larger than mr pikes but the handsi shot a quick glance to seewere not so large as mr pikes  as they passed i looked inquiry to wada  he carpenter  he sat second table  his name sam lavroff  he come from new york on ship  steward say he very young for carpenter maybe twenty two three years old  as i approached the open port over my desk i again heard the swish and gurgle of water and again realized that we were under way  so steady and noiseless was our progress that say seated at table it never entered ones head that we were moving or were anywhere save on the solid land i had been used to steamers all my life and it was difficult immediately to adjust myself to the absence of the propellerthrust vibration  well what do you think i asked wada who like myself had never made a sailingship voyage  he smiled politely  very funny ship  very funny sailors i dont know  mebbe all right  we see  you think trouble i asked pointedly  i think sailors very funny he evaded     chapter viii   having lighted my cigarette i strolled forard along the deck to where work was going on  above my head dim shapes of canvas showed in the starlight sail was being made and being made slowly as i might judge who was only the veriest tyro in such matters  the indistinguishable shapes of men in long lines pulled on ropes  they pulled in sick and dogged silence though mr pike ubiquitous snarled out orders and rapped out oaths from every angle upon their miserable heads  certainly from what i had read no ship of the old days ever proceeded so sadly and blunderingly to sea  ere long mr mellaire joined mr pike in the struggle of directing the men  it was not yet eight in the evening and all hands were at work  they did not seem to know the ropes  time and again when the halfhearted suggestions of the bosuns had been of no avail i saw one or the other of the mates leap to the rail and put the right rope in the hands of the men  these on the deck i concluded were the hopeless ones  up aloft from sounds and cries i knew were other men undoubtedly those who were at least a little seamanlike loosing the sails  but on deck  twenty or thirty of the poor devils tailed on a rope that hoisted a yard would pull without concerted effort and with painfully slow movements  walk away with it mr pike would yell  and perhaps for two or three yards they would manage to walk with the rope ere they came to a halt like stalled horses on a hill  and yet did either of the mates spring in and add his strength they were able to move right along the deck without stopping  either of the mates old men that they were was muscularly worth halfadozen of the wretched creatures  this is what sailins come to mr pike paused to snort in my ear this aint the place for an officer down here pulling and hauling  but what can you do when the bosuns are worse than the men  i thought sailors sang songs when they pulled i said  sure they do  want to hear em  i knew there was malice of some sort in his voice but i answered that id like to very much  here you bosun mr pike snarled  wake up  start a song  topsail halyards  in the pause that followed i could have sworn that sundry buyers was pressing his hands against his abdomen while nancy infinite bleakness freezing upon his face was wetting his lips to begin  nancy it was who began for from no other man i was confident could have issued so sepulchral a plaint  it was unmusical unbeautiful unlively and indescribably doleful  yet the words showed that it should have ripped and crackled with high spirits and lawlessness for the words poor nancy sang were     away way way yar    well kill paddy doyle for bus boots  quit it  quit it mr pike roared  this aint a funeral  aint there one of you that can sing  come on now  its a topsailyard  he broke off to leap in to the pinrail and get the wrong ropes out of the mens hands to put into them the right rope  come on bosun  break her out  then out of the gloom arose sundry buyers voice cracked and crazy and even more lugubrious than nancys     then up aloft that yard must go    whiskey for my johnny  the second line was supposed to be the chorus but not more than two men feebly mumbled it  sundry buyers quavered the next line     oh whiskey killed my sister sue  then mr pike took a hand seizing the haulingpart next to the pin and lifting his voice with a rare snap and devilishness     and whiskey killed the old man too    whiskey for my johnny  he sang the devilmaycare lines on and on lifting the crew to the work and to the chorused emphasis of whiskey for my johnny  and to his voice they pulled they moved they sang and were alive until he interrupted the song to cry belay  and then all the life and lilt went out of them and they were again maundering and futile things getting in one anothers way stumbling and shuffling through the darkness hesitating to grasp ropes and when they did take hold invariably taking hold of the wrong rope first  skulkers there were among them too and once from forard of the midship house i heard smacks and curses and groans and out of the darkness hurriedly emerged two men on their heels mr pike who chanted a recital of the distressing things that would befall them if he caught them at such tricks again  the whole thing was too depressing for me to care to watch further so i strolled aft and climbed the poop  in the lee of the charthouse captain west and the pilot were pacing slowly up and down  passing on aft i saw steering at the wheel the weazened little old man i had noted earlier in the day  in the light of the binnacle his small blue eyes looked more malevolent than ever  so weazened and tiny was he and so large was the brassstudded wheel that they seemed of a height  his face was withered scorched and wrinkled and in all seeming he was fifty years older than mr pike  he was the most remarkable figure of a burntout aged man one would expect to find able seaman on one of the proudest sailingships afloat  later through wada i was to learn that his name was andy fay and that he claimed no more years than sixtythree  i leaned against the rail in the lee of the wheelhouse and stared up at the lofty spars and myriad ropes that i could guess were there  no i decided i was not keen on the voyage  the whole atmosphere of it was wrong  there were the cold hours i had waited on the pierends  there was miss west coming along  there was the crew of broken men and lunatics  i wondered if the wounded greek in the midship house still gibbered and if mr pike had yet sewed him up and i was quite sure i would not care to witness such a transaction in surgery  even wada who had never been in a sailingship had his doubts of the voyage  so had the steward who had spent most of a lifetime in sailing ships  so far as captain west was concerned crews did not exist  and as for miss west she was so abominably robust that she could not be anything else than an optimist in such matters  she had always lived her red blood sang to her only that she would always live and that nothing evil would ever happen to her glorious personality  oh trust me i knew the way of red blood  such was my condition that the redblood health of miss west was virtually an affront to mefor i knew how unthinking and immoderate such blood could be  and for five months at leastthere was mr pikes offered wager of a pound of tobacco or a months wages to that effecti was to be pent on the same ship with her  as sure as cosmic sap was cosmic sap just that sure was i that ere the voyage was over i should be pestered by her making love to me  please do not mistake me  my certainty in this matter was due not to any exalted sense of my own desirableness to women but to my anything but exalted concept of women as instinctive huntresses of men  in my experience women hunted men with quite the same blind tropism that marks the pursuit of the sun by the sunflower the pursuit of attachable surfaces by the tendrils of the grapevine  call me blasei do not mind if by blase is meant the worldweariness intellectual artistic sensational which can come to a young man of thirty  for i was thirty and i was weary of all these thingsweary and in doubt  it was because of this state that i was undertaking the voyage  i wanted to get away by myself to get away from all these things and with proper perspective mull the matter over  it sometimes seemed to me that the culmination of this worldsickness had been brought about by the success of my playmy first play as every one knows  but it had been such a success that it raised the doubt in my own mind just as the success of my several volumes of verse had raised doubts  was the public right  were the critics right  surely the function of the artist was to voice life yet what did i know of life  so you begin to glimpse what i mean by the worldsickness that afflicted me  really i had been and was very sick  mad thoughts of isolating myself entirely from the world had hounded me  i had even canvassed the idea of going to molokai and devoting the rest of my years to the lepersi who was thirty years old and healthy and strong who had no particular tragedy who had a bigger income than i knew how to spend who by my own achievement had put my name on the lips of men and proved myself a power to be reckoned withi was that mad that i had considered the lazar house for a destiny  perhaps it will be suggested that success had turned my head  very well granted  but the turned head remains a fact an incontrovertible factmy sickness if you will and a real sickness and a fact  this i knew i had reached an intellectual and artistic climacteric a lifeclimacteric of some sort  and i had diagnosed my own case and prescribed this voyage  and here was the atrociously healthy and profoundly feminine miss west alongthe very last ingredient i would have considered introducing into my prescription  a woman  woman  heaven knows i had been sufficiently tormented by their persecutions to know them  i leave it to you thirty years of age not entirely unhandsome an intellectual and artistic place in the world and an income most dazzlingwhy shouldnt women pursue me  they would have pursued me had i been a hunchback for the sake of my artistic place alone for the sake of my income alone  yes and love  did i not know lovelyric passionate mad romantic love  that too was of old time with me  i too had throbbed and sung and sobbed and sighedyes and known grief and buried my dead  but it was so long ago  how young i wasturned twentyfour  and after that i had learned the bitter lesson that even deathless grief may die and i had laughed again and done my share of philandering with the pretty ferocious moths that fluttered around the light of my fortune and artistry and after that in turn i had retired disgusted from the lists of woman and gone on long lancebreaking adventures in the realm of mind  and here i was on board the elsinore unhorsed by my encounters with the problems of the ultimate carried off the field with a broken pate  as i leaned against the rail dismissing premonitions of disaster i could not help thinking of miss west below bustling and humming as she made her little nest  and from her my thought drifted on to the everlasting mystery of woman  yes i with all the futuristic contempt for woman am ever caught up afresh by the mystery of woman  oh no illusions thank you  woman the loveseeker obsessing and possessing fragile and fierce soft and venomous prouder than lucifer and as prideless holds a perpetual almost morbid attraction for the thinker  what is this flame of her blazing through all her contradictions and ignobilitiesthis ruthless passion for life always for life more life on the planet  at times it seems to me brazen and awful and soulless  at times i am made petulant by it  and at other times i am swayed by the sublimity of it  no there is no escape from woman  always as a savage returns to a dark glen where goblins are and gods may be so do i return to the contemplation of woman  mr pikes voice interrupted my musings  from forard on the main deck i heard him snarl  on the maintopsailyard thereif you cut that gasket ill split your damned skull  again he called with a marked change of voice and the henry he called to i concluded was the trainingship boy  you henry mainskysailyard there he cried  dont make those gaskets up  fetch em in along the yard and make fast to the tye  thus routed from my reverie i decided to go below to bed  as my hand went out to the knob of the charthouse door again the mates voice rang out  come on you gentlemens sons in disguise  wake up  lively now     chapter ix   i did not sleep well  to begin with i read late  not till two in the morning did i reach up and turn out the kerosene readinglamp which wada had purchased and installed for me  i was asleep immediatelyperfect sleep being perhaps my greatest gift but almost immediately i was awake again  and thereafter with dozings and catnaps and restless tossings i struggled to win to sleep then gave it up  for of all things in my state of jangled nerves to be afflicted with hives  and still again to be afflicted with hives in cold winter weather  at four i lighted up and went to reading forgetting my irritated skin in vernon lees delightful screed against william james and his will to believe  i was on the weather side of the ship and from overhead through the deck came the steady footfalls of some officer on watch  i knew that they were not the steps of mr pike and wondered whether they were mr mellaires or the pilots  somebody above there was awake  the work was going on the vigilant seeing and overseeing that i could plainly conclude would go on through every hour of all the hours on the voyage  at halfpast four i heard the stewards alarm go off instantly suppressed and five minutes later i lifted my hand to motion him in through my open door  what i desired was a cup of coffee and wada had been with me through too many years for me to doubt that he had given the steward precise instructions and turned over to him my coffee and my coffeemaking apparatus  the steward was a jewel  in ten minutes he served me with a perfect cup of coffee  i read on until daylight and halfpast eight found me breakfast in bed finished dressed and shaved and on deck  we were still towing but all sails were set to a light favouring breeze from the north  in the chartroom captain west and the pilot were smoking cigars at the wheel i noted what i decided at once was an efficient  he was not a large man if anything he was undersized  but his countenance was broadbrowed and intelligently formed  tom i later learned was his nametom spink an englishman  he was blueeyed fairskinned well grizzled and to the eye a hale fifty years of age  his reply of good morning sir was cheery and he smiled as he uttered the simple phrase he did not look sailorlike as did henry the trainingship boy and yet i felt at once that he was a sailor and an able one  it was mr pikes watch and on asking him about tom he grudgingly admitted that the man was the best of the boiling  miss west emerged from the charthouse with a rosy morning face and her vital springy limbmovement and immediately began establishing her contacts  on asking how i had slept and when i said wretchedly she demanded an explanation  i told her of my affliction of hives and showed her the lumps on my wrists  your blood needs thinning and cooling she adjudged promptly  wait a minute  ill see what can be done for you  and with that she was away and below and back in a trice in her hand a part glass of water into which she stirred a teaspoonful of cream of tartar  drink it she ordered as a matter of course  i drank it  and at eleven in the morning she came up to my deckchair with a second dose of the stuff  also she reproached me soundly for permitting wada to feed meat to possum  it was from her that wada and i learned how mortal a sin it was to give meat to a young puppy furthermore she laid down the law and the diet for possum not alone to me and wada but to the steward the carpenter and mr mellaire  of the latter two because they ate by themselves in the big afterroom and because possum played there she was especially suspicious and she was outspoken in voicing her suspicions to their faces  the carpenter mumbled embarrassed asseverations in broken english of past present and future innocence the while he humbly scraped and shuffled before her on his huge feet  mr mellaires protestations were of the same nature save that they were made with the grace and suavity of a chesterfield  in short possums diet raised quite a tempest in the elsinore teapot and by the time it was over miss west had established this particular contact with me and given me a feeling that we were the mutual owners of the puppy  i noticed later in the day that it was to miss west that wada went for instructions as to the quantity of warm water he must use to dilute possums condensed milk  lunch won my continued approbation of the cook  in the afternoon i made a trip forard to the galley to make his acquaintance  to all intents he was a chinese until he spoke whereupon measured by speech alone he was an englishman  in fact so cultured was his speech that i can fairly say it was vested with an oxford accent  he too was old fully sixtyhe acknowledged fiftynine  three things about him were markedly conspicuous his smile that embraced all of his cleanshaven asiatic face and asiatic eyes his evenrowed white and perfect teeth which i deemed false until wada ascertained otherwise for me and his hands and feet  it was his hands ridiculously small and beautifully modelled that led my scrutiny to his feet  they too were ridiculously small and very neatly almost dandifiedly shod  we had put the pilot off at midday but the britannia towed us well into the afternoon and did not cast us off until the ocean was wide about us and the land a faint blur on the western horizon  here at the moment of leaving the tug we made our departurethat is to say technically began the voyage despite the fact that we had already travelled a full twentyfour hours away from baltimore  it was about the time of casting off when i was leaning on the pooprail gazing forard when miss west joined me  she had been busy below all day and had just come up as she put it for a breath of air  she surveyed the sky in weatherwise fashion for a full five minutes then remarked  the barometers very high30 degrees 60  this light north wind wont last  it will either go into a calm or work around into a northeast gale  which would you prefer i asked  the gale by all means  it will help us off the land and it will put me through my torment of seasickness more quickly  oh yes she added im a good sailor but i do suffer dreadfully at the beginning of every voyage  you probably wont see me for a couple of days now  thats why ive been so busy getting settled first  lord nelson i have read never got over his squeamishness at sea i said  and ive seen father seasick on occasion she answered  yes and some of the strongest hardest sailors i have ever known  mr pike here joined us for a moment ceasing from his everlasting pacing up and down to lean with us on the pooprail  many of the crew were in evidence pulling on ropes on the main deck below us  to my inexperienced eye they appeared more unprepossessing than ever  a pretty scraggly crew mr pike miss west remarked  the worst ever he growled and ive seen some pretty bad ones  were teachin them the ropes just nowmost of em  they look starved i commented  they are they almost always are miss west answered and her eyes roved over them in the same appraising cattlebuyers fashion i had marked in mr pike  but theyll fatten up with regular hours no whiskey and solid foodwont they mr pike  oh sure  they always do  and youll see them liven up when we get em in hand    maybe  theyre a measly lot though  i looked aloft at the vast towers of canvas  our four masts seemed to have flowered into all the sails possible yet the sailors beneath us under mr mellaires direction were setting triangular sails like jibs between the masts and there were so many that they overlapped one another  the slowness and clumsiness with which the men handled these small sails led me to ask  but what would you do mr pike with a green crew like this if you were caught right now in a storm with all this canvas spread  he shrugged his shoulders as if i had asked what he would do in an earthquake with two rows of new york skyscrapers falling on his head from both sides of a street  do miss west answered for him  wed get the sail off  oh it can be done mr pathurst with any kind of a crew  if it couldnt i should have been drowned long ago  sure mr pike upheld her  so would i  the officers can perform miracles with the most worthless sailors in a pinch miss west went on  again mr pike nodded his head and agreed and i noted his two big paws relaxed the moment before and drooping over the rail quite unconsciously tensed and folded themselves into fists  also i noted fresh abrasions on the knuckles  miss west laughed heartily as from some recollection  i remember one time when we sailed from san francisco with a most hopeless crew  it was in the lallah rookhyou remember her mr pike  your fathers fifth command he nodded  lost on the west coast afterwardswent ashore in that big earthquake and tidal wave  parted her anchors and when she hit under the cliff the cliff fell on her  thats the ship  well our crew seemed mostly cowboys and bricklayers and tramps and more tramps than anything else  where the boardinghouse masters got them was beyond imagining  a number of them were shanghaied that was certain  you should have seen them when they were first sent aloft  again she laughed  it was better than circus clowns  and scarcely had the tug cast us off outside the heads when it began to blow up and we began to shorten down  and then our mates performed miracles  you remember mr hardingsilas harding  dont i though mr pike proclaimed enthusiastically  he was some man and he must have been an old man even then  he was and a terrible man she concurred and added almost reverently and a wonderful man  she turned her face to me  he was our mate  the men were seasick and miserable and green  but mr harding got the sail off the lallah rookh just the same  what i wanted to tell you was this  i was on the poop just like i am now and mr harding had a lot of those miserable sick men putting gaskets on the mainlowertopsail  how far would that be above the deck mr pike  let me see    the lallah rookh  mr pike paused to consider  oh say around a hundred feet  i saw it myself  one of the green hands a trampand he must already have got a taste of mr hardingfell off the lowertopsailyard  i was only a little girl but it looked like certain death for he was falling from the weather side of the yard straight down on deck  but he fell into the belly of the mainsail breaking his fall turned a somersault and landed on his feet on deck and unhurt  and he landed right alongside of mr harding facing him  i dont know which was the more astonished but i think mr harding was for he stood there petrified  he had expected the man to be killed  not so the man  he took one look at mr harding then made a wild jump for the rigging and climbed right back up to that topsailyard  miss west and the mate laughed so heartily that they scarcely heard me say  astonishing  think of the jar to the mans nerves falling to apparent death that way  hed been jarred harder by silas harding i guess was mr pikes remark with another burst of laughter in which miss west joined  which was all very well in a way  ships were ships and judging by what i had seen of our present crew harsh treatment was necessary  but that a young woman of the niceness of miss west should know of such things and be so saturated in this side of ship life was not nice  it was not nice for me though it interested me i confessand strengthened my grip on reality  yet it meant a hardening of ones fibres and i did not like to think of miss west being so hardened  i looked at her and could not help marking again the fineness and firmness of her skin  her hair was dark as were her eyebrows which were almost straight and rather low over her long eyes  gray her eyes were a warm gray and very steady and direct in expression intelligent and alive  perhaps taking her face as a whole the most noteworthy expression of it was a great calm  she seemed always in repose at peace with herself and with the external world  the most beautiful feature was her eyes framed in lashes as dark as her brows and hair  the most admirable feature was her nose quite straight very straight and just the slightest trifle too long  in this it was reminiscent of her fathers nose  but the perfect modelling of the bridge and nostrils conveyed an indescribable advertisement of race and blood  hers was a slenderlipped sensitive sensible and generous mouthgenerous not so much in size which was quite average but generous rather in tolerance in power and in laughter  all the health and buoyancy of her was in her mouth as well as in her eyes  she rarely exposed her teeth in smiling for which purpose she seemed chiefly to employ her eyes but when she laughed she showed strong white teeth even not babyish in their smallness but just the firm sensible normal size one would expect in a woman as healthy and normal as she  i would never have called her beautiful and yet she possessed many of the factors that go to compose feminine beauty  she had all the beauty of colouring a white skin that was healthy white and that was emphasized by the darkness of her lashes brows and hair  and in the same way the darkness of lashes and brows and the whiteness of skin set off the warm gray of her eyes  the forehead was well mediumbroad and medium high and quite smooth  no lines nor hints of lines were there suggestive of nervousness of blue days of depression and white nights of insomnia  oh she bore all the marks of the healthy human female who never worried nor was vexed in the spirit of her and in whose body every process and function was frictionless and automatic  miss west has posed to me as quite a weather prophet i said to the mate  now what is your forecast of our coming weather  she ought to be was mr pikes reply as he lifted his glance across the smooth swell of sea to the sky  this aint the first time shes been on the north atlantic in winter  he debated a moment as he studied the sea and sky  i should say considering the high barometer we ought to get a mild gale from the northeast or a calm with the chances in favour of the calm  she favoured me with a triumphant smile and suddenly clutched the rail as the elsinore lifted on an unusually large swell and sank into the trough with a roll from windward that flapped all the sails in hollow thunder  the calm has it miss west said with just a hint of grimness  and if this keeps up ill be in my bunk in about five minutes  she waved aside all sympathy  oh dont bother about me mr pathurst seasickness is only detestable and horrid like sleet and muddy weather and poison ivy besides id rather be seasick than have the hives  something went wrong with the men below us on the deck some stupidity or blunder that was made aware to us by mr mellaires raised voice  like mr pike he had a way of snarling at the sailors that was distinctly unpleasant to the ear  on the faces of several of the sailors bruises were in evidence  one in particular had an eye so swollen that it was closed  looks as if he had run against a stanchion in the dark i observed  most eloquent and most unconscious was the quick flash of miss wests eyes to mr pikes big paws with freshly abraded knuckles resting on the rail  it was a stab of hurt to me  she knew     chapter x   that evening the three men of us had dinner alone with racks on the table while the elsinore rolled in the calm that had sent miss west to her room  you wont see her for a couple of days captain west told me  her mother was the same waya born sailor but always sick at the outset of a voyage  its the shaking down  mr pike astonished me with the longest observation i had yet heard him utter at table  everybody has to shake down when they leave the land  weve got to forget the good times on shore and the good things moneyll buy and start watch and watch four hours on deck and four below  and it comes hard and all our tempers are strung until we can make the change  did it happen that you heard caruso and blanche arral this winter in new york mr pathurst  i nodded still marvelling over this spate of speech at table  well think of hearing them and homer and witherspoon and amato every night for nights and nights at the metropolitan and then to give it the goby and get to sea and shake down to watch and watch  you dont like the sea i queried  he sighed  i dont know  but of course the sea is all i know  except music i threw in  yes but the sea and all the longvoyaging has cheated me out of most of the music i oughta have had coming to me  i suppose youve heard schumann heink  wonderful wonderful he murmured fervently then regarded me with an eager wistfulness  ive halfadozen of her records and ive got the second dogwatch below  if captain west dont mind      captain west nodded that he didnt mind  and if youd want to hear them  the machine is a good one  and then to my amazement when the steward had cleared the table this hoary old relic of mankilling and mandriving days battered waif of the sea that he was carried in from his room a most splendid collection of phonograph records  these and the machine he placed on the table  the big doors were opened making the diningroom and the main cabin into one large room  it was in the cabin that captain west and i lolled in big leather chairs while mr pike ran the phonograph  his face was in a blaze of light from the swinging lamps and every shade of expression was visible to me  in vain i waited for him to start some popular song  his records were only of the best and the care he took of them was a revelation  he handled each one reverently as a sacred thing untying and unwrapping it and brushing it with a fine camels hair brush while it revolved and ere he placed the needle on it  for a time all i could see was the huge brute hands of a brutedriver with skin off the knuckles that expressed love in their every movement  each touch on the discs was a caress and while the record played he hovered over it and dreamed in some heaven of music all his own  during this time captain west lay back and smoked a cigar  his face was expressionless and he seemed very far away untouched by the music  i almost doubted that he heard it  he made no remarks between whiles betrayed no sign of approbation or displeasure  he seemed preternaturally serene preternaturally remote  and while i watched him i wondered what his duties were  i had not seen him perform any  mr pike had attended to the loading of the ship  not until she was ready for sea had captain west come on board  i had not seen him give an order  it looked to me that mr pike and mr mellaire did the work  all captain west did was to smoke cigars and keep blissfully oblivious of the elsinores crew  when mr pike had played the hallelujah chorus from the messiah and he shall feed his flock he mentioned to me almost apologetically that he liked sacred music and for the reason perhaps that for a short period a child ashore in san francisco he had been a choir boy  and then i hit the dominie over the head with a baseball bat and sneaked off to sea again he concluded with a harsh laugh  and thereat he fell to dreaming while he played meyerbeers king of heaven and mendelssohns o rest in the lord  when one bell struck at quarter to eight he carried his music all carefully wrapped back into his room  i lingered with him while he rolled a cigarette ere eight bells struck  ive got a lot more good things he said confidentially coenens come unto me and faures crucifix and theres o salutaris and lead kindly light by the trinity choir and jesu lover of my soul would just melt your heart  ill play em for you some night  do you believe in them i was led to ask by his rapt expression and by the picture of his brutedriving hands which i could not shake from my consciousness  he hesitated perceptibly then replied  i do    when im listening to them        my sleep that night was wretched  short of sleep from the previous night i closed my book and turned my light off early  but scarcely had i dropped into slumber when i was aroused by the recrudescence of my hives  all day they had not bothered me yet the instant i put out the light and slept the damnable persistent itching set up  wada had not yet gone to bed and from him i got more cream of tartar  it was useless however and at midnight when i heard the watch changing i partially dressed slipped into my dressinggown and went up on to the poop  i saw mr mellaire beginning his four hours watch pacing up and down the port side of the poop and i slipped away aft past the man at the wheel whom i did not recognize and took refuge in the lee of the wheel house  once again i studied the dim loom and tracery of intricate rigging and lofty sailcarrying spars thought of the mad imbecile crew and experienced premonitions of disaster  how could such a voyage be possible with such a crew on the huge elsinore a cargocarrier that was only a steel shell half an inch thick burdened with five thousand tons of coal  it was appalling to contemplate  the voyage had gone wrong from the first  in the wretched unbalance that loss of sleep brings to any good sleeper i could decide only that the voyage was doomed  yet how doomed it was in truth neither i nor a madman could have dreamed  i thought of the redblooded miss west who had always lived and had no doubts but what she would always live  i thought of the killing and driving and musicloving mr pike  many a haler remnant than he had gone down on a last voyage  as for captain west he did not count  he was too neutral a being too far away a sort of favoured passenger who had nothing to do but serenely and passively exist in some nirvana of his own creating  next i remembered the selfwounded greek sewed up by mr pike and lying gibbering between the steel walls of the midshiphouse  this picture almost decided me for in my fevered imagination he typified the whole mad helpless idiotic crew  certainly i could go back to baltimore thank god i had the money to humour my whims  had not mr pike told me in reply to a question that he estimated the running expenses of the elsinore at two hundred dollars a day  i could afford to pay two hundred a day or two thousand for the several days that might be necessary to get me back to the land to a pilot tug or any inbound craft to baltimore  i was quite wholly of a mind to go down and rout out captain west to tell him my decision when another presented itself then are you the thinker and philosopher the worldsick one afraid to go down to cease in the darkness  bah  my own pride in my lifepridelessness saved captain wests sleep from interruption  of course i would go on with the adventure if adventure it might be called to go sailing around cape horn with a shipload of fools and lunaticsand worse for i remembered the three babylonish and semitic ones who had aroused mr pikes ire and who had laughed so terribly and silently  night thoughts  sleepless thoughts  i dismissed them all and started below chilled through by the cold  but at the chartroom door i encountered mr mellaire  a pleasant evening sir he greeted me  a pity theres not a little wind to help us off the land  what do you think of the crew i asked after a moment or so  mr mellaire shrugged his shoulders  ive seen many queer crews in my time mr pathurst  but i never saw one as queer as thisboys old men cripples andyou saw tony the greek go overboard yesterday  well thats only the beginning  hes a sample ive got a big irishman in my watch whos going bad  did you notice a little driedup scotchman  who looks mean and angry all the time and who was steering the evening before last  the very oneandy fay  well andy fays just been complaining to me about osullivan  says osullivans threatened his life  when andy fay went off watch at eight he found osullivan stropping a razor  ill give you the conversation as andy gave it to me  says osullivan to me mr fay ill have a word wid yeh certainly says i what can i do for you  sell me your seaboots mr fay says osullivan polite as can be  but what will you be wantin of them says i  twill be a great favour says osullivan but its my only pair says i and you have a pair of your own says i  mr fay ill be needin me own in bad weather says osullivan besides says i you have no money  ill pay for them when we pay off in seattle says osullivan  ill not do it says i besides youre not tellin me what youll be doin with them  but i will tell yeh says osullivan im wantin to throw em over the side  and with that i turns to walk away but osullivan says very polite and seducinlike still astroppin the razor mr fay says he will you kindly step this way an have your throat cut  and with that i knew my life was in danger and i have come to make report to you sir that the man is a violent lunatic  or soon will be i remarked  i noticed him yesterday a big man muttering continually to himself  thats the man mr mellaire said  do you have many such at sea i asked  more than my share i do believe sir  he was lighting a cigarette at the moment and with a quick movement he pulled off his cap bent his head forward and held up the blazing match that i might see  i saw a grizzled head the full crown of which was not entirely bald but partially covered with a few sparse long hairs  and full across this crown disappearing in the thicker fringe above the ears ran the most prodigious scar i had ever seen  because the vision of it was so fleeting ere the match blew out and because of the scars very prodigiousness i may possibly exaggerate but i could have sworn that i could lay two fingers deep into the horrid cleft and that it was fully two fingers broad  there seemed no bone at all just a great fissure a deep valley covered with skin and i was confident that the brain pulsed immediately under that skin  he pulled his cap on and laughed in an amused reassuring way  a crazy sea cook did that mr pathurst with a meataxe  we were thousands of miles from anywhere in the south indian ocean at the time running our easting down but the cook got the idea into his addled head that we were lying in boston harbour and that i wouldnt let him go ashore  i had my back to him at the time and i never knew what struck me  but how could you recover from so fearful an injury i questioned there must have been a splendid surgeon on board and you must have had wonderful vitality  he shook his head  it must have been the vitality    and the molasses  molasses  yes the captain had oldfashioned prejudices against antiseptics  he always used molasses for fresh wounddressings  i lay in my bunk many weary weekswe had a long passageand by the time we reached hong kong the thing was healed there was no need for a shore surgeon and i was standing my third mates watchwe carried third mates in those days  not for many a long day was i to realize the dire part that scar in mr mellaires head was to play in his destiny and in the destiny of the elsinore  had i known at the time captain west would have received the most unusual awakening from sleep that he ever experienced for he would have been routed out by a very determined partiallydressed passenger with a proposition capable of going to the extent of buying the elsinore outright with all her cargo so that she might be sailed straight back to baltimore  as it was i merely thought it a very marvellous thing that mr mellaire should have lived so many years with such a hole in his head  we talked on and he gave me many details of that particular happening and of other happenings at sea on the part of the lunatics that seem to infest the sea  and yet i could not like the man  in nothing he said nor in the manner of saying things could i find fault  he seemed generous broadminded and for a sailor very much of a man of the world  it was easy for me to overlook his excessive suavity of speech and supercourtesy of social mannerism  it was not that  but all the time i was distressingly and i suppose intuitively aware though in the darkness i couldnt even see his eyes that there behind those eyes inside that skull was ambuscaded an alien personality that spied upon me measured me studied me and that said one thing while it thought another thing  when i said good night and went below it was with the feeling that i had been talking with the one half of some sort of a dual creature  the other half had not spoken  yet i sensed it there fluttering and quick behind the mask of words and flesh     chapter xi   but i could not sleep  i took more cream of tartar  it must be the heat of the bedclothes i decided that excited my hives  and yet whenever i ceased struggling for sleep and lighted the lamp and read my skin irritation decreased  but as soon as i turned out the lamp and closed my eyes i was troubled again  so hour after hour passed through which between vain attempts to sleep i managed to wade through many pages of rosnys le termitea not very cheerful proceeding i must say concerned as it is with the microscopic and overelaborate recital of noel servaises tortured nerves bodily pains and intellectual phantasma  at last i tossed the novel aside damned all analytical frenchmen and found some measure of relief in the more genial and cynical stendhal  over my head i could hear mr mellaire steadily pace up and down  at four the watches changed and i recognized the agelag in mr pikes promenade  half an hour later just as the stewards alarm went off instantly checked by that lightsleeping asiatic the elsinore began to heel over on my side  i could hear mr pike barking and snarling orders and at times a trample and shuffle of many feet passed over my head as the weird crew pulled and hauled  the elsinore continued to heel over until i could see the water against my port and then she gathered way and dashed ahead at such a rate that i could hear the stinging and singing of the foam through the circle of thick glass beside me  the steward brought me coffee and i read till daylight and after when wada served me breakfast and helped me dress  he too complained of inability to sleep  he had been bunked with nancy in one of the rooms in the midshiphouse  wada described the situation  the tiny room made of steel was airtight when the steel door was closed  and nancy insisted on keeping the door closed  as a result wada in the upper bunk had stifled  he told me that the air had got so bad that the flame of the lamp no matter how high it was turned guttered down and all but refused to burn  nancy snored beautifully through it all while he had been unable to close his eyes  he is not clean quoth wada  he is a pig  no more will i sleep in that place  on the poop i found the elsinore with many of her sails furled slashing along through a troubled sea under an overcast sky  also i found mr mellaire marching up and down just as i had left him hours before and it took quite a distinct effort for me to realize that he had had the watch off between four and eight  even then he told me he had slept from four until halfpast seven  that is one thing mr pathurst i always sleep like a baby    which means a good conscience sir yes a good conscience  and while he enunciated the platitude i was uncomfortably aware that that alien thing inside his skull was watching me studying me  in the cabin captain west smoked a cigar and read the bible  miss west did not appear and i was grateful that to my sleeplessness the curse of seasickness had not been added  without asking permission of anybody wada arranged a sleeping place for himself in a far corner of the big afterroom screening the corner with a solidly lashed wall of my trunks and empty book boxes  it was a dreary enough day no sun with occasional splatters of rain and a persistent crash of seas over the weather rail and swash of water across the deck  with my eyes glued to the cabin ports which gave forard along the main deck i could see the wretched sailors whenever they were given some task of pull and haul wet through and through by the boarding seas  several times i saw some of them taken off their feet and rolled about in the creaming foam  and yet erect unstaggering with certitude of weight and strength among these rolled men these clutching cowering ones moved either mr pike or mr mellaire  they were never taken off their feet  they never shrank away from a splash of spray or heavier bulk of downfalling water  they had fed on different food were informed with a different spirit were of iron in contrast with the poor miserables they drove to their bidding  in the afternoon i dozed for halfanhour in one of the big chairs in the cabin  had it not been for the violent motion of the ship i could have slept there for hours for the hives did not trouble  captain west stretched out on the cabin sofa his feet in carpet slippers slept enviably  by some instinct i might say in the deep of sleep he kept his place and was not rolled off upon the floor  also he lightly held a halfsmoked cigar in one hand  i watched him for an hour and knew him to be asleep and marvelled that he maintained his easy posture and did not drop the cigar  after dinner there was no phonograph  the second dogwatch was mr pikes on deck  besides as he explained the rolling was too severe  it would make the needle jump and scratch his beloved records  and no sleep  another weary night of torment and another dreary overcast day and leaden troubled sea  and no miss west  wada too is seasick although heroically he kept his feet and tried to tend on me with glassy unseeing eyes  i sent him to his bunk and read through the endless hours until my eyes were tired and my brain between lack of sleep and overuse was fuzzy  captain west is no conversationalist  the more i see of him the more i am baffled  i have not yet found a reason for that first impression i received of him  he has all the poise and air of a remote and superior being and yet i wonder if it be not poise and air and nothing else  just as i had expected that first meeting ere he spoke a word to hear fall from his lips words of untold beneficence and wisdom and then heard him utter mere social commonplaces so i now find myself almost forced to conclude that his touch of race and beak of power and all the tall aristocratic slenderness of him have nothing behind them  and yet on the other hand i can find no reason for rejecting that first impression  he has not shown any strength but by the same token he has not shown any weakness  sometimes i wonder what resides behind those clear blue eyes  certainly i have failed to find any intellectual backing  i tried him out with william james varieties of religious experience  he glanced at a few pages then returned it to me with the frank statement that it did not interest him  he has no books of his own  evidently he is not a reader  then what is he  i dared to feel him out on politics  he listened courteously said sometimes yes and sometimes no and when i ceased from very discouragement said nothing  aloof as the two officers are from the men captain west is still more aloof from his officers  i have not seen him address a further word to mr mellaire than good morning on the poop  as for mr pike who eats three times a day with him scarcely any more conversation obtains between them  and i am surprised by what seems the very conspicuous awe with which mr pike seems to regard his commander  another thing  what are captain wests duties  so far he has done nothing save eat three times a day smoke many cigars and each day stroll a total of one mile around the poop  the mates do all the work and hard work it is four hours on deck and four below day and night with never a variation  i watch captain west and am amazed  he will loll back in the cabin and stare straight before him for hours at a time until i am almost frantic to demand of him what are his thoughts sometimes i doubt that he is thinking at all  i give him up  i cannot fathom him  altogether a depressing day of rainsplatter and wash of water across the deck  i can see now that the problem of sailing a ship with five thousand tons of coal around the horn is more serious than i had thought so deep is the elsinore in the water that she is like a log awash  her tall sixfoot bulwarks of steel cannot keep the seas from boarding her she has not the buoyancy one is accustomed to ascribe to ships  on the contrary she is weighted down until she is dead so that for this one day alone i am appalled at the thought of how many thousands of tons of the north atlantic have boarded her and poured out through her spouting scuppers and clanging ports  yes a depressing day  the two mates have alternated on deck and in their bunks  captain west has dozed on the cabin sofa or read the bible miss west is still seasick  i have tired myself out with reading and the fuzziness of my unsleeping brain makes for melancholy  even wada is anything but a cheering spectacle crawling out of his bunk as he does at stated intervals and with sick glassy eyes trying to discern what my needs may be  i almost wish i could get seasick myself  i had never dreamed that a sea voyage could be so unenlivening as this one is proving     chapter xii   another morning of overcast sky and leaden sea and of the elsinore under half her canvas clanging her deck ports spouting water from her scuppers and dashing eastward into the heart of the atlantic  and i have failed to sleep halfanhour all told  at this rate in a very short time i shall have consumed all the cream of tartar on the ship  i never have had hives like these before  i cant understand it  so long as i keep my lamp burning and read i am untroubled  the instant i put out the lamp and drowse off the irritation starts and the lumps on my skin begin to form  miss west may be seasick but she cannot be comatose because at frequent intervals she sends the steward to me with more cream of tartar  i have had a revelation today  i have discovered captain west  he is a samuraiyou remember the samurai that h  g  wells describes in his modern utopiathe superior breed of men who know things and are masters of life and of their fellowmen in a superbenevolent superwise way  well that is what captain west is  let me tell it to you  we had a shift of wind today  in the height of a southwest gale the wind shifted in the instant eight points which is equivalent to a quarter of the circle  imagine it  imagine a gale howling from out of the southwest  and then imagine the wind in a heavier and more violent gale abruptly smiting you from the northwest  we had been sailing through a circular storm captain west vouchsafed to me before the event and the wind could be expected to box the compass  clad in seaboots oilskins and souwester i had for some time been hanging upon the rail at the break of the poop staring down fascinated at the poor devils of sailors repeatedly up to their necks in water or submerged or dashed like straws about the deck while they pulled and hauled stupidly blindly and in evident fear under the orders of mr pike  mr pike was with them working them and working with them  he took every chance they took yet somehow he escaped being washed off his feet though several times i saw him entirely buried from view  there was more than luck in the matter for i saw him twice at the head of a line of the men himself next to the pin  and twice in this position i saw the north atlantic curl over the rail and fall upon them  and each time he alone remained holding the turn of the rope on the pin while the rest of them were rolled and sprawled helplessly away  almost it seemed to me good fun as at a circus watching their antics but i did not apprehend the seriousness of the situation until the wind screaming higher than ever and the sea asmoke and white with wrath two men did not get up from the deck  one was carried away forard with a broken legit was iare jacobson a dullwitted scandinavian and the other kid twist was carried away unconscious with a bleeding scalp  in the height of the gusts in my high position where the seas did not break i found myself compelled to cling tightly to the rail to escape being blown away  my face was stung to severe pain by the highdriving spindrift and i had a feeling that the wind was blowing the cobwebs out of my sleepstarved brain  and all the time slender aristocratic graceful in streaming oilskins in apparent unconcern giving no orders effortlessly accommodating his body to the violent rolling of the elsinore captain west strolled up and down  it was at this stage in the gale that he unbent sufficiently to tell me that we were going through a circular storm and that the wind was boxing the compass  i did notice that he kept his gaze pretty steadily fixed on the overcast clouddriven sky  at last when it seemed the wind could not possibly blow more fiercely he found in the sky what he sought  it was then that i first heard his voicea seavoice clear as a bell distinct as silver and of an ineffable sweetness and volume as it might be the trump of gabriel  that voiceeffortless dominating  the mighty threat of the storm made articulate by the resistance of the elsinore shouted in all the stays bellowed in the shrouds thrummed the taut ropes against the steel masts and from the myriad tiny ropes far aloft evoked a devils chorus of shrill pipings and screechings  and yet through this bedlam of noise came captain wests voice as of a spirit visitant distinct unrelated mellow as all music and mighty as an archangels call to judgment  and it carried understanding and command to the man at the wheel and to mr pike waistdeep in the wash of sea below us  and the man at the wheel obeyed and mr pike obeyed barking and snarling orders to the poor wallowing devils who wallowed on and obeyed him in turn  and as the voice was the face  this face i had never seen before  it was the face of the spirit visitant chaste with wisdom lighted by a splendour of power and calm  perhaps it was the calm that smote me most of all  it was as the calm of one who had crossed chaos to bless poor seaworn men with the word that all was well it was not the face of the fighter  to my thrilled imagination it was the face of one who dwelt beyond all strivings of the elements and broody dissensions of the blood  the samurai had arrived in thunders and lightnings riding the wings of the storm directing the gigantic labouring elsinore in all her intricate massiveness commanding the wisps of humans to his will which was the will of wisdom  and then that wonderful gabriel voice of his silent while his creatures laboured his will unconcerned detached and casual more slenderly tall and aristocratic than ever in his streaming oilskins captain west touched my shoulder and pointed astern over our weather quarter  i looked and all that i could see was a vague smoke of sea and air and a cloudbank of sky that tore at the oceans breast  and at the same moment the gale from the southwest ceased  there was no gale no moving zephyrs nothing but a vast quietude of air  what is it i gasped out of equilibrium from the abrupt cessation of wind  the shift he said  there she comes  and it came from the northwest a blast of wind a blow an atmospheric impact that bewildered and stunned and again made the elsinore harp protest  it forced me down on the rail  i was like a windlestraw  as i faced this new abruptness of gale it drove the air back into my lungs so that i suffocated and turned my head aside to breathe in the lee of the draught  the man at the wheel again listened to the gabriel voice and mr pike on the deck below listened and repeated the will of the voice and captain west in slender and stately balance leaned into the face of the wind and slowly paced the deck  it was magnificent  now and for the first time i knew the sea and the men who overlord the sea  captain west had vindicated himself exposited himself  at the height and crisis of storm he had taken charge of the elsinore and mr pike had become what in truth was all he was the foreman of a gang of men the slavedriver of slaves serving the one from beyondthe samurai  a minute or so longer captain west strolled up and down leaning easily into the face of this new and abominable gale or resting his back against it and then he went below pausing for a moment his hand on the knob of the chartroom door to cast a last measuring look at the stormwhite sea and wrathsombre sky he had mastered  ten minutes later below passing the open cabin door i glanced in and saw him  seaboots and stormtrappings were gone his feet in carpet slippers rested on a hassock while he lay back in the big leather chair smoking dreamily his eyes wide open absorbed nonseeingor if they saw seeing things beyond the reeling cabin walls and beyond my ken  i have developed an immense respect for captain west though now i know him less than the little i thought i knew him before     chapter xiii   small wonder that miss west remains seasick on an ocean like this which has become a factory where the veering gales manufacture the selectest and most mountainous brands of crossseas  the way the poor elsinore pitches plunges rolls and shivers with all her lofty spars and masts and all her five thousand tons of deadweight cargo is astonishing  to me she is the most erratic thing imaginable yet mr pike with whom i now pace the poop on occasion tells me that coal is a good cargo and that the elsinore is wellloaded because he saw to it himself  he will pause abruptly in the midst of his interminable pacing in order to watch her in her maddest antics  the sight is very pleasant to him for his eyes glisten and a faint glow seems to irradiate his face and impart to it a hint of ecstasy  the elsinore has a snug place in his heart i am confident  he calls her behaviour admirable and at such times will repeat to me that it was he who saw to her loading  it is very curious the habituation of this man through a long life on the sea to the motion of the sea  there is a rhythm to this chaos of crossing buffeting waves  i sense this rhythm although i cannot solve it  but mr pike knows it  again and again as we paced up and down this afternoon when to me nothing unusually antic seemed impending he would seize my arm as i lost balance and as the elsinore smashed down on her side and heeled over and over with a colossal roll that seemed never to end and that always ended with an abrupt snapofthewhip effect as she began the corresponding roll to windward  in vain i strove to learn how mr pike forecasts these antics and i am driven to believe that he does not consciously forecast them at all  he feels them he knows them  they and the sea are ingrained in him  toward the end of our little promenade i was guilty of impatiently shaking off a sudden seizure of my arm in his big paw  if ever in an hour the elsinore had been less gymnastic than at that moment i had not noticed it  so i shook off the sustaining clutch and the next moment the elsinore had smashed down and buried a couple of hundred feet of her starboard rail beneath the sea while i had shot down the deck and smashed myself breathless against the wall of the charthouse my ribs and one shoulder are sore from it yet  now how did he know  and he never staggers nor seems in danger of being rolled away  on the contrary such a surplus of surety of balance has he that time and again he lent his surplus to me  i begin to have more respect not for the sea but for the men of the sea and not for the sweepings of seamen that are as slaves on our decks but for the real seamen who are their mastersfor captain west for mr pike yes and for mr mellaire dislike him as i do  as early as three in the afternoon the wind still a gale went back to the southwest  mr mellaire had the deck and he went below and reported the change to captain west  well wear ship at four mr pathurst the second mate told me when he came back  youll find it an interesting manoeuvre  but why wait till four i asked  the captains orders sir  the watches will be changing and well have the use of both of them without working a hardship on the watch below by calling it out now  and when both watches were on deck captain west again in oilskins came out of the charthouse  mr pike out on the bridge took charge of the many men who on deck and on the poop were to manage the mizzenbraces while mr mellaire went forard with his watch to handle the foreand mainbraces  it was a pretty manoeuvre a play of leverages by which they cased the force of the wind on the after part of the elsinore and used the force of the wind on the forard part  captain west gave no orders whatever and to all intents was quite oblivious of what was being done  he was again the favoured passenger taking a stroll for his healths sake  and yet i knew that both his officers were uncomfortably aware of his presence and were keyed to their finest seamanship  i know now captain wests position on board  he is the brains of the elsinore  he is the master strategist  there is more in directing a ship on the ocean than in standing watches and ordering men to pull and haul  they are pawns and the two officers are pieces with which captain west plays the game against sea and wind and season and ocean current  he is the knower  they are his tongue by which he makes his knowledge articulate        a bad nightequally bad for the elsinore and for me  she is receiving a sharp buffeting at the hands of the wintry north atlantic  i fell asleep early exhausted from lack of sleep and awoke in an hour frantic with my lumped and burning skin  more cream of tartar more reading more vain attempts to sleep until shortly before five when the steward brought me my coffee i wrapped myself in my dressinggown and like a being distracted prowled into the cabin  i dozed in a leather chair and was thrown out by a violent roll of the ship  i tried the sofa sinking to sleep immediately and immediately thereafter finding myself precipitated to the floor  i am convinced that when captain west naps on the sofa he is only half asleep  how else can he maintain so precarious a positionunless in him too the sea and its motion be ingrained  i wandered into the diningroom wedged myself into a screwed chair and fell asleep my head on my arms my arms on the table  and at quarter past seven the steward roused me by shaking my shoulders  it was time to set table  heavy with the brief heaviness of sleep i had had i dressed and stumbled up on to the poop in the hope that the wind would clear my brain  mr pike had the watch and with sure agelagging step he paced the deck the man is a marvelsixtynine years old a life of hardship and as sturdy as a lion  yet of the past night alone his hours had been four to six in the afternoon on deck eight to twelve on deck and four to eight in the morning on deck  in a few minutes he would be relieved but at midday he would again be on deck  i leaned on the pooprail and stared forard along the dreary waste of deck  every port and scupper was working to ease the weight of north atlantic that perpetually fell on board  between the rush of the cascades streaks of rust showed everywhere  some sort of a wooden pin rail had carried away on the starboardrail at the foot of the mizzen shrouds and an amazing raffle of ropes and tackles washed about  here nancy and halfadozen men worked sporadically and in fear of their lives to clear the tangle  the longsuffering bleakness was very pronounced on nancys face and when the walls of water in impending downfall reared above the elsinores rail he was always the first to leap for the lifeline which had been stretched fore and aft across the wide space of deck  the rest of the men were scarcely less backward in dropping their work and springing to safetyif safety it might be called to grip a rope in both hands and have legs sweep out from under and be wrenched fulllength upon the boiling surface of an icecold flood  small wonder they look wretched  bad as their condition was when they came aboard at baltimore they look far worse now what of the last several days of wet and freezing hardship  from time to time completing his forard pace along the poop mr pike would pause ere he retraced his steps and snort sardonic glee at what happened to the poor devils below  the mans heart is callous  a thing of iron he has endured and he has no patience nor sympathy with these creatures who lack his own excessive iron  i noticed the stonedeaf man the twisted oaf whose face i have described as being that of an illtreated and feebleminded faun  his bright liquid painfilled eyes were more filled with pain than ever his face still more lean and drawn with suffering  and yet his face showed an excess of nervousness sensitiveness and a pathetic eagerness to please and do  i could not help observing that despite his dreadful sensehandicap and his wrecked frail body he did the most work was always the last of the group to spring to the lifeline and always the first to loose the lifeline and slosh kneedeep or waistdeep through the churning water to attack the immense and depressing tangle of rope and tackle  i remarked to mr pike that the men seemed thinner and weaker than when they came on board and he delayed replying for a moment while he stared down at them with that cattlebuyers eye of his  sure they are he said disgustedly  a weak breed thats what they arenothing to build on no stamina  the least thing drags them down why in my day we grew fat on work like thatonly we didnt we worked so hard there wasnt any chance for fat  we kept in fighting trim that was all  but as for this scum and slumsay you remember mr pathurst that man i spoke to the first day who said his name was charles davis  the one you thought there was something the matter with  yes and there was too  hes in that midship room with the greek now hell never do a tap of work the whole voyage  hes a hospital case if there ever was one  talk about shot to pieces  hes got holes in him i could shove my fist through  i dont know whether theyre perforating ulcers or cancers or cannonshot wounds or what not  and he had the nerve to tell me they showed up after he came on board  and he had them all the time i asked  all the time  take my word mr pathurst theyre years old  but hes a wonder  i watched him those first days sent him aloft had him down in the forehold trimming a few tons of coal did everything to him and he never showed a wince  being up to the neck in the salt water finally fetched him and now hes reported off dutyfor the voyage  and hell draw his wages for the whole time have all night in and never do a tap oh hes a hot one to have passed over on us and the elsinores another man short  another i exclaimed  is the greek going to die  no fear  ill have him steering in a few days  i refer to the misfits if we rolled a dozen of them together they wouldnt make one real man im not saying it to alarm you for theres nothing alarming about it but were going to have proper hell this voyage  he broke off to stare reflectively at his broken knuckles as if estimating how much drive was left in them then sighed and concluded well i can see ive got my work cut out for me  sympathizing with mr pike is futile the only effect is to make his mood blacker  i tried it and he retaliated with  you oughta see the bloke with curvature of the spine in mr mellaires watch  hes a proper hobo too and a land lubber and dont weigh moren a hundred pounds and must be fifty years old and hes got curvature of the spine and hes able seaman if you please on the elsinore  and worse than all that he puts it over on you hes nasty hes mean hes a viper a wasp  he aint afraid of anything because he knows you dassent hit him for fear of croaking him  oh hes a pearl of purest ray serene if anybody should slide down a backstay and ask you if you fail to identify him any other way his name is mulligan jacobs        after breakfast again on deck in mr mellaires watch i discovered another efficient  he was at the wheel a small wellknit muscular man of say fortyfive with black hair graying on the temples a big eagle face swarthy with keen intelligent black eyes  mr mellaire vindicated my judgment by telling me the man was the best sailor in his watch a proper seaman  when he referred to the man as the maltese cockney and i asked why he replied  first because he is maltese mr pathurst and next because he talks cockney like a native  and depend upon it he heard bow bells before he lisped his first word  and has osullivan bought andy fays seaboots yet i queried  it was at this moment that miss west emerged upon the poop  she was as rosy and vital as ever and certainly if she had been seasick she flew no signals of it  as she came toward me greeting me i could not help remarking again the lithe and springy limbmovement with which she walked and her fine firm skin  her neck free in a sailor collar with white sweater open at the throat seemed almost redoubtably strong to my sleepless jaundiced eyes  her hair under a white knitted cap was smooth and wellgroomed  in fact the totality of impression she conveyed was of a wellgroomedness one would not expect of a seacaptains daughter much less of a woman who had been seasick lifethat is the key of her the essential note of herlife and health  ill wager she has never entertained a morbid thought in that practical balanced sensible head of hers  and how have you been she asked then rattled on with sheer exuberance ere i could answer  had a lovely nights sleep  i was really over my sickness yesterday but i just devoted myself to resting up  i slept ten solid hourswhat do you think of that  i wish i could say the same i replied with appropriate dejection as i swung in beside her for she had evinced her intention of promenading  oh then youve been sick  on the contrary i answered dryly  and i wish i had been  i havent had five hours sleep all told since i came on board  these pestiferous hives     i held up a lumpy wrist to show  she took one glance at it halted abruptly and neatly balancing herself to the roll took my wrist in both her hands and gave it close scrutiny  mercy she cried and then began to laugh  i was of two minds  her laughter was delightful to the ear there was such a mellowness and healthiness and frankness about it  on the other hand that it should be directed at my misfortune was exasperating  i suppose my perplexity showed in my face for when she had eased her laughter and looked at me with a sobering countenance she immediately went off into more peals  you poor child she gurgled at last  and when i think of all the cream of tartar i made you consume  it was rather presumptuous of her to poorchild me and i resolved to take advantage of the data i already possessed in order to ascertain just how many years she was my junior  she had told me she was twelve years old the time the dixie collided with the river steamer in san francisco bay  very well all i had to do was to ascertain the date of that disaster and i had her  but in the meantime she laughed at me and my hives  i suppose it iserhumorous in some sort of way i said a bit stiffly only to find that there was no use in being stiff with miss west for it only set her off into more laughter  what you needed she announced with fresh gurglings was an exterior treatment  dont tell me ive got the chickenpox or the measles i protested  no  she shook her head emphatically while she enjoyed another paroxysm  what you are suffering from is a severe attack      she paused deliberately and looked me straight the eyes  of bedbugs she concluded  and then all seriousness and practicality she went on but well have that righted in a jiffy  ill turn the elsinores afterquarters upside down though i know there are none in fathers room or mine  and though this is my first voyage with mr pike i know hes too hardbitten here i laughed at her involuntary pun an old sailor not to know that his room is clean  yours i was perturbed for fear she was going to say that i had brought them on board have most probably drifted in from forard  they always have them forard  and now mr pathurst i am going down to attend to your case  youd better get your wada to make up a camping kit for you  the next couple of nights youll spend in the cabin or chartroom  and be sure wada removes all silver and metallic tarnishable stuff from your rooms theres going to be all sorts of fumigating and tearing out of woodwork and rebuilding  trust me  i know the vermin     chapter xiv   such a cleaning up and turning over  for two nights one in the chart room and one on the cabin sofa i have soaked myself in sleep and i am now almost stupid with excess of sleep  the land seems very far away  by some strange quirk i have an impression that weeks or months have passed since i left baltimore on that bitter march morning  and yet it was march 28 and this is only the first week in april  i was entirely right in my first estimation of miss west  she is the most capable practically masterful woman i have ever encountered  what passed between her and mr pike i do not know but whatever it was she was convinced that he was not the erring one  in some strange way my two rooms are the only ones which have been invaded by this plague of vermin  under miss wests instructions bunks drawers shelves and all superficial woodwork have been ripped out  she worked the carpenter from daylight till dark and then after a night of fumigation two of the sailors with turpentine and white lead put the finishing touches on the cleansing operations  the carpenter is now busy rebuilding my rooms then will come the painting and in two or three more days i expect to be settled back in my quarters  of the men who did the turpentining and whiteleading there have been four  two of them were quickly rejected by miss west as not being up to the work  the first one steve roberts which he told me was his name is an interesting fellow  i talked with him quite a bit ere miss west sent him packing and told mr pike that she wanted a real sailor  this is the first time steve roberts has ever seen the sea  how he happened to drift from the western cattleranges to new york he did not explain any more than did he explain how he came to ship on the elsinore  but here he is not a sailor on horseback but a cowboy on the sea  he is a small man but most powerfully built  his shoulders are very broad and his muscles bulge under his shirt and yet he is slenderwaisted leanlimbed and hollowcheeked  this last however is not due to sickness or illhealth  tyro as he is on the sea steve roberts is keen and intelligent    yes and crooked  he has a way of looking straight at one with utmost frankness while he talks and yet it is at such moments i get most strongly the impression of crookedness  but he is a man if trouble should arise to be reckoned with  in ways he suggests a kinship with the three men mr pike took so instant a prejudice againstkid twist nosey murphy and bert rhine  and i have already noticed in the dogwatches that it is with this trio that steve roberts chums  the second sailor miss west rejected after silently watching him work for five minutes was mulligan jacobs the wisp of a man with curvature of the spine  but before she sent him packing other things occurred in which i was concerned  i was in the room when mulligan jacobs first came in to go to work and i could not help observing the startled avid glance he threw at my big shelves of books  he advanced on them in the way a robber might advance on a secret hoard of gold and as a miser would fondle gold so mulligan jacobs fondled these booktitles with his eyes  and such eyes  all time bitterness and venom mr pike had told me the man possessed was there in his eyes  they were small paleblue and gimletpointed with fire  his eyelids were inflamed and but served to ensanguine the bitter and coldblazing intensity of the pupils  the man was constitutionally a hater and i was not long in learning that he hated all things except books  would you care to read some of them i said hospitably  all the caress in his eyes for the books vanished as he turned his head to look at me and ere he spoke i knew that i too was hated  its hell aint ityou with a strong body and servants to carry for you a weight of books like this and me with a curved spine that puts the pothooks of hellfire into my brain  how can i possibly convey the terrible venomousness with which he uttered these words  i know that mr pike dragging his feet down the hall past my open door gave me a very gratifying sense of safety  being alone in the room with this man seemed much the same as if i were locked in a cage with a tigercat  the devilishness the wickedness and above all the pitch of glaring hatred with which the man eyed me and addressed me were most unpleasant  i swear i knew fearnot calculated caution not timid apprehension but blind panic unreasoned terror  the malignancy of the creature was blood curdling nor did it require words to convey it it poured from him out of his redrimmed blazing eyes out of his withered twisted tortured face out of his brokennailed crooked talons of hands  and yet in that very moment of instinctive startle and repulsion the thought was in my mind that with one hand i could take the throat of the weazened wisp of a crippled thing and throttle the malformed life out of it  but there was little encouragement in such thoughtno more than a man might feel in a cave of rattlesnakes or a pit of centipedes for crush them with his very bulk nevertheless they would first sink their poison into him  and so with this mulligan jacobs  my fear of him was the fear of being infected with his venom  i could not help it for i caught a quick vision of the black and broken teeth i had seen in his mouth sinking into my flesh polluting me eating me with their acid destroying me  one thing was very clear  in the creature was no fear  absolutely he did not know fear  he was as devoid of it as the fetid slime one treads underfoot in nightmares  lord lord that is what the thing was a nightmare  you suffer pain often i asked attempting to get myself in hand by the calculated use of sympathy  the hooks are in me in the brain whitehot hooks that burn an burn was his reply  but by what damnable right do you have all these books and time to read em an all night in to read em an soak in them when me brains on fire and im watch and watch an me broken spine wont let me carry half a hundredweight of books about with me  another madman was my conclusion and yet i was quickly compelled to modify it for thinking to play with a rattlebrain i asked him what were the books up to half a hundredweight he carried and what were the writers he preferred  his library he told me among other things included first and foremost a complete byron  next was a complete shakespeare also a complete browning in one volume  a full halldozen he had in the forecastle of renan a stray volume of lecky winwood reades martyrdom of man several of carlyle and eight or ten of zola zola he swore by though anatole france was a prime favourite  he might be mad was my revised judgment but he was most differently mad from any madman i had ever encountered  i talked on with him about books and bookmen  he was most universal and particular  he liked o  henry george moore was a cad and a fourflusher  edgar saltus anatomy of negation was profounder than kant  maeterlinck was a mystic frump emerson was a charlatan  ibsens ghosts was the stuff though ibsen was a bourgeois lickspittler  heine was the real goods  he preferred flaubert to de maupassant and turgenieff to tolstoy but gorky was the best of the russian boiling  john masefield knew what he was writing about and joseph conrad was living too fat to turn out the stuff he first turned out  and so it went the most amazing running commentary on literature i had ever heard  i was hugely interested and i quizzed him on sociology yes he was a red and knew his kropotkin but he was no anarchist  on the other hand political action was a blindalley leading to reformism and quietism  political socialism had gone to pot while industrial unionism was the logical culmination of marxism  he was a direct actionist  the mass strike was the thing  sabotage not merely as a withdrawal of efficiency but as a keen destructionofprofits policy was the weapon  of course he believed in the propaganda of the deed but a man was a fool to talk about it  his job was to do it and keep his mouth shut and the way to do it was to shoot the evidence  of course he talked but what of it  didnt he have curvature of the spine  he didnt care when he got his and woe to the man who tried to give it to him  and while he talked he hated me  he seemed to hate the things he talked about and espoused  i judged him to be of irish descent and it was patent that he was selfeducated  when i asked him how it was he had come to sea he replied that the hooks in his brain were as hot one place as another  he unbent enough to tell me that he had been an athlete when he was a young man a professional footracer in eastern canada  and then his disease had come upon him and for a quarter of a century he had been a common tramp and vagabond and he bragged of a personal acquaintance with more city prisons and county jails than any man that ever existed  it was at this stage in our talk that mr pike thrust his head into the doorway  he did not address me but he favoured me with a most sour look of disapprobation  mr pikes countenance is almost petrified  any expression seems to crack itwith the exception of sourness  but when mr pike wants to look sour he has no difficulty at all  his hardskinned hardmuscled face just flows to sourness  evidently he condemned my consuming mulligan jacobss time  to mulligan jacobs he said in his customary snarl  go on an get to your work  chew the rag in your watch below  and then i got a sample of mulligan jacobs  the venom of hatred i had already seen in his face was as nothing compared with what now was manifested  i had a feeling that like stroking a cat in cold weather did i touch his face it would crackle electric sparks  aw go to hell you old stiff said mulligan jacobs  if ever i had seen murder in a mans eyes i saw it then in the mates he lunged into the room his arm tensed to strike the hand not open but clenched  one stroke of that bears paw and mulligan jacobs and all the poisonous flame of him would have been quenched in the everlasting darkness  but he was unafraid  like a cornered rat like a rattlesnake on the trail unflinching sneering snarling he faced the irate giant more than that  he even thrust his face forward on its twisted neck to meet the blow  it was too much for mr pike it was too impossible to strike that frail crippled repulsive thing  its me that can call you the stiff said mulligan jacobs  i aint no larry  gwan an hit me  why dont you hit me  and mr pike was too appalled to strike the creature  he whose whole career on the sea had been that of a bucko driver in a shambles could not strike this fractured splinter of a man  i swear that mr pike actually struggled with himself to strike  i saw it  but he could not  go on to your work he ordered  the voyage is young yet mulligan ill have you eatin outa my hand before its over  and mulligan jacobss face thrust another inch closer on its twisted neck while all his concentrated rage seemed on the verge of bursting into incandescence  so immense and tremendous was the bitterness that consumed him that he could find no words to clothe it  all he could do was to hawk and guttural deep in his throat until i should not have been surprised had he spat poison in the mates face  and mr pike turned on his heel and left the room beaten absolutely beaten        i cant get it out of my mind  the picture of the mate and the cripple facing each other keeps leaping up under my eyelids  this is different from the books and from what i know of existence  it is revelation  life is a profoundly amazing thing  what is this bitter flame that informs mulligan jacobs  how dare hewith no hope of any profit not a hero not a leader of a forlorn hope nor a martyr to god but a mere filthy malignant rathow dare he i ask myself be so defiant so deathinviting  the spectacle of him makes me doubt all the schools of the metaphysicians and the realists  no philosophy has a leg to stand on that does not account for mulligan jacobs  and all the midnight oil of philosophy i have burned does not enable me to account for mulligan jacobs    unless he be insane  and then i dont know  was there ever such a freight of human souls on the sea as these humans with whom i am herded on the elsinore        and now working in my rooms whiteleading and turpentining is another one of them  i have learned his name  it is arthur deacon  he is the pallid furtiveeyed man whom i observed the first day when the men were routed out of the forecastle to man the windlassthe man i so instantly adjudged a drugfiend  he certainly looks it  i asked mr pike his estimate of the man  white slaver was his answer  had to skin outa new york to save his skin  hell be consorting with those other three larrakins i gave a piece of my mind to  and what do you make of them i asked  a months wages to a pound of tobacco that a district attorney or a committee of some sort investigating the new york police is lookin for em right now  id like to have the cash somebodys put up in new york to send them on this getaway  oh i know the breed  gangsters i queried  thats what  but ill trim their dirty hides  ill trim em  mr pathurst this voyage aint started yet and this old stiffs a long way from his last legs  ill give them a run for their money  why ive buried better men than the best of them aboard this craft  and ill bury some of them that think me an old stiff  he paused and looked at me solemnly for a full half minute  mr pathurst ive heard youre a writing man  and when they told me at the agents you were going along passenger i made a point of going to see your play  now im not saying anything about that play one way or the other  but i just want to tell you that as a writing man youll get stuff in plenty to write about on this voyage  hells going to pop believe me and right here before you is the stiff thatll do a lot of the poppin  some several and plentys going to learn whos an old stiff     chapter xv   how i have been sleeping  this relief of renewed normality is deliciousthanks to miss west  now why did not captain west or mr pike both experienced men diagnose my trouble for me  and then there was wada  but no it required miss west  again i contemplate the problem of woman  it is just such an incident among a million others that keeps the thinkers gaze fixed on woman  they truly are the mothers and the conservers of the race  rail as i will at miss wests redblood complacency of life yet i must bow my head to her lifegiving to me  practical sensible hardheaded a comfortmaker and a nestbuilder possessing all the distressing attributes of the blindinstinctive racemother nevertheless i must confess i am most grateful that she is along  had she not been on the elsinore by this time i should have been so overwrought from lack of sleep that i would be biting my veins and howlingas mad a hatter as any of our cargo of mad hatters  and so we come to itthe everlasting mystery of woman  one may not be able to get along with her yet is it patent as of old time that one cannot get along without her  but regarding miss west i do entertain one fervent hope namely that she is not a suffragette  that would be too much  captain west may be a samurai but he is also human  he was really a bit fluttery this morning in his reserved controlled way when he regretted the plague of vermin i had encountered in my rooms  it seems he has a keen sense of hospitality and that he is my host on the elsinore and that although he is oblivious of the existence of the crew he is not oblivious of my comfort  by his few expressions of regret it appears that he cannot forgive himself for his careless acceptance of the erroneous diagnosis of my affliction  yes captain west is a real human man  is he not the father of the slenderfaced strappingbodied miss west  thank goodness thats settled was miss wests exclamation this morning when we met on the poop and after i had told her how gloriously i had slept  and then that nightmare episode dismissed because forsooth for all practical purposesit was settled she next said  come on and see the chickens  and i accompanied her along the spidery bridge to the top of the midship house to look at the one rooster and the four dozen fat hens in the ships chickencoop  as i accompanied her my eyes dwelling pleasurably on that vital gait of hers as she preceded me i could not help reflecting that coming down on the tug from baltimore she had promised not to bother me nor require to be entertained  come and see the chickensoh the sheer female possessiveness of that simple invitation  for effrontery of possessiveness is there anything that can exceed the nestmaking planetpopulating female human womancome and see the chickens  oh well the sailors forard may be hardbitten but i can promise miss west that here aft is one male passenger unmarried and never married who is an equally hardbitten adventurer on the sea of matrimony  when i go over the census i remember at least several women superior to miss west who trilled their song of sex and failed to shipwreck me  as i read over what i have written i notice how the terminology of the sea has stolen into my mental processes  involuntarily i think in terms of the sea  another thing i notice is my excessive use of superlatives but then everything on board the elsinore is superlative  i find myself continually combing my vocabulary in quest of just and adequate words  yet am i aware of failure  for example all the words of all the dictionaries would fail to approximate the exceeding terribleness of mulligan jacobs  but to return to the chickens  despite every precaution it was evident that they had had a hard time during the past days of storm  it was equally evident that miss west even during her seasickness had not neglected them  under her directions the steward had actually installed a small oilstove in the big coop and she now beckoned him up to the top of the house as he was passing forard to the galley  it was for the purpose of instructing him further in the matter of feeding them  where were the grits  they needed grits  he didnt know  the sack had been lost among the miscellaneous stores but mr pike had promised a couple of sailors that afternoon to overhaul the lazarette  plenty of ashes she told the steward  remember  and if a sailor doesnt clean the coop each day you report to me  and give them only clean foodno spoiled scraps mind  how many eggs yesterday  the stewards eyes glistened with enthusiasm as he said he had got nine the day before and expected fully a dozen today  the poor things said miss westto me  youve no idea how bad weather reduces their laying  she turned back upon the steward  mind now you watch and find out which hens dont lay and kill them first and you ask me each time before you kill one  i found myself neglected out there on top the draughty house while miss west talked chickens with the chinese exsmuggler  but it gave me opportunity to observe her  it is the length of her eyes that accentuates their steadiness of gazehelped of course by the dark brows and lashes  i noted again the warm gray of her eyes  and i began to identify her to locate her  she is a physical type of the best of the womanhood of old new england  nothing spare nor meagre nor bred out but generously strong and yet not quite what one would call robust when i said she was strappingbodied i erred  i must fall back on my other word which will have to be the last miss west is vitalbodied that is the keyword  when we had regained the poop and miss west had gone below i ventured my customary pleasantry with mr mellaire of  and has osullivan bought andy fays seaboots yet  not yet mr pathurst was the reply though he nearly got them early this morning  come on along sir and ill show you  vouchsafing no further information the second mate led the way along the bridge across the midshiphouse and the forardhouse  from the edge of the latter looking down on number one hatch i saw two japanese with sailneedles and twine sewing up a canvasswathed bundle that unmistakably contained a human body  osullivan used a razor said mr mellaire  and that is andy fay i cried  no sir not andy  thats a dutchman  christian jespersen was his name on the articles  he got in osullivans way when osullivan went after the boots  thats what saved andy  andy was more active  jespersen couldnt get out of his own way much less out of osullivans  theres andy sitting over there  i followed mr mellaires gaze and saw the burntout aged little scotchman squatted on a spare spar and sucking a pipe  one arm was in a sling and his head was bandaged  beside him squatted mulligan jacobs they were a pair  both were blueeyed and both were malevolenteyed and they were equally emaciated  it was easy to see that they had discovered early in the voyage their kinship of bitterness  andy fay i knew was sixtythree years old although he looked a hundred and mulligan jacobs who was only about fifty made up for the difference by the furnaceheat of hatred that burned in his face and eyes  i wondered if he sat beside the injured bitter one in some sense of sympathy or if he were there in order to gloat  around the corner of the house strolled shorty flinging up to me his inevitable clowngrin  one hand was swathed in bandages  must have kept mr pike busy was my comment to mr mellaire  he was sewing up cripples about all his watch from four till eight  what i asked  are there any more  one more sir a sheeny  i didnt know his name before but mr pike got itisaac b chantz  i never saw in all my life at sea as many sheenies as are on board the elsinore right now  sheenies dont take to the sea as a rule  weve certainly got more than our share of them chantz isnt badly hurt but you ought to hear him whimper  wheres osullivan i inquired  in the midshiphouse with davis and without a mark  mr pike got into the rumpus and put him to sleep with one on the jaw  and now hes lashed down and talking in a trance  hes thrown the fear of god into davis davis is sitting up in his bunk with a marlinspike threatening to brain osullivan if he starts to break loose and complaining that its no way to run a hospital  hed have padded cells straitjackets night and day nurses and violent wards i supposeand a convalescents home in a queen anne cottage on the poop  oh dear oh dear mr mellaire sighed  this is the funniest voyage and the funniest crew ive ever tackled  its not going to come to a good end  anybody can see that with half an eye  itll be dead of winter off the horn and a focsle full of lunatics and cripples to do the workjust take a look at that one  crazy as a bedbug  hes likely to go overboard any time  i followed his glance and saw tony the greek the one who had sprung overboard the first day  he had just come around the corner of the house and beyond one arm in a sling seemed in good condition  he walked easily and with strength a testimonial to the virtues of mr pikes rough surgery  my eyes kept returning to the canvascovered body of christian jespersen and to the japanese who sewed with sailtwine his sailors shroud  one of them had his right hand in a huge wrapping of cotton and bandage  did he get hurt too i asked  no sir  hes the sailmaker  theyre both sailmakers  hes a good one too  yatsuda is his name  but hes just had bloodpoisoning and lain in hospital in new york for eighteen months  he flatly refused to let them amputate  hes all right now but the hand is dead all except the thumb and forefinger and hes teaching himself to sew with his left hand  hes as clever a sailmaker as youll find at sea  a lunatic and a razor make a cruel combination i remarked  its put five men out of commission mr mellaire sighed  theres osullivan himself and christian jespersen gone and andy fay and shorty and the sheeny  and the voyage not started yet  and theres lars with the broken leg and davis laid off for keepswhy sir well soon be that weak itll take both watches to set a staysail  nevertheless while i talked in a matteroffact way with mr mellaire i was shockedno not because death was aboard with us  i have stood by my philosophic guns too long to be shocked by death or by murder  what affected me was the utter stupid bestiality of the affair  even murdermurder for causei can understand  it is comprehensible that men should kill one another in the passion of love of hatred of patriotism of religion  but this was different  here was killing without cause an orgy of blindbrutishness a thing monstrously irrational  later on strolling with possum on the main deck as i passed the open door of the hospital i heard the muttering chant of osullivan and peeped in  there he lay lashed fast on his back in the lower bunk rolling his eyes and raving  in the top bunk directly above lay charles davis calmly smoking a pipe  i looked for the marlinspike there it was ready to hand on the bedding beside him  its hell aint it sir was his greeting  and how am i goin to get any sleep with that baboon chattering away there  he never lets upkeeps his chinmusic goin right along when hes asleep only worse  the way he grits his teeth is something awful  now i leave it to you sir is it right to put a crazy like that in with a sick man  and i am a sick man  while he talked the massive form of mr pike loomed beside me and halted just out of sight of the man in the bunk  and the man talked on  by rights i oughta have that lower bunk  it hurts me to crawl up here its inhumanity thats what it is and sailors at sea are better protected by the law than they used to be  and ill have you for a witness to this before the court when we get to seattle  mr pike stepped into the doorway  shut up you damned sealawyer you he snarled  havent you played a dirty trick enough comin on board this ship in your condition  and if i have anything more out of you      mr pike was so angry that he could not complete the threat  after spluttering for a moment he made a fresh attempt  you    you    well you annoy me thats what you do  i know the law sir davis answered promptly  i worked full able seaman on this here ship  all hands can testify to that  i was aloft from the start  yes sir and up to my neck in salt water day and night and you had me below trimmin coal  i did full duty and more until this sickness got me  you were petrified and rotten before you ever saw this ship mr pike broke in  the courtll decide that sir replied the imperturbable davis  and if you go to shoutin off your sealawyer mouth mr pike continued ill jerk you out of that and show you what real work is  an lay the owners open for lovely damages when we get in davis sneered  not if i bury you before we get in was the mates quick grim retort and let me tell you davis you aint the first sealawyer ive dropped over the side with a sack of coal to his feet  mr pike turned with a final damned sealawyer and started along the deck  i was walking behind him when he stopped abruptly  mr pathurst  not as an officer to a passenger did he thus address me  his tone was imperative and i gave heed  mr pathurst  from now on the less you see aboard this ship the better that is all  and again he turned on his heel and went his way     chapter xvi   no the sea is not a gentle place  it must be the very hardness of the life that makes all seapeople hard  of course captain west is unaware that his crew exists and mr pike and mr mellaire never address the men save to give commands  but miss west who is more like myself a passenger ignores the men  she does not even say goodmorning to the man at the wheel when she first comes on deck  nevertheless i shall at least to the man at the wheel  am i not a passenger  which reminds me  technically i am not a passenger  the elsinore has no licence to carry passengers and i am down on the articles as third mate and am supposed to receive thirtyfive dollars a month  wada is down as cabin boy although i paid a good price for his passage and he is my servant  not much time is lost at sea in getting rid of the dead  within an hour after i had watched the sailmakers at work christian jespersen was slid overboard feet first a sack of coal to his feet to sink him  it was a mild calm day and the elsinore logging a lazy two knots was not hove to for the occasion  at the last moment captain west came forard prayerbook in hand read the brief service for burial at sea and returned immediately aft  it was the first time i had seen him forard  i shall not bother to describe the burial  all i shall say of it is that it was as sordid as christian jespersens life had been and as his death had been  as for miss west she sat in a deckchair on the poop busily engaged with some sort of fancy work  when christian jespersen and his coal splashed into the sea the crew immediately dispersed the watch below going to its bunks the watch on deck to its work  not a minute elapsed ere mr mellaire was giving orders and the men were pulling and hauling  so i returned to the poop to be unpleasantly impressed by miss wests smiling unconcern  well hes buried i observed  oh she said with all the tonelessness of disinterest and went on with her stitching  she must have sensed my frame of mind for after a moment she paused from her sewing and looked at me  your first sea funeral mr pathurst  death at sea does not seem to affect you i said bluntly  not any more than on the land  she shrugged her shoulders  so many people die you know  and when they are strangers to you    well what do you do on the land when you learn that some workers have been killed in a factory you pass every day coming to town  it is the same on the sea  its too bad we are a hand short i said deliberately  it did not miss her  just as deliberately she replied  yes isnt it  and so early in the voyage too  she looked at me and when i could not forbear a smile of appreciation she smiled back  oh i know very well mr pathurst that you think me a heartless wretch  but it isnt that its    its the sea i suppose  and yet i didnt know this man  i dont remember ever having seen him  at this stage of the voyage i doubt if i could pick out halfadozen of the sailors as men i had ever laid eyes on  so why vex myself with even thinking of this stupid stranger who was killed by another stupid stranger  as well might one die of grief with reading the murder columns of the daily papers  and yet it seems somehow different i contended  oh youll get used to it she assured me cheerfully and returned to her sewing  i asked her if she had read moodys ship of souls but she had not  i searched her out further  she liked browning and was especially fond of the ring and the book  this was the key to her  she cared only for healthful literaturefor the literature that exposits the vital lies of life  for instance the mention of schopenhauer produced smiles and laughter to her all the philosophers of pessimism were laughable  the red blood of her would not permit her to take them seriously  i tried her out with a conversation i had had with de casseres shortly before leaving new york  de casseres after tracing jules de gaultiers philosophic genealogy back to schopenhauer and nietzsche had concluded with the proposition that out of their two formulas de gaultier had constructed an even profounder formula  the willtolive of the one and the willto power of the other were after all only parts of de gaultiers supreme generalization the willtoillusion  i flatter myself that even de casseres would have been pleased with the way i repeated his argument  and when i had concluded it miss west promptly demanded if the realists might not be fooled by their own phrases as often and as completely as were the poor common mortals with the vital lies they never questioned  and there we were  an ordinary young woman who had never vexed her brains with ultimate problems hears such things stated for the first time and immediately and with a laugh sweeps them all away  i doubt not that de casseres would have agreed with her  do you believe in god i asked rather abruptly  she dropped her sewing into her lap looked at me meditatively then gazed on and away across the flashing sea and up into the azure dome of sky  and finally with true feminine evasion she replied  my father does  but you i insisted  i really dont know  i dont bother my head about such things  i used to when i was a little girl  and yet    yes surely i believe in god at times when i am not thinking about it at all i am very sure and my faith that all is well is just as strong as the faith of your jewish friend in the phrases of the philosophers  thats all it comes to i suppose in every casefaith  but as i say why bother  ah i have you now miss west i cried  you are a true daughter of herodias  it doesnt sound nice she said with a moue  and it isnt i exulted  nevertheless it is what you are  it is arthur symons poem the daughters of herodias  some day i shall read it to you and you will answer  i know you will answer that you too have looked often upon the stars  we had just got upon the subject of music of which she possesses a surprisingly solid knowledge and she was telling me that debussy and his school held no particular charm for her when possum set up a wild yelping  the puppy had strayed forard along the bridge to the midshiphouse and had evidently been investigating the chickens when his disaster came upon him  so shrill was his terror that we both stood up  he was dashing along the bridge toward us at full speed yelping at every jump and continually turning his head back in the direction whence he came  i spoke to him and held out my hand and was rewarded with a snap and clash of teeth as he scuttled past  still with head turned back he went on along the poop  before i could apprehend his danger mr pike and miss west were after him  the mate was the nearer and with a magnificent leap gained the rail just in time to intercept possum who was blindly going overboard under the slender railing  with a sort of scooping kick mr pike sent the animal rolling half across the poop howling and snapping more violently possum regained his feet and staggered on toward the opposite railing  dont touch him mr pike cried as miss west showed her intention of catching the crazed little animal with her hands  dont touchm  hes got a fit  but it did not deter her  he was halfway under the railing when she caught him up and held him at arms length while he howled and barked and slavered  its a fit said mr pike as the terrier collapsed and lay on the deck jerking convulsively  perhaps a chicken pecked him said miss west  at any rate get a bucket of water  better let me take him i volunteered helplessly for i was unfamiliar with fits  no its all right she answered  ill take charge of him  the cold water is what he needs  he got too close to the coop and a peck on the nose frightened him into the fit  first time i ever heard of a fit coming that way mr pike remarked as he poured water over the puppy under miss wests direction  its just a plain puppy fit  they all get them at sea  i think it was the sails that caused it i argued  ive noticed that he is very afraid of them  when they flap he crouches down in terror and starts to run  you noticed how he ran with his head turned back  ive seen dogs with fits do that when there was nothing to frighten them mr pike contended  it was a fit no matter what caused it miss west stated conclusively which means that he has not been fed properly  from now on i shall feed him  you tell your boy that mr pathurst  nobody is to feed possum anything without my permission  at this juncture wada arrived with possums little sleeping box and they prepared to take him below  it was splendid of you miss west i said and rash as well and i wont attempt to thank you  but i tell you whatyou take him  hes your dog now  she laughed and shook her head as i opened the charthouse door for her to pass  no but ill take care of him for you  now dont bother to come below this is my affair and you would only be in the way  wada will help me  and i was rather surprised as i returned to my deck chair and sat down to find how affected i was by the little episode  i remembered at the first that my pulse had been distinctly accelerated with the excitement of what had taken place  and somehow as i leaned back in my chair and lighted a cigarette the strangeness of the whole voyage vividly came to me  miss west and i talk philosophy and art on the poop of a stately ship in a circle of flashing sea while captain west dreams of his far home and mr pike and mr mellaire stand watch and watch and snarl orders and the slaves of men pull and haul and possum has fits and andy fay and mulligan jacobs burn with hatred unconsumable and the small handed halfcaste chinese cooks for all and sundry buyers perpetually presses his abdomen and osullivan raves in the steel cell of the midshiphouse and charles davis lies about him nursing a marlinspike and christian jespersen miles astern is deep sunk in the sea with a sack of coal at his feet     chapter xvii   two weeks out today on a balmy sea under a cloudflecked sky and slipping an easy eight knots through the water to a light easterly wind captain west said he was almost convinced that it was the northeast trade  also i have learned that the elsinore in order to avoid being jammed down on cape san roque on the brazil coast must first fight eastward almost to the coast of africa  on occasion on this traverse the cape verde islands are raised  no wonder the voyage from baltimore to seattle is reckoned at eighteen thousand miles  i found tony the suicidal greek steering this morning when i came on deck  he seemed sensible enough and quite rationally took off his hat when i said good morning to him  the sick men are improving nicely with the exceptions of charles davis and osullivan  the latter still is lashed to his bunk and mr pike has compelled davis to attend on him  as a result davis moves about the deck bringing food and water from the galley and grumbling his wrongs to every member of the crew  wada told me a strange thing this morning  it seems that he the steward and the two sailmakers foregather each evening in the cooks roomall being asiaticswhere they talk over ships gossip  they seem to miss little and wada brings it all to me  the thing wada told me was the curious conduct of mr mellaire  they have sat in judgment on him and they do not approve of his intimacy with the three gangsters forard  but wada i said he is not that kind of a man  he is very hard and rough with all the sailors  he treats them like dogs  you know that  sure assented wada  other sailors he do that  but those three very bad men he make good friends  louis say second mate belong aft like first mate and captain  no good for second mate talk like friend with sailors  no good for ship  bime by trouble  you see  louis say mr mellaire crazy do that kind funny business  all of which if it were true and i saw no reason to doubt it led me to inquire  it seems that the gangsters kid twist nosey murphy and bert rhine have made themselves cocks of the forecastle  standing together they have established a reign of terror and are ruling the forecastle all their training in new york in ruling the slum brutes and weaklings in their gangs fits them for the part  as near as i could make out from wadas tale they first began on the two italians in their watch guido bombini and mike cipriani  by means i cannot guess they have reduced these two wretches to trembling slaves  as an instance the other night according to the ships gossip bert rhine made bombini get out of bed and fetch him a drink of water  isaac chantz is likewise under their rule though he is treated more kindly  herman lunkenheimer a goodnatured but simpleminded dolt of a german received a severe beating from the three because he refused to wash some of nosey murphys dirty garments  the two bosuns are in fear of their lives with this clique which is growing for steve roberts the excowboy and the whiteslaver arthur deacon have been admitted to it  i am the only one aft who possesses this information and i confess i dont know what to do with it  i know that mr pike would tell me to mind my own business  mr mellaire is out of the question  and captain west hasnt any crew  and i fear miss west would laugh at me for my pains  besides i understand that every forecastle has its bully or group of bullies so this is merely a forecastle matter and no concern of the afterguard  the ships work goes on  the only effect i can conjecture is an increase in the woes of the unfortunates who must bow to this petty tyranny forard  oh and another thing wada told me  the gangster clique has established its privilege of taking first cut of the saltbeef in the meatkids  after that the rest take the rejected pieces  but i will say contrary to my expectations the elsinores forecastle is well found  the men are not on whack  they have all they want to eat  a barrel of good hardtack stands always open in the forecastle  louis bakes fresh bread for the sailors three times a week  the variety of food is excellent if not the quality  there is no restriction in the amount of water for drinking purposes  and i can only say that in this good weather the mens appearance improves daily  possum is very sick  each day he grows thinner  scarcely can i call him a perambulating skeleton because he is too weak to walk  each day in this delightful weather wada under miss wests instructions brings him up in his box and places him out of the wind on the awninged poop  she has taken full charge of the puppy and has him sleep in her room each night  i found her yesterday in the chartroom reading up the elsinores medical library  later on she overhauled the medicinechest  she is essentially the lifegiving lifeconserving female of the species  all her ways for herself and for others make toward life  and yetand this is so curious it gives me pauseshe shows no interest in the sick and injured forard  they are to her cattle or less than cattle  as the lifegiver and race conserver i should have imagined her a lady bountiful tripping regularly into that ghastly steelwalled hospital room of the midship house and dispensing gruel sunshine and even tracts  on the contrary as with her father these wretched humans do not exist  and still again when the steward jammed a splinter under his nail she was greatly concerned and manipulated the tweezers and pulled it out the elsinore reminds me of a slave plantation before the war and miss west is the lady of the plantation interested only in the houseslaves the field slaves are beyond her ken or consideration and the sailors are the elsinores field slaves  why several days back when wada suffered from a severe headache she was quite perturbed and dosed him with aspirin  well i suppose this is all due to her seatraining  she has been trained hard  we have the phonograph in the second dogwatch every other evening in this fine weather  on the alternate evenings this period is mr pikes watch on deck  but when it is his evening below even at dinner he betrays his anticipation by an eagerness ill suppressed  and yet on each such occasion he punctiliously waits until we ask if we are to be favoured with music  then his hardbitten face lights up although the lines remain hard as ever hiding his ecstasy and he remarks gruffly offhandedly that he guesses he can play over a few records  and so every other evening we watch this killer and driver with lacerated knuckles and gorilla paws brushing and caressing his beloved discs ravished with the music of them and as he told me early in the voyage at such moments believing in god  a strange experience is this life on the elsinore  i confess while it seems that i have been here for long months so familiar am i with every detail of the little round of living that i cannot orient myself  my mind continually strays from things nonunderstandable to things incomprehensiblefrom our samurai captain with the exquisite gabriel voice that is heard only in the tumult and thunder of storm on to the illtreated and feebleminded faun with the bright liquid painfilled eyes to the three gangsters who rule the forecastle and seduce the second mate to the perpetually muttering osullivan in the steelwalled hole and the complaining davis nursing the marlinspike in the upper bunk and to christian jespersen somewhere adrift in this vastitude of ocean with a coalsack at his feet  at such moments all the life on the elsinore becomes as unreal as life to the philosopher is unreal  i am a philosopher  therefore it is unreal to me  but is it unreal to messrs  pike and mellaire to the lunatics and idiots to the rest of the stupid herd forard  i cannot help remembering a remark of de casseres  it was over the wine in mouquins  said he the profoundest instinct in man is to war against the truth that is against the real he shuns facts from his infancy  his life is a perpetual evasion miracle chimera and tomorrow keep him alive  he lives on fiction and myth  it is the lie that makes him free  animals alone are given the privilege of lifting the veil of isis men dare not  the animal awake has no fictional escape from the real because he has no imagination  man awake is compelled to seek a perpetual escape into hope belief fable art god socialism immortality alcohol love  from medusatruth he makes an appeal to mayalie  ben will agree that i have quoted him fairly  and so the thought comes to me that to all these slaves of the elsinore the real is real because they fictionally escape it  one and all they are obsessed with the belief that they are free agents  to me the real is unreal because i have torn aside the veils of fiction and myth  my pristine fictional escape from the real making me a philosopher has bound me absolutely to the wheel of the real  i the superrealist am the only unrealist on board the elsinore  therefore i who penetrate it deepest in the whole phenomena of living on the elsinore see it only as phantasmagoria  paradoxes  i admit it  all deep thinkers are drowned in the sea of contradictions  but all the others on the elsinore sheer surface swimmers keep afloat on this seaforsooth because they have never dreamed its depth  and i can easily imagine what miss wests practical hardheaded judgment would be on these speculations of mine  after all words are traps  i dont know what i know nor what i think i think  this i do know i cannot orient myself  i am the maddest and most sea lost soul on board  take miss west  i am beginning to admire her  why i know not unless it be because she is so abominably healthy  and yet it is this very health of her the absence of any shred of degenerative genius that prevents her from being great    for instance in her music  a number of times now i have come in during the day to listen to her playing  the piano is good and her teaching has evidently been of the best  to my astonishment i learn that she is a graduate of bryn mawr and that her father took a degree from old bowdoin long ago  and yet she lacks in her music  her touch is masterful  she has the firmness and weight without sharpness or pounding of a mans playingthe strength and surety that most women lack and that some women know they lack  when she makes a slip she is ruthless with herself and replays until the difficulty is overcome  and she is quick to overcome it  yes and there is a sort of temperament in her work but there is no sentiment no fire  when she plays chopin she interprets his sureness and neatness  she is the master of chopins technique but she never walks where chopin walks on the heights  somehow she stops short of the fulness of music  i did like her method with brahms and she was not unwilling at my suggestion to go over and over the three rhapsodies  on the third intermezzo she was at her best and a good best it was  you were talking of debussy she remarked  ive got some of his stuff here  but i dont get into it  i dont understand it and there is no use in trying  it doesnt seem altogether like real music to me  it fails to get hold of me just as i fail to get hold of it  yet you like macdowell i challenged  y   es she admitted grudgingly  his new england idylls and fireside tales  and i like that finnish mans stuff sibelius too although it seems to me too soft too richly soft too beautiful if you know what i mean  it seems to cloy  what a pity i thought that with that noble masculine touch of hers she is unaware of the deeps of music  some day i shall try to get from her just what beethoven say and chopin mean to her  she has not read shaws perfect wagnerite nor had she ever heard of nietzsches case of wagner  she likes mozart and old boccherini and leonardo leo likewise she is partial to schumann especially forest scenes  and she played his papillons most brilliantly  when i closed my eyes i could have sworn it was a mans fingers on the keys  and yet i must say it in the long run her playing makes me nervous  i am continually led up to false expectations  always she seems just on the verge of achieving the big thing the superbig thing and always she just misses it by a shade  just as i am prepared for the culminating flash and illumination i receive more perfection of technique  she is cold  she must be cold    or else and the theory is worth considering she is too healthy  i shall certainly read to her the daughters of herodias     chapter xviii   was there ever such a voyage  this morning when i came on deck i found nobody at the wheel  it was a startling sightthe great elsinore by the wind under an alpine range of canvas every sail set from skysails to trysails and spanker slipping across the surface of a mild trade wind sea and no hand at the wheel to guide her  no one was on the poop  it was mr pikes watch and i strolled forard along the bridge to find him  he was on number one hatch giving some instructions to the sailmakers  i awaited my chance until he glanced up and greeted me  good morning i answered  and what man is at the wheel now  that crazy greek tony he replied  a months wages to a pound of tobacco he isnt i offered  mr pike looked at me with quick sharpness  who is at the wheel  nobody i replied  and then he exploded into action  the agelag left his massive frame and he bounded aft along the deck at a speed no man on board could have exceeded and i doubt if very many could have equalled it  he went up the poopladder three steps at a time and disappeared in the direction of the wheel behind the charthouse  next came a promptitude of bellowed orders and all the watch was slacking away after braces to starboard and pulling on after braces to port  i had already learned the manoeuvre  mr pike was wearing ship  as i returned aft along the bridge mr mellaire and the carpenter emerged from the cabin door  they had been interrupted at breakfast for they were wiping their mouths  mr pike came to the break of the poop called down instructions to the second mate who proceeded forard and ordered the carpenter to take the wheel  as the elsinore swung around on her heel mr pike put her on the back track so as to cover the water she had just crossed over  he lowered the glasses through which he was scanning the sea and pointed down the hatchway that opened into the big afterroom beneath  the ladder was gone  must have taken the lazarette ladder with him said mr pike  captain west strolled out of the chartroom  he said good morning in his customary way courteously to me and formally to the mate and strolled on along the poop to the wheel where he paused to glance into the binnacle  turning he went on leisurely to the break of the poop  again he came back to us  fully two minutes must have elapsed ere he spoke  what is the matter mr pike  man overboard  yes sir was the answer  and took the lazarette ladder along with him captain west queried  yes sir  its the greek that jumped over at baltimore  evidently the affair was not serious enough for captain west to be the samurai  he lighted a cigar and resumed his stroll  and yet he had missed nothing not even the absence of the ladder  mr pike sent lookouts aloft to every skysailyard and the elsinore slipped along through the smooth sea  miss west came up and stood beside me searching the ocean with her eyes while i told her the little i knew she evidenced no excitement and reassured me by telling me how difficult it was to lose a man of tonys suicidal type  their madness always seems to come upon them in fine weather or under safe circumstances she smiled when a boat can be lowered or a tug is alongside  and sometimes they take lifepreservers with them as in this case  at the end of an hour mr pike wore the elsinore around and again retraced the course she must have been sailing when the greek went over captain west still strolled and smoked and miss west made a brief trip below to give wada forgotten instructions about possum  andy pay was called to the wheel and the carpenter went below to finish his breakfast  it all seemed rather callous to me  nobody was much concerned for the man who was overboard somewhere on that lonely ocean  and yet i had to admit that everything possible was being done to find him  i talked a little with mr pike and he seemed more vexed than anything else  he disliked to have the ships work interrupted in such fashion  mr mellaires attitude was different  we are shorthanded enough as it is he told me when he joined us on the poop  we cant afford to lose him even if he is crazy  we need him  hes a good sailor most of the time  the hail came from the mizzenskysailyard  the maltese cockney it was who first sighted the man and called down the information  the mate looking to windwards suddenly lowered his glasses rubbed his eyes in a puzzled way and looked again  then miss west using another pair of glasses cried out in surprise and began to laugh  what do you make of it miss west the mate asked  he doesnt seem to be in the water  hes standing up  mr pike nodded  hes on the ladder he said  id forgotten that  it fooled me at first  i couldnt understand it  he turned to the second mate  mr mellaire will you launch the long boat and get some kind of a crew into it while i back the mainyard  ill go in the boat  pick men that can pull an oar  you go too miss west said to me  it will be an opportunity to get outside the elsinore and see her under full sail  mr pike nodded consent so i went along sitting near him in the stern sheets where he steered while half a dozen hands rowed us toward the suicide who stood so weirdly upon the surface of the sea  the maltese cockney pulled the stroke oar and among the other five men was one whose name i had but recently learnedditman olansen a norwegian  a good seaman mr mellaire had told me in whose watch he was a good seaman but crankeyed  when pressed for an explanation mr mellaire had said that he was the sort of man who flew into blind rages and that one never could tell what little thing would produce such a rage  as near as i could grasp it ditman olansen was a berserker type  yet as i watched him pulling in good time at the oar his large paleblue eyes seemed almost bovinethe last man in the world in my judgment to have a berserker fit  as we drew close to the greek he began to scream menacingly at us and to brandish a sheathknife  his weight sank the ladder until the water washed his knees and on this submerged support he balanced himself with wild writhing and outflinging of arms  his face grimacing like a monkeys was not a pretty thing to look upon  and as he continued to threaten us with the knife i wondered how the problem of rescuing him would be solved  but i should have trusted mr pike for that  he removed the boatstretcher from under the maltese cockneys feet and laid it close to hand in the sternsheets  then he had the men reverse the boat and back it upon the greek  dodging a sweep of the knife mr pike awaited his chance until a passing wave lifted the boats stern high while tony was sinking toward the trough  this was the moment  again i was favoured with a sample of the lightning speed with which that aged man of sixty nine could handle his body  timed precisely and delivered in a flash and with weight the boatstretcher came down on the greeks head  the knife fell into the sea and the demented creature collapsed and followed it knocked unconscious  mr pike scooped him out quite effortlessly it seemed to me and flung him into the boats bottom at my feet  the next moment the men were bending to their oars and the mate was steering back to the elsinore  it was a stout rap mr pike had administered with the boatstretcher  thin streaks of blood oozed on the damp plastered hair from the broken scalp  i could but stare at the lump of unconscious flesh that dripped seawater at my feet  a man all life and movement one moment defying the universe reduced the next moment to immobility and the blackness and blankness of death is always a fascinating object for the contemplative eye of the philosopher  and in this case it had been accomplished so simply by means of a stick of wood brought sharply in contact with his skull  if tony the greek be accounted an appearance what was he nowa disappearance  and if so whither had he disappeared  and whence would he journey back to reoccupy that body when what we call consciousness returned to him  the first word much less the last of the phenomena of personality and consciousness yet remains to be uttered by the psychologists  pondering thus i chanced to lift my eyes and the glorious spectacle of the elsinore burst upon me  i had been so long on board and in board of her that i had forgotten she was a whitepainted ship  so low to the water was her hull so delicate and slender that the tall skyreaching spars and masts and the hugeness of the spread of canvas seemed preposterous and impossible an insolent derision of the law of gravitation  it required effort to realize that that slim curve of hull inclosed and bore up from the seas bottom five thousand tons of coal and again it seemed a miracle that the mites of men had conceived and constructed so stately and magnificent an elementdefying fabricmites of men most woefully like the greek at my feet prone to precipitation into the blackness by means of a rap on the head with a piece of wood  tony made a struggling noise in his throat then coughed and groaned from somewhere he was reappearing  i noticed mr pike look at him quickly as if apprehending some recrudescence of frenzy that would require more boatstretcher  but tony merely fluttered his big black eyes open and stared at me for a long minute of incurious amaze ere he closed them again  what are you going to do with him i asked the mate  put m back to work was the reply  its all hes good for and he aint hurt  somebodys got to work this ship around the horn  when we hoisted the boat on board i found miss west had gone below  in the chartroom captain west was winding the chronometers  mr mellaire had turned in to catch an hour or two of sleep ere his watch on deck at noon  mr mellaire by the way as i have forgotten to state does not sleep aft  he shares a room in the midshiphouse with mr pikes nancy  nobody showed sympathy for the unfortunate greek  he was bundled out upon number two hatch like so much carrion and left there unattended to recover consciousness as he might elect  yes and so inured have i become that i make free to admit i felt no sympathy for him myself  my eyes were still filled with the beauty of the elsinore  one does grow hard at sea     chapter xix   one does not mind the trades  we have held the northeast trade for days now and the miles roll off behind us as the patent log whirls and tinkles on the taffrail  yesterday log and observation approximated a run of two hundred and fiftytwo miles the day before we ran two hundred and forty and the day before that two hundred and sixtyone  but one does not appreciate the force of the wind  so balmy and exhilarating is it that it is so much atmospheric wine  i delight to open my lungs and my pores to it  nor does it chill  at any hour of the night while the cabin lies asleep i break off from my reading and go up on the poop in the thinnest of tropical pyjamas  i never knew before what the trade wind was  and now i am infatuated with it  i stroll up and down for an hour at a time with whichever mate has the watch  mr mellaire is always fullgarmented but mr pike on these delicious nights stands his first watch after midnight in his pyjamas  he is a fearfully muscular man  sixtynine years seem impossible when i see his single slimpsy garments pressed like fleshings against his form and bulged by heavy bone and huge muscle  a splendid figure of a man  what he must have been in the heyday of youth two score years and more ago passes comprehension  the days so filled with simple routine pass as in a dream  here where time is rigidly measured and emphasized by the changing of the watches where every hour and halfhour is persistently brought to ones notice by the striking of the ships bells fore and aft time ceases  days merge into days and weeks slip into weeks and i for one can never remember the day of the week or month  the elsinore is never totally asleep  day and night always there are the men on watch the lookout on the forecastle head the man at the wheel and the officer of the deck  i lie reading in my bunk which is on the weather side and continually over my head during the long night hours impact the footsteps of one mate or the other pacing up and down and as i well know the man himself is for ever peering forard from the break of the poop or glancing into the binnacle or feeling and gauging the weight and direction of wind on his cheek or watching the cloudstuff in the sky adrift and ascud across the stars and the moon always always there are wakeful eyes on the elsinore  last night or this morning rather about two oclock as i lay with the printed page swimming drowsily before me i was aroused by an abrupt outbreak of snarl from mr pike  i located him as at the break of the poop and the man at whom he snarled was larry evidently on the main deck beneath him  not until wada brought me breakfast did i learn what had occurred  larry with his funny pug nose his curiously flat and twisted face and his querulous plaintive chimpanzee eyes had been moved by some unlucky whim to venture an insolent remark under the cover of darkness on the main deck  but mr pike from above at the break of the poop had picked the offender unerringly  this was when the explosion occurred then the unfortunate larry truly halfdevil and all child had waxed sullen and retorted still more insolently and the next he knew the mate descending upon him like a hurricane had handcuffed him to the mizzen fiferail  imagine on mr pikes part that this was one for larry and at least ten for kid twist nosey murphy and bert rhine  ill not be so absurd as to say that the mate is afraid of those gangsters  i doubt if he has ever experienced fear  it is not in him  on the other hand i am confident that he apprehends trouble from these men and that it was for their benefit he made this example of larry  larry could stand no more than an hour in irons at which time his stupid brutishness overcame any fear he might have possessed because he bellowed out to the poop to come down and loose him for a fair fight promptly mr pike was there with the key to the handcuffs  as if larry had the shred of a chance against that redoubtable aged man  wada reported that larry amongst other things had lost a couple of front teeth and was laid up in his bunk for the day  when i met mr pike on deck after eight oclock i glanced at his knuckles  they verified wadas tale  i cannot help being amused by the keen interest i take in little events like the foregoing  not only has time ceased but the world has ceased strange it is when i come to think of it in all these weeks i have received no letter no telephone call no telegram no visitor  i have not been to the play  i have not read a newspaper  so far as i am concerned there are no plays nor newspapers  all such things have vanished with the vanished world  all that exists is the elsinore with her queer human freightage and her cargo of coal cleaving a rotund of ocean of which the skyline is a dozen miles away  i am reminded of captain scott frozen on his southpolar venture who for ten months after his death was believed by the world to be alive  not until the world learned of his death was he anything but alive to the world  by the same token was he not alive  and by the same token here on the elsinore has not the landworld ceased  may not the pupil of ones eye be not merely the centre of the world but the world itself truly it is tenable that the world exists only in consciousness  the world is my idea said schopenhauer  said jules de gaultier the world is my invention  his dogma was that imagination created the real  ah me i know that the practical miss west would dub my metaphysics a depressing and unhealthful exercise of my wits  today in our deck chairs on the poop i read the daughters of herodias to miss west  it was superb in its effectjust what i had expected of her  she hemstitched a fine white linen handkerchief for her father while i read  she is never idle being so essentially a nest maker and comfortproducer and raceconserver and she has a whole pile of these handkerchiefs for her father  she smiled how shall i sayoh incredulously triumphantly oh with all the sure wisdom of all the generations of women in her warm long gray eyes when i read     but they smile innocently and dance on    having no thought but this unslumbering thought    am i not beautiful  shall i not be loved    be patient for they will not understand    not till the end of time will they put by    the weaving of slow steps about mens hearts  but it is well for the world that it is so was her comment  ah symons knew women  his perfect knowledge she attested when i read that magnificent passage     they do not understand that in the world    there grows between the sunlight and the grass    anything save themselves desirable    it seems to them that the swift eyes of men    are made but to be mirrors not to see    faroff disastrous unattainable things    for are not we they say the end of all    why should you look beyond us  if you look    into the night you will find nothing there    we also have gazed often at the stars  it is true said miss west in the pause i permitted in order to see how she had received the thought  we also have gazed often at the stars  it was the very thing i had predicted to her face that she would say  but wait i cried  let me read on  and i read     we we alone among all beautiful things    we only are real for the rest are dreams    why will you follow after wandering dreams    when we await you  and you can but dream    of us and in our image fashion them  true most true she murmured while all unconsciously pride and power mounted in her eyes  a wonderful poem she concedednay proclaimedwhen i had done  but do you not see     i began impulsively then abandoned the attempt  for how could she see being woman the faroff disastrous unattainable things when she as she so stoutly averred had gazed often on the stars  she  what could she see save what all women seethat they only are real and that all the rest are dreams  i am proud to be a daughter of herodias said miss west  well i admitted lamely we agree  you remember it is what i told you you were  i am grateful for the compliment she said and in those long gray eyes of hers were limned and coloured all the satisfaction and selfcertitude and answering complacency of power that constitute so large a part of the seductive mystery and mastery that is possessed by woman     chapter xx   heavenshow i read in this fine weather  i take so little exercise that my sleep need is very small and there are so few interruptions such as life teems with on the land that i read myself almost stupid recommend me a seavoyage any time for a man who is behind in his reading  i am making up years of it  it is an orgy a debauch and i am sure the addled sailors adjudge me the queerest creature on board  at times so fuzzy do i get from so much reading that i am glad for any diversion  when we strike the doldrums which lie between the northeast and the southeast trades i shall have wada assemble my little twenty two automatic rifle and try to learn how to shoot  i used to shoot when i was a wee lad  i can remember dragging a shotgun around with me over the hills  also i possessed an airrifle with which on great occasion i was even able to slaughter a robin  while the poop is quite large for promenading the available space for deckchairs is limited to the awnings that stretch across from either side of the charthouse and that are of the width of the charthouse this space again is restricted to one side or the other according to the slant of the morning and afternoon sun and the freshness of the breeze wherefore miss wests chair and mine are most frequently side by side captain west has a chair which he infrequently occupies  he has so little to do in the working of the ship taking his regular observations and working them up with such celerity that he is rarely in the chart room for any length of time  he elects to spend his hours in the main cabin not reading not doing anything save dream with eyes wide open in the draught of wind that pours through the open ports and door from out the huge crojack and the jigger staysails  miss west is never idle  below in the big afterroom she does her own laundering  nor will she let the steward touch her fathers fine linen in the main cabin she has installed a sewingmachine  all handstitching and embroidering and fancy work she does in the deck chair beside me  she avers that she loves the sea and the atmosphere of sealife yet verily she has brought her homethings and landthings along with hereven to her pretty china for afternoon tea  most essentially is she the woman and homemaker  she is a born cook the steward and louis prepare dishes extraordinary and de luxe for the cabin table yet miss west is able at a moments notice to improve on these dishes  she never lets any of their dishes come on the table without first planning them or passing on them  she has quick judgment an unerring taste and is possessed of the needful steel of decision  it seems she has only to look at a dish no matter who has cooked it and immediately divine its lack or its surplusage and prescribe a treatment that transforms it into something indescribably different and deliciousmy how i do eat  i am quite dumbfounded by the unfailing voracity of my appetite  already am i quite convinced that i am glad miss west is making the voyage  she has sailed out east as she quaintly calls it and has an enormous repertoire of tasty spicy eastern dishes  in the cooking of rice louis is a master but in the making of the accompanying curry he fades into a blundering amateur compared with miss west  in the matter of curry she is a sheer genius  how often ones thoughts dwell upon food when at sea  so in this tradewind weather i see a great deal of miss west  i read all the time and quite a good part of the time i read aloud to her passages and even books with which i am interested in trying her out then too such reading gives rise to discussions and she has not yet uttered anything that would lead me to change my first judgment of her she is a genuine daughter of herodias  and yet she is not what one would call a cute girl  she isnt a girl she is a mature woman with all the freshness of a girl  she has the carriage the attitude of mind the aplomb of a woman and yet she cannot be described as being in the slightest degree stately  she is generous dependable sensibleyes and sensitive and her superabundant vitality the vitality that makes her walk so gloriously discounts the maturity of her  sometimes she seems all of thirty to me at other times when her spirits and risibilities are aroused she scarcely seems thirteen  i shall make a point of asking captain west the date of the dixies collision with that river steamer in san francisco bay  in a word she is the most normal the most healthy natural woman i have ever known  yes and she is feminine despite no matter how she does her hair that it is as invariably smooth and wellgroomed as all the rest of her  on the other hand this perpetual wellgroomedness is relieved by the latitude of dress she allows herself  she never fails of being a woman her sex and the lure of it is ever present  possibly she may possess high collars but i have never seen her in one on board  her blouses are always open at the throat disclosing one of her choicest assets the muscular adequate neck with its finetextured garmenture of skin  i embarrass myself by stealing long glances at that bare throat of hers and at the hint of fine firmsurfaced shoulder  visiting the chickens has developed into a regular function  at least once each day we make the journey forard along the bridge to the top of the midshiphouse  possum who is now convalescent accompanies us  the steward makes a point of being there so as to receive instructions and report the eggoutput and laying conduct of the many hens  at the present time our four dozen hens are laying two dozen eggs a day with which record miss west is greatly elated  already she has given names to most of them  the cock is peter of course  a muchspeckled hen is dolly varden  a slim trim thing that dogs peters heels she calls cleopatra  another henthe mellowestvoiced one of allshe addresses as bernhardt  one thing i have noted whenever she and the steward have passed death sentence on a nonlaying hen which occurs regularly once a week she takes no part in the eating of the meat not even when it is metamorphosed into one of her delectable curries  at such times she has a special curry made for herself of tinned lobster or shrimp or tinned chicken  ah i must not forget  i have learned that it was no maninterest in me if you please that brought about her sudden interest to come on the voyage  it was for her father that she came  something is the matter with captain west  at rare moments i have observed her gazing at him with a world of solicitude and anxiety in her eyes  i was telling an amusing story at table yesterday midday when my glance chanced to rest upon miss west  she was not listening  her food on her fork was suspended in the air a sheer instant as she looked at her father with all her eyes  it was a stare of fear  she realized that i was observing and with superb control slowly quite naturally she lowered the fork and rested it on her plate retaining her hold on it and retaining her fathers face in her look  but i had seen  yes i had seen more than that  i had seen captain wests face a transparent white while his eyelids fluttered down and his lips moved noiselessly  then the eyelids raised the lips set again with their habitual discipline and the colour slowly returned to his face  it was as if he had been away for a time and just returned  but i had seen and guessed her secret  and yet it was this same captain west seven hours later who chastened the proud sailor spirit of mr pike  it was in the second dogwatch that evening a dark night and the watch was pulling away on the main deck  i had just come out of the charthouse door and seen captain west pace by me hands in pockets toward the break of the poop  abruptly from the mizzenmast came a snap of breakage and crash of fabric  at the same instant the men fell backward and sprawled over the deck  a moment of silence followed and then captain wests voice went out  what carried away mr pike  the halyards sir came the reply out of the darkness  there was a pause  again captain wests voice went out  next time slack away on your sheet first  now mr pike is incontestably a splendid seaman  yet in this instance he had been wrong  i have come to know him and i can well imagine the hurt to his pride  and morehe has a wicked resentful primitive nature and though he answered respectfully enough yes sir i felt safe in predicting to myself that the poor devils under him would receive the weight of his resentment in the later watches of the night  they evidently did for this morning i noted a black eye on john hackey a san francisco hoodlum and guido bombini was carrying a freshly and outrageously swollen jaw  i asked wada about the matter and he soon brought me the news  quite a bit of beating up takes place forard of the deckhouses in the night watches while we of the afterguard peacefully slumber  even today mr pike is going around sullen and morose snarling at the men more than usual and barely polite to miss west and me when we chance to address him  his replies are grunted in monosyllables and his face is set in superlative sourness  miss west who is unaware of the occurrence laughs and calls it a sea groucha phenomenon with which she claims large experience  but i know mr pike nowthe stubborn wonderful old seadog  it will be three days before he is himself again  he takes a terrible pride in his seamanship and what hurts him most is the knowledge that he was guilty of the blunder     chapter xxi   today twentyeight days out in the early morning while i was drinking my coffee still carrying the northeast trade we crossed the line  and charles davis signalized the event by murdering osullivan  it was boney the lanky splinter of a youth in mr mellaires watch who brought the news  the second mate and i had just arrived in the hospital room when mr pike entered  osullivans troubles were over  the man in the upper bunk had completed the mad sad span of his life with the marlinspike  i cannot understand this charles davis  he sat up calmly in his bunk and calmly lighted his pipe ere he replied to mr mellaire  he certainly is not insane  yet deliberately in cold blood he has murdered a helpless man  whatd you do it for mr mellaire demanded  because sir said charles davis applying a second match to his pipe becausepuff puffhe bothered my sleep  here he caught mr pikes glowering eye  becausepuff puffhe annoyed me  the next timepuff puffi hope better judgment will be shown in what kind of a man is put in with me  besidespuff puffthis top bunk aint no place for me  it hurts me to get into itpuff puffan im gem back to that lower bunk as soon as you get osullivan out of it  but whatd you do it for mr pike snarled  i told you sir because he annoyed me  i got tired of it an so this morning i just put him out of his misery  an what are you goin to do about it  the mans dead aint he  an i killed m in selfdefence  i know the law  what rightd you to put a ravin lunatic in with me an me sick an helpless  by god davis the mate burst forth  youll never draw your payday in seattle  ill fix you out for this killing a crazy lashed down in his bunk an harmless  youll follow m overside my hearty  if i do youll hang for it sir davis retorted  he turned his cool eyes on me  an i call on you sir to witness the threats hes made an youll testify to them too in court  an hell hang as sure as i go over the side  oh i know his record  hes afraid to face a court with it  hes been up too many a time with charges of mankillin an brutality on the high seas  an a man could retire for life an live off the interest of the fines hes paid or his owners paid for him  shut your mouth or ill knock it out of your face mr pike roared springing toward him with clenched upraised fist  davis involuntarily shrank away  his flesh was weak but not so his spirit  he got himself promptly in hand and struck another match  you cant get my goat sir he sneered under the shadow of the impending blow  i aint scared to die  a mans got to die once anyway an its none so hard a trick to do when you cant help it  osullivan died so easy it was amazin  besides i aint goin to die  im goin to finish this voyage an sue the owners when i get to seattle  i know my rights an the law  an i got witnesses  truly i was divided between admiration for the courage of this wretched sailor and sympathy for mr pike thus bearded by a sick man he could not bring himself to strike  nevertheless he sprang upon the man with calculated fury gripped him between the base of the neck and the shoulders with both gnarled paws and shook him back and forth violently and frightfully for a full minute  it was a wonder the mans neck was not dislocated  i call on you to witness sir davis gasped at me the instant he was free  he coughed and strangled felt his throat and made wry neckmovements indicative of injury  the marksll begin to show in a few minutes he murmured complacently as his dizziness left him and his breath came back  this was too much for mr pike who turned and left the room growling and cursing incoherently deep in his throat  when i made my departure a moment later davis was refilling his pipe and telling mr mellaire that hed have him up for a witness in seattle        so we have had another burial at sea  mr pike was vexed by it because the elsinore according to sea tradition was going too fast through the water for a proper ceremony  thus a few minutes of the voyage were lost by backing the elsinores maintopsail and deadening her way while the service was read and osullivan was slid overboard with the inevitable sack of coal at his feet  hope the coal holds out mr pike grumbled morosely at me five minutes later        and we sit on the poop miss west and i tended on by servants sipping afternoon tea sewing fancy work discussing philosophy and art while a few feet away from us on this tiny floating world all the grimy sordid tragedy of sordid malformed brutish life plays itself out  and captain west remote untroubled sits dreaming in the twilight cabin while the draught of wind from the crojack blows upon him through the open ports he has no doubts no worries  he believes in god  all is settled and clear and well as he nears his far home  his serenity is vast and enviable  but i cannot shake from my eyes that vision of him when life forsook his veins and his mouth slacked and his eyelids closed while his face took on the white transparency of death  i wonder who will be the next to finish the game and depart with a sack of coal  oh this is nothing sir mr mellaire remarked to me cheerfully as we strolled the poop during the first watch  i was once on a voyage on a tramp steamer loaded with four hundred chinksi beg your pardon sirchinese  they were coolies contract labourers coming back from serving their time  and the cholera broke out  we hove over three hundred of them overboard sir along with both bosuns most of the lascar crew and the captain the mate the third mate and the first and third engineers  the second and one white oiler was all that was left below and i was in command on deck when we made port  the doctors wouldnt come aboard they made me anchor in the outer roads and told me to heave out my dead there was some tall buryin about that time mr pathurst and they went overboard without canvas coal or iron  they had to  i had nobody to help me and the chinks below wouldnt lift a hand  i had to go down myself drag the bodies on to the slings then climb on deck and heave them up with the donkey  and each trip i took a drink  i was pretty drunk when the job was done  and you never caught it yourself i queried  mr mellaire held up his left hand  i had often noted that the index finger was missing  thats all that happened to me sir  the old mand had a foxterrier like yours  and after the old man passed out the puppy got real chummy with me  just as i was making the hoist of the last slingload what does the puppy do but jump on my leg and sniff my hand  i turned to pat him and the next i knew my other hand had slipped into the gears and that finger wasnt there any more  heavens i cried  what abominable luck to come through such a terrible experience like that and then lose your finger  thats what i thought sir mr mellaire agreed  what did you do i asked  oh just held it up and looked at it and said my goodness gracious and took another drink  and you didnt get the cholera afterwards  no sir  i reckon i was so full of alcohol the germs dropped dead before they could get to me  he considered a moment  candidly mr pathurst i dont know about that alcohol theory  the old man and the mates died drunk and so did the third engineer  but the chief was a teetotaller and he died too        never again shall i wonder that the sea is hard  i walked apart from the second mate and stared up at the magnificent fabric of the elsinore sweeping and swaying great blotting curves of darkness across the face of the starry sky     chapter xxii   something has happened  but nobody knows either fore or aft except the interested persons and they will not say anything  yet the ship is abuzz with rumours and guesses  this i do know mr pike has received a fearful blow on the head  at table yesterday at midday i arrived late and passing behind his chair i saw a prodigious lump on top of his head  when i was seated facing him i noted that his eyes seemed dazed yes and i could see pain in them  he took no part in the conversation ate perfunctorily behaved stupidly at times and it was patent that he was controlling himself with an iron hand  and nobody dares ask him what has happened  i know i dont dare ask him and i am a passenger a privileged person  this redoubtable old searelic has inspired me with a respect for him that partakes half of timidity and half of awe  he acts as if he were suffering from concussion of the brain  his pain is evident not alone in his eyes and the strained expression of his face but by his conduct when he thinks he is unobserved  last night just for a breath of air and a moments gaze at the stars i came out of the cabin door and stood on the main deck under the break of the poop from directly over my head came a low and persistent groaning  my curiosity was aroused and i retreated into the cabin came out softly on to the poop by way of the charthouse and strolled noiselessly forard in my slippers  it was mr pike  he was leaning collapsed on the rail his head resting on his arms  he was giving voice in secret to the pain that racked him  a dozen feet away he could not be heard  but close to his shoulder i could hear his steady smothered groaning that seemed to take the form of a chant  also at regular intervals he would mutter  oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear  always he repeated the phrase five times then returned to his groaning  i stole away as silently as i had come  yet he resolutely stands his watches and performs all his duties of chief officer  oh i forgot  miss west dared to quiz him and he replied that he had a toothache and that if it didnt get better hed pull it out  wada cannot learn what has happened  there were no eyewitnesses  he says that the asiatic clique discussing the affair in the cooks room thinks the three gangsters are responsible  bert rhine is carrying a lame shoulder  nosey murphy is limping as from some injury in the hips and kid twist has been so badly beaten that he has not left his bunk for two days  and that is all the data to build on  the gangsters are as closemouthed as mr pike  the asiatic clique has decided that murder was attempted and that all that saved the mate was his hard skull  last evening in the second dogwatch i got another proof that captain west is not so oblivious of what goes on aboard the elsinore as he seems  i had gone forard along the bridge to the mizzenmast in the shadow of which i was leaning  from the main deck in the alleyway between the midshiphouse and the rail came the voices of bert rhine nosey murphy and mr mellaire  it was not ships work  they were having a friendly even sociable chat for their voices hummed genially and now and again one or another laughed and sometimes all laughed  i remembered wadas reports on this unseamanlike intimacy of the second mate with the gangsters and tried to make out the nature of the conversation  but the gangsters were lowvoiced and all i could catch was the tone of friendliness and goodnature  suddenly from the poop came captain wests voice  it was the voice not of the samurai riding the storm but of the samurai calm and cold  it was clear soft and mellow as the mellowest bell ever cast by eastern artificers of old time to call worshippers to prayer  i know i slightly chilled to itit was so exquisitely sweet and yet as passionless as the ring of steel on a frosty night  and i knew the effect on the men beneath me was electrical  i could feel them stiffen and chill to it as i had stiffened and chilled  and yet all he said was  mr mellaire  yes sir answered mr mellaire after a moment of tense silence  come aft here came captain wests voice  i heard the second mate move along the deck beneath me and stop at the foot of the poopladder  your place is aft on the poop mr mellaire said the cold passionless voice  yes sir answered the second mate  that was all  not another word was spoken  captain west resumed his stroll on the weather side of the poop and mr mellaire ascending the ladder went to pacing up and down the lee side  i continued along the bridge to the forecastle head and purposely remained there half an hour ere i returned to the cabin by way of the main deck  although i did not analyze my motive i knew i did not desire any one to know that i had overheard the occurrence        i have made a discovery  ninety per cent of our crew is brunette  aft with the exception of wada and the steward who are our servants we are all blonds  what led me to this discovery was woodruffs effects of tropical light on white men which i am just reading  major woodruffs thesis is that the whiteskinned blueeyed aryan born to government and command ever leaving his primeval overcast and foggy home ever commands and governs the rest of the world and ever perishes because of the toowhite light he encounters  it is a very tenable hypothesis and will bear looking into  but to return  every one of us who sits aft in the high place is a blond aryan  forard leavened with a ten per cent of degenerate blonds the remaining ninety per cent of the slaves that toil for us are brunettes they will not perish  according to woodruff they will inherit the earth not because of their capacity for mastery and government but because of their skinpigmentation which enables their tissues to resist the ravages of the sun  and i look at the four of us at tablecaptain west his daughter mr pike and myselfall fairskinned blueeyed and perishing yet mastering and commanding like our fathers before us to the end of our type on the earth  ah well ours is a lordly history and though we may be doomed to pass in our time we shall have trod on the faces of all peoples disciplined them to obedience taught them government and dwelt in the palaces we have compelled them by the weight of our own right arms to build for us  the elsinore depicts this in miniature  the best of the food and all spacious and beautiful accommodation is ours  forard is a pigsty and a slavepen  as a king captain west sits above all  as a captain of soldiers mr pike enforces his kings will  miss west is a princess of the royal house  and i  am i not an honourable noblelineaged pensioner on the deeds and achievements of my father who in his day compelled thousands of the lesser types to the building of the fortune i enjoy     chapter xxiii   the northwest trade carried us almost into the southeast trade and then left us for several days to roll and swelter in the doldrums  during this time i have discovered that i have a genius for rifleshooting  mr pike swore i must have had long practice and i confess i was myself startled by the ease of the thing  of course its the knack but one must be so made i suppose in order to be able to acquire the knack  by the end of half an hour standing on the heaving deck and shooting at bottles floating on the rolling swell i found that i broke each bottle at the first shot  the supply of empty bottles giving out mr pike was so interested that he had the carpenter saw me a lot of small square blocks of hard wood  these were more satisfactory  a wellaimed shot threw them out of the water and spinning into the air and i could use a single block until it had drifted out of range  in an hours time i could shooting quickly and at short range empty my magazine at a block and hit it nine times and on occasion ten times out of eleven  i might not have judged my aptitude as unusual had i not induced miss west and wada to try their hands  neither had luck like mine  i finally persuaded mr pike and he went behind the wheelhouse so that none of the crew might see how poor a shot he was  he was never able to hit the mark and was guilty of the most ludicrous misses  i never could get the hang of rifleshooting he announced disgustedly but when it comes to close range with a gat im right there  i guess i might as well overhaul mine and limber it up  he went below and came back with a huge 44 automatic pistol and a handful of loaded clips  anywhere from right against the body up to ten or twelve feet away holding for the stomach its astonishing mr pathurst what you can do with a weapon like this  now you cant use a rifle in a mixup  ive been down and under with a bunch giving me the boot when i turned loose with this  talk about damage  it ranged them the full length of their bodies  one of themd just landed his brogans on my face when i letm have it  the bullet entered just above his knee smashed the collarbone where it came out and then clipped off an ear  i guess that bullets still going  it took more than a fullsized man to stop it  so i say give me a good handy gat when somethings doing  aint you afraid youll use all your ammunition up he asked anxiously half an hour later as i continued to crack away with my new toy  he was quite reassured when i told him wada had brought along fifty thousand rounds for me  in the midst of the shooting two sharks came swimming around  they were quite large mr pike said and he estimated their length at fifteen feet  it was sunday morning so that the crew except for working the ship had its time to itself and soon the carpenter with a rope for a fishline and a great iron hook baited with a chunk of salt pork the size of my head captured first one and then the other of the monsters  they were hoisted in on the main deck  and then i saw a spectacle of the cruelty of the sea  the full crew gathered about with sheath knives hatchets clubs and big butcher knives borrowed from the galley  i shall not give the details save that they gloated and lusted and roared and bellowed their delight in the atrocities they committed  finally the first of the two fish was thrown back into the ocean with a pointed stake thrust into its upper and lower jaws so that it could not close its mouth  inevitable and prolonged starvation was the fate thus meted out to it  ill show you something boys andy fay cried as they prepared to handle the second shark  the maltese cockney had been a most capable master of ceremonies with the first one  more than anything else i think was i hardened against these brutes by what i saw them do  in the end the maltreated fish thrashed about the deck entirely eviscerated  nothing remained but the mere fleshshell of the creature yet it would not die  it was amazing the life that lingered when all the vital organs were gone  but more amazing things were to follow  mulligan jacobs his arms a butchers to the elbows without as much as by your leave suddenly thrust a hunk of meat into my hand  i sprang back startled and dropped it to the deck while a gleeful howl went up from the twoscore men  i was shamed despite myself  these brutes held me in little respect and after all human nature is so strange a compound that even a philosopher dislikes being held in disesteem by the brutes of his own species  i looked at what i had dropped  it was the heart of the shark and as i looked there under my eyes on the scorching deck where the pitch oozed from the seams the heart pulsed with life  and i dared  i would not permit these animals to laugh at any fastidiousness of mine  i stooped and picked up the heart and while i concealed and conquered my qualms i held it in my hand and felt it beat in my hand  at any rate i had won a mild victory over mulligan jacobs for he abandoned me for the more delectable diversion of torturing the shark that would not die  for several minutes it had been lying quite motionless  mulligan jacobs smote it a heavy blow on the nose with the flat of a hatchet and as the thing galvanized into life and flung its body about the deck the little venomous man screamed in ecstasy  the hooks are in itthe hooks are in itand burnin hot  he squirmed and writhed with fiendish delight and again he struck it on the nose and made it leap  this was too much and i beat a retreatfeigning boredom or cessation of interest of course and absently carrying the still throbbing heart in my hand  as i came upon the poop i saw miss west with her sewing basket emerging from the port door of the charthouse  the deckchairs were on that side so i stole around on the starboard side of the charthouse in order to fling overboard unobserved the dreadful thing i carried  but drying on the surface in the tropic heat and still pulsing inside it stuck to my hand so that it was a bad cast  instead of clearing the railing it struck on the pinrail and stuck there in the shade and as i opened the door to go below and wash my hands with a last glance i saw it pulse where it had fallen  when i came back it was still pulsing  i heard a splash overside from the waist of the ship and knew the carcass had been flung overboard  i did not go around the charthouse and join miss west but stood enthralled by the spectacle of that heart that beat in the tropic heat  boisterous shouts from the sailors attracted my attention  they had all climbed to the top of the tall rail and were watching something outboard i followed their gaze and saw the amazing thing  that longeviscerated shark was not dead  it moved it swam it thrashed about and ever it strove to escape from the surface of the ocean  sometimes it swam down as deep as fifty or a hundred feet and then still struggling to escape the surface struggled involuntarily to the surface  each failure thus to escape fetched wild laughter from the men  but why did they laugh the thing was sublime horrible but it was not humorous  i leave it to you  what is there laughable in the sight of a paindistraught fish rolling helplessly on the surface of the sea and exposing to the sun all its essential emptiness  i was turning away when renewed shouting drew my gaze  half a dozen other sharks had appeared smaller ones nine or ten feet long  they attacked their helpless comrade  they tore him to pieces they destroyed him devoured him  i saw the last shred of him disappear down their maws  he was gone disintegrated entombed in the living bodies of his kind and already entering into the processes of digestion  and yet there in the shade on the pinrail that unbelievable and monstrous heart beat on     chapter xxiv   the voyage is doomed to disaster and death  i know mr pike now and if ever he discovers the identity of mr mellaire murder will be done  mr mellaire is not mr mellaire  he is not from georgia  he is from virginia  his name is walthamsidney waltham  he is one of the walthams of virginia a black sheep true but a waltham  of this i am convinced just as utterly as i am convinced that mr pike will kill him if he learns who he is  let me tell how i have discovered all this  it was last night shortly before midnight when i came up on the poop to enjoy a whiff of the south east trades in which we are now bowling along closehauled in order to weather cape san roque  mr pike had the watch and i paced up and down with him while he told me old pages of his life  he has often done this when not seagrouched and often he has mentioned with prideyes with reverencea master with whom he sailed five years  old captain somers he called himthe finest squarest noblest man i ever sailed under sir  well last night our talk turned on lugubrious subjects and mr pike wicked old man that he is descanted on the wickedness of the world and on the wickedness of the man who had murdered captain somers  he was an old man over seventy years old mr pike went on  and they say hed got a touch of palsyi hadnt seen him for years  you see id had to clear out from the coast because of trouble  and that devil of a second mate caught him in bed late at night and beat him to death  it was terrible  they told me about it  right in san francisco on board the jason harrison it happened eleven years ago  and do you know what they did  first they gave the murderer life when he should have been hanged  his plea was insanity from having had his head chopped open a long time before by a crazy seacook  and when hed served seven years the governor pardoned him  he wasnt any good but his people were a powerful old virginian family the walthamsi guess youve heard of themand they brought all kinds of pressure to bear  his name was sidney waltham  at this moment the warning bell a single stroke fifteen minutes before the change of watch rang out from the wheel and was repeated by the look out on the forecastle head  mr pike under his stress of feeling had stopped walking and we stood at the break of the poop  as chance would have it mr mellaire was a quarter of an hour ahead of time and he climbed the poopladder and stood beside us while the mate concluded his tale  i didnt mind it mr pike continued as long as hed got life and was serving his time  but when they pardoned him out after only seven years i swore id get him  and i will  i dont believe in god or devil and its a rotten crazy world anyway but i do believe in hunches  and i know im going to get him  what will you do i queried  do mr pikes voice was fraught with surprise that i should not know do  well what did he do to old captain somers  yet hes disappeared these last three years now  ive heard neither hide nor hair of him  but hes a sailor and hell drift back to the sea and some day      in the illumination of a match with which the second mate was lighting his pipe i saw mr pikes gorilla arms and huge clenched paws raised to heaven and his face convulsed and working  also in that brief moment of light i saw that the second mates hand which held the match was shaking  and i aint never seen even a photo of him mr pike added  but ive got a general idea of his looks and hes got a mark unmistakable  i could know him by it in the dark  all id have to do is feel it  some day ill stick my fingers into that mark  what did you say sir was the captains name mr mellaire asked casually  somersold captain somers mr pike answered  mr mellaire repeated the name aloud several times and then hazarded  didnt he command the lammermoor thirty years ago  thats the man  i thought i recognized him  i lay at anchor in a ship next to his in table bay that time ago  oh the wickedness of the world the wickedness of the world mr pike muttered as he turned and strode away  i said goodnight to the second mate and had started to go below when he called to me in a low voice mr pathurst  i stopped and then he said hurriedly and confusedly  never mind sir    i beg your pardon    ii changed my mind  below lying in my bunk i found myself unable to read  my mind was bent on returning to what had just occurred on deck and against my will the most gruesome speculations kept suggesting themselves  and then came mr mellaire  he had slipped down the booby hatch into the big afterroom and thence through the hallway to my room  he entered noiselessly on clumsy tiptoes and pressed his finger warningly to his lips  not until he was beside my bunk did he speak and then it was in a whisper  i beg your pardon sir mr pathurst    ii beg your pardon but you see sir i was just passing and seeing you awake i    i thought it would not inconvenience you to    you see i thought i might just as well prefer a small favour    seeing that i would not inconvenience you sir    i    i      i waited for him to proceed and in the pause that ensued while he licked his dry lips with his tongue the thing ambushed in his skull peered at me through his eyes and seemed almost on the verge of leaping out and pouncing upon me  well sir he began again this time more coherently its just a little thingfoolish on my part of coursea whim so to saybut you will remember near the beginning of the voyage i showed you a scar on my head    a really small affair sir which i contracted in a misadventure  it amounts to a deformity which it is my fancy to conceal  not for worlds sir would i care to have miss west for instance know that i carried such a deformity  a man is a man siryou understandand you have not spoken of it to her  no i replied  it just happens that i have not  nor to anybody elseto say captain westor say mr pike  no i havent mentioned it to anybody i averred  he could not conceal the relief he experienced  the perturbation went out of his face and manner and the ambushed thing drew back deeper into the recess of his skull  the favour sir mr pathurst that i would prefer is that you will not mention that little matter to anybody  i suppose he smiled and his voice was superlatively suave it is vanity on my partyou understand i am sure  i nodded and made a restless movement with my book as evidence that i desired to resume my reading  i can depend upon you for that mr pathurst  his whole voice and manner had changed  it was practically a command and i could almost see fangs bared and menacing sprouting in the jaws of that thing i fancied dwelt behind his eyes  certainly i answered coldly  thank you siri thank you he said and without more ado tiptoed from the room  of course i did not read  how could i  nor did i sleep  my mind ran on and on and not until the steward brought my coffee shortly before five did i sink into my first doze  one thing is very evident  mr pike does not dream that the murderer of captain somers is on board the elsinore  he has never glimpsed that prodigious fissure that clefts mr mellaires or rather sidney walthams skull  and i for one shall never tell mr pike  and i know now why from the very first i disliked the second mate  and i understand that live thing that other thing that lurks within and peers out through the eyes  i have recognized the same thing in the three gangsters forard  like the second mate they are prison birds  the restraint the secrecy and iron control of prison life has developed in all of them terrible other selves  yes and another thing is very evident  on board this ship driving now through the south atlantic for the winter passage of cape horn are all the elements of sea tragedy and horror  we are freighted with human dynamite that is liable at any moment to blow our tiny floating world to fragments     chapter xxv   the days slip by  the southeast trade is brisk and small splashes of sea occasionally invade my open ports  mr pikes room was soaked yesterday  this is the most exciting thing that has happened for some time  the gangsters rule in the forecastle  larry and shorty have had a harmless fight  the hooks continue to burn in mulligan jacobss brain charles davis resides alone in his little steel room coming out only to get his food from the galley  miss west plays and sings doctors possum launders and is for ever otherwise busy with her fancy work  mr pike runs the phonograph every other evening in the second dogwatch  mr mellaire hides the cleft in his head  i keep his secret  and captain west more remote than ever sits in the draught of wind in the twilight cabin  we are now thirtyseven days at sea in which time until today we have not sighted a vessel  and today at one time no less than six vessels were visible from the deck  not until i saw these ships was i able thoroughly to realize how lonely this ocean is  mr pike tells me we are several hundred miles off the south american coast  and yet only the other day it seems we were scarcely more distant from africa  a big velvety moth fluttered aboard this morning and we are filled with conjecture  how possibly could it have come from the south american coast these hundreds of miles in the teeth of the trades  the southern cross has been visible of course for weeks the north star has disappeared behind the bulge of the earth and the great bear at its highest is very low  soon it too will be gone and we shall be raising the magellan clouds  i remember the fight between larry and shorty  wada reports that mr pike watched it for some time until becoming incensed at their awkwardness he clouted both of them with his open hands and made them stop announcing that until they could make a better showing he intended doing all the fighting on the elsinore himself  it is a feat beyond me to realize that he is sixtynine years old  and when i look at the tremendous build of him and at his fearful manhandling hands i conjure up a vision of him avenging captain somerss murder  life is cruel  amongst the elsinores five thousand tons of coal are thousands of rats  there is no way for them to get out of their steel walled prison for all the ventilators are guarded with stout wiremesh on her previous voyage loaded with barley they increased and multiplied  now they are imprisoned in the coal and cannibalism is what must occur among them  mr pike says that when we reach seattle there will be a dozen or a score of survivors huge fellows the strongest and fiercest  sometimes passing the mouth of one ventilator that is in the after wall of the charthouse i can hear their plaintive squealing and crying from far beneath in the coal  other and luckier rats are in the tween decks forard where all the spare suits of sails are stored  they come out and run about the deck at night steal food from the galley and lap up the dew  which reminds me that mr pike will no longer look at possum  it seems under his suggestion that wada trapped a rat in the donkeyengine room  wada swears that it was the father of all rats and that by actual measurement it scaled eighteen inches from nose to the tip of tail also it seems that mr pike and wada with the door shut in the formers room pitted the rat against possum and that possum was licked  they were compelled to kill the rat themselves while possum when all was over lay down and had a fit  now mr pike abhors a coward and his disgust with possum is profound  he no longer plays with the puppy nor even speaks to him and whenever he passes him on the deck glowers sourly at him  i have been reading up the south atlantic sailing directions and i find that we are now entering the most beautiful sunset region in the world and this evening we were favoured with a sample  i was in my quarters overhauling my books when miss west called to me from the foot of the charthouse stairs  mr pathurstcome quick  oh do come quick  you cant afford to miss it  half the sky from the zenith to the western sealine was an astonishing sheet of pure pale even gold  and through this sheen on the horizon burned the sun a disc of richer gold  the gold of the sky grew more golden then tarnished before our eyes and began to glow faintly with red  as the red deepened a mist spread over the whole sheet of gold and the burning yellow sun  turner was never guilty of so audacious an orgy in goldmist  presently along the horizon entirely completing the circle of sea and sky the tightpacked shapes of the trade wind clouds began to show through the mist and as they took form they spilled with rosecolour at their upper edges while their bases were a pulsing bluishwhite  i say it advisedly  all the colours of this display pulsed  as the goldmist continued to clear away the colours became garish bold the turquoises went into greens and the roses turned to the red of blood  and the purple and indigo of the long swells of sea were bronzed with the colourriot in the sky while across the water like gigantic serpents crawled red and green skyreflections  and then all the gorgeousness quickly dulled and the warm tropic darkness drew about us     chapter xxvi   the elsinore is truly the ship of souls the world in miniature and because she is such a small world cleaving this vastitude of ocean as our larger world cleaves space the strange juxtapositions that continually occur are startling  for instance this afternoon on the poop  let me describe it  here was miss west in a crisp duck sailor suit immaculately white open at the throat where under the broad collar was knotted a manofwar black silk neckerchief  her smoothgroomed hair a trifle rebellious in the breeze was glorious  and here was i in white ducks white shoes and white silk shirt as immaculate and welltended as she  the steward was just bringing the pretty teaservice for miss west and in the background wada hovered  we had been discussing philosophyor rather i had been feeling her out and from a sketch of spinozas anticipations of the modern mind through the speculative interpretations of the latest achievements in physics of sir oliver lodge and sir william ramsay i had come as usual to de casseres whom i was quoting when mr pike snarled orders to the watch  in this rise into the azure of pure perception attainable only by a very few human beings the spectacular sense is born  i was quoting life is no longer good or evil  it is a perpetual play of forces without beginning or end  the freed intellect merges itself with the worldwill and partakes of its essence which is not a moral essence but an aesthetic essence      and at this moment the watch swarmed on to the poop to haul on the port braces of the mizzenskysail royal and topgallantsail  the sailors passed us or toiled close to us with lowered eyes  they did not look at us so far removed from them were we  it was this contrast that caught my fancy  here were the high and low slaves and masters beauty and ugliness cleanness and filth  their feet were bare and scaled with patches of tar and pitch  their unbathed bodies were garmented in the meanest of clothes dingy dirty ragged and sparse  each one had on but two garmentsdungaree trousers and a shoddy cotton shirt  and we in our comfortable deckchairs our two servants at our backs the quintessence of elegant leisure sipped delicate tea from beautiful fragile cups and looked on at these wretched ones whose labour made possible the journey of our little world  we did not speak to them nor recognize their existence any more than would they have dared speak to us  and miss west with the appraising eye of a plantation mistress for the condition of her field slaves looked them over  you see how they have fleshed up she said as they coiled the last turns of the ropes over the pins and faded away forard off the poop  it is the regular hours the good weather the hard work the open air the sufficient food and the absence of whisky  and they will keep in this fettle until they get off the horn  and then you will see them go down from day to day  a winter passage of the horn is always a severe strain on the men  but then once we are around and in the good weather of the pacific you will see them gain again from day to day  and when we reach seattle they will be in splendid shape  only they will go ashore drink up their wages in several days and ship away on other vessels in precisely the same sodden miserable condition that they were in when they sailed with us from baltimore  and just then captain west came out the charthouse door strolled by for a single turn up and down and with a smile and a word for us and an all observant eye for the ship the trim of her sails the wind and the sky and the weather promise went back through the charthouse doorthe blond aryan master the king the samurai  and i finished sipping my tea of delicious and most expensive aroma and our slanteyed darkskinned servitors carried the pretty gear away and i read continuing de casseres  instinct wills creates carries on the work of the species  the intellect destroys negatives satirizes and ends in pure nihilism instinct creates life endlessly hurling forth profusely and blindly its clowns tragedians and comedians  intellect remains the eternal spectator of the play  it participates at will but never gives itself wholly to the fine sport  the intellect freed from the trammels of the personal will soars into the ether of perception where instinct follows it in a thousand disguises seeking to draw it down to earth     chapter xxvii   we are now south of rio and working south  we are out of the latitude of the trades and the wind is capricious  rain squalls and wind squalls vex the elsinore  one hour we may be rolling sickeningly in a dead calm and the next hour we may be dashing fourteen knots through the water and taking off sail as fast as the men can clew up and lower away a night of calm when sleep is wellnigh impossible in the sultry muggy air may be followed by a day of blazing sun and an oily swell from the southard connoting great gales in that area of ocean we are sailing towardor all day long the elsinore under an overcast sky royals and sky sails furled may plunge and buck under windpressure into a short and choppy headsea  and all this means work for the men  taking mr pikes judgment they are very inadequate though by this time they know the ropes  he growls and grumbles and snorts and sneers whenever he watches them doing anything  today at eleven in the morning the wind was so violent continuing in greater gusts after having come in a great gust that mr pike ordered the mainsail taken off  the great crojack was already off but the watch could not clew up the mainsail and after much vain sing songing and pullhauling the watch below was routed out to bear a hand  my god mr pike groaned to me  two watches for a rag like that when half a decent watch could do it  look at that preventer bosun of mine  poor nancy  he looked the saddest sickest bleakest creature i had ever seen  he was so wretched so miserable so helpless  and sundry buyers was just as impotent  the expression on his face was of pain and hopelessness and as he pressed his abdomen he lumbered futilely about ever seeking something he might do and ever failing to find it  he pottered  he would stand and stare at one rope for a minute or so at a time following it aloft with his eyes through the maze of ropes and stabs and gears with all the intentness of a man working out an intricate problem  then holding his hand against his stomach he would lumber on a few steps and select another rope for study  oh dear oh dear mr pike lamented  how can one drive with bosuns like that and a crew like that  just the same if i was captain of this ship id drive em  id show em what drive was if i had to lose a few of them  and when they grow weak off the horn whatll we do  itll be both watches all the time which will weaken them just that much the faster  evidently this winter passage of the horn is all that one has been led to expect from reading the narratives of the navigators  iron men like the two mates are very respectful of cape stiff as they call that uttermost tip of the american continent  speaking of the two mates iron made and ironmouthed that they are it is amusing that in really serious moments both of them curse with oh dear oh dear  in the spells of calm i take great delight in the little rifle  i have already fired away five thousand rounds and have come to consider myself an expert  whatever the knack of shooting may be ive got it  when i get back i shall take up target practice  it is a neat deft sport  not only is possum afraid of the sails and of rats but he is afraid of riflefire and at the first discharge goes yelping and kiyiing below the dislike mr pike has developed for the poor little puppy is ludicrous  he even told me that if it were his dog hed throw it overboard for a target  just the same he is an affectionate heartwarming little rascal and has already crept so deep into my heart that i am glad miss west did not accept him  andohhe insists on sleeping with me on top the bedding a proceeding which has scandalized the mate  i suppose hell be using your toothbrush next mr pike growled at me  but the puppy loves my companionship and is never happier than when on the bed with me  yet the bed is not entirely paradise for possum is badly frightened when ours is the lee side and the seas pound and smash against the glass ports  then the little beggar electric with fear to every hair tip crouches and snarls menacingly and almost at the same time whimpers appeasingly at the stormmonster outside  father knows the sea miss west said to me this afternoon  he understands it and he loves it  or it may be habit i ventured  she shook her head  he does know it  and he loves it  that is why he has come back to it all his people before him were sea folk  his grandfather anthony west made fortysix voyages between 1801 and 1847  and his father robert sailed master to the northwest coast before the gold days and was captain of some of the fastest cape horn clippers after the gold discovery  elijah west fathers greatgrandfather was a privateersman in the revolution  he commanded the armed brig new defence  and even before that elijahs father in turn and elijahs fathers father were masters and owners on longvoyage merchant adventures  anthony west in 1813 and 1814 commanded the david bruce with letters of marque  he was halfowner with gracie  sons as the other halfowners  she was a twohundredton schooner built right up in maine  she carried a long eighteenpounder two tenpounders and ten sixpounders and she sailed like a witch  she ran the blockade off newport and got away to the english channel and the bay of biscay  and do you know though she only cost twelve thousand dollars all told she took over three hundred thousand dollars of british prizes  a brother of his was on the wasp  so you see the sea is in our blood  she is our mother  as far back as we can trace all our line was born to the sea  she laughed and went on  weve pirates and slavers in our family and all sorts of disreputable searovers  old ezra west just how far back i dont remember was executed for piracy and his body hung in chains at plymouth  the sea is fathers blood  and he knows well a ship as you would know a dog or a horse  every ship he sails has a distinct personality for him  i have watched him in high moments and seen him think  but oh the times i have seen him when he does not thinkwhen he feels and knows everything without thinking at all  really with all that appertains to the sea and ships he is an artist  there is no other word for it  you think a great deal of your father i remarked  he is the most wonderful man i have ever known she replied  remember you are not seeing him at his best  he has never been the same since mothers death  if ever a man and woman were one they were  she broke off then concluded abruptly  you dont know him  you dont know him at all     chapter xxviii   i think we are going to have a fine sunset captain west remarked last evening  miss west and i abandoned our rubber of cribbage and hastened on deck the sunset had not yet come but all was preparing  as we gazed we could see the sky gathering the materials grouping the gray clouds in long lines and towering masses spreading its palette with slowgrowing glowing tints and sudden blobs of colour  its the golden gate miss west cried indicating the west  see were just inside the harbour  look to the south there  if that isnt the skyline of san francisco  theres the call building and there far down the ferry tower and surely that is the fairmount  her eyes roved back through the opening between the cloud masses and she clapped her hands  its a sunset within a sunset  see  the farallonesswimming in a miniature orange and red sunset all their own  isnt it the golden gate and san francisco and the farallones  she appealed to mr pike who leaning near on the pooprail was divided between gazing sourly at nancy pottering on the main deck and sourly at possum who on the bridge crouched with terror each time the crojack flapped emptily above him  the mate turned his head and favoured the sky picture with a solemn stare  oh i dont know he growled  it may look like the farallones to you but to me it looks like a battleship coming right in the gate with a bone in its teeth at a twentyknot clip  sure enough  the floating farallones had metamorphosed into a giant warship  then came the colour riot the dominant tone of which was green  it was green green greenthe bluegreen of the springing year and sere and yellow green and tawnybrown green of autumn  there were orange green gold green and a copper green  and all these greens were rich green beyond description and yet the richness and the greenness passed even as we gazed upon it going out of the gray clouds and into the sea which assumed the exquisite golden pink of polished copper while the hollows of the smooth and silken ripples were touched by a most ethereal pea green  the gray clouds became a long low swathe of ruby red or garnet redsuch as one sees in a glass of heavy burgundy when held to the light  there was such depth to this red  and below it separated from the main colourmass by a line of graywhite fog or line of sea was another and smaller streak of ruddycoloured wine  i strolled across the poop to the port side  oh  come back  look  look miss west cried to me  whats the use i answered  ive something just as good over here  she joined me and as she did so i noted a sour grin on mr pikes face  the eastern heavens were equally spectacular  that quarter of the sky was sheer and delicate shell of blue the upper portions of which faded changed through every harmony into a pale yet warm rose all trembling palpitating with misty blue tinting into pink  the reflection of this coloured skyshell upon the water made of the sea a glimmering watered silk all changeable blue nilegreen and salmon pink  it was silky silken a wonderful silk that veneered and flossed the softly moving wavy water  and the pale moon looked like a wet pearl gleaming through the tinted mist of the skyshell  in the southern quadrant of the sky we discovered an entirely different sunsetwhat would be accounted a very excellent orangeandred sunset anywhere with grey clouds hanging low and lighted and tinted on all their under edges  huh mr pike muttered gruffly while we were exclaiming over our fresh discovery  look at the sunset i got here to the north  it aint doing so badly now i leave it to you  and it wasnt  the northern quadrant was a great fen of colour and cloud that spread ribs of feathery pink fleecefrilled from the horizon to the zenith  it was all amazing  four sunsets at the one time in the sky  each quadrant glowed and burned and pulsed with a sunset distinctly its own  and as the colours dulled in the slow twilight the moon still misty wept tears of brilliant heavy silver into the dim lilac sea  and then came the hush of darkness and the night and we came to ourselves out of reverie sated with beauty leaning toward each other as we leaned upon the rail side by side        i never grow tired of watching captain west  in a way he bears a sort of resemblance to several of washingtons portraits  he is six feet of aristocratic thinness and has a very definite leisurely and stately grace of movement  his thinness is almost ascetic  in appearance and manner he is the perfect oldtype new england gentleman  he has the same gray eyes as his daughter although his are genial rather than warm and his eyes have the same trick of smiling  his skin is pinker than hers and his brows and lashes are fairer  but he seems removed beyond passion or even simple enthusiasm  miss west is firm like her father but there is warmth in her firmness  he is clean he is sweet and courteous but he is coolly sweet coolly courteous  with all his certain graciousness in cabin or on deck so far as his social equals are concerned his graciousness is cool elevated thin  he is the perfect master of the art of doing nothing  he never reads except the bible yet he is never bored  often i note him in a deck chair studying his perfect fingernails and ill swear not seeing them at all  miss west says he loves the sea  and i ask myself a thousand times but how he shows no interest in any phase of the sea although he called our attention to the glorious sunset i have just described he did not remain on deck to enjoy it  he sat below in the big leather chair not reading not dozing but merely gazing straight before him at nothing        the days pass and the seasons pass  we left baltimore at the tailend of winter went into spring and on through summer and now we are in fall weather and urging our way south to the winter of cape horn  and as we double the cape and proceed north we shall go through spring and summera long summerpursuing the sun north through its declination and arriving at seattle in summer  and all these seasons have occurred and will have occurred in the space of five months  our white ducks are gone and in south latitude thirtyfive we are wearing the garments of a temperate clime  i notice that wada has given me heavier underclothes and heavier pyjamas and that possum of nights is no longer content with the top of the bed but must crawl underneath the bedclothes        we are now off the plate a region notorious for storms and mr pike is on the lookout for a pampero  captain west does not seem to be on the lookout for anything yet i notice that he spends longer hours on deck when the sky and barometer are threatening  yesterday we had a hint of plate weather and today an awesome fiasco of the same  the hint came last evening between the twilight and the dark there was practically no wind and the elsinore just maintaining steerage way by means of intermittent fans of air from the north floundered exasperatingly in a huge glassy swell that rolled up as an echo from some blownout storm to the south  ahead of us arising with the swiftness of magic was a dense slateblackness  i suppose it was cloudformation but it bore no semblance to clouds  it was merely and sheerly a blackness that towered higher and higher until it overhung us while it spread to right and left blotting out half the sea  and still the light puffs from the north filled our sails and still as the elsinore floundered on the huge smooth swells and the sails emptied and flapped a hollow thunder we moved slowly towards that ominous blackness  in the cast in what was quite distinctly an active thunder cloud the lightning fairly winked while the blackness in front of us was rent with blobs and flashes of lightning  the last puffs left us and in the hushes between the rumbles of the nearing thunder the voices of the men aloft on the yards came to ones ear as if they were right beside one instead of being hundreds of feet away and up in the air  that they were duly impressed by what was impending was patent from the earnestness with which they worked  both watches toiled under both mates and captain west strolled the poop in his usual casual way and gave no orders at all save in low conventional tones when mr pike came upon the poop and conferred with him  miss west having deserted the scene five minutes before returned a proper seawoman clad in oilskins souwester and long seaboots  she ordered me quite peremptorily to do the same  but i could not bring myself to leave the deck for fear of missing something so i compromised by having wada bring my stormgear to me  and then the wind came smack out of the blackness with the abruptness of thunder and accompanied by the most diabolical thunder  and with the rain and thunder came the blackness  it was tangible  it drove past us in the bellowing wind like so much stuff that one could feel  blackness as well as wind impacted on us  there is no other way to describe it than by the old ancient old way of saying one could not see his hand before his face  isnt it splendid miss west shouted into my ear close beside me as we clung to the railing of the break of the poop  superb i shouted back my lips to her ear so that her hair tickled my face  and i know not whyit must have been spontaneous with both of usin that shouting blackness of wind as we clung to the rail to avoid being blown away our hands went out to each other and my hand and hers gripped and pressed and then held mutually to the rail  daughter of herodias i commented grimly to myself but my hand did not leave hers  what is happening i shouted in her ear  weve lost way came her answer  i think were caught aback  the wheels up but she could not steer  the gabriel voice of the samurai rang out  hard over was his mellow stormcall to the man at the wheel  hard over sir came the helmsmans reply vague cracked with strain and smothered  came the lightning before us behind us on every side bathing us in flaming minutes at a time  and all the while we were deafened by the unceasing uproar of thunder  it was a weird sightfar aloft the black skeleton of spars and masts from which the sails had been removed lower down the sailors clinging like monstrous bugs as they passed the gaskets and furled beneath them the few set sails filled backward against the masts gleaming whitely wickedly evilly in the fearful illumination and at the bottom the deck and bridge and houses of the elsinore and a tangled riffraff of flying ropes and clumps and bunches of swaying pulling hauling human creatures  it was a great moment the masters momentcaught all aback with all our bulk and tonnage and infinitude of gear and our heavenaspiring masts two hundred feet above our heads  and our master was there in sheeting flame slender casual imperturbable with two menone of them a murdererunder him to pass on and enforce his will and with a horde of inefficients and weaklings to obey that will and pull and haul and by the sheer leverages of physics manipulate our floating world so that it would endure this fury of the elements  what happened next what was done i do not know save that now and again i heard the gabriel voice for the darkness came and the rain in pouring horizontal sheets  it filled my mouth and strangled my lungs as if i had fallen overboard  it seemed to drive up as well as down piercing its way under my souwester through my oilskins down my tight buttoned collar and into my seaboots  i was dizzied obfuscated by all this onslaught of thunder lightning wind blackness and water  and yet the master near to me there on the poop lived and moved serenely in all voicing his wisdom and will to the wisps of creatures who obeyed and by their brute puny strength pulled braces slacked sheets dragged courses swung yards and lowered them hauled on buntlines and clewlines smoothed and gasketed the huge spreads of canvas  how it happened i know not but miss west and i crouched together clinging to the rail and to each other in the shelter of the thrumming weathercloth  my arm was about her and fast to the railing her shoulder pressed close against me and by one hand she held tightly to the lapel of my oilskin  an hour later we made our way across the poop to the charthouse helping each other to maintain footing as the elsinore plunged and bucked in the rising sea and was pressed over and down by the weight of wind on her few remaining set sails  the wind which had lulled after the rain had risen in recurrent gusts to storm violence  but all was well with the gallant ship  the crisis was past and the ship lived and we lived and with streaming faces and bright eyes we looked at each other and laughed in the bright light of the chartroom  who can blame one for loving the sea miss west cried out exultantly as she wrung the rain from her ropes of hair which had gone adrift in the turmoil  and the men of the sea she cried  the masters of the sea you saw my father      he is a king i said  he is a king she repeated after me  and the elsinore lifted on a cresting sea and flung down on her side so that we were thrown together and brought up breathless against the wall  i said goodnight to her at the foot of the stairs and as i passed the open door to the cabin i glanced in  there sat captain west whom i had thought still on deck  his stormtrappings were removed his seaboots replaced by slippers and he leaned back in the big leather chair eyes wide open beholding visions in the curling smoke of a cigar against a background of wildly reeling cabin wall  it was at eleven this morning that the plate gave us a fiasco  last nights was a real pamperothough a mild one  todays promised to be a far worse one and then laughed at us as a proper cosmic joke  the wind during the night had so eased that by nine in the morning we had all our topgallantsails set  by ten we were rolling in a dead calm  by eleven the stuff began making up ominously in the southard  the overcast sky closed down  our lofty trucks seemed to scrape the cloudzenith  the horizon drew in on us till it seemed scarcely half a mile away  the elsinore was embayed in a tiny universe of mist and sea  the lightning played  sky and horizon drew so close that the elsinore seemed on the verge of being absorbed sucked in by it sucked up by it  then from zenith to horizon the sky was cracked with forked lightning and the wet atmosphere turned to a horrid green  the rain beginning gently in dead calm grew into a deluge of enormous streaming drops  it grew darker and darker a green darkness and in the cabin although it was midday wada and the steward lighted lamps  the lightning came closer and closer until the ship was enveloped in it  the green darkness was continually atremble with flame through which broke greater illuminations of forked lightning  these became more violent as the rain lessened and so absolutely were we centred in this electrical maelstrom there was no connecting any chain or flash or fork of lightning with any particular thunderclap  the atmosphere all about us paled and flamed  such a crashing and smashing  we looked every moment for the elsinore to be struck  and never had i seen such colours in lightning  although from moment to moment we were dazzled by the greater bolts there persisted always a tremulous pulsing lesser play of light sometimes softly blue at other times a thin purple that quivered on into a thousand shades of lavender  and there was no wind  no wind came  nothing happened  the elsinore nakedsparred under only lowertopsails with spanker and crojack furled was prepared for anything  her lowertopsails hung in limp emptiness from the yards heavy with rain and flapping soggily when she rolled  the cloud mass thinned the day brightened the green blackness passed into gray twilight the lightning eased the thunder moved along away from us and there was no wind  in half an hour the sun was shining the thunder muttered intermittently along the horizon and the elsinore still rolled in a hush of air  you cant tell sir mr pike growled to me  thirty years ago i was dismasted right here off the plate in a clap of wind that come on just as that come on  it was the changing of the watches and mr mellaire who had come on the poop to relieve the mate stood beside me  one of the nastiest pieces of water in the world he concurred eighteen years ago the plate gave it to melost half our sticks twenty hours on our beamends cargo shifted and foundered  i was two days in the boat before an english tramp picked us up  and none of the other boats ever was picked up  the elsinore behaved very well last night i put in cheerily  oh hell that wasnt nothing mr pike grumbled  wait till you see a real pampero  its a dirty stretch hereabouts and i for one ll be glad when we get across it  id sooner have a dozen cape horn snorters than one of these  how about you mr mellaire  same here sir he answered  those souwesters are honest  you know what to expect  but here you never know  the best of shipmasters can get tripped up off the plate     as ive found out       beyond a doubt  mr pike hummed from newcombs celeste as he went down the ladder     chapter xxix   the sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the argentine  last evening we had high clouds broken white and golden flung disorderly generously over the western half of the sky while in the east was painted a second sunseta reflection perhaps of the first  at any rate the eastern sky was a bank of pale clouds that shed soft spread rays of blue and white upon a bluegrey sea  and the evening before last we had a gorgeous arizona riot in the west bastioned upon the ocean cloudtier was piled upon cloudtier spacious and lofty until we gazed upon a grand canyon a myriad times vaster and more celestial than that of the colorado  the clouds took on the same stratified serrated roserock formation and all the hollows were filled with the opal blues and purple hazes of the painted lands  the sailing directions say that these remarkable sunsets are due to the dust being driven high into the air by the winds that blow across the pampas of the argentine  and our sunset tonighti am writing this at midnight as i sit propped in my blankets wedged by pillows while the elsinore wallows damnably in a dead calm and a huge swell rolling up from the cape horn region where it does seem gales perpetually blow  but our sunset  turner might have perpetrated it  the west was as if a painter had stood off and slapped brushfuls of gray at a green canvas  on this green background of sky the clouds spilled and crumpled  but such a background  such an orgy of green  no shade of green was missing in the interstices large and small between the milky curdled cloudsnilegreen high up and then in order each with a thousand shades bluegreen browngreen greygreen and a wonderful olivegreen that tarnished into a rich bronzegreen  during the display the rest of the horizon glowed with broad bands of pink and blue and pale green and yellow  a little later when the sun was quite down in the background of the curdled clouds smouldered a wine red mass of colour that faded to bronze and tinged all the fading greens with its sanguinary hue  the clouds themselves flushed to rose of all shades while a fan of gigantic streamers of pale rose radiated toward the zenith  these deepened rapidly into flaunting roseflame and burned long in the slowclosing twilight  and with all this wonder of the beauty of the world still glowing in my brain hours afterward i hear the snarling of mr pike above my head and the trample and drag of feet as the men move from rope to rope and pull and haul  more weather is making and from the way sail is being taken in it cannot be far off        yet at daylight this morning we were still wallowing in the same dead calm and sickly swell  miss west says the barometer is down but that the warning has been too long for the plate to amount to anything pamperos happen quickly here and though the elsinore under bare poles to her uppertopsails is prepared for anything it may well be that they will be crowding on canvas in another hour  mr pike was so fooled that he actually had set the topgallantsails and the gaskets were being taken off the royals when the samurai came on deck strolled back and forth a casual five minutes then spoke in an undertone to mr pike  mr pike did not like it  to me a tyro it was evident that he disagreed with his master  nevertheless his voice went out in a snarl aloft to the men on the royalyards to make all fast again  then it was clewlines and buntlines and lowering of yards as the topgallantsails were stripped off  the crojack was taken in and some of the outer foreandaft handsails whose order of names i can never remember  a breeze set in from the southwest blowing briskly under a clear sky  i could see that mr pike was secretly pleased  the samurai had been mistaken  and each time mr pike glanced aloft at the naked topgallant and royalyards i knew his thought was that they might well be carrying sail  i was quite convinced that the plate had fooled captain west  so was miss west convinced and being a favoured person like myself she frankly told me so  father will be setting sail in half an hour she prophesied  what superior weathersense captain west possesses i know not save that it is his by samurai right  the sky as i have said was clear  the air was brittlesparkling gloriously in the windy sun  and yet behold in a brief quarter of an hour the change that took place  i had just returned from a trip below and miss west was venting her scorn on the river plate and promising to go below to the sewingmachine when we heard mr pike groan  it was a whimsical groan of disgust contrition and acknowledgment of inferiority before the master  here comes the whole river plate was what he groaned  following his gaze to the southwest we saw it coming  it was a cloud mass that blotted out the sunlight and the day  it seemed to swell and belch and roll over and over on itself as it advanced with a rapidity that told of enormous wind behind it and in it  its speed was headlong terrific and beneath it covering the sea advancing with it was a gray bank of mist  captain west spoke to the mate who bawled the order along and the watch reinforced by the watch below began dewing up the mainsail and foresail and climbing into the rigging  keep off  put your wheel over  hard over captain west called gently to the helmsman  and the big wheel spun around and the elsinores bow fell off so that she might not be caught aback by the onslaught of wind  thunder rode in that rushing rolling blackness of cloud and it was rent by lightning as it fell upon us  then it was rain wind obscureness of gloom and lightning  i caught a glimpse of the men on the loweryards as they were blotted from view and as the elsinore heeled over and down  there were fifteen men of them to each yard and the gaskets were well passed ere we were struck  how they regained the deck i do not know i never saw for the elsinore under only upper and lowertopsails lay down on her side her portrail buried in the sea and did not rise  there was no maintaining an unsupported upright position on that acute slant of deck  everybody held on  mr pike frankly gripped the poop rail with both hands and miss west and i made frantic clutches and scrambled for footing  but i noticed that the samurai poised lightly like a bird on the verge of flight merely rested one hand on the rail he gave no orders  as i divined there was nothing to be done  he waitedthat was allin tranquillity and repose  the situation was simple  either the masts would go or the elsinore would rise with her masts intact or she would never rise again  in the meantime she lay dead her lee yardarms almost touching the sea the sea creaming solidly to her hatchcombings across the buried unseen rail  the minutes were as centuries until the bow paid off and the elsinore turned tail before it righted to an even keel  immediately this was accomplished captain west had her brought back upon the wind  and immediately thereupon the big foresail went adrift from its gaskets the shock or succession of shocks to the ship from the tremendous buffeting that followed was fearful  it seemed she was being racked to pieces  master and mate were side by side when this happened and the expressions on their faces typified them  in neither face was apprehension  mr pikes face bore a sour sneer for the worthless sailors who had botched the job  captain wests face was serenely considerative  still nothing was to be done could be done and for five minutes the elsinore was shaken as in the maw of some gigantic monster until the last shreds of the great piece of canvas had been torn away  our foresail has departed for africa miss west laughed in my ear  she is like her father unaware of fear  and now we may as well go below and be comfortable she said five minutes later  the worst is over  it will only be blow blow blow and a big sea making        all day it blew  and the big sea that arose made the elsinores conduct almost unlivable  my only comfort was achieved by taking to my bunk and wedging myself with pillows buttressed against the bunks sides by empty soapboxes which wada arranged  mr pike clinging to my door casing while his legs sprawled adrift in a succession of terrific rolls paused to tell me that it was a new one on him in the pampero line  it was all wrong from the first  it had not come on right  it had no reason to be  he paused a little longer and in a casual way that under the circumstances was ridiculously transparent exposed what was at ferment in his mind  first of all he was absurd enough to ask if possum showed symptoms of sea sickness  next he unburdened his wrath for the inefficients who had lost the foresail and sympathized with the sailmakers for the extra work thrown upon them  then he asked permission to borrow one of my books and clinging to my bunk selected buchners force and matter from my shelf carefully wedging the empty space with the doubled magazine i use for that purpose  still he was loth to depart and cudgelling his brains for a pretext he set up a rambling discourse on river plate weather  and all the time i kept wondering what was behind it all  at last it came  by the way mr pathurst he remarked do you happen to remember how many years ago mr mellaire said it was that he was dismasted and foundered off here  i caught his drift on the instant  eight years ago wasnt it i lied  mr pike let this sink in and slowly digested it while the elsinore was guilty of three huge rolls down to port and back again  now i wonder what ship was sunk off the plate eight years ago he communed as if with himself  i guess ill have to ask mr mellaire her name  you can search me for all any i can recollect  he thanked me with unwonted elaborateness for force and matter of which i knew he would never read a line and felt his way to the door here he hung on for a moment as if struck by a new and most accidental idea  now it wasnt by any chance that he said eighteen years ago he queried  i shook my head  eight years ago i said  thats the way i remember it though why i should remember it at all i dont know  but that is what he said i went on with increasing confidence  eight years ago  i am sure of it  mr pike looked at me ponderingly and waited until the elsinore had fairly righted for an instant ere he took his departure down the hall  i think i have followed the working of his mind  i have long since learned that his memory of ships officers cargoes gales and disasters is remarkable  he is a veritable encyclopaedia of the sea  also it is patent that he has equipped himself with sidney walthams history  as yet he does not dream that mr mellaire is sidney waltham and he is merely wondering if mr mellaire was a shipmate of sidney waltham eighteen years ago in the ship lost off the plate  in the meantime i shall never forgive mr mellaire for this slip he has made  he should have been more careful     chapter xxx   an abominable night  a wonderful night  sleep  i suppose i did sleep in catnaps but i swear i heard every bell struck until threethirty then came a change an easement  no longer was it a stubborn loggy fight against pressures  the elsinore moved  i could feel her slip and slide and send and soar  whereas before she had been flung continually down to port she now rolled as far to one side as to the other  i knew what had taken place  instead of remaining hoveto on the pampero captain west had turned tail and was running before it  this i understood meant a really serious storm for the northeast was the last direction in which captain west desired to go  but at any rate the movement though wilder was easier and i slept  i was awakened at five by the thunder of seas that fell aboard rushed down the main deck and crashed against the cabin wall  through my open door i could see water swashing up and down the hall while half a foot of water creamed and curdled from under my bunk across the floor each time the ship rolled to starboard  the steward brought me my coffee and wedged by boxes and pillows like an equilibrist i sat up and drank it  luckily i managed to finish it in time for a succession of terrific rolls emptied one of my bookshelves possum crawling upward from my feet under the covered way of my bed yapped with terror as the seas smashed and thundered and as the avalanche of books descended upon us  and i could not but grin when the paste board crown smote me on the head while the puppy was knocked gasping with chestertons whats wrong with the world  well what do you think i queried of the steward who was helping to set us and the books to rights  he shrugged his shoulders and his bright slant eyes were very bright as he replied  many times i see like this  me old man  many times i see more bad  too much wind too much work  rotten dam bad  i could guess that the scene on deck was a spectacle and at six oclock as gray light showed through my ports in the intervals when they were not submerged i essayed the sideboard of my bunk like a gymnast captured my careering slippers and shuddered as i thrust my bare feet into their chill sogginess  i did not wait to dress  merely in pyjamas i headed for the poop possum wailing dismally at my desertion  it was a feat to travel the narrow halls  time and again i paused and held on until my fingertips hurt  in the moments of easement i made progress  yet i miscalculated  the foot of the broad stairway to the charthouse rested on a crosshall a dozen feet in length overconfidence and an unusually violent antic of the elsinore caused the disaster  she flung down to starboard with such suddenness and at such a pitch that the flooring seemed to go out from under me and i hustled helplessly down the incline  i missed a frantic clutch at the newelpost flung up my arm in time to save my face and most fortunately whirled half about and still falling impacted with my shoulder musclepad on captain wests door  youth will have its way  so will a ship in a sea  and so will a hundred and seventy pounds of a man  the beautiful hardwood doorpanel splintered the latch fetched away and i broke the nails of the four fingers of my right hand in a futile grab at the flying door marring the polished surface with four parallel scratches  i kept right on erupting into captain wests spacious room with the big brass bed  miss west swathed in a woollen dressinggown her eyes heavy still with sleep her hair glorious and for the once ungroomed clinging in the doorway that gave entrance on the main cabin met my startled gaze with an equally startled gaze  it was no time for apologies  i kept right on my mad way caught the foot stanchion and was whipped around in half a circle flat upon captain wests brass bed  miss west was beginning to laugh  come right in she gurgled  a score of retorts all deliciously inadvisable tickled my tongue so i said nothing contenting myself with holding on with my left hand while i nursed my stinging right hand under my armpit  beyond her across the floor of the main cabin i saw the steward in pursuit of captain wests bible and a sheaf of miss wests music  and as she gurgled and laughed at me beholding her in this intimacy of storm the thought flashed through my brain  she is a woman  she is desirable  now did she sense this fleeting unuttered flash of mine  i know not save that her laughter left her and long conventional training asserted itself as she said  i just knew everything was adrift in fathers room  he hasnt been in it all night  i could hear things rolling around    what is wrong are you hurt  stubbed my fingers thats all i answered looking at my broken nails and standing gingerly upright  my that was a roll she sympathized  yes id started to go upstairs i said and not to turn into your fathers bed  im afraid ive ruined the door  came another series of great rolls  i sat down on the bed and held on miss west secure in the doorway began gurgling again while beyond across the cabin carpet the steward shot past embracing a small writing desk that had evidently carried away from its fastenings when he seized hold of it for support  more seas smashed and crashed against the forard wall of the cabin and the steward failing of lodgment shot back across the carpet still holding the desk from harm  taking advantage of favouring spells i managed to effect my exit and gain the newelpost ere the next series of rolls came  and as i clung on and waited i could not forget what i had just seen  vividly under my eyelids burned the picture of miss wests sleepladen eyes her hair and all the softness of her  a woman and desirable kept drumming in my brain  but i forgot all this when nearly at the top i was thrown up the hill of the stairs as if it had suddenly become downhill  my feet flew from stair to stair to escape falling and i flew or fell apparently upward until at the top i hung on for dear life while the stern of the elsinore flung skyward on some mighty surge  such antics of so huge a ship  the old stereotyped toy describes her for toy she was the sheerest splinter of a plaything in the grip of the elements  and yet despite this overwhelming sensation of microscopic helplessness i was aware of a sense of surety  there was the samurai informed with his will and wisdom the elsinore was no catspaw everything was ordered controlled  she was doing what he ordained her to do and no matter what stormtitans bellowed about her and buffeted her she would continue to do what he ordained her to do  i glanced into the chartroom  there he sat leaned back in a screwchair his seabooted legs wedged against the settee holding him in place in the most violent rolls  his black oilskin coat glistened in the lamplight with a myriad drops of ocean that advertised a recent return from deck  his souwester black and glistening was like the helmet of some legendary hero  he was smoking a cigar and he smiled and greeted me  but he seemed very tired and very oldold with wisdom however not weakness  the flesh of his face the pink pigment quite washed and worn away was more transparent than ever and yet never was he more serene never more the master absolute of our tiny fragile world  the age that showed in him was not a matter of terrestrial years it was ageless passionless beyond human  never had he appeared so great to me so far remote so much a spirit visitant  and he cautioned and advised me in silvermellow beneficent voice as i essayed the venture of opening the charthouse door to gain outside  he knew the moment although i never could have guessed it for myself and gave the word that enabled me to win the poop  water was everywhere  the elsinore was rushing through a blurring whirr of water  seas creamed and licked the poopdeck edge now to starboard now to port  high in the air overtowering and perilously downtoppling followingseas pursued our stern  the air was filled with spindrift like a fog or spray  no officer of the watch was in sight  the poop was deserted save for two helmsmen in streaming oilskins under the halfshelter of the open wheelhouse  i nodded good morning to them  one was tom spink the elderly but keen and dependable english sailor the other was bill quigley one of a forecastle group of three that herded uniquely together though the other two frank fitzgibbon and richard oiler were in the second mates watch  the three had proved handy with their fists and clannish they had fought pitched forecastle battles with the gangster clique and won a sort of neutrality of independence for themselves  they were not exactly sailorsmr mellaire sneeringly called them the bricklayersbut they had successfully refused subservience to the gangster crowd  to cross the deck from the charthouse to the break of the poop was no slight feat but i managed it and hung on to the railing while the wind stung my flesh with the flappings of my pyjamas  at this moment and for the moment the elsinore righted to an even keel and dashed along and down the avalanching face of a wave  and as she thus righted her deck was filled with water level from rail to rail  above this flood or knee deep in it mr pike and halfadozen sailors were bunched on the fife rail of the mizzenmast  the carpenter too was there with a couple of assistants  the next roll spilled half a thousand tons of water outboard sheer over the starboardrail while all the starboard ports opened automatically and gushed huge streams  then came the opposite roll to port with a clanging shut of the iron doors and a hundred tons of sea sloshed outboard across the portrail while all the iron doors on that side opened wide and gushed  and all this time it must not be forgotten the elsinore was dashing ahead through the sea  the only sail she carried was three uppertopsails  not the tiniest triangle of headsail was on her  i had never seen her with so little windsurface and the three narrow strips of canvas bellied to the seemingness of sheetiron with the pressure of the wind drove her before the gale at astonishing speed  as the water on the deck subsided the men on the fiferail left their refuge  one group led by the redoubtable mr pike strove to capture a mass of planks and twisted steel  for the moment i did not recognize what it was  the carpenter with two men sprang upon number three hatch and worked hurriedly and fearfully  and i knew why captain west had turned tail to the storm  number three hatch was a wreck  among other things the great timber called the strongback was broken  he had had to run or founder  before our decks were swept again i could make out the carpenters emergency repairs  with fresh timbers he was bolting lashing and wedging number three hatch into some sort of tightness  when the elsinore dipped her portrail under and scooped several hundred tons of south atlantic and then immediately rolling her starboardrail under had another hundred tons of breaking sea fall in board upon her all the men forsook everything and scrambled for life upon the fiferail  in the bursting spray they were quite hidden and then i saw them and counted them all as they emerged into view  again they waited for the water to subside  the mass of wreckage pursued by mr pike and his men ground a hundred feet along the deck forard and as the elsinores stern sank down in some abyss ground back again and smashed up against the cabin wall  i identified this stuff as part of the bridge  that portion which spanned from the mizzenmast to the midshiphouse was missing while the starboard boat on the midshiphouse was a splintered mess  watching the struggle to capture and subdue the section of bridge i was reminded of victor hugos splendid description of the sailors battle with a ships gun gone adrift in a night of storm  but there was a difference i found that hugos narrative had stirred me more profoundly than was i stirred by this actual struggle before my eyes  i have repeatedly said that the sea makes one hard  i now realized how hard i had become as i stood there at the break of the poop in my wind shipped spraysoaked pyjamas  i felt no solicitude for the forecastle humans who struggled in peril of their lives beneath me  they did not count  ahi was even curious to see what might happen did they get caught by those crashing avalanches of sea ere they could gain the safety of the fiferail  and i saw  mr pike in the lead of course up to his waist in rushing water dashed in caught the flying wreckage with a turn of rope and fetched it up short with a turn around one of the port mizzenshrouds the elsinore flung down to port and a solid wall of downtoppling green upreared a dozen feet above the rail  the men fled to the fife rail  but mr pike holding his turn held on looked squarely into the wall of the wave and received the downfall  he emerged still holding by the turn the captured bridge  the feebleminded faun the stonedeaf man led the way to mr pikes assistance followed by tony the suicidal greek  paddy was next and in order came shorty henry the trainingship boy and nancy last of course and looking as if he were going to execution  the deckwater was no more than kneedeep though rushing with torrential force when mr pike and the six men lifted the section of bridge and started forard with it  they swayed and staggered but managed to keep going  the carpenter saw the impending oceanmountain first  i saw him cry to his own men and then to mr pike ere he fled to the fiferail  but mr pikes men had no chance  abreast of the midshiphouse on the starboard side fully fifteen feet above the rail and twenty above the deck the sea fell on board  the top of the midshiphouse was swept clean of the splintered boat  the water impacting against the side of the house spouted skyward as high as the crojackyard  and all this in addition to the main bulk of the wave swept and descended upon mr pike and his men  they disappeared  the bridge disappeared  the elsinore rolled to port and dipped her deck full from rail to rail  next she plunged down by the head and all this mass of water surged forward  through the creaming foaming surface now and then emerged an arm or a head or a back while cruel edges of jagged plank and twisted steel rods advertised that the bridge was turning over and over  i wondered what men were beneath it and what mauling they were receiving  and yet these men did not count  i was aware of anxiety only for mr pike  he in a way socially was of my caste and class  he and i belonged aft in the high place ate at the same table  i was acutely desirous that he should not be hurt or killed  the rest did not matter they were not of my world  i imagine the oldtime skippers on the middle passage felt much the same toward their slavecargoes in the fetid tween decks  the elsinores bow tilted skyward while her stern fell into a foaming valley  not a man had gained his feet  bridge and men swept back toward me and fetched up against the mizzenshrouds  and then that prodigious incredible old man appeared out of the water on his two legs upright dragging with him a man in each hand the helpless forms of nancy and the faun  my heart leapt at beholding this mighty figure of a mankiller and slavedriver it is true but who sprang first into the teeth of danger so that his slaves might follow and who emerged with a halfdrowned slave in either hand  i knew augustness and pride as i gazedpride that my eyes were blue like his that my skin was blond like his that my place was aft with him and with the samurai in the high place of government and command  i nearly wept with the chill of pride that was akin to awe and that tingled and bristled along my spinal column and in my brain  as for the restthe weaklings and the rejected and the darkpigmented things the halfcastes the mongrelbloods and the dregs of longconquered raceshow could they count  my heels were iron as i gazed on them in their peril and weakness  lord  lord  for ten thousand generations and centuries we had stamped upon their faces and enslaved them to the toil of our will  again the elsinore rolled to starboard and to port while the spume spouted to our loweryards and a thousand tons of south atlantic surged across from rail to rail  and again all were down and under with jagged plank and twisted steel overriding them  and again that amazing blond skinned giant emerged on his two legs upstanding a broken waif like a rat in either hand  he forced his way through rushing waisthigh water deposited his burdens with the carpenter on the fiferail and returned to drag larry reeling to his feet and help him to the fiferail  out of the wash tony the greek crawled on hands and knees and sank down helplessly at the fiferail  there was nothing suicidal now in his mood struggle as he would he could not lift himself until the mate gripping his oilskin at the collar with one hand flung him through the air into the carpenters arms  next came shorty his face streaming blood one arm hanging useless his seaboots stripped from him  mr pike pitched him into the fiferail and returned for the last man  it was henry the trainingship boy  him i had seen unstruggling motionless show at the surface like a drowned man and sink again as the flood surged aft and smashed him against the cabin  mr pike shoulderdeep twice beaten to his knees and under by bursting seas caught the lad shouldered him and carried him away forard  an hour later in the cabin i encountered mr pike going into breakfast he had changed his clothes and he had shaved  now how could one treat a hero such as he save as i treated him when i remarked offhandedly that he must have had a lively watch  my he answered equally offhandedly i did get a prime soaking  that was all  he had had no time to see me at the pooprail  it was merely the days work the ships work the mans workall capitals if you please in man  i was the only one aft who knew and i knew because i had chanced to see  had i not been on the poop at that early hour no one aft ever would have known those gray stormmorning deeds of his  anybody hurt i asked  oh some of the men got wet  but no bones broke  henryll be laid off for a day  he got turned over in a sea and bashed his head  and shortys got a wrenched shoulder i thinkbut say we got davis into the top bunk  the seas filled him full and he had to climb for it  hes all awash and wet now and you oughta seen me praying for more  he paused and sighed  im getting old i guess  i oughta wring his neck but somehow i aint got the gumption  just the same hell be overside before we get in  a months wages against a pound of tobacco he wont i challenged  no said mr pike slowly  but ill tell you what i will do  ill bet you a pound of tobacco even or a months wages even that ill have the pleasure of putting a sack of coal to his feet that never will come off  done said i  done said mr pike  and now i guess ill get a bite to eat     chapter xxxi   the more i see of miss west the more she pleases me  explain it in terms of propinquity or isolation or whatever you will i at least do not attempt explanation  i know only that she is a woman and desirable  and i am rather proud in a way to find that i am just a man like any man the midnight oil and the relentless pursuit i have endured in the past from the whole tribe of women have not i am glad to say utterly spoiled me  i am obsessed by that phrasea woman and desirable  it beats in my brain in my thought  i go out of my way to steal a glimpse of miss west through a cabin door or vista of hall when she does not know i am looking  a woman is a wonderful thing  a womans hair is wonderful  a womans softness is a magicoh i know them for what they are and yet this very knowledge makes them only the more wonderful  i knowi would stake my soulthat miss west has considered me as a mate a thousand times to once that i have so considered her  and yetshe is a woman and desirable  and i find myself continually reminded of richard le galliennes inimitable quatrain     were i a woman i would all day long    sing my own beauty in some holy song    bend low before it hushed and half afraid    and say i am a woman all day long  let me advise all philosophers suffering from worldsickness to take a long sea voyage with a woman like miss west  in this narrative i shall call her miss west no more  she has ceased to be miss west  she is margaret  i do not think of her as miss west  i think of her as margaret  it is a pretty word a womanword  what poet must have created it  margaret  i never tire of it  my tongue is enamoured of it  margaret west  what a name to conjure with  a name provocative of dreams and mighty connotations  the history of our westwardfaring race is written in it  there is pride in it and dominion and adventure and conquest  when i murmur it i see visions of lean beaked ships of winged helmets and heels ironshod of restless men royal lovers royal adventurers royal fighters  yes and even now in these latter days when the sun consumes us still we sit in the high seat of government and command  ohand by the wayshe is twentyfour years old  i asked mr pike the date of the dixies collision with the river steamer in san francisco bay  this occurred in 1901  margaret was twelve years old at the time this is 1913  blessings on the head of the man who invented arithmetic she is twentyfour  her name is margaret and she is desirable        there are so many things to tell about  where and how this mad voyage with a mad crew will end is beyond all surmise  but the elsinore drives on and day by day her history is bloodily written  and while murder is done and while the whole floating drama moves toward the bleak southern ocean and the icy blasts of cape horn i sit in the high place with the masters unafraid i am proud to say in an ecstasy i am proud to say and i murmur over and over to myselfmargaret a woman margaret and desirable  but to resume  it is the first day of june  ten days have passed since the pampero  when the strong back on number three hatch was repaired captain west came back on the wind hove to and rode out the gale  since then in calm and fog and damp and storm we have won south until to day we are almost abreast of the falklands  the coast of the argentine lies to the west below the sealine and some time this morning we crossed the fiftieth parallel of south latitude  here begins the passage of cape horn for so it is reckoned by the navigatorsfifty south in the atlantic to fifty south in the pacific  and yet all is well with us in the matter of weather  the elsinore slides along with favouring winds  daily it grows colder  the great cabin stove roars and is whitehot and all the connecting doors are open so that the whole after region of the ship is warm and comfortable but on the deck the air bites and margaret and i wear mittens as we promenade the poop or go forard along the repaired bridge to see the chickens on the midshiphouse  the poor wretched creatures of instinct and climate  behold as they approach the southern midwinter of the horn when they have need of all their feathers they proceed to moult because forsooth this is the summer time in the land they came from  or is moulting determined by the time of year they happen to be born  i shall have to look into this  margaret will know  yesterday ominous preparations were made for the passage of the horn  all the braces were taken from the main deck pinrails and geared and arranged so that they may be worked from the tops of the houses  thus the forebraces run to the top of the forecastle the mainbraces to the top of the midshiphouse and the mizzenbraces to the poop  it is evident that they expect our main deck frequently to be filled with water  so evident is it that a laden ship when in big seas is like a log awash that fore and aft on both sides along the deck shoulderhigh lifelines have been rigged  also the two iron doors on port and starboard that open from the cabin directly upon the main deck have been barricaded and caulked  not until we are in the pacific and flying north will these doors open again  and while we prepare to battle around the stormiest headland in the world our situation on board grows darker  this morning petro marinkovich a sailor in mr mellaires watch was found dead on number one hatch  the body bore several knifewounds and the throat was cut  it was palpably done by some one or several of the forecastle hands but not a word can be elicited  those who are guilty of it are silent of course while others who may chance to know are afraid to speak  before midday the body was overside with the customary sack of coal already the man is a past episode  but the humans forard are tense with expectancy of what is to come  i strolled forard this afternoon and noted for the first time a distinct hostility toward me  they recognize that i belong with the afterguard in the high place  oh nothing was said but it was patent by the way almost every man looked at me or refused to look at me  only mulligan jacobs and charles davis were outspoken  good riddance said mulligan jacobs  the guinea didnt have the spunk of a louse  and hes better off aint he  he lived dirty an he died dirty an now hes over an done with the whole dirty game  theres men on board that oughta wish they was as lucky as him  theirs is still a coming to em  you mean     i queried  whatever you want to think i mean the twisted wretch grinned malevolently into my face  charles davis when i peeped into his iron room was exuberant  a pretty tale for the court in seattle he exulted  itll only make my case that much stronger  and wait till the reporters get hold of it the hellship elsinore  theyll have pretty pickins  i havent seen any hellship i said coldly  youve seen my treatment aint you he retorted  youve seen the hell ive got aint you  i know you for a coldblooded murderer i answered  the court will determine that sir  all youll have to do is to testify to facts  ill testify that had i been in the mates place id have hanged you for murder  his eyes positively sparkled  ill ask you to remember this conversation when youre under oath sir he cried eagerly  i confess the man aroused in me a reluctant admiration  i looked about his mean ironwalled room  during the pampero the place had been awash the white paint was peeling off in huge scabs and ironrust was everywhere  the floor was filthy  the place stank with the stench of his sickness  his pannikin and unwashed eatinggear from the last meal were scattered on the floor his blankets were wet his clothing was wet in a corner was a heterogeneous mass of soggy dirty garments  he lay in the very bunk in which he had brained osullivan  he had been months in this vile hole  in order to live he would have to remain months more in it  and while his ratlike vitality won my admiration i loathed and detested him in very nausea  arent you afraid i demanded  what makes you think you will last the voyage  dont you know bets are being made that you wont  so interested was he that he seemed to prick up his ears as he raised on his elbow  i suppose youre too scared to tell me about them bets he sneered  oh ive bet youll last i assured him  that means theres others that bet i wont he rattled on hastily  an that means that theres men aboard the elsinore right now financially interested in my takingoff  at this moment the steward bound aft from the galley paused in the doorway and listened grinning  as for charles davis the man had missed his vocation  he should have been a landlawyer not a sealawyer  very well sir he went on  ill have you testify to that in seattle unless youre lying to a helpless sick man or unless youll perjure yourself under oath  he got what he was seeking for he stung me to retort  oh ill testify  though i tell you candidly that i dont think ill win my bet  you loose m bet sure the steward broke in nodding his head  that fellow him die damn soon  bet withm sir david challenged me  its a straight tip from me an a regular cinch  the whole situation was so gruesome and grotesque and i had been swept into it so absurdly that for the moment i did not know what to do or say  its good money davis urged  i aint goin to die  look here steward how much you want to bet  five dollar ten dollar twenty dollar the steward answered with a shouldershrug that meant that the sum was immaterial  very well then steward  mr pathurst covers your money say for twenty  is it a go sir  why dont you bet with him yourself i demanded  sure i will sir  here you steward i bet you twenty even i dont die  the steward shook his head  i bet you twenty to ten the sick man insisted  whats eatin you anyway  you live me lose me pay you the steward explained  you die i win you dead no pay me  still grinning and shaking his head he went his way  just the same sir itll be rich testimony david chuckled  an cant you see the reporters eatin it up  the asiatic clique in the cooks room has its suspicions about the death of marinkovich but will not voice them  beyond shakings of heads and dark mutterings i can get nothing out of wada or the steward  when i talked with the sailmaker he complained that his injured hand was hurting him and that he would be glad when he could get to the surgeons in seattle  as for the murder when pressed by me he gave me to understand that it was no affair of the japanese or chinese on board and that he was a japanese  but louis the chinese halfcaste with the oxford accent was more frank i caught him aft from the galley on a trip to the lazarette for provisions  we are of a different race sir from these men he said and our safest policy is to leave them alone  we have talked it over and we have nothing to say sir nothing whatever to say  consider my position i work forard in the galley i am in constant contact with the sailors i even sleep in their section of the ship and i am one man against many the only other countryman i have on board is the steward and he sleeps aft  your servant and the two sailmakers are japanese  they are only remotely kin to us though weve agreed to stand together and apart from whatever happens  there is shorty i said remembering mr pikes diagnosis of his mixed nationality  but we do not recognize him sir louis answered suavely  he is portuguese he is malay he is japanese true but he is a mongrel sir a mongrel and a bastard  also he is a fool  and please sir remember that we are very few and that our position compels us to neutrality  but your outlook is gloomy i persisted  how do you think it will end  we shall arrive in seattle most probably some of us  but i can tell you this sir i have lived a long life on the sea but i have never seen a crew like this  there are few sailors in it there are bad men in it and the rest are fools and worse  you will notice i mention no names sir but there are men on board whom i do not care to antagonize  i am just louis the cook  i do my work to the best of my ability and that is all sir  and will charles davis arrive in seattle i asked changing the topic in acknowledgment of his right to be reticent  no i do not think so sir he answered although his eyes thanked me for my courtesy  the steward tells me you have bet that he will  i think sir it is a poor bet  we are about to go around the horn  i have been around it many times  this is midwinter and we are going from east to west  davis room will be awash for weeks  it will never be dry  a strong healthy man confined in it could well die of the hardship and davis is far from well  in short sir i know his condition and he is in a shocking state  surgeons might prolong his life but here in a windjammer it is shortened very rapidly  i have seen many men die at sea  i know sir  thank you sir  and the eurasian chineseenglishman bowed himself away     chapter xxxii   things are worse than i fancied  here are two episodes within the last seventytwo hours  mr mellaire for instance is going to pieces  he cannot stand the strain of being on the same vessel with the man who has sworn to avenge captain somerss murder especially when that man is the redoubtable mr pike  for several days margaret and i have been remarking the second mates bloodshot eyes and painlined face and wondering if he were sick  and to day the secret leaked out  wada does not like mr mellaire and this morning when he brought me breakfast i saw by the wicked gleeful gleam in his almond eyes that he was spilling over with some fresh delectable ships gossip  for several days i learned he and the steward have been solving a cabin mystery  a gallon can of wood alcohol standing on a shelf in the after room had lost quite a portion of its contents  they compared notes and then made of themselves a sherlock holmes and a doctor watson  first they gauged the daily diminution of alcohol  next they gauged it several times daily and learned that the diminution whenever it occurred was first apparent immediately after mealtime  this focussed their attention on two suspectsthe second mate and the carpenter who alone sat in the afterroom  the rest was easy  whenever mr mellaire arrived ahead of the carpenter more alcohol was missing  when they arrived and departed together the alcohol was undisturbed  the carpenter was never alone in the room  the syllogism was complete  and now the steward stores the alcohol under his bunk  but wood alcohol is deadly poison  what a constitution this man of fifty must have  small wonder his eyes have been bloodshot  the great wonder is that the stuff did not destroy him  i have not whispered a word of this to margaret nor shall i whisper it i should like to put mr pike on his guard and yet i know that the revealing of mr mellaires identity would precipitate another killing and still we drive south closehauled on the wind toward the inhospitable tip of the continent  today we are south of a line drawn between the straits of magellan and the falklands and tomorrow if the breeze holds we shall pick up the coast of tierra del fuego close to the entrance of the straits of le maire through which captain west intends to pass if the wind favours  the other episode occurred last night  mr pike says nothing yet he knows the crew situation  i have been watching some time now ever since the death of marinkovich and i am certain that mr pike never ventures on the main deck after dark  yet he holds his tongue confides in no man and plays out the bitter perilous game as a commonplace matter of course and all in the days work  and now to the episode  shortly after the close of the second dogwatch last evening i went forard to the chickens on the midshiphouse on an errand for margaret  i was to make sure that the steward had carried out her orders  the canvas covering to the big chicken coop had to be down the ventilation insured and the kerosene stove burning properly  when i had proved to my satisfaction the dependableness of the steward and just as i was on the verge of returning to the poop i was drawn aside by the weird crying of penguins in the darkness and by the unmistakable noise of a whale blowing not far away  i had climbed around the end of the port boat and was standing there quite hidden in the darkness when i heard the unmistakable agelag step of the mate proceed along the bridge from the poop  it was a dim starry night and the elsinore in the calm ocean under the lee of tierra del fuego was slipping gently and prettily through the water at an eight knot clip  mr pike paused at the forard end of the housetop and stood in a listening attitude  from the main deck below near number two hatch across the mumbling of various voices i could recognize kid twist nosey murphy and bert rhinethe three gangsters  but steve roberts the cow boy was also there as was mr mellaire both of whom belonged in the other watch and should have been turned in for at midnight it would be their watch on deck  especially wrong was mr mellaires presence holding social converse with members of the crewa breach of ship ethics most grievous  i have always been cursed with curiosity  always have i wanted to know and on the elsinore i have already witnessed many a little scene that was a cleancut dramatic gem  so i did not discover myself but lurked behind the boat  five minutes passed  ten minutes passed  the men still talked  i was tantalized by the crying of the penguins and by the whale evidently playful which came so close that it spouted and splashed a biscuittoss away  i saw mr pikes head turn at the sound he glanced squarely in my direction but did not see me  then he returned to listening to the mumble of voices from beneath  now whether mulligan jacobs just happened along or whether he was deliberately scouting i do not know  i tell what occurred  upanddown the side of the midshiphouse is a ladder  and up this ladder mulligan jacobs climbed so noiselessly that i was not aware of his presence until i heard mr pike snarl  what the hell you doin here  then i saw mulligan jacobs in the gloom within two yards of the mate  whats it to you mulligan jacobs snarled back  the voices below hushed  i knew every man stood there tense and listening  no the philosophers have not yet explained mulligan jacobs  there is something more to him than the last word has said in any book  he stood there in the darkness a fragile creature with curvature of the spine facing alone the first mate and he was not afraid  mr pike cursed him with fearful unrepeatable words and again demanded what he was doing there  i left me plug of tobacco here when i was coiling down last said the little twisted manno he did not say it  he spat it out like so much venom  get off of here or ill throw you off you and your tobacco raged the mate  mulligan jacobs lurched closer to mr pike and in the gloom and with the roll of the ship swayed in the others face  by god jacobs was all the mate could say  you old stiff was all the terrible little cripple could retort  mr pike gripped him by the collar and swung him in the air  are you goin downor am i goin to throw you down the mate demanded  i cannot describe their manner of utterance  it was that of wild beasts  i aint ate outa your hand yet have i was the reply  mr pike tried to say something still holding the cripple suspended but he could do no more than strangle in his impotence of rage  youre an old stiff an old stiff an old stiff mulligan jacobs chanted equally incoherent and unimaginative with brutish fury  say it again and over you go the mate managed to enunciate thickly  youre an old stiff gasped mulligan jacobs  he was flung  he soared through the air with the might of the fling and even as he soared and fell through the darkness he reiterated  old stiff  old stiff  he fell among the men on number two hatch and there were confusion and movement below and groans  mr pike paced up and down the narrow house and gritted his teeth  then he paused  he leaned his arms on the bridgerail rested his head on his arms for a full minute then groaned  oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear  that was all  then he went aft slowly dragging his feet along the bridge     chapter xxxiii   the days grow gray  the sun has lost its warmth and each noon at meridian it is lower in the northern sky  all the old stars have long since gone and it would seem the sun is following them  the worldthe only world i knowhas been left behind far there to the north and the hill of the earth is between it and us  this sad and solitary ocean gray and cold is the end of all things the fallingoff place where all things cease  only it grows colder and grayer and penguins cry in the night and huge amphibians moan and slubber and great albatrosses gray with stormbattling of the horn wheel and veer        land ho was the cry yesterday morning  i shivered as i gazed at this the first land since baltimore a few centuries ago  there was no sun and the morning was damp and cold with a brisk wind that penetrated any garment  the deck thermometer marked 30two degrees below freezingpoint and now and then easy squalls of snow swept past  all of the land that was to be seen was snow  long low chains of peaks snowcovered arose out of the ocean  as we drew closer there were no signs of life  it was a sheer savage bleak forsaken land  by eleven off the entrance of le maire straits the squalls ceased the wind steadied and the tide began to make through in the direction we desired to go  captain west did not hesitate  his orders to mr pike were quick and tranquil  the man at the wheel altered the course while both watches sprang aloft to shake out royals and skysails  and yet captain west knew every inch of the risk he took in this graveyard of ships  when we entered the narrow strait under full sail and gripped by a tremendous tide the rugged headlands of tierra del fuego dashed by with dizzying swiftness  close we were to them and close we were to the jagged coast of staten island on the opposite shore  it was here in a wild bight between two black and precipitous walls of rock where even the snow could find no lodgment that captain west paused in a casual sweep of his glasses and gazed steadily at one place  i picked the spot up with my own glasses and was aware of an instant chill as i saw the four masts of a great ship sticking out of the water  whatever craft it was it was as large as the elsinore and it had been but recently wrecked  one of the german nitrate ships said mr pike  captain west nodded still studying the wreck then said  she looks quite deserted  just the same mr pike send several of your bestsighted sailors aloft and keep a good lookout yourself  there may be some survivors ashore trying to signal us  but we sailed on and no signals were seen  mr pike was delighted with our good fortune  he was guilty of walking up and down rubbing his hands and chuckling to himself  not since 1888 he told me had he been through the straits of le maire  also he said that he knew of shipmasters who had made forty voyages around the horn and had never once had the luck to win through the straits  the regular passage is far to the east around staten island which means a loss of westing and here at the tip of the world where the great west wind unobstructed by any land sweeps round and around the narrow girth of earth westing is the thing that has to be fought for mile by mile and inch by inch  the sailing directions advise masters on the horn passage make westing whatever you do make westing  when we emerged from the straits in the early afternoon the same steady breeze continued and in the calm water under the lee of tierra del fuego which extends southwesterly to the horn we slipped along at an eightknot clip  mr pike was beside himself  he could scarcely tear himself from the deck when it was his watch below  he chuckled rubbed his hands and incessantly hummed snatches from the twelfth mass  also he was voluble  tomorrow morning well be up with the horn  well shave it by a dozen or fifteen miles  think of it  well just steal around  i never had such luck and never expected to  old girl elsinore youre rotten forard but the hand of god is at your helm  once under the weather cloth i came upon him talking to himself  it was more a prayer  if only she dont pipe up he kept repeating  if only she dont pipe up  mr mellaire was quite different  it never happens he told me  no ship ever went around like this  you watch her come  she always comes asmoking out of the souwest  but cant a vessel ever steal around i asked  the odds are mighty big against it sir he answered  ill give you a line on them  ill wager even sir just a nominal bet of a pound of tobacco that inside twentyfour hours well he hove to under uppertopsails  ill wager ten pounds to five that were not west of the horn a week from now and fifty to fifty being the passage twenty pounds to five that two weeks from now were not up with fifty in the pacific  as for captain west the perils of le maire behind he sat below his slippered feet stretched before him smoking a cigar  he had nothing to say whatever although margaret and i were jubilant and dared duets through all of the second dogwatch        and this morning in a smooth sea and gentle breeze the horn bore almost due north of us not more than six miles away  here we were well abreast and reeling off westing  what price tobacco this morning i quizzed mr mellaire  going up he came back  wish i had a thousand bets like the one with you sir  i glanced about at sea and sky and gauged the speed of our way by the foam but failed to see anything that warranted his remark  it was surely fine weather and the steward in token of the same was trying to catch fluttering cape pigeons with a bent pin on a piece of thread  forard on the poop i encountered mr pike  it was an encounter for his salutation was a grunt  well were going right along i ventured cheerily  he made no reply but turned and stared into the gray southwest with an expression sourer than any i had ever seen on his face  he mumbled something i failed to catch and on my asking him to repeat it he said  its breeding weather  cant you see it  i shook my head  what dye think were taking off the kites for he growled  i looked aloft  the skysails were already furled men were furling the royals and the topgallantyards were running down while clewlines and buntlines bagged the canvas  yet if anything our northerly breeze fanned even more gently  bless me if i can see any weather i said  then go and take a look at the barometer he grunted as he turned on his heel and swung away from me  in the chartroom was captain west pulling on his long seaboots  that would have told me had there been no barometer though the barometer was eloquent enough of itself  the night before it had stood at 3010  it was now 2864  even in the pampero it had not been so low as that  the usual cape horn programme captain west smiled to me as he stood up in all his lean and slender gracefulness and reached for his long oilskin coat  still i could scarcely believe  is it very far away i inquired  he shook his head and forebore in the act of speaking to lift his hand for me to listen  the elsinore rolled uneasily and from without came the soft and hollow thunder of sails emptying themselves against the masts and gear  we had chatted a bare five minutes when again he lifted his head  this time the elsinore heeled over slightly and remained heeled over while the sighing whistle of a rising breeze awoke in the rigging  its beginning to make he said in the good old anglosaxon of the sea  and then i heard mr pike snarling out orders and in my heart discovered a growing respect for cape horncape stiff as the sailors call it  an hour later we were hove to on the port tack under uppertopsails and foresail  the wind had come out of the southwest and our leeway was setting us down upon the land  captain west gave orders to the mate to stand by to wear ship  both watches had been taking in sail so that both watches were on deck for the manoeuvre  it was astounding the big sea that had arisen in so short a time  the wind was blowing a gale that ever in recurring gusts increased upon itself  nothing was visible a hundred yards away  the day had become blackgray  in the cabin lamps were burning  the view from the poop along the length of the great labouring ship was magnificent  seas burst and surged across her weatherrail and kept her deck half filled despite the spouting ports and gushing scuppers  on each of the two houses and on the poop the ships complement all in oilskins was in groups  forard mr mellaire had charge  mr pike took charge of the midshiphouse and the poop  captain west strolled up and down saw everything said nothing for it was the mates affair  when mr pike ordered the wheel hard up he slacked off all the mizzen yards and followed it with a partial slacking of the mainyards so that the afterpressures were eased  the foresail and forelower andupper topsails remained flat in order to pay the head off before the wind  all this took time  the men were slow not strong and without snap  they reminded me of dull oxen by the way they moved and pulled  and the gale ever snorting harder now snorted diabolically  only at intervals could i glimpse the group on top the forardhouse  again and again leaning to it and holding their heads down the men on the midshiphouse were obliterated by the drive of crested seas that burst against the rail spouted to the loweryards and swept in horizontal volumes across to leeward  and mr pike like an enormous spider in a windtossed web went back and forth along the slender bridge that was itself a shaken thread in the blast of the storm  so tremendous were the gusts that for the time the elsinore refused to answer  she lay down to it she was swept and racked by it but her head did not pay off before it and all the while we drove down upon that bitter iron coast  and the world was blackgray and violent and very cold with the flying spray freezing to ice in every lodgment  we waited  the groups of men head down to it waited  mr pike restless angry his blue eyes as bitter as the cold his mouth as much a snarl as the snarl of the elements with which he fought waited  the samurai waited tranquil casual remote  and cape horn waited there on our lee for the bones of our ship and us  and then the elsinores bow paid off  the angle of the beat of the gale changed and soon with dreadful speed we were dashing straight before it and straight toward the rocks we could not see  but all doubt was over  the success of the manoeuvre was assured  mr mellaire informed by messenger along the bridge from mr pike slacked off the headyards  mr pike his eye on the helmsman his hand signalling the order had the wheel put over to port to check the elsinores rush into the wind as she came up on the starboard tack  all was activity  main and mizzenyards were braced up and the elsinore snugged down and hove to had a lee of thousands of miles of southern ocean  and all this had been accomplished in the stamping ground of storm at the end of the world by a handful of wretched weaklings under the drive of two strong mates with behind them the placid will of the samurai  it had taken thirty minutes to wear ship and i had learned how the best of shipmasters can lose their ships without reproach  suppose the elsinore had persisted in her refusal to payoff  suppose anything had carried away  and right here enters mr pike  it is his task ever to see that every rope and block and all the myriad other things in the vast and complicated gear of the elsinore are in strength not to carry away always have the masters of our race required henchmen like mr pike and it seems the race has well supplied those henchmen  ere i went below i heard captain west tell mr pike that while both watches were on deck it would be just as well to put a reef in the foresail before they furled it  the mainsail and the crojack being off i could see the men black on the foreyard  for halfanhour i lingered watching them  they seemed to make no progress with the reef  mr mellaire was with them having direct supervision of the job while mr pike on the poop growled and grumbled and spat endless blasphemies into the flying air  whats the matter i asked  two watches on a single yardarm and unable to put a reef in a handkerchief like that he snorted  whatll it be if were off here a month  a month i cried  a month isnt anything for cape stiff he said grimly  ive been off here seven weeks and then turned tail and run around the other way  around the world i gasped  it was the only way to get to frisco he answered  the horns the horn and theres no summer seas that ive ever noticed in this neighbourhood  my fingers were numb and i was chilled through when i took a last look at the wretched men on the foreyard and went below to warm up  a little later as i went in to table through a cabin port i stole a look forard between seas and saw the men still struggling on the freezing yard  the four of us were at table and it was very comfortable in spite of the elsinores violent antics  the room was warm  the stormracks on the table kept each dish in its place  the steward served and moved about with ease and apparent unconcern although i noticed an occasional anxious gleam in his eyes when he poised some dish at a moment when the ship pitched and flung with unusual wildness  and now and again i thought of the poor devils on the yard  well they belonged there by right just as we belonged here by right in this oasis of the cabin  i looked at mr pike and wagered to myself that halfa dozen like him could master that stubborn foresail  as for the samurai i was convinced that alone not moving from his seat by a tranquil exertion of will he could accomplish the same thing  the lighted sealamps swung and leaped in their gimbals ever battling with the dancing shadows in the murky gray  the woodwork creaked and groaned  the jiggermast a huge cylinder of hollow steel that perforated the apartment through deck above and floor beneath was hideously vocal with the storm  far above taut ropes beat against it so that it clanged like a boilershop  there was a perpetual thunder of seas falling on our deck and crash of water against our forard wall while the ten thousand ropes and gears aloft bellowed and screamed as the storm smote them  and yet all this was from without  here at this wellappointed table was no draught nor breath of wind no drive of spray nor wash of sea  we were in the heart of peace in the midmost centre of the storm  margaret was in high spirits and her laughter vied with the clang of the jiggermast  mr pike was gloomy but i knew him well enough to attribute his gloom not to the elements but to the inefficients futilely freezing on the yard  as for me i looked about at the four of usblueeyed grayeyed all fairskinned and royal blondand somehow it seemed that i had long since lived this and that with me and in me were all my ancestors and that their lives and memories were mine and that all this vexation of the sea and air and labouring ship was of old time and a thousand times before     chapter xxxiv   how are you for a climb margaret asked me shortly after we had left the table  she stood challengingly at my open door in oilskins souwester and sea boots  ive never seen you with a foot above the deck since we sailed she went on  have you a good head  i marked my book rolled out of my bunk in which i had been wedged and clapped my hands for wada  will you she cried eagerly  if you let me lead i answered airily and if you will promise to hold on tight  whither away  into the top of the jigger  its the easiest  as for holding on please remember that i have often done it  it is with you the doubt rests  very well i retorted do you lead then  i shall hold on tight  i have seen many a landsman funk it she teased  there are no lubber holes in our tops  and most likely i shall i agreed  ive never been aloft in my life and since there is no hole for a lubber  she looked at me half believing my confession of weakness while i extended my arms for the oilskin which wada struggled on to me  on the poop it was magnificent and terrible and sombre  the universe was very immediately about us  it blanketed us in storming wind and flying spray and grayness  our main deck was impassable and the relief of the wheel came aft along the bridge  it was two oclock and for over two hours the frozen wretches had laid out upon the foreyard  they were still there weak feeble hopeless  captain west stepping out in the lee of the charthouse gazed at them for several minutes  well have to give up that reef he said to mr pike  just make the sail fast  better put on double gaskets  and with lagging feet from time to time pausing and holding on as spray and the tops of waves swept over him the mate went forard along the bridge to vent his scorn on the two watches of a fourmasted ship that could not reef a foresail  it is true  they could not do it despite their willingness for this i have learned the men do their weak best whenever the order is given to shorten sail  it must be that they are afraid  they lack the iron of mr pike the wisdom and the iron of captain west  always have i noticed with all the alacrity of which they are capable do they respond to any order to shorten down  that is why they are forard in that pigsty of a forecastle because they lack the iron  well i can say only this if nothing else could have prevented the funk hinted at by margaret the sorry spectacle of these ironless spineless creatures was sufficient safeguard  how could i funk in the face of their weaknessi who lived aft in the high place  margaret did not disdain the aid of my hand as she climbed upon the pin rail at the foot of the weather jiggerrigging  but it was merely the recognition of a courtesy on her part for the next moment she released her mittened hand from mine swung boldly outboard into the face of the gale and around against the ratlines  then she began to climb  i followed almost unaware of the ticklishness of the exploit to a tyro so buoyed up was i by her example and by my scorn of the weaklings forard where men could go i could go  what men could do i could do  and no daughter of the samurai could outgame me  yet it was slow work  in the windward rolls against the stormgusts one was pinned helplessly like a butterfly against the rigging  at such times so great was the pressure one could not lift hand nor foot  also there was no need for holding on  as i have said one was pinned against the rigging by the wind  through the snow beginning to drive the deck grew small beneath me until a fall meant a broken back or death unless one landed in the sea in which case the result would be frigid drowning  and still margaret climbed  without pause she went out under the overhanging platform of the top shifted her holds to the rigging that went aloft from it and swung around this rigging easily carelessly timing the action to the roll and stood safely upon the top  i followed  i breathed no prayers knew no qualms as i presented my back to the deck and climbed out under the overhang feeling with my hands for holds i could not see  i was in an ecstasy  i could dare anything  had she sprung into the air stretched out her arms and soared away on the breast of the gale i should have unhesitatingly followed her  as my head outpassed the edge of the top so that she came into view i could see she was looking at me with stormbright eyes  and as i swung around the rigging lightly and joined her i saw approval in her eyes that was quickly routed by petulance  oh youve done this sort of thing before she reproached calling loudly so that i might hear her lips close to my ear  i shook a denial with my head that brightened her eyes again  she nodded and smiled and sat down dangling her seaboots into snowswirled space from the edge of the top  i sat beside her looking down into the snow that hid the deck while it exaggerated the depth out of which we had climbed  we were all alone there a pair of storm petrels perched in mid air on a steel stick that arose out of snow and that vanished above into snow  we had come to the tip of the world and even that tip had ceased to be  but no  out of the snow down wind with motionless wings driving fully eighty or ninety miles an hour appeared a huge albatross  he must have been fifteen feet from wingtip to wingtip  he had seen his danger ere we saw him and tilting his body on the blast he carelessly veered clear of collision  his head and neck were rimed with age or frostwe could not tell whichand his bright beadeye noted us as he passed and whirled away on a great circle into the snow to leeward  margarets hand shot out to mine  it alone was worth the climb she cried  and then the elsinore flung down and margarets hand clutched tighter for holding while from the hidden depths arose the crash and thunder of the great west wind drift upon our decks  quickly as the snowsquall had come it passed with the same sharp quickness and as in a flash we could see the lean length of the ship beneath usthe main deck full with boiling flood the forecastlehead buried in a bursting sea the lookout stationed for very life back on top the forardhouse hanging on head down to the winddrive of ocean and directly under us the streaming poop and mr mellaire with a handful of men rigging relieving tackles on the tiller  and we saw the samurai emerge in the lee of the charthouse swaying with casual surety on the mad deck as he spoke what must have been instructions to mr pike  the gray circle of the world had removed itself from us for several hundred yards and we could see the mighty sweep of sea  shaggy gray beards sixty feet from trough to crest leapt out of the windward murky gray and in unending procession rushed upon the elsinore one moment overtoppling her slender frailness the next moment splashing a hundred tons of water on her deck and flinging her skyward as they passed beneath and foamed and crested from sight in the murky gray to leeward  and the great albatrosses veered and circled about us beating up into the bitter violence of the gale and sweeping grandly away before it far faster than it blew  margaret forbore from looking to challenge me with eloquent questioning eyes  with numb fingers inside my thick mitten i drew aside the ear flap of her souwester and shouted  it is nothing new  i have been here before  in the lives of all my fathers have i been here  the frost is on my cheek the salt bites my nostrils the wind chants in my ears and it is an old happening  i know now that my forbears were vikings  i was seed of them in their own day  with them i have raided english coasts dared the pillars of hercules forayed the mediterranean and sat in the high place of government over the soft sunwarm peoples  i am hengist and horsa i am of the ancient heroes even legendary to them  i have bearded and bitten the frozen seas and aforetime of that ere ever the iceages came to be i have dripped my shoulders in reindeer gore slain the mastodon and the sabretooth scratched the record of my prowess on the walls of deep buried cavesay and suckled shewolves side by side with my brother cubs the scars of whose fangs are now upon me  she laughed deliciously and a snowsquall drove upon us and cut our cheeks and the elsinore flung over and down as if she would never rise again while we held on and swept through the air in a dizzying arc margaret released a hand still laughing and pressed aside my earflap  i dont know anything about it she cried  it sounds like poetry  but i believe it  it has to be for it has been  i have heard it aforetime when skinclad men sang in firecircles that pressed back the frost and night  and the books she queried maliciously as we prepared to descend  they can go hang along with all the brainsick worldsick fools that wrote them i replied  again she laughed deliciously though the wind tore the sound away as she swung out into space muscled herself by her arms while she caught footholds beneath her which she could not see and passed out of my sight under the perilous overhang of the top     chapter xxxv   what price tobacco was mr mellaires greeting when i came on deck this morning bruised and weary aching in every bone and muscle from sixty hours of being tossed about  the wind had fallen to a dead calm toward morning and the elsinore her several spread sails booming and slatting rolled more miserably than ever  mr mellaire pointed forard of our starboard beam  i could make out a bleak land of white and jagged peaks  staten island the easterly end of it said mr mellaire  and i knew that we were in the position of a vessel just rounding staten island preliminary to bucking the horn  and yet four days ago we had run through the straits of le maire and stolen along toward the horn three days ago we had been well abreast of the horn and even a few miles past  and here we were now starting all over again and far in the rear of where we had originally started        the condition of the men is truly wretched  during the gale the forecastle was washed out twice  this means that everything in it was afloat and that every article of clothing including mattresses and blankets is wet and will remain wet in this bitter weather until we are around the horn and well up in the goodweather latitudes  the same is true of the midshiphouse  every room in it with the exception of the cooks and the sailmakers which open forard on number two hatch is soaking  and they have no fires in their rooms with which to dry things out  i peeped into charles daviss room  it was terrible  he grinned to me and nodded his head  its just as well osullivan wasnt here sir he said  hed adrowned in the lower bunk  and i want to tell you i was doing some swimmin before i could get into the top one  and salt waters bad for my sores  i oughtnt to be in a hole like this in cape horn weather look at the ice there on the floor  its below freezin right now in this room and my blankets are wet and im a sick man as any man can tell thats got a nose  if youd been decent to the mate you might have got decent treatment in return i said  huh he sneered  you neednt think you can lose me sir  i can grow fat on this sort of stuff  why sir when i think of the court doins in seattle i just couldnt die  an if youll listen to me sir youll cover the stewards money  you cant lose  im advisin you sir because youre a sort of decent sort  anybody that bets on my going over the side is a sure loser  how could you dare ship on a voyage like this in your condition i demanded  condition he queried with a fine assumption of innocence  why that is why i did ship  i was in tiptop shape when i sailed  all this come out on me afterward  you remember seem me aloft an up to my neck in water  and i trimmed coal below too  a sick man couldnt do it  and remember sir youll have to testify to how i did my duty at the beginning before i took down  ill bet with you myself if you think im goin to die he called after me  already the sailors show marks of the hardship they are enduring  it is surprising in so short a time how lean their faces have grown how lined and seamed  they must dry their underclothing with their body heat  their outer garments under their oilskins are soggy  and yet paradoxically despite their lean drawn faces they have grown very stout  their walk is a waddle and they bulge with seaming corpulency this is due to the amount of clothing they have on  i noticed larry to day had on two vests two coats and an overcoat with his oilskin outside of that  they are elephantine in their gait for in addition to everything else they have wrapped their feet outside their seaboots with gunny sacking  it is cold although the deck thermometer stood at thirtythree today at noon  i had wada weigh the clothing i wear on deck  omitting oilskins and boots it came to eighteen pounds  and yet i am not any too warm in all this gear when the wind is blowing  how sailors after having once experienced the horn can ever sign on again for a voyage around is beyond me  it but serves to show how stupid they must be  i feel sorry for henry the trainingship boy  he is more my own kind and some day he will make a henchman of the afterguard and a mate like mr pike  in the meantime along with buckwheat the other boy who berths in the midshiphouse with him he suffers the same hardship as the men  he is very fairskinned and i noticed this afternoon when he was pulling on a brace that the sleeves of his oilskins assisted by the salt water have chafed his wrists till they are raw and bleeding and breaking out in seaboils  mr mellaire tells me that in another week there will be a plague of these boils with all hands forard  when do you think well be up with the horn again i innocently queried of mr pike  he turned upon me in a rage as if i had insulted him and positively snarled in my face ere he swung away without the courtesy of an answer it is evident that he takes the sea seriously  that is why i fancy he is so excellent a seaman        the days passif the interval of sombre gray that comes between the darknesses can be called day  for a week now we have not seen the sun our ships position in this waste of storm and sea is conjectural  once by dead reckoning we gained up with the horn and a hundred miles south of it  and then came another souwest gale that tore our foretopsail and brand new spencer out of the beltropes and swept us away to a conjectured longitude east of staten island  oh i know now this great west wind that blows for ever around the world south of 55  and i know why the chartmakers have capitalized it as for instance when i read the great west wind drift  and i know why the sailing directions advise whatever you do make westing make westing  and the west wind and the drift of the west wind will not permit the elsinore to make westing  gale follows gale always from the west and we make easting  and it is bitter cold and each gale snorts up with a prelude of driving snow  in the cabin the lamps burn all day long  no more does mr pike run the phonograph nor does margaret ever touch the piano  she complains of being bruised and sore  i have a wrenched shoulder from being hurled against the wall  and both wada and the steward are limping  really the only comfort i can find is in my bunk so wedged with boxes and pillows that the wildest rolls cannot throw me out  there save for my meals and for an occasional run on deck for exercise and fresh air i lie and read eighteen and nineteen hours out of the twentyfour  but the unending physical strain is very wearisome  how it must be with the poor devils forard is beyond conceiving  the forecastle has been washed out several times and everything is soaking wet  besides they have grown weaker and two watches are required to do what one ordinary watch could do  thus they must spend as many hours on the seaswept deck and aloft on the freezing yards as i do in my warm dry bunk  wada tells me that they never undress but turn into their wet bunks in their oilskins and seaboots and wet undergarments  to look at them crawling about on deck or in the rigging is enough  they are truly weak  they are gauntcheeked and haggardgray of skin with great dark circles under their eyes  the predicted plague of seaboils and seacuts has come and their hands and wrists and arms are frightfully afflicted  now one and now another and sometimes several either from being knocked down by seas or from general miserableness take to the bunk for a day or so off  this means more work for the others so that the men on their feet are not tolerant of the sick ones and a man must be very sick to escape being dragged out to work by his mates  i cannot but marvel at andy fay and mulligan jacobs  old and fragile as they are it seems impossible that they can endure what they do  for that matter i cannot understand why they work at all  i cannot understand why any of them toil on and obey an order in this freezing hell of the horn  is it because of fear of death that they do not cease work and bring death to all of us  or is it because they are slavebeasts with a slavepsychology so used all their lives to being driven by their masters that it is beyond their mental power to refuse to obey  and yet most of them in a week after we reach seattle will be on board other ships outward bound for the horn  margaret says the reason for this is that sailors forget  mr pike agrees  he says give them a week in the southeast trades as we run up the pacific and they will have forgotten that they have ever been around the horn  i wonder  can they be as stupid as this  does pain leave no record with them  do they fear only the immediate thing  have they no horizons wider than a day  then indeed do they belong where they are  they are cowardly  this was shown conclusively this morning at two oclock  never have i witnessed such panic fear and it was fear of the immediate thingfear stupid and beastlike  it was mr mellaires watch  as luck would have it i was reading boass mind of primitive man when i heard the rush of feet over my head  the elsinore was hove to on the port tack at the time under very short canvas  i was wondering what emergency had brought the watch upon the poop when i heard another rush of feet that meant the second watch  i heard no pulling and hauling and the thought of mutiny flashed across my mind  still nothing happened and growing curious i got into my seaboots sheepskin coat and oilskin put on my souwester and mittens and went on deck  mr pike had already dressed and was ahead of me  captain west who in this bad weather sleeps in the chartroom stood in the lee doorway of the house through which the lamplight streamed on the frightened faces of the men  those of the midshiphouse were not present but every man jack of the forecastle with the exception of andy fay and mulligan jacobs as i afterwards learned had joined in the flight aft  andy fay who belonged in the watch below had calmly remained in his bunk while mulligan jacobs had taken advantage of the opportunity to sneak into the forecastle and fill his pipe  what is the matter mr pike captain west asked  before the mate could reply bert rhine snickered  the devils come aboard sir  but his snicker was palpably an assumption of unconcern he did not possess  the more i think over it the more i am surprised that such keen men as the gangsters should have been frightened by what had occurred but frightened they were the three of them out of their bunks and out of the precious surcease of their brief watch below  so fearstruck was larry that he chattered and grimaced like an ape and shouldered and struggled to get away from the dark and into the safety of the shaft of light that shone out of the charthouse  tony the greek was just as bad mumbling to himself and continually crossing himself  he was joined in this as a sort of chorus by the two italians guido bombini and mike cipriani  arthur deacon was almost in collapse and he and chantz the jew shamelessly clung to each other for support  bob the fat and overgrown youth was sobbing while the other youth bony the splinter was shivering and chattering his teeth  yes and the two best sailors forard tom spink and the maltese cockney stood in the background their backs to the dark their faces yearning toward the light  more than all other contemptible things in this world there are two that i loathe and despise hysteria in a woman fear and cowardice in a man the first turns me to ice  i cannot sympathize with hysteria  the second turns my stomach  cowardice in a man is to me positively nauseous  and this fearsmitten mass of human animals on our reeling poop raised my gorge  truly had i been a god at that moment i should have annihilated the whole mass of them  no i should have been merciful to one  he was the faun  his bright painliquid and flashingeager eyes strained from face to face with desire to understand  he did not know what had occurred and being stonedeaf had thought the rush aft a response to a call for all hands  i noticed mr mellaire  he may be afraid of mr pike and he is a murderer but at any rate he has no fear of the supernatural  with two men above him in authority although it was his watch there was no call for him to do anything  he swayed back and forth in balance to the violent motions of the elsinore and looked on with eyes that were amused and cynical  what does the devil look like my man captain west asked  bert rhine grinned sheepishly  answer the captain mr pike snarled at him  oh it was murder sheer murder that leapt into the gangsters eyes for the instant in acknowledgment of the snarl  then he replied to captain west  i didnt wait to see sir  but its one whale of a devil  hes as big as a elephant sir volunteered bill quigley  i seenm face to face sir  he almost got me when i run out of the focsle  oh lord sir larry moaned  the way he hit the house sir  it was the call to judgment  your theology is mixed my man captain west smiled quietly though i could not help seeing how tired was his face and how tired were his wonderful samurai eyes  he turned to the mate  mr pike will you please go forard and interview this devil  fasten him up and tie him down and ill take a look at him in the morning  yes sir said mr pike and kiplings line came to me     woman man or god or devil was there anything we feared  and as i went forard through the wall of darkness after mr pike and mr mellaire along the freezing slender seaswept bridgenot a sailor dared to accompany usother lines of the galley slave drifted through my brain such as     our bulkheads bulged with cotton and our masts were stepped in gold    we ran a mighty merchandise of niggers in the hold     and     by the brand upon my shoulder by the gall of clinging steel    by the welts the whips have left me by the scars that never heal      and     battered chaingangs of the orlop grizzled draughts of years gone by         and i caught my great radiant vision of mr pike galley slave of the race and a driver of men under men greater than he the faithful henchman the able sailorman battered and grizzled branded and galled the servant of the sweephead that made mastery of the sea  i know him now  he can never again offend me  i forgive him everythingthe whiskey raw on his breath the day i came aboard at baltimore his moroseness when sea and wind do not favour his savagery to the men his snarl and his sneer  on top the midshiphouse we got a ducking that makes me shiver to recall  i had dressed too hastily properly to fasten my oilskin about my neck so that i was wet to the skin  we crossed the next span of bridge through driving spray and were well upon the top of the forardhouse when something adrift on the deck hit the forard wall a terrific smash  whatever it is its playing the devil mr pike yelled in my ear as he endeavoured to locate the thing by the drybattery lightstick which he carried  the pencil of light travelled over dark water white with foam that churned upon the deck  there it goes mr pike cried as the elsinore dipped by the head and hurtled the water forard  the light went out as the three of us caught holds and crouched to a deluge of water from overside  as we emerged from under the forecastle head we heard a tremendous thumping and battering  then as the bow lifted for an instant in the pencil of light that immediately lost it i glimpsed a vague black object that bounded down the inclined deck where no water was  what became of it we could not see  mr pike descended to the deck followed by mr mellaire  again as the elsinore dipped by the head and fetched a surge of seawater from aft along the runway i saw the dark object bound forard directly at the mates  they sprang to safety from its charge the light went out while another icy sea broke aboard  for a time i could see nothing of the two men  next in the light flashed from the stick i guessed that mr pike was in pursuit of the thing  he evidently must have captured it at the rail against the starboard rigging and caught a turn around it with a loose end of rope as the vessel rolled to windward some sort of a struggle seemed to be going on  the second mate sprang to the mates assistance and together with more loose ends they seemed to subdue the thing  i descended to see  by the lightstick we made it out to be a large barnaclecrusted cask  shes been afloat for forty years was mr pikes judgment  look at the size of the barnacles and look at the whiskers  and its full of something said mr mellaire  hope it isnt water  i rashly lent a hand when they started to work the cask forard between seas and taking advantage of the rolls and pitches to the shelter under the forecastlehead  as a result even through my mittens i was cut by the sharp edges of broken shell  its liquor of some sort said the mate but we wont risk broaching it till morning  but where did it come from i asked  over the sides the only place it could have come from  mr pike played the light over it  look at it  its been afloat for years and years  the stuff ought to be wellseasoned commented mr mellaire  leaving them to lash the cask securely i stole along the deck to the forecastle and peered in  the men in their headlong flight had neglected to close the doors and the place was afloat  in the flickering light from a small and very smoky sealamp it was a dismal picture  no selfrespecting caveman i am sure would have lived in such a hole  even as i looked a bursting sea filled the runway between the house and rail and through the doorway in which i stood the freezing water rushed waistdeep  i had to hold on to escape being swept inside the room  from a top bunk lying on his side andy fay regarded me steadily with his bitter blue eyes  seated on the rough table of heavy planks his sea booted feet swinging in the water mulligan jacobs pulled at his pipe when he observed me he pointed to pulpy bookpages that floated about  me librarys gone to hell he mourned as he indicated the flotsam theres me byron  an there goes zola an browning with a piece of shakespeare runnin neck an neck an whats left of antichrist makin a bad last  an theres carlyle and zola that cheek by jowl you cant tell em apart  here the elsinore lay down to starboard and the water in the forecastle poured out against my legs and hips  my wet mittens slipped on the iron work and i swept down the runway into the scuppers where i was turned over and over by another flood that had just boarded from windward  i know i was rather confused and that i had swallowed quite a deal of salt water ere i got my hands on the rungs of the ladder and climbed to the top of the house  on my way aft along the bridge i encountered the crew coming forard  mr mellaire and mr pike were talking in the lee of the charthouse and inside as i passed below captain west was smoking a cigar  after a good rub down in dry pyjamas i was scarcely back in my bunk with the mind of primitive man before me when the stampede over my head was repeated  i waited for the second rush  it came and i proceeded to dress  the scene on the poop duplicated the previous one save that the men were more excited more frightened  they were babbling and chattering all together  shut up mr pike was snarling when i came upon them  one at a time and answer the captains question  it aint no barrel this time sir tom spink said  its alive  an if it aint the devil its the ghost of a drownded man  i see m plain an clear  hes a man or was a man once  they was two of em sir richard giller one of the bricklayers broke in  i think he looked like petro marinkovich sir tom spink went on  an the other was jesperseni seen m giller added  they was three of em sir said nosey murphy  osullivan sir was the other one  they aint devils sir  theyre drownded men  they come aboard right over the bows an they moved slow like drownded men sorensen seen the first one first  he caught my arm an pointed an then i seen m  he was on top the forardhouse  and olansen seen m an deacon sir an hackey  we all seen m sir    an the second one an when the rest run away i stayed long enough to see the third one  mebbe theres more  i didnt wait to see  captain west stopped the man  mr pike he said wearily will you straighten this nonsense out  yes sir mr pike responded then turned on the man  come on all of you  theres three devils to tie down this time  but the men shrank away from the order and from him  for two cents     i heard mr pike growl to himself then choke off utterance  he flung about on his heel and started for the bridge  in the same order as on the previous trip mr mellaire second and i bringing up the rear we followed  it was a similar journey save that we caught a ducking midway on the first span of bridge as well as a ducking on the midship house  we halted on top the forardhouse  in vain mr pike flashed his light stick  nothing was to be seen nor heard save the whiteflecked dark water on our deck the roar of the gale in our rigging and the crash and thunder of seas falling aboard  we advanced halfway across the last span of bridge to the forecastle head and were driven to pause and hang on at the foremast by a bursting sea  between the drives of spray mr pike flashed his stick  i heard him exclaim something  then he went on to the forecastlehead followed by mr mellaire while i waited by the foremast clinging tight and endured another ducking  through the emergencies i could see the pencil of light appearing and disappearing darting here and there  several minutes later the mates were back with me  half our headgears carried away mr pike told me  we must have run into something  i felt a jar right after you went below sir last time said mr mellaire  only i thought it was a thump of sea  so did i feel it the mate agreed  i was just taking off my boots  i thought it was a sea  but where are the three devils  broaching the cask the second mate suggested  we made the forecastlehead descended the iron ladder and went forard inside underneath out of the wind and sea  there lay the cask securely lashed  the size of the barnacles on it was astonishing  they were as large as apples and inches deep  a downfling of bow brought a foot of water about our boots and as the bow lifted and the water drained away it drew out from the shellcrusted cask streamers of seaweed a foot or so in length  led by mr pike and watching our chance between seas we searched the deck and rails between the forecastlehead and the forardhouse and found no devils  the mate stepped into the forecastle doorway and his lightstick cut like a dagger through the dim illumination of the murky sealamp  and we saw the devils  nosey murphy had been right  there were three of them  let me give the picture a drenched and freezing room of rusty paint scabbed iron lowroofed doubletiered with bunks reeking with the filth of thirty men despite the washing of the sea  in a top bunk on his side in seaboots and oilskins staring steadily with blue bitter eyes andy fay on the table pulling at a pipe with hanging legs dragged this way and that by the churn of water mulligan jacobs solemnly regarding three men seabooted and bloody who stand side by side of a height and not duly tall swaying in unison to the elsinores downflinging and uplifting  but such men  i know my east side and my east end and i am accustomed to the faces of all the ruck of races yet with these three men i was at fault  the mediterranean had surely never bred such a breed nor had scandinavia  they were not blonds  they were not brunettes  nor were they of the brown or black or yellow  their skin was white under a bronze of weather  wet as was their hair it was plainly a colourless sandy hair  yet their eyes were darkand yet not dark  they were neither blue nor gray nor green nor hazel  nor were they black  they were topaz pale topaz and they gleamed and dreamed like the eyes of great cats  they regarded us like walkers in a dream these palehaired stormwaifs with pale topaz eyes  they did not bow they did not smile in no way did they recognize our presence save that they looked at us and dreamed  but andy fay greeted us  its a hell of a night an not a wink of sleep with these goingson he said  now where did they blow in from a night like this mulligan jacobs complained  youve got a tongue in your mouth mr pike snarled  why aint you asked em  as though you didnt know i could use the tongue in me mouth you old stiff jacobs snarled back  but it was no time for their private feud  mr pike turned on the dreaming newcomers and addressed them in the mangled and aborted phrases of a dozen languages such as the worldwandering anglosaxon has had every opportunity to learn but is too stubbornbrained and wilfulmouthed to wrap his tongue about  the visitors made no reply  they did not even shake their heads  their faces remained peculiarly relaxed and placid incurious and pleasant while in their eyes floated profounder dreams  yet they were human  the blood of their injuries stained them and clotted on their clothes  dutchmen snorted mr pike with all due contempt for other breeds as he waved them to make themselves at home in any of the bunks  mr pikes ethnology is narrow  outside his own race he is aware of only three races niggers dutchmen and dagoes  again our visitors proved themselves human  they understood the mates invitation and glancing first at one another they climbed into three topbunks and closed their eyes  i could swear the first of them was asleep in half a minute  well have to clean up forard or well be having the sticks about our ears the mate said already starting to depart  get the men along mr mellaire and call out the carpenter     chapter xxxvi   and no westing  we have been swept back three degrees of casting since the night our visitors came on board  they are the great mystery these three men of the sea  horn gypsies margaret calls them and mr pike dubs them dutchmen  one thing is certain they have a language of their own which they talk with one another  but of our hotchpotch of nationalities fore and aft there is no person who catches an inkling of their language or nationality  mr mellaire raised the theory that they were finns of some sort but this was indignantly denied by our bigfooted youth of a carpenter who swears he is a finn himself  louis the cook avers that somewhere over the world on some forgotten voyage he has encountered men of their type but he can neither remember the voyage nor their race  he and the rest of the asiatics accept their presence as a matter of course but the crew with the exception of andy fay and mulligan jacobs is very superstitious about the newcomers and will have nothing to do with them  no good will come of them sir tom spink at the wheel told us shaking his head forebodingly  margarets mittened hand rested on my arm as we balanced to the easy roll of the ship  we had paused from our promenade which we now take each day religiously as a constitutional between eleven and twelve  why what is the matter with them she queried nudging me privily in warning of what was coming  because they aint men miss as we can rightly call men  they aint regular men  it was a bit irregular their manner of coming on board she gurgled  thats just it miss tom spink exclaimed brightening perceptibly at the hint of understanding  whered they come from  they wont tell  of course they wont tell  they aint men  theyre spiritsghosts of sailors that drowned as long ago as when that cask went adrift from a sinkin ship an thats years an years miss as anybody can see lookin at the size of the barnacles on it  do you think so margaret queried  we all think so miss  we aint spent our lives on the sea for nothin theres no end of landsmen dont believe in the flyin dutchman  but what do they know  theyre just landsmen aint they  they aint never had their leg grabbed by a ghost such as i had on the kathleen thirtyfive years ago down in the hole tween the watercasks  an didnt that ghost rip the shoe right off of me  an didnt i fall through the hatch two days later an break my shoulder  now miss i seen em makin signs to mr pike that wed run into their ship hove to on the other tack  dont you believe it  there wasnt no ship  but how do you explain the carrying away of our headgear i demanded  theres lots of things cant be explained sir was tom spinks answer who can explain the way the finns plays tomfool tricks with the weather  yet everybody knows it  why are we havin a hard passage around the horn sir  i ask you that  why sir  i shook my head  because of the carpenter sir  weve found out hes a finn  why did he keep it quiet all the way down from baltimore  why did he tell it margaret challenged  he didnt tell it missleastways not until after them three others boarded us  i got my suspicions he knows more about m than hes lettin on  an look at the weather an the delay were gettin  an dont everybody know the finns is regular warlocks an weatherbreeders  my ears pricked up  where did you get that word warlock i questioned  tom spink looked puzzled  whats wrong with it sir he asked  nothing  its all right  but where did you get it  i never got it sir  i always had it  thats what finns iswarlocks  and these three newcomersthey arent finns asked margaret  the old englishman shook his head solemnly  no miss  theyre drownded sailors a long time drownded  all you have to do is look at m  an the carpenter could tell us a few if he was minded        nevertheless our mysterious visitors are a welcome addition to our weakened crew  i watch them at work  they are strong and willing  mr pike says they are real sailormen even if he doesnt understand their lingo  his theory is that they are from some small oldcountry or outlander ship which hove to on the opposite tack to the elsinore was run down and sunk  i have forgotten to say that we found the barnacled cask nearly filled with a most delicious wine which none of us can name  as soon as the gale moderated mr pike had the cask brought aft and broached and now the steward and wada have it all in bottles and spare demijohns  it is beautifully aged and mr pike is certain that it is some sort of a mild and unheardof brandy  mr mellaire merely smacks his lips over it while captain west margaret and i steadfastly maintain that it is wine  the condition of the men grows deplorable  they were always poor at pulling on ropes but now it takes two or three to pull as much as one used to pull  one thing in their favour is that they are well though grossly fed  they have all they want to eat such as it is but it is the cold and wet the terrible condition of the forecastle the lack of sleep and the almost continuous toil of both watches on deck  either watch is so weak and worthless that any severe task requires the assistance of the other watch  as an instance we finally managed a reef in the foresail in the thick of a gale  it took both watches two hours yet mr pike tells me that under similar circumstances with an average crew of the old days he has seen a single watch reef the foresail in twenty minutes  i have learned one of the prime virtues of a steel sailingship  such a craft heavily laden does not strain her seams open in bad weather and big seas  except for a tiny leak down in the forepeak with which we sailed from baltimore and which is bailed out with a pail once in several weeks the elsinore is bonedry  mr pike tells me that had a wooden ship of her size and cargo gone through the buffeting we have endured she would be leaking like a sieve  and mr mellaire out of his own experience has added to my respect for the horn  when he was a young man he was once eight weeks in making around from 50 in the atlantic to 50 in the pacific  another time his vessel was compelled to put back twice to the falklands for repairs  and still another time in a wooden ship running back in distress to the falklands his vessel was lost in a shift of gale in the very entrance to port stanley  as he told me  and after wed been there a month sir who should come in but the old lucy powers  she was a sighther foremast clean gone out of her and half her spars the old man killed from one of the spars falling on him the mate with two broken arms the second mate sick and what was left of the crew at the pumps  wed lost our ship so my skipper took charge refitted her doubled up both crews and we headed the other way around pumping two hours in every watch clear to honolulu  the poor wretched chickens  because of their illjudged moulting they are quite featherless  it is a marvel that one of them survives yet so far we have lost only six  margaret keeps the kerosene stove going and though they have ceased laying she confidently asserts that they are all layers and that we shall have plenty of eggs once we get fine weather in the pacific  there is little use to describe these monotonous and perpetual westerly gales  one is very like another and they follow so fast on one anothers heels that the sea never has a chance to grow calm  so long have we rolled and tossed about that the thought say of a solid unmoving billiardtable is inconceivable  in previous incarnations i have encountered things that did not move but    they were in previous incarnations  we have been up to the diego ramirez rocks twice in the past ten days  at the present moment by vague dead reckoning we are two hundred miles east of them  we have been hove down to our hatches three times in the last week  we have had six stout sails of the heaviest canvas furled and doublegasketed torn loose and stripped from the yards  sometimes so weak are our men not more than half of them can respond to the call for all hands  lars jacobson who had his leg broken early in the voyage was knocked down by a sea several days back and had the leg rebroken  ditman olansen the crankeyed norwegian went berserker last night in the second dogwatch and pretty well cleaned out his half of the forecastle wada reports that it required the bricklayers fitzgibbon and gilder the maltese cockney and steve roberts the cowboy finally to subdue the madman  these are all men of mr mellaires watch  in mr pikes watch john hackey the san francisco hoodlum who has stood out against the gangsters has at last succumbed and joined them  and only this morning mr pike dragged charles davis by the scruff of the neck out of the forecastle where he had caught him expounding sealaw to the miserable creatures  mr mellaire i notice on occasion remains unduly intimate with the gangster clique  and yet nothing serious happens  and charles davis does not die  he seems actually to be gaining in weight  he never misses a meal  from the break of the poop in the shelter of the weather cloth our decks a thunder and rush of freezing water i often watch him slip out of his room between seas mug and plate in hand and hobble forard to the galley for his food  he is a keen judge of the ships motions for never yet have i seen him get a serious ducking  sometimes of course he may get splattered with spray or wet to the knees but he manages to be out of the way whenever a big graybeard falls on board     chapter xxxvii   a wonderful event today  for five minutes at noon the sun was actually visible  but such a suna pale and cold and sickly orb that at meridian was only 90 degrees 18 minutes above the horizon  and within the hour we were taking in sail and lying down to the snowgusts of a fresh southwest gale  whatever you do make westing make westingthis sailing rule of the navigators for the horn has been bitten out of iron  i can understand why shipmasters with a favouring slant of wind have left sailors fallen overboard to drown without heavingto to lower a boat cape horn is iron and it takes masters of iron to win around from east to west  and we make easting  this west wind is eternal  i listen incredulously when mr pike or mr mellaire tells of times when easterly winds have blown in these latitudes  it is impossible  always does the west wind blow gale upon gale and gales everlasting else why the great west wind drift printed on the charts  we of the afterguard are weary of this eternal buffeting  our men have become pulpy washedout sorecorroded shadows of men  i should not be surprised in the end to see captain west turn tail and run eastward around the world to seattle  but margaret smiles with surety and nods her head and affirms that her father will win around to 50 in the pacific  how charles davis survives in that wet freezing paintscabbed room of iron in the midshiphouse is beyond mejust as it is beyond me that the wretched sailors in the wretched forecastle do not lie down in their bunks and die or at least refuse to answer the call of the watches  another week has passed and we are today by observation sixty miles due south of the straits of le maire and we are hoveto in a driving gale on the port tack  the glass is down to 2858 and even mr pike acknowledges that it is one of the worst cape horn snorters he has ever experienced  in the old days the navigators used to strive as far south as 64 degrees or 65 degrees into the antarctic drift ice hoping in a favouring spell to make westing at a prodigious rate across the extremenarrowing wedges of longitude  but of late years all shipmasters have accepted the hugging of the land all the way around  out of ten times ten thousand passages of cape stiff from east to west this they have concluded is the best strategy  so captain west hugs the land  he heavesto on the port tack until the leeward drift brings the land into perilous proximity then wears ship and heavesto on the port tack and makes leeway off shore  i may be weary of all this bitter movement of a labouring ship on a frigid sea but at the same time i do not mind it  in my brain burns the flame of a great discovery and a great achievement  i have found what makes all the books go glimmering i have achieved what my very philosophy tells me is the greatest achievement a man can make  i have found the love of woman  i do not know whether she cares for me  nor is that the point  the point is that in myself i have risen to the greatest height to which the human male animal can rise  i know a woman and her name is margaret  she is margaret a woman and desirable  my blood is red  i am not the pallid scholar i so proudly deemed myself to be  i am a man and a lover despite the books  as for de casseresif ever i get back to new york equipped as i now am i shall confute him with the same ease that he has confuted all the schools  love is the final word  to the rational man it alone gives the superrational sanction for living  like bergson in his overhanging heaven of intuition or like one who has bathed in pentecostal fire and seen the new jerusalem so i have trod the materialistic dictums of science underfoot scaled the last peak of philosophy and leaped into my heaven which after all is within myself  the stuff that composes me that is i is so made that it finds its supreme realization in the love of woman  it is the vindication of being  yes and it is the wages of being the payment in full for all the brittleness and frailty of flesh and breath  and she is only a woman like any woman and the lord knows i know what women are  and i know margaret for what she ismere woman and yet i know in the lovers soul of me that she is somehow different  her ways are not as the ways of other women and all her ways are delightful to me  in the end i suppose i shall become a nestbuilder for of a surety nestbuilding is one of her pretty ways  and who shall say which is the worthierthe writing of a whole library or the building of a nest  the monotonous days bleak and gray and soggy cold drag by  it is now a month since we began the passage of the horn and here we are not so well forward as a month ago because we are something like a hundred miles south of the straits of le maire  even this position is conjectural being arrived at by dead reckoning based on the leeway of a ship hoveto now on the one tack now on the other with always the great west wind drift making against us  it is four days since our last instrumentsight of the sun  this stormvexed ocean has become populous  no ships are getting round and each day adds to our number  never a brief day passes without our sighting from two or three to a dozen hoveto on port tack or starboard tack  captain west estimates there must be at least two hundred sail of us  a ship hoveto with preventer tackles on the rudderhead is unmanageable  each night we take our chance of unavoidable and disastrous collision  and at times glimpsed through the snowsqualls we see and curse the ships eastbound that drive past us with the west wind and the west wind drift at their backs  and so wild is the mind of man that mr pike and mr mellaire still aver that on occasion they have known gales to blow ships from east to west around the horn  it surely has been a year since we of the elsinore emerged from under the lee of tierra del fuego into the snorting southwest gales  a century at least has elapsed since we sailed from baltimore        and i dont give a snap of my fingers for all the wrath and fury of this dimgray sea at the tip of the earth  i have told margaret that i love her  the tale was told in the shelter of the weather cloth where we clung together in the second dogwatch last evening  and it was told again and by both of us in the brightlighted chartroom after the watches had been changed at eight bells  yes and her face was storm bright and all of her was very proud save that her eyes were warm and soft and fluttered with lids that just would flutter maidenly and womanly  it was a great hourour great hour  a poor devil of a man is most lucky when loving he is loved  grievous indeed must be the fate of the lover who is unloved  and i for one and for still other reasons congratulate myself upon the vastitude of my good fortune  for see were margaret any other sort of a woman were she    well just the lovely and lovable and adorably snuggly sort who seem made just precisely for love and loving and nestling into the strong arms of a manwhy there wouldnt be anything remarkable or wonderful about her loving me  but margaret is margaret strong selfpossessed serene controlled a very mistress of herself  and theres the miraclethat such a woman should have been awakened to love by me  it is almost unbelievable  i go out of my way to get another peep into those long cool gray eyes of hers and see them grow melting soft as she looks at me  she is no juliet thank the lord and thank the lord i am no romeo  and yet i go up alone on the freezing poop and under my breath chant defiantly at the snorting gale and at the graybeards thundering down on us that i am a lover  and i send messages to the lonely albatrosses veering through the murk that i am a lover  and i look at the wretched sailors crawling along the sprayswept bridge and know that never in ten thousand wretched lives could they experience the love i experience and i wonder why god ever made them        and the one thing i had firmly resolved from the start margaret confessed to me this morning in the cabin when i released her from my arms was that i would not permit you to make love to me  true daughter of herodias i gaily gibed so such was the drift of your thoughts even as early as the very start  already you were looking upon me with a considerative female eye  she laughed proudly and did not reply  what possibly could have led you to expect that i would make love to you i insisted  because it is the way of young male passengers on long voyages she replied  then others have      they always do she assured me gravely  and at that instant i knew the first ridiculous pang of jealousy but i laughed it away and retorted  it was an ancient chinese philosopher who is first recorded as having said what doubtlessly the cave men before him gibbered namely that a woman pursues a man by fluttering away in advance of him  wretch she cried  i never fluttered  when did i ever flutter  it is a delicate subject     i began with assumed hesitancy  when did i ever flutter she demanded  i availed myself of one of schopenhauers ruses by making a shift  from the first you observed nothing that a female could afford to miss observing i charged  ill wager you knew as quickly as i the very instant when i first loved you  i knew the first time you hated me she evaded  yes i know the first time i saw you and learned that you were coming on the voyage i said  but now i repeat my challenge  you knew as quickly as i the first instant i loved you  oh her eyes were beautiful and the repose and certitude of her were tremendous as she rested her hand on my arm for a moment and in a low quiet voice said  yes i    i think i know  it was the morning of that pampero off the plate when you were thrown through the door into my fathers stateroom i saw it in your eyes  i knew it  i think it was the first time the very instant  i could only nod my head and draw her close to me  and she looked up at me and added  you were very ridiculous  there you sat on the bed holding on with one hand and nursing the other hand under your arm staring at me irritated startled utterly foolish and then    how i dont know    i knew that you had just come to know      and the very next instant you froze up i charged ungallantly  and that was why she admitted shamelessly then leaned away from me her hands resting on my shoulders while she gurgled and her lips parted from over her beautiful white teeth  one thing i john pathurst know that gurgling laughter of hers is the most adorable laughter that was ever heard     chapter xxxviii   i wonder  i wonder  did the samurai make a mistake  or was it the darkness of oncoming death that chilled and clouded that starcool brain of his and made a mock of all his wisdom  or was it the blunder that brought death upon him beforehand  i do not know i shall never know for it is a matter no one of us dreams of hinting at much less discussing  i shall begin at the beginningyesterday afternoon  for it was yesterday afternoon five weeks to a day since we emerged from the straits of le maire into this gray stormocean that once again we found ourselves hove to directly off the horn  at the changing of the watches at four oclock captain west gave the command to mr pike to wear ship we were on the starboard tack at the time making leeway off shore  this manoeuvre placed us on the port tack and the consequent leeway to me seemed on shore though at an acute angle to be sure  in the chartroom glancing curiously at the chart i measured the distance with my eye and decided that we were in the neighbourhood of fifteen miles off cape horn  with our drift well be close up under the land by morning wont we i ventured tentatively  yes captain west nodded and if it werent for the west wind drift and if the land did not trend to the northeast wed be ashore by morning  as it is well be well under it at daylight ready to steal around if there is a change ready to wear ship if there is no change  it did not enter my head to question his judgment  what he said had to be  was he not the samurai  and yet a few minutes later when he had gone below i noticed mr pike enter the charthouse  after several paces up and down and a brief pause to watch nancy and several men shift the weather cloth from lee to weather i strolled aft to the charthouse  prompted by i know not what i peeped through one of the glass ports  there stood mr pike his souwester doffed his oilskins streaming rivulets to the floor while he dividers and parallel rulers in hand bent over the chart  it was the expression of his face that startled me the habitual sourness had vanished  all that i could see was anxiety and apprehension    yes and age  i had never seen him look so old for there at that moment i beheld the wastage and weariness of all his sixtynine years of seabattling and seastaring  i slipped away from the port and went along the deck to the break of the poop where i held on and stood staring through the gray and spray in the conjectural direction of our drift  somewhere there in the northeast and north i knew was a broken iron coast of rocks upon which the graybeards thundered  and there in the chartroom a redoubtable sailorman bent anxiously over a chart as he measured and calculated and measured and calculated again our position and our drift  and i knew it could not be  it was not the samurai but the henchman who was weak and wrong  age was beginning to tell upon him at last which could not be otherwise than expected when one considered that no man in ten thousand had weathered age so successfully as he  i laughed at my moments qualm of foolishness and went below well content to meet my loved one and to rest secure in her fathers wisdom of course he was right  he had proved himself right too often already on the long voyage from baltimore  at dinner mr pike was quite distrait  he took no part whatever in the conversation and seemed always to be listening to something from withoutto the vexing clang of taut ropes that came down the hollow jiggermast to the muffled roar of the gale in the rigging to the smash and crash of the seas along our decks and against our iron walls  again i found myself sharing his apprehension although i was too discreet to question him then or afterwards alone about his trouble  at eight he went on deck again to take the watch till midnight and as i went to bed i dismissed all forebodings and speculated as to how many more voyages he could last after this sudden onslaught of old age  i fell asleep quickly and awoke at midnight my lamp still burning conrads mirror of the sea on my breast where it had dropped from my hands  i heard the watches change and was wide awake and reading when mr pike came below by the boobyhatch and passed down my hail by my open door on his way to his room  in the pause i had long since learned so well i knew he was rolling a cigarette  then i heard him cough as he always did when the cigarette was lighted and the first inhalation of smoke flushed his lungs  at twelvefifteen in the midst of conrads delightful chapter the weight of the burden i heard mr pike come along the hall  stealing a glance over the top of my book i saw him go by seabooted oilskinned souwestered  it was his watch below and his sleep was meagre in this perpetual bad weather yet he was going on deck  i read and waited for an hour but he did not return and i knew that somewhere up above he was staring into the driving dark  i dressed fully in all my heavy stormgear from seaboots and souwester to sheepskin under my oilskin coat  at the foot of the stairs i noted along the hall that margarets light was burning  i peeped inshe keeps her door open for ventilationand found her reading  merely not sleepy she assured me  nor in the heart of me do i believe she had any apprehension  she does not know even now i am confident the samurais blunderif blunder it was  as she said she was merely not sleepy although there is no telling in what occult ways she may have received though not recognized mr pikes anxiety  at the head of the stairs passing along the tiny hall to go out the lee door of the charthouse i glanced into the chartroom  on the couch lying on his back his head uncomfortably high i thought slept captain west  the room was warm from the ascending heat of the cabin so that he lay unblanketed fully dressed save for oilskins and boots  he breathed easily and steadily and the lean ascetic lines of his face seemed softened by the light of the lowturned lamp  and that one glance restored to me all my surety and faith in his wisdom so that i laughed at myself for having left my warm bed for a freezing trip on deck  under the weather cloth at the break of the poop i found mr mellaire  he was wide awake but under no strain  evidently it had not entered his mind to consider much less question the manoeuvre of wearing ship the previous afternoon  the gale is breaking he told me waving his mittened hand at a starry segment of sky momentarily exposed by the thinning clouds  but where was mr pike  did the second mate know he was on deck  i proceeded to feel mr mellaire out as we worked our way aft along the mad poop toward the wheel  i talked about the difficulty of sleeping in stormy weather stated the restlessness and semiinsomnia that the violent motion of the ship caused in me and raised the query of how bad weather affected the officers  i noticed captain west in the chartroom as i came up sleeping like a baby i concluded  we leaned in the lee of the charthouse and went no farther  trust us to sleep just the same way mr pathurst the second mate laughed  the harder the weather the harder the demand on us and the harder we sleep  im dead the moment my head touches the pillow  it takes mr pike longer because he always finishes his cigarette after he turns in  but he smokes while hes undressing so that he doesnt require more than a minute to go deado  ill wager he hasnt moved right now since ten minutes after twelve  so the second mate did not dream the first was even on deck  i went below to make sure  a small sealamp was burning in mr pikes room and i saw his bunk unoccupied  i went in by the big stove in the diningroom and warmed up then again came on deck  i did not go near the weather cloth where i was certain mr mellaire was but keeping along the lee of the poop i gained the bridge and started forard  i was in no hurry so i paused often in that cold wet journey  the gale was breaking for again and again the stars glimmered through the thinning stormclouds  on the midshiphouse was no mr pike  i crossed it stung by the freezing flying spray and carefully reconnoitred the top of the forardhouse where in such bad weather i knew the lookout was stationed  i was within twenty feet of them when a wider clearance of starry sky showed me the figures of the lookout whoever he was and of mr pike side by side  long i watched them not making my presence known and i knew that the old mates eyes were boring like gimlets into the windy darkness that separated the elsinore from the thundersurfed iron coast he sought to find  coming back to the poop i was caught by the surprised mr mellaire  thought you were asleep sir he chided  im too restless i explained  ive read until my eyes are tired and now im trying to get chilled so that i can fall asleep while warming up in my blankets  i envy you sir he answered  think of it  so much of all night in that you cannot sleep  some day if ever i make a lucky strike i shall make a voyage like this as a passenger and have all watches below  think of it  all blessed watches below  and i shall like you sir bring a jap servant along and ill make him call me at every changing of the watches so that wide awake i can appreciate my good fortune in the several minutes before i roll over and go to sleep again  we laughed good night to each other  another peep into the chartroom showed me captain west sleeping as before  he had not moved in general though all his body moved with every roll and fling of the ship  below margarets light still burned but a peep showed her asleep her book fallen from her hands just as was the so frequent case with my books  and i wondered  half the souls of us on the elsinore slept  the samurai slept  yet the old first mate who should have slept kept a bitter watch on the forardhouse  was his anxiety right  could it be right  or was it the crankiness of ultimate age  were we drifting and leewaying to destruction  or was it merely an old man being struck down by senility in the midst of his lifetask  too wide awake to think of sleeping i ensconced myself with the mirror of the sea at the diningtable  nor did i remove aught of my stormgear save the soggy mittens which i wrung out and hung to dry by the stove four bells struck and six bells and mr pike had not returned below  at eight bells with the changing of the watches it came upon me what a night of hardship the old mate was enduring  eight to twelve had been his own watch on deck  he had now completed the four hours of the second mates watch and was beginning his own watch which would last till eight in the morningtwelve consecutive hours in a cape horn gale with the mercury at freezing  nextfor i had dozedi heard loud cries above my head that were repeated along the poop  i did not know till afterwards that it was mr pikes command to hardup the helm passed along from forard by the men he had stationed at intervals on the bridge  all that i knew at this shock of waking was that something was happening above  as i pulled on my steaming mittens and hurried my best up the reeling stairs i could hear the stamp of mens feet that for once were not lagging  in the charthouse hall i heard mr pike who had already covered the length of the bridge from the forardhouse shouting  mizzenbraces  slack damn you  slack on the run  but hold a turn aft here all of you  jump  lively if you dont want to swim  come in portbraces  dont let m get away  leebracesif you lose that turn ill split your skull  lively  livelyis that helm hard over why in hell dont you answer  all this i heard as i dashed for the lee door and as i wondered why i did not hear the samurais voice  then as i passed the chartroom door i saw him  he was sitting on the couch whitefaced one seaboot in his hands and i could have sworn his hands were shaking  that much i saw and the next moment was out on deck  at first just emerged from the light i could see nothing although i could hear men at the pinrails and the mate snarling and shouting commands  but i knew the manoeuvre  with a weak crew in the big tail end sea of a broken gale breakers and destruction under her lee the elsinore was being worn around  we had been under lowertopsails and a reefed foresail all night  mr pikes first action after putting the wheel up had been to square the mizzenyards  with the windpressure thus eased aft the stern could more easily swing against the wind while the windpressure on the forardsails paid the bow off  but it takes time to wear a ship under short canvas in a big sea slowly very slowly i could feel the direction of the wind altering against my cheek  the moon dim at first showed brighter and brighter as the last shreds of a flying cloud drove away from before it  in vain i looked for any land  mainbracesall of youjump mr pike shouted himself leading the rush along the poop  and the men really rushed  not in all the months i had observed them had i seen such swiftness of energy  i made my way to the wheel where tom spink stood  he did not notice me with one hand holding the idle wheel he was leaning out to one side his eyes fixed in a fascinated stare  i followed its direction on between the charthouse and the portjigger shrouds and on across a mountain sea that was very vague in the moonlight  and then i saw it  the elsinores stern was flung skyward and across that cold ocean i saw landblack rocks and snowcovered slopes and crags  and toward this land the elsinore now almost before the wind was driving  from the midshiphouse came the snarls of the mate and the cries of the sailors  they were pulling and hauling for very life  then came mr pike across the poop leaping with incredible swiftness sending his snarl before him  ease that wheel there  what the hell you gawkin at  steady her as i tell you  thats all you got to do  from forard came a cry and i knew mr mellaire was on top of the forardhouse and managing the foreyards  nowfrom mr pike  more spokes  steady  steady  and be ready to check her  he bounded away along the poop again shouting for men for the mizzen braces  and the men appeared some of his watch others of the second mates watch routed from sleepmen coatless and hatless and bootless men ghastlyfaced with fear but eager for once to spring to the orders of the man who knew and could save their miserable lives from miserable death  yesand i noted the delicatehanded cook and yatsuda the sail maker pulling with his one unparalysed hand  it was all hands to save ship and all hands knew it  even sundry buyers who had drifted aft in his stupidity instead of being forard with his own officer forebore to stare about and to press his abdomen  for the nonce he pulled like a youngling of twenty  the moon covered again and it was in darkness that the elsinore rounded up on the wind on the starboard tack  this in her case under lowertopsails only meant that she lay eight points from the wind or in land terms at right angles to the wind  mr pike was splendid marvellous  even as the elsinore was rounding to on the wind while the headyards were still being braced and even as he was watching the ships behaviour and the wheel in between his commands to tom spink of a spoke  a spoke or two  another  steady hold her  ease her he was ordering the men aloft to loose sail  i had thought the manoeuvre of wearing achieved that we were saved but this setting of all three uppertopsails unconvinced me  the moon remained hidden and to leeward nothing could be seen  as each sail was set the elsinore was pressed farther and farther over and i realized that there was plenty of wind left despite the fact that the gale had broken or was breaking  also under this additional canvas i could feel the elsinore moving through the water  pike now sent the maltese cockney to help tom spink at the wheel  as for himself he took his stand beside the boobyhatch where he could gauge the elsinore gaze to leeward and keep his eye on the helmsmen  full and by was his reiterated command  keep her a good fulla rap full but dont let her fall away  hold her to it and drive her  he took no notice whatever of me although i on my way to the lee of the charthouse stood at his shoulder a full minute offering him a chance to speak  he knew i was there for his big shoulder brushed my arm as he swayed and turned to warn the helmsmen in the one breath to hold her up to it but to keep her full  he had neither time nor courtesy for a passenger in such a moment  sheltering by the charthouse i saw the moon appear  it grew brighter and brighter and i saw the land dead to leeward of us not three hundred yards away  it was a cruel sightblack rock and bitter snow with cliffs so perpendicular that the elsinore could have laid alongside of them in deep water with great gashes and fissures and with great surges thundering and spouting along all the length of it  our predicament was now clear to me  we had to weather the bight of land and islands into which we had drifted and sea and wind worked directly on shore  the only way out was to drive through the water to drive fast and hard and this was borne in upon me by mr pike bounding past to the break of the poop where i heard him shout to mr mellaire to set the mainsail  evidently the second mate was dubious for the next cry of mr pikes was  damn the reef  youd be in hell first  full mainsail  all hands to it  the difference was appreciable at once when that huge spread of canvas opposed the wind  the elsinore fairly leaped and quivered as she sprang to it and i could feel her eat to windward as she at the same time drove faster ahead  also in the rolls and gusts she was forced down till her leerail buried and the sea foamed level across to her hatches  mr pike watched her like a hawk and like certain death he watched the maltese cockney and tom spink at the wheel  land on the lee bow came a cry from forard that was carried on from mouth to mouth along the bridge to the poop  i saw mr pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically  he had already seen it from the leepoop and what he had not seen he had guessed  a score of times i saw him test the weight of the gusts on his cheek and with all the brain of him study the elsinores behaviour  and i knew what was in his mind  could she carry what she had  could she carry more  small wonder in this tense passage of time that i had forgotten the samurai  nor did i remember him until the charthouse door swung open and i caught him by the arm  he steadied and swayed beside me while he watched that cruel picture of rock and snow and spouting surf  a good full mr pike snarled  or ill eat your heart out  god damn you for the farmers hound you are tom spink  ease her  ease her  ease her into the big ones damn you  dont let her head fall off  steady where in hell did you learn to steer  what cowfarm was you raised on  here he bounded forard past us with those incredible leaps of his  it would be good to set the mizzentopgallant i heard captain west mutter in a weak quavery voice  mr pathurst will you please tell mr pike to set the mizzentopgallant  and at that very instant mr pikes voice rang out from the break of the poop  mr mellairethe mizzentopgallant  captain wests head drooped until his chin rested on his breast and so low did he mutter that i leaned to hear  a very good officer he said  an excellent officer  mr pathurst if you will kindly favour me i should like to go in  i    i havent got on my boots  the muscular feat was to open the heavy iron door and hold it open in the rolls and plunges  this i accomplished but when i had helped captain west across the high threshold he thanked me and waived further services and i did not know even then he was dying  never was a blackwood ship driven as was the elsinore during the next halfhour  the fulljib was also set and as it departed in shreds the foretopmast staysail was being hoisted  forard of the midshiphouse it was made unlivable by the bursting seas  mr mellaire with half the crew clung on somehow on top the midshiphouse while the rest of the crew was with us in the comparative safety of the poop  even charles davis drenched and shivering hung on beside me to the brass ringhandle of the charthouse door  such sailing  it was a madness of speed and motion for the elsinore drove over and through and under those huge graybeards that thundered shoreward  there were times when rolls and gusts worked against her at the same moment when i could have sworn the ends of her loweryardarms swept the sea  it was one chance in ten that we could claw off  all knew it and all knew there was nothing more to do but await the issue  and we waited in silence  the only voice was that of the mate intermittently cursing threatening and ordering tom spink and the maltese cockney at the wheel between whiles and all the while he gauged the gusts and ever his eyes lifted to the maintopgallantyard  he wanted to set that one more sail a dozen times i saw him halfopen his mouth to give the order he dared not give  and as i watched him so all watched him  hardbitten bitter natured sourfeatured and snarlingmouthed he was the one man the henchman of the race the master of the moment  and where was my thought o where was the samurai  one chance in ten  it was one in a hundred as we fought to weather the last bold tooth of rock that gashed into sea and tempest between us and open ocean  so close were we that i looked to see our farreeling skysailyards strike the face of the rock  so close were we no more than a biscuit toss from its iron buttress that as we sank down into the last great trough between two seas i can swear every one of us held breath and waited for the elsinore to strike  instead we drove free  and as if in very rage at our escape the storm took that moment to deal us the mightiest buffet of all  the mate felt that monster sea coming for he sprang to the wheel ere the blow fell  i looked forard and i saw all forard blotted out by the mountain of water that fell aboard  the elsinore righted from the shock and reappeared to the eye full of water from rail to rail  then a gust caught her sails and heeled her over spilling half the enormous burden outboard again  along the bridge came the relayed cry of man overboard  i glanced at the mate who had just released the wheel to the helmsmen he shook his head as if irritated by so trivial a happening walked to the corner of the halfwheelhouse and stared at the coast he had escaped white and black and cold in the moonlight  mr mellaire came aft and they met beside me in the lee of the chart house  all hands mr mellaire the mate said and get the mainsail off of her  after that the mizzentopgallant  yes sir said the second  who was it the mate asked as mr mellaire was turning away  boneyhe was no good anyway came the answer  that was all  boney the splinter was gone and all hands were answering the command of mr mellaire to take in the mainsail  but they never took it in for at that moment it started to blow away out of the boltropes and in but few moments all that was left of it was a few short slatting ribbons  mizzentopgallantsail mr pike ordered  then and for the first time he recognized my existence  well rid of it he growled  it never did set properly  i was always aching to get my hands on the sailmaker that made it  on my way below a glance into the chartroom gave me the cue to the samurais blunderif blunder it can be called for no one will ever know  he lay on the floor in a loose heap rolling willynilly with every roll of the elsinore     chapter xxxix   there is so much to write about all at once  in the first place captain west  not entirely unexpected was his death  margaret tells me that she was apprehensive from the start of the voyageand even before  it was because of her apprehension that she so abruptly changed her plans and accompanied her father  what really happened we do not know but the agreed surmise is that it was some stroke of the heart  and yet after the stroke did he not come out on deck  or could the first stroke have been followed by another and fatal one after i had helped him inside through the door  and even so i have never heard of a heartstroke being preceded hours before by a weakening of the mind  captain wests mind seemed quite clear and must have been quite clear that last afternoon when he wore the elsinore and started the leeshore drift  in which case it was a blunder  the samurai blundered and his heart destroyed him when he became aware of the blunder  at any rate the thought of blunder never enters margarets head  she accepts as a matter of course that it was all a part of the oncoming termination of his sickness  and no one will ever undeceive her  neither mr pike mr mellaire nor i among ourselves mention a whisper of what so narrowly missed causing disaster  in fact mr pike does not talk about the matter at alland then again might it not have been something different from heart disease  or heart disease complicated with something else that obscured his mind that afternoon before his death  well no one knows and i for one shall not sit even in secret judgment on the event        at midday of the day we clawed off tierra del fuego the elsinore was rolling in a dead calm and all afternoon she rolled not a score of miles off the land  captain west was buried at four oclock and at eight bells that evening mr pike assumed command and made a few remarks to both watches  they were straightfromtheshoulder remarks or as he called them they were brass tacks  among other things he told the sailors that they had another boss and that they would toe the mark as they never had before  up to this time they had been loafing in an hotel but from this time on they were going to work  on this hooker from now on he perorated its going to be like old times when a man jumped the last day of the voyage as well as the first and god help the man that dont jump  thats all  relieve the wheel and lookout        and yet the men are in terribly wretched condition  i dont see how they can jump  another week of westerly gales alternating with brief periods of calm has elapsed making a total of six weeks off the horn  so weak are the men that they have no spirit left in themnot even the gangsters  and so afraid are they of the mate that they really do their best to jump when he drives them and he drives them all the time  mr mellaire shakes his head  wait till they get around and up into better weather he astonished me by telling me the other afternoon  wait till they get dried out and rested up with more sleep and their sores healed and more flesh on their bones and more spunk in their bloodthen they wont stand for this driving  mr pike cant realize that times have changed sir and laws have changed and men have changed  hes an old man and i know what i am talking about  you mean youve been listening to the talk of the men i challenged rashly all my gorge rising at the unofficerlike conduct of this ships officer  the shot went home for in a flash that suave and gentle film of light vanished from the surface of the eyes and the watching fearful thing that lurked behind inside the skull seemed almost to leap out at me while the cruel gash of mouth drew thinner and crueller  and at the same time on my inner sight was grotesquely limned a picture of a brain pulsing savagely against the veneer of skin that covered that cleft of skull beneath the dripping souwester  then he controlled himself the mouthgash relaxed and the suave and gentle film drew again across the eyes  i mean sir he said softly that i am speaking out of a long sea experience  times have changed  the old driving days are gone  and i trust mr pathurst that you will not misunderstand me in the matter nor misinterpret what i have said  although the conversation drifted on to other and calmer topics i could not ignore the fact that he had not denied listening to the talk of the men  and yet even as mr pike grudgingly admits he is a good sailorman and second mate save for his unholy intimacy with the men forardan intimacy which even the chinese cook and the chinese steward deplore as unseamanlike and perilous  even though men like the gangsters are so worn down by hardship that they have no heart of rebellion there remain three of the frailest forard who will not die and who are as spunky as ever  they are andy fay mulligan jacobs and charles davis  what strange abysmal vitality informs them is beyond all speculation  of course charles davis should have been overside with a sack of coal at his feet long ago  and andy fay and mulligan jacobs are only and have always been wrecked and emaciated wisps of men  yet far stronger men than they have gone over the side and far stronger men than they are laid up right now in absolute physical helplessness in the soggy forecastle bunks  and these two bitter flames of shreds of things stand all their watches and answer all calls for both watches  yes and the chickens have something of this same spunk of life in them featherless semifrozen despite the oilstove sprayed dripping on occasion by the frigid seas that pound by sheer weight through canvas tarpaulins nevertheless not a chicken has died  is it a matter of selection  are these the ironvigoured ones that survived the hardships from baltimore to the horn and are fitted to survive anything  then for a de vries to take them save them and out of them found the hardiest breed of chickens on the planet  and after this i shall always query that phrase most ancient in our languagechickenhearted  measured by the elsinores chickens it is a misnomer  nor are our three horn gypsies the stormvisitors with the dreaming topaz eyes spunkless  held in superstitious abhorrence by the rest of the crew aliens by lack of any word of common speech nevertheless they are good sailors and are always first to spring into any enterprise of work or peril  they have gone into mr mellaires watch and they are quite apart from the rest of the sailors  and when there is a delay or wait with nothing to do for long minutes they shoulder together and stand and sway to the heave of deck and dream far dreams in those pale topaz eyes of a country i am sure where mothers with pale topaz eyes and sandy hair birth sons and daughters that breed true in terms of topaz eyes and sandy hair  but the rest of the crew  take the maltese cockney  he is too keenly intelligent too sharply sensitive successfully to endure  he is a shadow of his former self  his cheeks have fallen in  dark circles of suffering are under his eyes while his eyes latin and english intermingled are cavernously sunken and as brightburning as if aflame with fever  tom spink hardfibred anglosaxon good seaman that he is long tried and always proved is quite wrecked in spirit  he is whining and fearful  so broken is he though he still does his work that he is prideless and shameless  ill never ship around the horn again sir he began on me the other day when i greeted him good morning at the wheel  ive sworn it before but this time i mean it  never again sir  never again  why did you swear it before i queried  it was on the nahoma sir four years ago  two hundred and thirty days from liverpool to frisco  think of it sir  two hundred and thirty days  and we was loaded with cement and creosote and the creosote got loose  we buried the captain right here off the horn  the grub gave out  most of us nearly died of scurvy  every man jack of us was carted to hospital in frisco  it was plain hell sir thats what it was an two hundred and thirty days of it  yet here you are i laughed signed on another horn voyage  and this morning tom spink confided the following tome  if only wed lost the carpenter sir instead of boney  i did not catch his drift for the moment then i remembered  the carpenter was the finn the jonah the warlock who played tricks with the winds and despitefully used poor sailormen        yes and i make free to confess that i have grown well weary of this eternal buffeting by the great west wind  nor are we alone in our travail on this desolate ocean  never a day does the gray thin or the snowsqualls cease that we do not sight ships westbound like ourselves hoveto and trying to hold on to the meagre westing they possess  and occasionally when the gray clears and lifts we see a lucky ship bound east running before it and reeling off the miles  i saw mr pike yesterday shaking his fist in a fury of hatred at one such craft that flew insolently past us not a quarter of a mile away  and the men are jumping  mr pike is driving with those blocksquare fists of his as many a mans face attests  so weak are they and so terrible is he that i swear he could whip either watch singlehanded  i cannot help but note that mr mellaire refuses to take part in this driving  yet i know that he is a trained driver and that he was not averse to driving at the outset of the voyage  but now he seems bent on keeping on good terms with the crew  i should like to know what mr pike thinks of it for he cannot possibly be blind to what is going on but i am too well aware of what would happen if i raised the question  he would insult me snap my head off and indulge in a threedays seagrouch  things are sad and monotonous enough for margaret and me in the cabin and at table without invoking the blight of the mates displeasure     chapter xl   another brutal seasuperstition vindicated  from now on and for always these imbeciles of ours will believe that finns are jonahs  we are west of the diego de ramirez rocks and we are running west at a twelveknot clip with an easterly gale at our backs  and the carpenter is gone  his passing and the coming of the easterly wind were coincidental  it was yesterday morning as he helped me to dress that i was struck by the solemnity of wadas face  he shook his head lugubriously as he broke the news  the carpenter was missing  the ship had been searched for him high and low  there just was no carpenter  what does the steward think i asked  what does louis thinkand yatsuda  the sailors they kill m carpenter sure was the answer  very bad ship this  very bad hearts  just the same pig just the same dog  all the time kill  all the time kill  bimeby everybody kill  you see  the old steward at work in his pantry grinned at me when i mentioned the matter  they make fool with me i fix em he said vindictively  mebbe they kill me all right but i kill some too  he threw back his coat and i saw strapped to the left side of his body in a canvas sheath so that the handle was ready to hand a meat knife of the heavy sort that butchers hack with  he drew it forthit was fully two feet longand to demonstrate its razoredge sliced a sheet of newspaper into many ribbons  huh he laughed sardonically  i am chink monkey damn fool ehno good eh all rotten damn to hell  i fix em they make fool with me  and yet there is not the slightest evidence of foul play  nobody knows what happened to the carpenter  there are no clues no traces  the night was calm and snowy  no seas broke on board  without doubt the clumsy bigfooted overgrown giant of a boy is overside and dead  the question is did he go over of his own accord or was he put over  at eight oclock mr pike proceeded to interrogate the watches  he stood at the break of the poop in the high place leaning on the rail and gazing down at the crew assembled on the main deck beneath him  man after man he questioned and from each man came the one story  they knew no more about it than did weor so they averred  i suppose youll be chargin next that i hove that big lummux overboard with me own hands mulligan jacobs snarled when he was questioned  an mebbe i did bein that husky an rampagin bulllike  the mates face grew more forbidding and sour but without comment he passed on to john hackey the san francisco hoodlum  it was an unforgettable scenethe mate in the high place the men sullen and irresponsive grouped beneath  a gentle snow drifted straight down through the windless air while the elsinore with hollow thunder from her sails rolled down on the quiet swells so that the ocean lapped the mouths of her scuppers with longdrawn shuddering sucks and sobs and all the men swayed in unison to the rolls their hands in mittens their feet in sackwrapped seaboots their faces worn and sick  and the three dreamers with the topaz eyes stood and swayed and dreamed together incurious of setting and situation  and then it camethe hint of easterly air  the mate noted it first  i saw him start and turn his cheek to the almost imperceptible draught then i felt it  a minute longer he waited until assured when the dead carpenter forgotten he burst out with orders to the wheel and the crew and the men jumped though in their weakness the climb aloft was slow and toilsome and when the gaskets were off the topgallantsails and the men on deck were hoisting yards and sheeting home those aloft were loosing the royals  while this work went on and while the yards were being braced around the elsinore her bow pointing to the west began moving through the water before the first fair wind in a month and a half  slowly that light air fanned to a gentle breeze while all the time the snow fell steadily  the barometer down to 2880 continued to fall and the breeze continued to grow upon itself  tom spink passing by me on the poop to lend a hand at the final finicky trimming of the mizzenyards gave me a triumphant look  superstition was vindicated events had proved him right  fair wind had come with the going of the carpenter which said warlock had incontestably taken with him overside his bag of windtricks  mr pike strode up and down the poop rubbing his hands which he was too disdainfully happy to mitten chuckling and grinning to himself glancing at the draw of every sail stealing adoring looks astern into the gray of snow out of which blew the favouring wind  he even paused beside me to gossip for a moment about the french restaurants of san francisco and how therein the delectable california fashion of cooking wild duck obtained  throw em through the fire he chanted  thats the waythrow em through the firea hot oven sixteen minutesi take mine fourteen to the secondan squeeze the carcasses  by midday the snow had ceased and we were bowling along before a stiff breeze  at three in the afternoon we were running before a growing gale it was across a mad ocean we tore for the mounting sea that made from eastward bucked into the west end drift and battled and battered down the huge southwesterly swell  and the big grinning dolt of a finnish carpenter already food for fish and bird was astern there somewhere in the freezing rack and drive  make westing  we ripped it off across these narrowing degrees of longitude at the southern tip of the planet where one mile counts for two  and mr pike staring at his bending topgallantyards swore that they could carry away for all he cared ere he eased an inch of canvas more he did  he set the huge crojack biggest of all sails and challenged god or satan to start a seam of it or all its seams  he simply could not go below  in such auspicious occasions all watches were his and he strode the poop perpetually with all agelag banished from his legs  margaret and i were with him in the chartroom when he hurrahed the barometer down to 2855 and falling  and we were near him on the poop when he drove by an eastbound limejuicer hoveto under uppertopsails  we were a biscuittoss away and he sprang upon the rail at the jiggershrouds and danced a wardance and waved his free arm and yelled his scorn and joy at their discomfiture to the several oilskinned figures on the stranger vessels poop  through the pitchblack night we continued to drive  the crew was sadly frightened and i sought in vain in the two dogwatches for tom spink to ask him if he thought the carpenter astern had opened wide the bag mouth and loosed all his tricks  for the first time i saw the steward apprehensive  too much he told me with ominous rolling head  too much sail rotten bad damn all to hell  bimeby pretty quick all finish  you see  they talk about running the easting down mr pike chortled to me as we clung to the pooprail to keep from fetching away and breaking ribs and necks  well this is running your westing down if anybody should ride up in a godevil and ask you  it was a wretched glorious night  sleep was impossiblefor me at any rate  nor was there even the comfort of warmth  something had gone wrong with the big cabin stove due to our wild running i fancy and the steward was compelled to let the fire go out  so we are getting a taste of the hardship of the forecastle though in our case everything is dry instead of soggy or afloat  the kerosene stoves burned in our state room but so smelly was mine that i preferred the cold  to sail on ones nerve in an overcanvassed harbour catboat is all the excitement any glutton can desire  but to sail in the same fashion in a big ship off the horn is incredible and terrible  the great west wind drift setting squarely into the teeth of the easterly gale kicked up a tideway sea that was monstrous  two men toiled at the wheel relieving in pairs every halfhour and in the face of the cold they streamed with sweat long ere their halfhour shift was up  mr pike is of the elder race of men  his endurance is prodigious  watch and watch and all watches he held the poop  i never dreamed of it he told me at midnight as the great gusts tore by and as we listened for our lighter spars to smash aloft and crash upon the deck  i thought my last whirling sailing was past  and here we are  here we are  lord  lord  i sailed third mate in the little vampire before you were born  fiftysix men before the mast and the last jack of em an able seaman  and there were eight boys an bosuns that was bosuns an sailmakers an carpenters an stewards an passengers to jam the decks an three driving mates of us an captain brown the little wonder  he didnt weigh a hundredweight an he drove ushe drove us three drivin mates that learned from him what drivin was  it was knock down and drag out from the start  the first hour of puttin the men to fair perished our knuckles  ive got the smashed joints yet to show  every seachest broke open every seabag turned out and whiskey bottles knuckledusters slingshots bowieknives an guns chucked overside by the armful  an when we chose the watches each man of fiftysix of em laid his knife on the mainhatch an the carpenter broke the point square offyes an the little vampire only eight hundred tons  the elsinore could carry her on her deck  but she was ship all ship an them was mens days  margaret save for inability to sleep did not mind the driving although mr mellaire on the other hand admitted apprehension  hes got my goat he confided to me  it isnt right to drive a cargo carrier this way  this isnt a ballasted yacht  its a coalhulk  i know what driving was but it was in ships made to drive  our ironwork aloft wont stand it  mr pathurst i tell you frankly that it is criminal it is sheer murder to run the elsinore with that crojack on her  you can see yourself sir  its an aftersail  all its tendency is to throw her stern off and her bow up to it  and if it ever happens sir if she ever gets away from the wheel for two seconds and broaches to      then what i asked or rather shouted for all conversation had to be shouted close to ear in that blast of gale  he shrugged his shoulders and all of him was eloquent with the unuttered unmistakable wordfinish  at eight this morning margaret and i struggled up to the poop  and there was that indomitable iron old man  he had never left the deck all night  his eyes were bright and he appeared in the pink of wellbeing he rubbed his hands and chuckled greeting to us and took up his reminiscences  in 51 on this same stretch miss west the flying cloud in twenty four hours logged three hundred and seventyfour miles under her topgallantsails  that was sailing  she broke the record that day for sail an steam  and what are we averaging mr pike margaret queried while her eyes were fixed on the main deck where continually one rail and then the other dipped under the ocean and filled across from rail to rail only to spill out and take in on the next roll  thirteen for a fair average since five oclock yesterday afternoon he exulted  in the squalls she makes all of sixteen which is going some for the elsinore  id take the crojack off if i had charge margaret criticised  so would i so would i miss west he replied if we hadnt been six weeks already off the horn  she ran her eyes aloft spar by spar past the spars of hollow steel to the wooden royals which bent in the gusts like bows in some invisible archers hands  theyre remarkably good sticks of timber was her comment  well may you say it miss west he agreed  id never abelieved theyd astood it myself  but just look at m  just look at m  there was no breakfast for the men  three times the galley had been washed out and the men in the forecastle awash contented themselves with hard tack and cold salt horse  aft with us the steward scalded himself twice ere he succeeded in making coffee over a keroseneburner  at noon we picked up a ship ahead a limejuicer travelling in the same direction under lowertopsails and one uppertopsail  the only one of her courses set was the foresail  the way that skippers carryin on is shocking mr pike sneered  he should be more cautious and remember god the owners the underwriters and the board of trade  such was our speed that in almost no time we were up with the stranger vessel and passing her  mr pike was like a boy just loosed from school he altered our course so that we passed her a hundred yards away  she was a gallant sight but such was our speed she appeared standing still  mr pike jumped upon the rail and insulted those on her poop by extending a ropes end in invitation to take a tow  margaret shook her head privily to me as she gazed at our bending royal yards but was caught in the act by mr pike who cried out  what kites she wont carry she can drag  an hour later i caught tom spink just relieved from his shift at the wheel and weak from exhaustion  what do you think now of the carpenter and his bag of tricks i queried  lord lumme it should aben the mate sir was his reply  by five in the afternoon we had logged 314 miles since five the previous day which was two over an average of thirteen knots for twentyfour consecutive hours  now take captain brown of the little vampire mr pike grinned to me for our sailing made him goodnatured  he never would take in until the kites an stunsails was about his ears  an when she was blown her worst an we was halffairly shortened down hed turn in for a snooze an say to us call me if she moderates  yes and ill never forget the night when i called him an told him that everything on top the houses had gone adrift an that two of the boats had been swept aft and was kindlingwood against the break of the cabin  very well mr pike he says battin his eyes and turnin over to go to sleep again  very well mr pike says he  watch her  an mr pike     yes sir says i  give me a call mr pike when the windlass shows signs of comin aft  thats what he said his very words an the next moment damme he was snorin        it is now midnight and cunningly wedged into my bunk unable to sleep i am writing these lines with flying dabs of pencil at my pad  and no more shall i write i swear until this gale is blown out or we are blown to kingdom come     chapter xli   the days have passed and i have broken my resolve for here i am again writing while the elsinore surges along across a magnificent smoky dusty sea  but i have two reasons for breaking my word  first and minor we had a real dawn this morning  the gray of the sea showed a streaky blue and the cloudmasses were actually pinktipped by a really and truly sun  second and major we are around the horn  we are north of 50 in the pacific in longitude 8049 with cape pillar and the straits of magellan already south of east from us and we are heading northnorthwest  we are around the horn  the profound significance of this can be appreciated only by one who has windjammed around from east to west blow high blow low nothing can happen to thwart us  no ship north of 50 was ever blown back  from now on it is plain sailing and seattle suddenly seems quite near  all the ships company with the exception of margaret is better spirited  she is quiet and a little down though she is anything but prone to the wastage of grief  in her robust vital philosophy gods always in heaven  i may describe her as being merely subdued and gentle and tender  and she is very wistful to receive gentle consideration and tenderness from me  she is after all the genuine woman  she wants the strength that man has to give and i flatter myself that i am ten times a stronger man than i was when the voyage began because i am a thousand times a more human man since i told the books to go hang and began to revel in the human maleness of the man that loves a woman and is loved  returning to the ships company  the rounding of the horn the better weather that is continually growing better the easement of hardship and toil and danger with the promise of the tropics and of the balmy south east trades before themall these factors contribute to pick up our men again  the temperature has already so moderated that the men are beginning to shed their surplusage of clothing and they no longer wrap sacking about their seaboots  last evening in the second dogwatch i heard a man actually singing  the steward has discarded the huge hacking knife and relaxed to the extent of engaging in an occasional sober romp with possum  wadas face is no longer solemnly long and louis oxford accent is more mellifluous than ever  mulligan jacobs and andy fay are the same venomous scorpions they have always been  the three gangsters with the clique they lead have again asserted their tyrrany and thrashed all the weaklings and feeblings in the forecastle  charles davis resolutely refuses to die though how he survived that wet and freezing room of iron through all the weeks off the horn has elicited wonder even from mr pike who has a most accurate knowledge of what men can stand and what they cannot stand  how nietzsche with his eternal slogan of be hard  be hard would have delighted in mr pike  andohlarry has had a tooth removed  for some days distressed with a jumping toothache he came aft to the mate for relief  mr pike refused to monkey with the fangled forceps in the medicinechest  he used a tenpenny nail and a hammer in the good old way to which he was brought up  i vouch for this  i saw it done  one blow of the hammer and the tooth was out while larry was jumping around holding his jaw  it is a wonder it wasnt fractured  but mr pike avers he has removed hundreds of teeth by this method and never known a fractured jaw  also he avers he once sailed with a skipper who shaved every sunday morning and never touched a razor nor any cuttingedge to his face  what he used according to mr pike was a lighted candle and a damp towel  another candidate for nietzsches immortals who are hard  as for mr pike himself he is the highestspirited bestconditioned man on board  the driving to which he subjected the elsinore was meat and drink  he still rubs his hands and chuckles over the memory of it  huh he said to me in reference to the crew i gave em a taste of real oldfashioned sailing  theyll never forget this hookerat least them that dont take a sack of coal overside before we reach port  you mean you think well have more seaburials i inquired  he turned squarely upon me and squarely looked me in the eyes for the matter of five long seconds  huh he replied as he turned on his heel  hell aint begun to pop on this hooker  he still stands his mates watch alternating with mr mellaire for he is firm in his conviction that there is no man forard fit to stand a second mates watch  also he has kept his old quarters  perhaps it is out of delicacy for margaret for i have learned that it is the invariable custom for the mate to occupy the captains quarters when the latter dies  so mr mellaire still eats by himself in the big afterroom as he has done since the loss of the carpenter and bunks as before in the midshiphouse with nancy     chapter xlii   mr mellaire was right  the men would not accept the driving when the elsinore won to easier latitudes  mr pike was right  hell had not begun to pop  but it has popped now and men are overboard without even the kindliness of a sack of coal at their feet  and yet the men though ripe for it did not precipitate the trouble  it was mr mellaire  or rather it was ditman olansen the crankeyed norwegian  perhaps it was possum  at any rate it was an accident in which the severalnamed including possum played their respective parts  to begin at the beginning  two weeks have elapsed since we crossed 50 and we are now in 37the same latitude as san francisco or to be correct we are as far south of the equator as san francisco is north of it  the trouble was precipitated yesterday morning shortly after nine oclock and possum started the chain of events that culminated in downright mutiny  it was mr mellaires watch and he was standing on the bridge directly under the mizzentop giving orders to sundry buyers who with arthur deacon and the maltese cockney was doing rigging work aloft  get the picture and the situation in all its ridiculousness  mr pike thermometer in hand was coming back along the bridge from taking the temperature of the coal in the forard hold  ditman olansen was just swinging into the mizzentop as he went up with several turns of rope over one shoulder  also in some way to the end of this rope was fastened a sizable block that might have weighed ten pounds  possum running free was fooling around the chickencoop on top the midship house  and the chickens featherless but indomitable were enjoying the milder weather as they pecked at the grain and grits which the steward had just placed in their feedingtrough  the tarpaulin that covered their pen had been off for several days  now observe  i am at the break of the poop leaning on the rail and watching ditman olansen swing into the top with his cumbersome burden mr pike proceeding aft has just passed mr mellaire  possum who on account of the horn weather and the tarpaulin has not seen the chickens for many weeks is getting reacquainted and is investigating them with that keen nose of his  and a hens beak equally though differently keen impacts on possums nose which is as sensitive as it is keen  i may well say now that i think it over that it was this particular hen that started the mutiny  the men welldriven by mr pike were ripe for an explosion and possum and the hen laid the train  possum fell away backwards from the coop and loosed a wild cry of pain and indignation  this attracted ditman olansens attention  he paused and craned his neck out in order to see and in this moment of carelessness the block he was carrying fetched away from him along with the several turns of rope around his shoulder  both the mates sprang away to get out from under  the rope fast to the block and following it lashed about like a blacksnake and though the block fell clear of mr mellaire the bight of the rope snatched off his cap  mr pike had already started an oath aloft when his eyes caught sight of the terrible cleft in mr mellaires head  there it was for all the world to read and mr pikes and mine were the only eyes that could read it  the sparse hair upon the second mates crown served not at all to hide the cleft  it began out of sight in the thicker hair above the ears and was exposed nakedly across the whole dome of head  the stream of abuse for ditman olansen was choked in mr pikes throat all he was capable of for the moment was to stare petrified at that enormous fissure flanked at either end with a thatch of grizzled hair  he was in a dream a trance his great hands knotting and clenching unconsciously as he stared at the mark unmistakable by which he had said that he would some day identify the murderer of captain somers  and in that moment i remembered having heard him declare that some day he would stick his fingers in that mark  still as in a dream moving slowly right hand outstretched like a talon with the fingers drawn downward he advanced on the second mate with the evident intention of thrusting his fingers into that cleft and of clawing and tearing at the brainlife beneath that pulsed under the thin film of skin  the second mate backed away along the bridge and mr pike seemed partially to come to himself  his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused  i know you he said in a strange shaky voice blended of age and passion  eighteen years ago you were dismasted off the plate in the cyrus thompson  she foundered after you were on your beam ends and lost your sticks  you were in the only boat that was saved  eleven years ago on the jason harrison in san francisco captain somers was beaten to death by his second mate  this second mate was a survivor of the cyrus thompson  this second mated had his skull split by a crazy seacook  your skull is split  this second mates name was sidney waltham  and if you aint sidney waltham      at this point mr mellaire or rather sidney waltham despite his fifty years did what only a sailor could do  he went over the bridgerail sidewise caught the running gear upanddown the mizzenmast and landed lightly on his feet on top of number three hatch  nor did he stop there  he ran across the hatch and dived through the doorway of his room in the midshiphouse  such must have been mr pikes profundity of passion that he paused like a somnambulist actually rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand and seemed to awaken  but the second mate had not run to his room for refuge  the next moment he emerged a thirtytwo smith and wesson in his hand and the instant he emerged he began shooting  mr pike was wholly himself again and i saw him perceptibly pause and decide between the two impulses that tore at him  one was to leap over the bridgerail and down at the man who shot at him the other was to retreat  he retreated  and as he bounded aft along the narrow bridge the mutiny began  arthur deacon from the mizzentop leaned out and hurled a steel marlinspike at the fleeing mate  the thing flashed in the sunlight as it hurtled down  it missed mr pike by twenty feet and nearly impaled possum who afraid of firearms was wildly rushing and ki yiing aft  it so happened that the sharp point of the marlinspike struck the wooden floor of the bridge and it penetrated the planking with such force that after it had fetched to a standstill it vibrated violently for long seconds  i confess that i failed to observe a tithe of what occurred during the next several minutes  piece together as i will after the event i know that i missed much of what took place  i know that the men aloft in the mizzen descended to the deck but i never saw them descend  i know that the second mate emptied the chambers of his revolver but i did not hear all the shots  i know that lars johnson left the wheel and on his broken leg rebroken and not yet really mended limped and scuttled across the poop down the ladder and gained forard  i know he must have limped and scuttled on that bad leg of his i know that i must have seen him and yet i swear that i have no impression of seeing him  i do know that i heard the rush of feet of men from forard along the main deck  and i do know that i saw mr pike take shelter behind the steel jiggermast  also as the second mate manoeuvred to port on top of number three hatch for his last shot i know that i saw mr pike duck around the corner of the charthouse to starboard and get away aft and below by way of the boobyhatch  and i did hear that last futile shot and the bullet also as it ricochetted from the corner of the steelwalled charthouse  as for myself i did not move  i was too interested in seeing  it may have been due to lack of presence of mind or to lack of habituation to an active part in scenes of quick action but at any rate i merely retained my position at the break of the poop and looked on  i was the only person on the poop when the mutineers led by the second mate and the gangsters rushed it  i saw them swarm up the ladder and it never entered my head to attempt to oppose them  which was just as well for i would have been killed for my pains and i could never have stopped them  i was alone on the poop and the men were quite perplexed to find no enemy in sight  as bert rhine went past he half fetched up in his stride as if to knife me with the sheath knife sharppointed which he carried in his right hand then and i know i correctly measured the drift of his judgment he unflatteringly dismissed me as unimportant and ran on  right here i was impressed by the lack of clearthinking on any of their parts  so spontaneously had the ships company exploded into mutiny that it was dazed and confused even while it acted  for instance in the months since we left baltimore there had never been a moment day or night even when preventer tackles were rigged that a man had not stood at the wheel  so habituated were they to this that they were shocked into consternation at sight of the deserted wheel  they paused for an instant to stare at it  then bert rhine with a quick word and gesture sent the italian guido bombini around the rear of the halfwheelhouse the fact that he completed the circuit was proof that nobody was there  again in the swift rush of events i must confess that i saw but little i was aware that more of the men were climbing up the ladder and gaining the poop but i had no eyes for them  i was watching that sanguinary group aft near the wheel and noting the most important thing namely that it was bert rhine the gangster and not the second mate who gave orders and was obeyed  he motioned to the jew isaac chantz who had been wounded earlier in the voyage by osullivan and chantz led the way to the starboard charthouse door  while this was going on all in flashing fractions of seconds bert rhine was cautiously inspecting the lazarette through the open booby hatch  isaac chantz jerked open the charthouse door which swung outward things did happen so swiftly  as he jerked the iron door open a twofoot hacking butcher knife at the end of a withered yellow hand flashed out and down on him  it missed head and neck but caught him on top of the left shoulder  all hands recoiled before this and the jew reeled across to the rail his right hand clutching at his wound and between the fingers i could see the blood welling darkly  bert rhine abandoned his inspection of the boobyhatch and with the second mate the latter still carrying his empty smith  wesson sprang into the press about the charthouse door  o wise clever cautious old chinese steward  he made no emergence  the door swung emptily back and forth to the rolling of the elsinore and no man knew but what just inside with that heavy hacking knife upraised lurked the steward  and while they hesitated and stared at the aperture that alternately closed and opened with the swinging of the door the boobyhatch situated between charthouse and wheel erupted it was mr pike with his 44 automatic colt  there were shots fired other than by him  i know i heard them like redheads at an oldtime fourth of july but i do not know who discharged them  all was mess and confusion  many shots were being fired and through the uproar i heard the reiterant monotonous explosions from the colts 44  i saw the italian mike cipriani clutch savagely at his abdomen and sink slowly to the deck  shorty the japanese halfcaste clown that he was dancing and grinning on the outskirts of the struggle with a final grimace and hysterical giggle led the retreat across the poop and down the poopladder  never had i seen a finer exemplification of mob psychology  shorty the most unstableminded of the individuals who composed this mob by his own instability precipitated the retreat in which the mob joined  when he broke before the steady discharge of the automatic in the hand of the mate on the instant the rest broke with him  leastbalanced his balance was the balance of all of them  chantz bleeding prodigiously was one of the first on shortys heels  i saw nosey murphy pause long enough to throw his knife at the mate  the missile went wide with a metallic clang struck the brass tip of one of the spokes of the elsinores wheel and clattered on the deck  the second mate with his empty revolver and bert rhine with his sheathknife fled past me side by side  mr pike emerged from the boobyhatch and with an unaimed shot brought down bill quigley one of the bricklayers who fell at my feet  the last man off the poop was the maltese cockney and at the top of the ladder he paused to look back at mr pike who holding the automatic in both hands was taking careful aim  the maltese cockney disdaining the ladder leaped through the air to the main deck  but the colt merely clicked  it was the last bullet in it that had fetched down bill quigley  and the poop was ours  events still crowded so closely that i missed much  i saw the steward belligerent and cautious his long knife poised for a slash emerge from the charthouse  margaret followed him and behind her came wada who carried my 22 winchester automatic rifle  as he told me afterwards he had brought it up under instructions from her  mr pike was glancing with cool haste at his colt to see whether it was jammed or empty when margaret asked him the course  by the wind he shouted to her as he bounded forard  put your helm hard up or well be all aback  ahyeoman and henchman of the race he could not fail in his fidelity to the ship under his command  the iron of all his years of iron training was there manifest  while mutiny spread red and death was on the wing he could not forget his charge the ship the elsinore the insensate fabric compounded of steel and hemp and woven cotton that was to him glorious with personality  margaret waved wada in my direction as she ran to the wheel  as mr pike passed the corner of the charthouse simultaneously there was a report from amidships and the ping of a bullet against the steel wall  i saw the man who fired the shot  it was the cowboy steve roberts  as for the mate he ducked in behind the sheltering jiggermast and even as he ducked his left hand dipped into his side coatpocket so that when he had gained shelter it was coming out with a fresh clip of cartridges the empty clip fell to the deck the loader clip slipped up the hollow butt and he was good for eight more shots  wada turned the little automatic rifle over to me where i still stood under the weather cloth at the break of the poop  all ready he said  you take off safety  get roberts mr pike called to me  hes the best shot forard  if you cant get m jolt the fear of god into him anyway  it was the first time i had a human target and let me say here and now that i am convinced i am immune to buck fever  there he was before me less than a hundred feet distant in the gangway between the door to davis room and the starboardrail manoeuvring for another shot at mr pike  i must have missed steve roberts that first time but i came so near him that he jumped  the next instant he had located me and turned his revolver on me  but he had no chance  my little automatic was discharging as fast as i could tickle the trigger with my forefinger the cowboys first shot went wild of me because my bullet arrived ere he got his swift aim  he swayed and stumbled backward but the bulletsten of thempoured from the muzzle of my winchester like water from a garden hose  it was a stream of lead i played upon him  i shall never know how many times i hit him but i am confident that after he had begun his long staggering fall at least three additional bullets entered him ere he impacted on the deck  and even as he was falling aimlessly and mechanically stricken then with death he managed twice again to discharge his weapon  and after he struck the deck he never moved  i do believe he died in the air  as i held up my gun and gazed at the abruptlydeserted maindeck i was aware of wadas touch on my arm  i looked  in his hand were a dozen little 22 long softnosed smokeless cartridges  he wanted me to reload  i threw on the safety opened the magazine and tilted the rifle so that he could let the fresh cartridges of themselves slide into place  get some more i told him  scarcely had he departed on the errand when bill quigley who lay at my feet created a diversion  i jumpedyes and i freely confess that i yelledwith startle and surprise when i felt his paws clutch my ankles and his teeth shut down on the calf of my leg  it was mr pike to the rescue  i understand now the western hyperbole of hitting the high places  the mate did not seem in contact with the deck  my impression was that he soared through the air to me landing beside me and in the instant of landing kicking out with one of those big feet of his  bill quigley was kicked clear away from me and the next moment he was flying overboard  it was a clean throw  he never touched the rail  whether mike cipriani who till then had lain in a welter began crawling aft in quest of safety or whether he intended harm to margaret at the wheel we shall never know for there was no opportunity given him to show his purpose  as swiftly as mr pike could cross the deck with those giant bounds just that swiftly was the italian in the air and following bill quigley overside  the mate missed nothing with those eagle eyes of his as he returned along the poop  nobody was to be seen on the main deck  even the lookout had deserted the forecastlehead and the elsinore steered by margaret slipped a lazy two knots through the quiet sea  mr pike was apprehensive of a shot from ambush and it was not until after a scrutiny of several minutes that he put his pistol into his side coatpocket and snarled forard  come out you rats  show your ugly faces  i want to talk with you  guido bombini gesticulating peaceable intentions and evidently thrust out by bert rhine was the first to appear  when it was observed that mr pike did not fire the rest began to dribble into view  this continued till all were there save the cook the two sailmakers and the second mate  the last to come out were tom spink the boy buckwheat and herman lunkenheimer the goodnatured but simpleminded german and these three came out only after repeated threats from bert rhine who with nosey murphy and kid twist was patently in charge  also like a faithful dog guido bombini fawned close to him  that will dostop where you are mr pike commanded when the crew was scattered abreast to starboard and to port of number three hatch  it was a striking scene  mutiny on the high seas  that phrase learned in boyhood from my marryatt and cooper recrudesced in my brain this was itmutiny on the high seas in the year nineteen thirteenand i was part of it a perishing blond whose lot was cast with the perishing but lordly blonds and i had already killed a man  mr pike in the high place aged and indomitable leaned his arm on the rail at the break of the poop and gazed down at the mutineers the like of which ill wager had never been assembled in mutiny before  there were the three gangsters and exjailbirds anything but seamen yet in control of this affair that was peculiarly an affair of the sea  with them was the italian hound bombini and beside them were such strangely assorted men as anton sorensen lars jacobsen frank fitzgibbon and richard gilleralso arthur deacon the white slaver john hackey the san francisco hoodlum the maltese cockney and tony the suicidal greek  i noticed the three strange ones shouldering together and standing apart from the others as they swayed to the lazy roll and dreamed with their pale topaz eyes  and there was the faun stone deaf but observant straining to understand what was taking place  yes and mulligan jacobs and andy fay were bitterly and eagerly side by side and ditman olansen crankeyed as if drawn by some affinity of bitterness stood behind them his head appearing between their heads  farthest advanced of all was charles davis the man who by all rights should long since be dead his face with its waxlike pallor startlingly in contrast to the weathered faces of the rest  i glanced back at margaret who was coolly steering and she smiled to me and love was in her eyesshe too of the perishing and lordly race of blonds her place the high place her heritage government and command and mastery over the stupid lowly of her kind and over the ruck and spawn of the darkpigmented breeds  wheres sidney waltham the mate snarled  i want him  bring him out after that the rest of you filth get back to work or god have mercy on you  the men moved about restlessly shuffling their feet on the deck  sidney waltham i want youcome out mr pike called addressing himself beyond them to the murderer of the captain under whom once he had sailed  the prodigious old hero  it never entered his head that he was not the master of the rabble there below him  he had but one idea an idea of passion and that was his desire for vengeance on the murderer of his old skipper  you old stiff mulligan jacobs snarled back  shut up mulligan was bert rhines command in receipt of which he received a venomous stare from the cripple  oh ho my hearty mr pike sneered at the gangster  ill take care of your case never fear  in the meantime and right now fetch out that dog  whereupon he ignored the leader of the mutineers and began calling waltham you dog come out  come out you sneaking cur  come out  another lunatic was the thought that flashed through my mind another lunatic the slave of a single idea  he forgets the mutiny his fidelity to the ship in his personal thirst for vengeance  but did he  even as he forgot and called his hearts desire which was the life of the second mate even then without intention mechanically his sailors considerative eye lifted to note the draw of the sails and roved from sail to sail  thereupon so reminded he returned to his fidelity  well he snarled at bert rhine  go on and get forard before i spit on you you scum and slum  ill give you and the rest of the rats two minutes to return to duty  and the leader with his two fellowgangsters laughed their weird silent laughter  i guess youll listen to our talk first old horse bert rhine retorted  davis get up now and show what kind of a spieler you are dont get cold feet  spit it out to foxy grandpa an tell m whats doin  you damned sealawyer mr pike snarled as davis opened his mouth to speak  bert rhine shrugged his shoulders and half turned on his heel as if to depart as he said quietly  oh well if you dont want to talk      mr pike conceded a point  go on he snarled  spit the dirt out of your system davis but remember one thing youll pay for this and youll pay through the nose go on  the sealawyer cleared his throat in preparation  first of all i aint got no part in this he began  im a sick man an i oughta be in my bunk right now  i aint fit to be on my feet  but theyve asked me to advise em on the law an i have advised em  and the lawwhat is it mr pike broke in  but davis was uncowed  the law is that when the officers is inefficient the crew can take charge peaceably an bring the ship into port  its all law an in the records  there was the abyssinia in eighteen ninetytwo when the masterd died of fever and the mates took to drinkin  go on mr pike shut him off  i dont want your citations  what dye want  spit it out  welland im talkin as an outsider as a sick man off duty thats been asked to talkwell the point is our skipper was a good one but hes gone  our mate is violent seekin the life of the second mate  we dont care about that  what we want is to get into port with our lives an our lives is in danger  we aint hurt nobody  youve done all the bloodshed  youve shot an killed an thrown two men overboard as witnessesll testify to in court  an theres roberts there dead too an headin for the sharksan what for  for defendin himself from murderous an deadly attack as every man can testify an tell the truth the whole truth an nothin but the truth so help m godaint that right men  a confused murmur of assent arose from many of them  you want my job eh mr pike grinned  an what are you goin to do with me  youll be taken care of until we get in an turn you over to the lawful authorities davis answered promptly  most likely you can plead insanity an get off easy  at this moment i felt a stir at my shoulder  it was margaret armed with the long knife of the steward whom she had put at the wheel  youve got another guess comin davis mr pike said  ive got no more talk with you  im goin to talk to the bunch  ill give you fellows just two minutes to choose and ill tell you your choices youve only got two choices  youll turn the second mate over to me an go back to duty and take whats comin to you or youll go to jail with the stripes on you for long sentences  youve got two minutes  the fellows that want jail can stand right where they are  the fellows that dont want jail and are willin to work faithful can walk right back to me here on the poop  two minutes an you can keep your jaws stopped while you think over what its goin to be  he turned his head to me and said in an undertone be ready with that popgun for trouble  an dont hesitate  slap it into emthe swine that think they can put as raw a deal as this over on us  it was buckwheat who made the first move but so tentative was it that it got no farther than a tensing of the legs and a sway forward of the shoulders  nevertheless it was sufficient to start herman lunkenheimer who thrust out his foot and began confidently to walk aft  kid twist gained him in a single spring and kid twist his wrist under the germans throat from behind his knee pressed into the germans back bent the man backward and held him  even as the rifle came to my shoulder the hound bombini drew his knife directly beneath kid twists wrist across the upstretched throat of the man  it was at this instant that i heard mr pikes plug him and pulled the trigger and of all ungodly things the bullet missed and caught the faun who staggered back sat down on the hatch and began to cough  and even as he coughed he still strained with paineloquent eyes to try to understand  no other man moved  herman lunkenheimer released by kid twist sank down on the deck  nor did i shoot again  kid twist stood again by the side of bert rhine and guido bombini fawned near  bert rhine actually visibly smiled  any more of you guys want to promenade aft he queried in velvet tones  two minutes up mr pike declared  an what are you goin to do about it grandpa bert rhine sneered  in a flash the big automatic was out of the mates pocket and he was shooting as fast as he could pull trigger while all hands fled to shelter  but as he had long since told me he was no shot and could effectively use the weapon only at close rangemuzzle to stomach preferably  as we stared at the main deck deserted save for the dead cowboy on his back and for the faun who still sat on the hatch and coughed an eruption of men occurred over the forard edge of the midshiphouse  shoot margaret cried at my back  dont mr pike roared at me  the rifle was at my shoulder when i desisted  louis the cook led the rush aft to us across the top of the house and along the bridge  behind him in single file and not wasting any time came the japanese sailmakers henry the trainingship boy and the other boy buckwheat tom spink brought up the rear  as he came up the ladder of the midship house somebody from beneath must have caught him by a leg in an effort to drag him back  we saw half of him in sight and knew that he was struggling and kicking  he fetched clear abruptly gained the top of the house in a surge and raced aft along the bridge until he overtook and collided with buckwheat who yelled out in fear that a mutineer had caught him     chapter xliii   we who are aft besieged in the high place are stronger in numbers than i dreamed until now when i have just finished taking the ships census of course margaret mr pike and myself are apart  we alone represent the ruling class  with us are servants and serfs faithful to their salt who look to us for guidance and life  i use my words advisedly  tom spink and buckwheat are serfs and nothing else  henry the trainingship boy occupies an anomalous classification  he is of our kind but he can scarcely be called even a cadet of our kind  he will some day win to us and become a mate or a captain but in the meantime of course his past is against him  he is a candidate rising from the serf class to our class  also he is only a youth the iron of his heredity not yet tested and proven  wada louis and the steward are servants of asiatic breed  so are the two japanese sailmakersscarcely servants not to be called slaves but something in between  so all told there are eleven of us aft in the citadel  but our followers are too servantlike and serflike to be offensive fighters they will help us defend the high place against all attack but they are incapable of joining with us in an attack on the other end of the ship they will fight like cornered rats to preserve their lives but they will not advance like tigers upon the enemy  tom spink is faithful but spirit broken  buckwheat is hopelessly of the stupid lowly  henry has not yet won his spurs  on our side remain margaret mr pike and myself  the rest will hold the wall of the poop and fight thereon to the death but they are not to be depended upon in a sortie  at the other end of the shipand i may as well give the roster are the second mate either to be called mellaire or waltham a strong man of our own breed but a renegade the three gangsters killers and jackals bert rhine nosey murphy and kid twist the maltese cockney and tony the crazy greek frank fitzgibbon and richard giller the survivors of the trio of bricklayers anton sorensen and lars jacobsen stupid scandinavian sailormen ditman olansen the crankeyed berserk john hackey and arthur deacon respectively hoodlum and white slaver shorty the mixedbreed clown guido bombini the italian hound andy pay and mulligan jacobs the bitter ones the three topazeyed dreamers who are unclassifiable isaac chantz the wounded jew bob the overgrown dolt the feebleminded faun lungwounded nancy and sundry buyers the two hopeless helpless bosuns and finally the sealawyer charles davis  this makes twentyseven of them against the eleven of us  but there are men strong in viciousness among them  they too have their serfs and bravos  guido bombini and isaac chantz are certainly bravos  and weaklings like sorensen and jacobsen and bob cannot be anything else than slaves to the men who compose the gangster clique  i failed to tell what happened yesterday after mr pike emptied his automatic and cleared the deck  the poop was indubitably ours and there was no possibility of the mutineers making a charge on us in broad daylight  margaret had gone below accompanied by wada to see to the security of the port and starboard doors that open from the cabin directly on the main deck  these are still caulked and tight and fastened on the inside as they have been since the passage of cape horn began  mr pike put one of the sailmakers at the wheel and the steward relieved and starting below was attracted to the port quarter where the patent log that towed astern was made fast  margaret had returned his knife to him and he was carrying it in his hand when his attention was attracted astern to our wake  mike cipriani and bill quigley had managed to catch the lazily moving logline and were clinging to it  the elsinore was moving just fast enough to keep them on the surface instead of dragging them under  above them and about them circled curious and hungry albatrosses cape hens and mollyhawks  even as i glimpsed the situation one of the big birds a tenfooter at least with a teninch beak to the fore dropped down on the italian  releasing his hold with one hand he struck with his knife at the bird  feathers flew and the albatross deflected by the blow fell clumsily into the water  quite methodically just as part of the days work the steward chopped down with his knife catching the logline between the steel edge and the rail  at once no longer buoyed up by the elsinores twoknot drag ahead the wounded men began to swim and flounder  the circling hosts of huge seabirds descended upon them with carnivorous beaks striking at their heads and shoulders and arms  a great screeching and squawking arose from the winged things of prey as they strove for the living meat and yet somehow i was not very profoundly shocked  these were the men whom i had seen eviscerate the shark and toss it overboard and shout with joy as they watched it devoured alive by its brethren  they had played a violent cruel game with the things of life and the things of life now played upon them the same violent cruel game  as they that rise by the sword perish by the sword just so did these two men who had lived cruelly die cruelly  oh well was mr pikes comment weve saved two sacks of mighty good coal        certainly our situation might be worse  we are cooking on the coalstove and on the oilburners  we have servants to cook and serve for us  and most important of all we are in possession of all the food on the elsinore  mr pike makes no mistake  realizing that with our crowd we cannot rush the crowd at the other end of the ship he accepts the siege which as he says consists of the besieged holding all food supplies while the besiegers are on the imminent edge of famine  starve the dogs he growls  starve m until they crawl aft and lick our shoes  maybe you think the custom of carrying the stores aft just happened  only it didnt  before you and i were born it was longestablished and it was established on brass tacks  they knew what they were about the old cusses when they put the grub in the lazarette  louis says there is not more than three days regular whack in the galley that the barrel of hardtack in the forecastle will quickly go and that our chickens which they stole last night from the top of the midshiphouse are equivalent to no more than an additional days supply  in short at the outside limit we are convinced the men will be keen to talk surrender within the week  we are no longer sailing  in last nights darkness we helplessly listened to the men loosing headsailhalyards and letting yards go down on the run  under orders of mr pike i shot blindly and many times into the dark but without result save that we heard the bullets of answering shots strike against the charthouse  so today we have not even a man at the wheel  the elsinore drifts idly on an idle sea and we stand regular watches in the shelter of charthouse and jiggermast  mr pike says it is the laziest time he has had on the whole voyage  i alternate watches with him although when on duty there is little to be done save in the daytime to stand rifle in hand behind the jiggermast and in the night to lurk along the break of the poop  behind the chart house ready to repel assault are my watch of four men tom spink wada buckwheat and louis  henry the two japanese sailmakers and the old steward compose mr pikes watch  it is his orders that no one forard is to be allowed to show himself so today when the second mate appeared at the corner of the midship house i made him take a quick leap back with the thud of my bullet against the iron wall a foot from his head  charles david tried the same game and was similarly stimulated  also this evening after dark mr pike put blockandtackle on the first section of the bridge heaved it out of place and lowered it upon the poop  likewise he hoisted in the ladder at the break of the poop that leads down to the main deck  the men will have to do some climbing if they ever elect to rush us  i am writing this in my watch below  i came off duty at eight oclock and at midnight i go on deck to stay till four tomorrow morning  wada shakes his head and says that the blackwood company should rebate us on the firstclass passage paid in advance  we are working our passage he contends  margaret takes the adventure joyously  it is the first time she has experienced mutiny but she is such a thorough seawoman that she appears like an old hand at the game  she leaves the deck to the mate and me but still acknowledging his leadership she has taken charge below and entirely manages the commissary the cooking and the sleeping arrangements  we still keep our old quarters and she has bedded the new comers in the big afterroom with blankets issued from the slopchest  in a way from the standpoint of her personal welfare the mutiny is the best thing that could have happened to her  it has taken her mind off her father and filled her waking hours with work to do  this afternoon standing above the open boobyhatch i heard her laugh ring out as in the old days coming down the atlantic  yes and she hums snatches of songs under her breath as she works  in the second dogwatch this evening after mr pike had finished dinner and joined us on the poop she told him that if he did not soon rerig his phonograph she was going to start in on the piano  the reason she advanced was the psychological effect such sounds of revelry would have on the starving mutineers        the days pass and nothing of moment happens  we get nowhere  the elsinore without the steadying of her canvas rolls emptily and drifts a lunatic course  sometimes she is bow on to the wind and at other times she is directly before it but at all times she is circling vaguely and hesitantly to get somewhere else than where she is  as an illustration at daylight this morning she came up into the wind as if endeavouring to go about  in the course of half an hour she worked off till the wind was directly abeam  in another half hour she was back into the wind  not until evening did she manage to get the wind on her port bow but when she did she immediately paid off accomplished the complete circle in an hour and recommenced her morning tactics of trying to get into the wind  and there is nothing for us to do save hold the poop against the attack that is never made  mr pike more from force of habit than anything else takes his regular observations and works up the elsinores position  this noon she was eight miles east of yesterdays position yet todays position in longitude was within a mile of where she was four days ago  on the other hand she invariably makes nothing at the rate of seven or eight miles a day  aloft the elsinore is a sad spectacle  all is confusion and disorder the sails unfurled are a slovenly mess along the yards and many loose ends sway dismally to every roll  the only yard that is loose is the mainyard  it is fortunate that wind and wave are mild else would the ironwork carry away and the mutineers find the huge thing of steel about their ears  there is one thing we cannot understand  a week has passed and the men show no signs of being starved into submission  repeatedly and in vain has mr pike interrogated the hands aft with us  one and all from the cook to buckwheat they swear they have no knowledge of any food forard save the small supply in the galley and the barrel of hardtack in the forecastle  yet it is very evident that those forard are not starving we see the smoke from the galleystove and can only conclude that they have food to cook  twice has bert rhine attempted a truce but both times his white flag as soon as it showed above the edge of the midshiphouse was fired upon by mr pike  the last occurrence was two days ago  it is mr pikes intention thoroughly to starve them into submission but now he is beginning to worry about their mysterious food supply  mr pike is not quite himself  he is obsessed i know beyond any doubt with the idea of vengeance on the second mate  on divers occasions now i have come unexpectedly upon him and found him muttering to himself with grim set face or clenching and unclenching his big square fists and grinding his teeth  his conversation continually runs upon the feasibility of our making a night attack forard and he is perpetually questioning tom spink and louis on their ideas of where the various men may be sleepingthe point of which always is where is the second mate likely to be sleeping  no later than yesterday afternoon did he give me most positive proof of his obsession  it was four oclock the beginning of the first dogwatch and he had just relieved me  so careless have we grown that we now stand in broad daylight at the exposed break of the poop  nobody shoots at us and occasionally over the top of the forardhouse shorty sticks up his head and grins or makes clownish faces at us  at such times mr pike studies shortys features through the telescope in an effort to find signs of starvation  yet he admits dolefully that shorty is looking fleshedup  but to return  mr pike had just relieved me yesterday afternoon when the second mate climbed the forecastlehead and sauntered to the very eyes of the elsinore where he stood gazing overside  take a crack at m mr pike said  it was a long shot and i was taking slow and careful aim when he touched my arm  no dont he said  i lowered the little rifle and looked at him inquiringly  you might hit him he explained  and i want him for myself        life is never what we expect it to be  all our voyage from baltimore south to the horn and around the horn has been marked by violence and death  and now that it has culminated in open mutiny there is no more violence much less death  we keep to ourselves aft and the mutineers keep to themselves forard  there is no more harshness no more snarling and bellowing of commands and in this fine weather a general festival obtains  aft mr pike and margaret alternate with phonograph and piano and forard although we cannot see them a fullfledged foofoo band makes most of the day and night hideous  a squealing accordion that tom spink says was the property of mike cipriani is played by guido bombini who sets the pace and seems the leader of the foofoo  there are two broken reeded harmonicas  someone plays a jewsharp  then there are homemade fifes and whistles and drums combs covered with paper extemporized triangles and bones made from ribs of salt horse such as negro minstrels use  the whole crew seems to compose the band and like a lot of monkeyfolk rejoicing in rude rhythm emphasizes the beat by hammering kerosene cans fryingpans and all sorts of things metallic or reverberant  some genius has rigged a line to the clapper of the ships bell on the forecastlehead and clangs it horribly in the big foofoo crises though bombini can be heard censuring him severely on occasion  and to cap it all the foghorn machine pumps in at the oddest moments in imitation of a big bass viol  and this is mutiny on the high seas  almost every hour of my deckwatches i listen to this infernal din and am maddened into desire to join with mr pike in a night attack and put these rebellious and inharmonious slaves to work  yet they are not entirely inharmonious  guido bombini has a respectable though untrained tenor voice and has surprised me by a variety of selections not only from verdi but from wagner and massenet  bert rhine and his crowd are full of ragtime junk and one phrase that has caught the fancy of all hands and which they roar out at all times is its a bear  its a bear  its a bear  this morning nancy evidently very strongly urged gave a doleful rendering of flying cloud  yes and in the second dogwatch last evening our three topaz eyed dreamers sang some folksong strangely sweet and sad  and this is mutiny  as i write i can scarcely believe it  yet i know mr pike keeps the watch over my head  i hear the shrill laughter of the steward and louis over some ancient chinese joke  wada and the sailmakers in the pantry are i know talking japanese politics  and from across the cabin along the narrow halls i can hear margaret softly humming as she goes to bed  but all doubts vanish at the stroke of eight bells when i go on deck to relieve mr pike who lingers a moment for a gain as he calls it  say he said confidentially you and i can clean out the whole gang all we got to do is sneak forard and turn loose  as soon as we begin to shoot up half of emll bolt aftlobsters like nancy an sundry buyers an jacobsen an bob an shorty an them three castaways for instance  an while theyre doin that an our bunch on the poop is takin em in you an me can make a pretty big hole in them thats left what dye say  i hesitated thinking of margaret  why say he urged once i jumped into that focsle at close range id start right in blimblamblim fast as you could wink nailing them gangsters an bombini an the sheeny an deacon an the cockney an mulligan jacobs an    an    waltham  that would be mine i smiled  youve only eight shots in your colt  mr pike considered a moment and revised his list  all right he agreed i guess ill have to let jacobs go  what dye say  are you game  still i hesitated but before i could speak he anticipated me and returned to his fidelity  no you cant do it mr pathurst  if by any luck they got the both of us    no well just stay aft and sit tight until theyre starved to it    but where they get their tucker gets me  forard shes as bare as a bone as any decent ship ought to be and yet look at em rolling hog fat  and by rights they ought to aquit eatin a week ago     chapter xliv   yes it is certainly mutiny  collecting water from the leaders of the charthouse in a shower of rain this morning buckwheat exposed himself and a long lucky revolvershot from forard caught him in the shoulder the bullet was smallcalibre and spent ere it reached him so that he received no more than a fleshwound though he carried on as if he were dying until mr pike hushed his noise by cuffing his ears  i should not like to have mr pike for my surgeon  he probed for the bullet with his little finger which was far too big for the aperture and with his little finger while with his other hand he threatened another earclout he gouged out the leaden pellet  then he sent the boy below where margaret took him in charge with antiseptics and dressings  i see her so rarely that a halfhour alone with her these days is an adventure  she is busy morning to night in keeping her house in order as i write this through my open door i can hear her laying the law down to the men in the afterroom  she has issued underclothes all around from the slopchest and is ordering them to take a bath in the rainwater just caught  and to make sure of their thoroughness in the matter she has told off louis and the steward to supervise the operation  also she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after room  and to cap everything they are to scrub walls ceiling everything and then start tomorrow morning at painting  all of which serves to convince me almost that mutiny does not obtain and that i have imagined it  but no  i hear buckwheat blubbering and demanding how he can take a bath in his wounded condition  i wait and listen for margarets judgment  nor am i disappointed  tom spink and henry are told off to the task and the thorough scrubbing of buckwheat is assured        the mutineers are not starving  today they have been fishing for albatrosses  a few minutes after they caught the first one its carcase was flung overboard  mr pike studied it through his seaglasses and i heard him grit his teeth when he made certain that it was not the mere feathers and skin but the entire carcass  they had taken only its wing bones to make into pipestems  the inference was obvious starving men would not throw meat away in such fashion  but where do they get their food  it is a seamystery in itself although i might not so deem it were it not for mr pike  i think and think till my brain is all frazzled out he tells me and yet i cant get a line on it  i know every inch of space on the elsinore and know there isnt an ounce of grub anywhere forard and yet they eat  ive overhauled the lazarette  as near as i can make it out nothing is missing  then where do they get it  thats what i want to know  where do they get it  i know that this morning he spent hours in the lazarette with the steward and the cook overhauling and checking off from the lists of the baltimore agents  and i know that they came up out of the lazarette the three of them dripping with perspiration and baffled  the steward has raised the hypothesis that first of all there were extra stores left over from the previous voyage or from previous voyages and next that the stealing of these stores must have taken place during the nightwatches when it was mr pikes turn below  at any rate the mate takes the food mystery almost as much to heart as he takes the persistent and propinquitous existence of sidney waltham  i am coming to realize the meaning of watchandwatch  to begin with i spend on deck twelve hours and a fraction more of each twentyfour  a fair portion of the remaining twelve is spent in eating in dressing and in undressing and with margaret  as a result i feel the need for more sleep than i am getting  i scarcely read at all now  the moment my head touches the pillow i am asleep  oh i sleep like a baby eat like a navvy and in years have not enjoyed such physical wellbeing  i tried to read george moore last night and was dreadfully bored  he may be a realist but i solemnly aver he does not know reality on that tight little shelteredlife archipelago of his  if he could windjam around the horn just one voyage he would be twice the writer  and mr pike for practically all of his sixtynine years has stood his watchandwatch with many a spillover of watches into watches  and yet he is iron  in a struggle with him i am confident that he would break me like so much straw  he is truly a prodigy of a man and so far as to day is concerned an anachronism  the faun is not dead despite my unlucky bullet  henry insisted that he caught a glimpse of him yesterday  today i saw him myself  he came to the corner of the midshiphouse and gazed wistfully aft at the poop straining and eager to understand  in the same way i have often seen possum gaze at me  it has just struck me that of our eight followers five are asiatic and only three are our own breed  somehow it reminds me of india and of clive and hastings  and the fine weather continues and we wonder how long a time must elapse ere our mutineers eat up their mysterious food and are starved back to work  we are almost due west of valparaiso and quite a bit less than a thousand miles off the west coast of south america  the light northerly breezes varying from northeast to west would according to mr pike work us in nicely for valparaiso if only we had sail on the elsinore  as it is sailless she drifts around and about and makes nowhere save for the slight northerly drift each day        mr pike is beside himself  in the past two days he has displayed increasing possession of himself by the one idea of vengeance on the second mate  it is not the mutiny irksome as it is and helpless as it makes him it is the presence of the murderer of his oldtime and admired skipper captain somers  the mate grins at the mutiny calls it a snap speaks gleefully of how his wages are running up and regrets that he is not ashore where he would be able to take a hand in gambling on the reinsurance  but the sight of sidney waltham calmly gazing at sea and sky from the forecastle head or astride the far end of the bowsprit and fishing for sharks saddens him  yesterday coming to relieve me he borrowed my rifle and turned loose the stream of tiny pellets on the second mate who coolly made his line secure ere he scrambled inboard  of course it was only one chance in a hundred that mr pike might have hit him but sidney waltham did not care to encourage the chance  and yet it is not like mutinynot like the conventional mutiny i absorbed as a boy and which has become classic in the literature of the sea  there is no handtohand fighting no crash of cannon and flash of cutlass no sailors drinking grog no lighted matches held over open powdermagazines  heavensthere isnt a single cutlass nor a powder magazine on board  and as for grog not a man has had a drink since baltimore        well it is mutiny after all  i shall never doubt it again  it may be nineteenthirteen mutiny on a coalcarrier with feeblings and imbeciles and criminals for mutineers but at any rate mutiny it is and at least in the number of deaths it is reminiscent of the old days  for things have happened since last i had opportunity to write up this log  for that matter i am now the keeper of the elsinores official log as well in which work margaret helps me  and i might have known it would happen  at four yesterday morning i relieved mr pike  when in the darkness i came up to him at the break of the poop i had to speak to him twice to make him aware of my presence and then he merely grunted acknowledgment in an absent sort of way  the next moment he brightened up and was himself save that he was too bright  he was making an effort  i felt this but was quite unprepared for what followed  ill be back in a minute he said as he put his leg over the rail and lightly and swiftly lowered himself down into the darkness  there was nothing i could do  to cry out or to attempt to reason with him would only have drawn the mutineers attention  i heard his feet strike the deck beneath as he let go  immediately he started forard little enough precaution he took  i swear that clear to the midship house i heard the dragging agelag of his feet  then that ceased and that was all  i repeat  that was all  never a sound came from forard  i held my watch till daylight  i held it till margaret came on deck with her cheery what ho of the night brave mariner  i held the next watch which should have been the mates till midday eating both breakfast and lunch behind the sheltering jiggermast  and i held all afternoon and through both dogwatches my dinner served likewise on the deck  and that was all  nothing happened  the galleystove smoked three times advertising the cooking of three meals  shorty made faces at me as usual across the rim of the forardhouse  the maltese cockney caught an albatross  there was some excitement when tony the greek hooked a shark off the jibboom so big that half a dozen tailed on to the line and failed to land it  but i caught no glimpse of mr pike nor of the renegade sidney waltham  in short it was a lazy quiet day of sunshine and gentle breeze  there was no inkling to what had happened to the mate  was he a prisoner  was he already overside  why were there no shots  he had his big automatic it is inconceivable that he did not use it at least once  margaret and i discussed the affair till we were well aweary but reached no conclusion  she is a true daughter of the race  at the end of the second dogwatch armed with her fathers revolver she insisted on standing the first watch of the night  i compromised with the inevitable by having wada make up my bed on the deck in the shelter of the cabin skylight just forard of the jiggermast  henry the two sailmakers and the steward variously equipped with knives and clubs were stationed along the break of the poop  and right here i wish to pass my first criticism on modern mutiny  on ships like the elsinore there are not enough weapons to go around  the only firearms now aft are captain wests 38 colt revolver and my 22 automatic winchester  the old steward with a penchant for hacking and chopping has his long knife and a butchers cleaver  henry in addition to his sheathknife has a short bar of iron  louis despite a most sanguinary array of butcherknives and a big poker pins his cooks faith on hot water and sees to it that two kettles are always piping on top the cabin stove  buckwheat who on account of his wound is getting all night in for a couple of nights cherishes a hatchet  the rest of our retainers have knives and clubs although yatsuda the first sailmaker carries a handaxe and uchino the second sailmaker sleeping or waking never parts from a clawhammer  tom spink has a harpoon  wada however is the genius  by means of the cabin stove he has made a sharp pikepoint of iron and fitted it to a pole  tomorrow be intends to make more for the other men  it is rather shuddery however to speculate on the terrible assortment of cutting gouging jabbing and slashing weapons with which the mutineers are able to equip themselves from the carpenters shop  if it ever comes to an assault on the poop there will be a weird mess of wounds for the survivors to dress  for that matter master as i am of my little rifle no man could gain the poop in the daytime  of course if rush they will they will rush us in the night when my rifle will be worthless  then it will be blow for blow handtohand and the strongest pates and arms will win  but no  i have just bethought me  we shall be ready for any nightrush ill take a leaf out of modern warfare and show them not only that we are topdog a favourite phrase of the mate but why we are topdog it is simplenight illumination  as i write i work opt the ideagasoline balls of oakum caps and gunpowder from a few cartridges roman candles and flares blue red and green shallow metal receptacles to carry the explosive and inflammable stuff and a triggerlike arrangement by which pulling on a string the caps are exploded in the gunpowder and fire set to the gasolinesoaked oakum and to the flares and candles  it will be brain as well as brawn against mere brawn        i have worked like a trojan all day and the idea is realized  margaret helped me out with suggestions and tom spink did the sailorizing  over our head from the jiggermast the steel stays that carry the three jiggertrysails descend high above the break of the poop and across the main deck to the mizzenmast  a light line has been thrown over each stay and been thrown repeatedly around so as to form an unslipping knot tom spink waited till dark when he went aloft and attached loose rings of stiff wire around the stays below the knots  also he bent on hoisting gear and connected permanent fastenings with the sliding rings  and further between rings and fastenings is a slack of fifty feet of light line  this is the idea after dark each night we shall hoist our three metal washbasins loaded with inflammables up to the stays  the arrangement is such that at the first alarm of a rush by pulling a cord the trigger is pulled that ignites the powder and the very same pull operates a trip device that lets the rings slide down the steel stays  of course suspended from the rings are the illuminators and when they have run down the stays fifty feet the lines will automatically bring them to rest  then all the main deck between the poop and the mizzenmast will be flooded with light while we shall be in comparative darkness  of course each morning before daylight we shall lower all this apparatus to the deck so that the men forard will not guess what we have up our sleeve or rather what we have up on the trysailstays  even today the little of our gear that has to be left standing aroused their curiosity  head after head showed over the edge of the forardhouse as they peeped and peered and tried to make out what we were up to  why i find myself almost looking forward to an attack in order to see the device work     chapter xlv   and what has happened to mr pike remains a mystery  for that matter what has happened to the second mate  in the past three days we have by our eyes taken the census of the mutineers  every man has been seen by us with the sole exception of mr mellaire or sidney waltham as i assume i must correctly name him  he has not appeareddoes not appear and we can only speculate and conjecture  in the past three days various interesting things have taken place margaret stands watch and watch with me day and night the clock around for there is no one of our retainers to whom we can entrust the responsibility of a watch  though mutiny obtains and we are besieged in the high place the weather is so mild and there is so little call on our men that they have grown careless and sleep aft of the charthouse when it is their watch on deck  nothing ever happens and like true sailors they wax fat and lazy  even have i found louis the steward and wada guilty of catnapping  in fact the trainingship boy henry is the only one who has never lapsed  oh yes and i gave tom spink a thrashing yesterday  since the disappearance of the mate he had had little faith in me and had been showing vague signs of insolence and insubordination  both margaret and i had noted it independently  day before yesterday we talked it over  he is a good sailor but weak she said  if we let him go on he will infect the rest  very well ill take him in hand i announced valorously  you will have to she encouraged  be hard  be hard  you must be hard  those who sit in the high places must be hard yet have i discovered that it is hard to be hard  for instance easy enough was it to drop steve roberts as he was in the act of shooting at me  yet it is most difficult to be hard with a chuckleheaded retainer like tom spinkespecially when he continually fails by a shade to give sufficient provocation  for twentyfour hours after my talk with margaret i was on pins and needles to have it out with him yet rather than have had it out with him i should have preferred to see the poop rushed by the gang from the other side  not in a day can the tyro learn to employ the snarling immediacy of mastery of mr pike nor the reposeful voiceless mastery of a captain west  truly the situation was embarrassing  i was not trained in the handling of men and tom spink knew it in his chuckleheaded way  also in his chuckleheaded way he was dispirited by the loss of the mate fearing the mate nevertheless he had depended on the mate to fetch him through with a whole skin or at least alive  on me he has no dependence  what chance had the gentleman passenger and the captains daughter against the gang forard  so he must have reasoned and so reasoning become despairing and desperate  after margaret had told me to be hard i watched tom spink with an eagle eye and he must have sensed my attitude for he carefully forebore from overstepping while all the time he palpitated just on the edge of overstepping  yes and it was clear that buckwheat was watching to learn the outcome of this veiled refractoriness  for that matter the situation was not being missed by our keeneyed asiatics and i know that i caught louis several times verging on the offence of offering me advice  but he knew his place and managed to keep his tongue between his teeth  at last yesterday while i held the watch tom spink was guilty of spitting tobacco juice on the deck  now it must be understood that such an act is as grave an offence of the sea as blasphemy is of the church  it was margaret who came to where i was stationed by the jiggermast and told me what had occurred and it was she who took my rifle and relieved me so that i could go aft  there was the offensive spot and there was tom spink his cheek bulging with a quid  here you get a swab and mop that up i commanded in my harshest manner  tom spink merely rolled his quid with his tongue and regarded me with sneering thoughtfulness  i am sure he was no more surprised than was i by the immediateness of what followed  my fist went out like an arrow from a released bow and tom spink staggered back tripped against the corner of the tarpaulincovered soundingmachine and sprawled on the deck  he tried to make a fight of it but i followed him up giving him no chance to set himself or recover from the surprise of my first onslaught  now it so happens that not since i was a boy have i struck a person with my naked fist and i candidly admit that i enjoyed the trouncing i administered to poor tom spink  yes and in the rapid play about the deck i caught a glimpse of margaret  she had stepped out of the shelter of the mast and was looking on from the corner of the charthouse  yes and more she was looking on with a cool measuring eye  oh it was all very grotesque to be sure  but then mutiny on the high seas in the year nineteenthirteen is also grotesque  no lists here between mailed knights for a ladys favour but merely the trouncing of a chucklehead for spitting on the deck of a coalcarrier  nevertheless the fact that my lady looked on added zest to my enterprise and doubtlessly speed and weight to my blows and at least half a dozen additional clouts to the unlucky sailor  yes man is strangely and wonderfully made  now that i coolly consider the matter i realize that it was essentially the same spirit with which i enjoyed beating up tom spink that i have in the past enjoyed contests of the mind in which i have outepigrammed clever opponents  in the one case one proves himself topdog of the mind in the other topdog of the muscle  whistler and wilde were just as much intellectual bullies as i was a physical bully yesterday morning when i punched tom spink into lying down and staying down  and my knuckles are sore and swollen  i cease writing for a moment to look at them and to hope that they will not stay permanently enlarged  at any rate tom spink took his disciplining and promised to come in and be good  sir i thundered at him quite in mr pikes most bloodthirsty manner  sir he mumbled with bleeding lips  yes sir ill mop it up sir yes sir  i could scarcely keep from laughing in his face the whole thing was so ludicrous but i managed to look my haughtiest and sternest and fiercest while i superintended the deckcleansing  the funniest thing about the affair was that i must have knocked tom spinks quid down his throat for he was gagging and hiccoughing all the time he mopped and scrubbed  the atmosphere aft has been wonderfully clear ever since  tom spink obeys all orders on the jump and buckwheat jumps with equal celerity  as for the five asiatics i feel that they are stouter behind me now that i have shown masterfulness  by punching a mans face i verily believe i have doubled our united strength  and there is no need to punch any of the rest  the asiatics are keen and willing  henry is a true cadet of the breed buckwheat will follow tom spinks lead and tom spink a proper anglosaxon peasant will lead buckwheat all the better by virtue of the punching        two days have passed and two noteworthy things have happened  the men seem to be nearing the end of their mysterious food supply and we have had our first truce  i have noted through the glasses that no more carcasses of the mollyhawks they are now catching are thrown overboard  this means that they have begun to eat the tough and unsavoury creatures although it does not mean of course that they have entirely exhausted their other stores  it was margaret her sailors eye on the falling barometer and on the making stuff adrift in the sky who called my attention to a coming blow  as soon as the sea rises she said well have that loose mainyard and all the rest of the tophamper tumbling down on deck  so it was that i raised the white flag for a parley  bert rhine and charles davis came abaft the midshiphouse and while we talked many faces peered over the forard edge of the house and many forms slouched into view on the deck on each side of the house  well getting tired was bert rhines insolent greeting  anything we can do for you  yes there is i answered sharply  you can save your heads so that when you return to work there will be enough of you left to do the work  if you are making threats charles davis began but was silenced by a glare from the gangster  well what is it bert rhine demanded  cough it off your chest  its for your own good was my reply  it is coming on to blow and all that unfurled canvas aloft will bring the yards down on your heads were safe here aft  you are the ones who will run risks and it is up to you to hustle your crowd aloft and make things fast and shipshape  and if we dont the gangster sneered  why youll take your chances that is all i answered carelessly  i just want to call your attention to the fact that one of those steel yards endon will go through the roof of your forecastle as if it were so much eggshell  bert rhine looked to charles davis for verification and the latter nodded  well talk it over first the gangster announced  and ill give you ten minutes i returned  if at the end of ten minutes youve not started taking in it will be too late  i shall put a bullet into any man who shows himself  all right well talk it over  as they started to go back i called  one moment  they stopped and turned about  what have you done to mr pike i asked  even the impassive bert rhine could not quite conceal his surprise  an what have you done with mr mellaire he retorted  you tell us an well tell you  i am confident of the genuineness of his surprise  evidently the mutineers have been believing us guilty of the disappearance of the second mate just as we have been believing them guilty of the disappearance of the first mate  the more i dwell upon it the more it seems the proposition of the kilkenny cats a case of mutual destruction on the part of the two mates  another thing i said quickly  where do you get your food  bert rhine laughed one of his silent laughs charles davis assumed an expression of mysteriousness and superiority and shorty leaping into view from the corner of the house danced a jig of triumph  i drew out my watch  remember i said youve ten minutes in which to make a start  they turned and went forard and before the ten minutes were up all hands were aloft and stowing canvas  all this time the wind out of the northwest was breezing up  the old familiar harpchords of a rising gale were strumming along the rigging and the men i verily believe from lack of practice were particularly slow at their work  it would be better if the upperandlower topsails are set so that we can heave to margaret suggested  they will steady her and make it more comfortable for us  i seized the idea and improved upon it  better set the upper and lower topsails so that we can handle the ship i called to the gangster who was ordering the men about quite like a mate from the top of the midshiphouse  he considered the idea and then gave the proper orders although it was the maltese cockney with nancy and sundry buyers under him who carried the orders out  i ordered tom spink to the longidle wheel and gave him the course which was due east by the steering compass  this put the wind on our port quarter so that the elsinore began to move through the water before a fair breeze  and due east less than a thousand miles away lay the coast of south america and the port of valparaiso  strange to say none of our mutineers objected to this and after dark as we tore along before a fullsized gale i sent my own men up on top the charthouse to take the gaskets off the spanker  this was the only sail we could set and trim and in every way control  it is true the mizzenbraces were still rigged aft to the poop according to horn practice  but while we could thus trim the mizzenyards the sails themselves in setting or furling were in the hands of the forard crowd  margaret beside me in the darkness at the break of the poop put her hand in mine with a warm pressure as both our tiny watches swayed up the spanker and as both of us held our breaths in an effort to feel the added draw in the elsinores speed  i never wanted to marry a sailor she said  and i thought i was safe in the hands of a landsman like you  and yet here you are with all the stuff of the sea in you running down your easting for port  next thing i suppose ill see you out with a sextant shooting the sun or making starobservations     chapter xlvi   four more days have passed the gale has blown itself out we are not more than three hundred and fifty miles off valparaiso and the elsinore this time due to me and my own stubbornness is rolling in the wind and heading nowhere in a light breeze at the rate of nothing but driftage per hour  in the height of the gusts in the three days and nights of the gale we logged as much as eight and even nine knots  what bothered me was the acquiescence of the mutineers in my programme  they were sensible enough in the simple matter of geography to know what i was doing  they had control of the sails and yet they permitted me to run for the south american coast  more than that as the gale eased on the morning of the third day they actually went aloft set topgallantsails royals and skysails and trimmed the yards to the quartering breeze  this was too much for the saxon streak in me whereupon i wore the elsinore about before the wind fetched her up upon it and lashed the wheel  margaret and i are agreed in the hypothesis that their plan is to get inshore until land is sighted at which time they will desert in the boats  but we dont want them to desert she proclaims with flashing eyes  we are bound for seattle  they must return to duty  theyve got to soon for they are beginning to starve  there isnt a navigator aft i oppose  promptly she withers me with her scorn  you a master of books by all the seablood in your body should be able to pick up the theoretics of navigation while i snap my fingers furthermore remember that i can supply the seamanship  why any squarehead peasant in a six months cramming course at any seaport navigation school can pass the examiners for his navigators papers that means six hours for you  and less  if you cant after an hours reading and an hours practice with the sextant take a latitude observation and work it out ill do it for you  you mean you know  she shook her head  i mean from the little i know that i know i can learn to know a meridian sight and the working out of it  i mean that i can learn to know inside of two hours  strange to say the gale after easing to a mild breeze recrudesced in a sort of afterclap  with sails untrimmed and flapping the consequent smashing crashing and rending of our gear can be imagined  it brought out in alarm every man forard  trim the yards i yelled at bert rhine who backed for counsel by charles davis and the maltese cockney actually came directly beneath me on the main deck in order to hear above the commotion aloft  keep arunnin an you wont have to trim the gangster shouted up to me  want to make land eh i girded down at him  getting hungry eh well you wont make land or anything else in a thousand years once you get all your tophamper piled down on deck  i have forgotten to state that this occurred at midday yesterday  what are you goin to do if we trim charles davis broke in  run off shore i replied and get your gang out in deep sea where it will be starved back to duty  well furl an let you heave to the gangster proposed  i shook my head and held up my rifle  youll have to go aloft to do it and the first man that gets into the shrouds will get this  then she can go to hell for all we care he said with emphatic conclusiveness  and just then the foretopgallantyard carried awayluckily as the bow was downpitched into a trough of seaand when the slow confused and tangled descent was accomplished the big stick lay across the wreck of both bulwarks and of that portion of the bridge between the foremast and the forecastle head  bert rhine heard but could not see the damage wrought  he looked up at me challengingly and sneered  want some more to come down  it could not have happened more apropos  the portbrace and immediately afterwards the starboardbrace of the crojackyardcarried away  this was the big lowest spar on the mizzen and as the huge thing of steel swung wildly back and forth the gangster and his followers turned and crouched as they looked up to see  next the gooseneck of the truss on which it pivoted smashed away  immediately the lifts and lowertopsail sheets parted and with a foreandaft pitch of the ship the spar upended and crashed to the deck upon number three hatch destroying that section of the bridge in its fall  all this was new to the gangsteras it was to mebut charles davis and the maltese cockney thoroughly apprehended the situation  stand out from under i yelled sardonically and the three of them cowered and shrank away as their eyes sought aloft for what new spar was thundering down upon them  the lowertopsail its sheets parted by the fall of the crojackyard was tearing out of the boltropes and ribboning away to leeward and making such an uproar that they might well expect its yard to carry away  since this wreckage of our beautiful gear was all new to me i was quite prepared to see the thing happen  the gangsterleader no sailor but after months at sea intelligent enough and nervously strong enough to appreciate the danger turned his head and looked up at me  and i will do him the credit to say that he took his time while all our world of gear aloft seemed smashing to destruction  i guess well trim yards he capitulated  better get the skysails and royals off margaret said in my ear  while youre about it get in the skysails and royals i shouted down and make a decent job of the gasketing  both charles davis and the maltese cockney advertised their relief in their faces as they heard my words and at a nod from the gangster they started forard on the run to put the orders into effect  never in the whole voyage did our crew spring to it in more lively fashion  and lively fashion was needed to save our gear  as it was they cut away the remnants of the mizzenlowertopsail with their sheath knives and they loosed the mainskysail out of its boltropes  the first infraction of our agreement was on the mainlowertopsail  this they attempted to furl  the carrying away of the crojack and the blowing away of the mizzenlowertopsail gave me freedom to see and aim and when the tiny messengers from my rifle began to spat through the canvas and to spat against the steel of the yard the men strung along it desisted from passing the gaskets  i waved my will to bert rhine who acknowledged me and ordered the sail set again and the yard trimmed  what is the use of running offshore i said to margaret when the kites were snugged down and all yards trimmed on the wind  three hundred and fifty miles off the land is as good as thirtyfive hundred so far as starvation is concerned  so instead of making speed through the water toward deep sea i hove the elsinore to on the starboard tack with no more than leeway driftage to the west and south  but our gallant mutineers had their will of us that very night  in the darkness we could hear the work aloft going on as yards were run down sheets let go and sails dewed up and gasketed  i did try a few random shots and all my reward was to hear the whine and creak of ropes through sheaves and to receive an equally random fire of revolvershots  it is a most curious situation  we of the high place are masters of the steering of the elsinore while those forard are masters of the motor power  the only sail that is wholly ours is the spanker  they control absolutelysheets halyards clewlines buntlines braces and downhaulsevery sail on the fore and main  we control the braces on the mizzen although they control the canvas on the mizzen  for that matter margaret and i fail to comprehend why they do not go aloft any dark night and sever the mizzenbraces at the yardends  all that prevents this we are decided is laziness  for if they did sever the braces that lead aft into our hands they would be compelled to rig new braces forard in some fashion else in the rolling would the mizzenmast be stripped of every spar  and still the mutiny we are enduring is ridiculous and grotesque  there was never a mutiny like it  it violates all standards and precedents  in the old classic mutinies long ere this attacking like tigers the seamen should have swarmed over the poop and killed most of us or been most of them killed  wherefore i sneer at our gallant mutineers and recommend trained nurses for them quite in the manner of mr pike  but margaret shakes her head and insists that human nature is human nature and that under similar circumstances human nature will express itself similarly  in short she points to the number of deaths that have already occurred and declares that on some dark night sooner or later whenever the pinch of hunger sufficiently sharpens we shall see our rascals storming aft  and in the meantime except for the tenseness of it and for the incessant watchfulness which margaret and i alone maintain it is more like a mild adventure more like a page out of some book of romance which ends happily  it is surely romance watch and watch for a man and a woman who love to relieve each others watches  each such relief is a love passage and unforgettable  never was there wooing like itthe muttered surmises of wind and weather the whispered councils the kissed commands in palms of hands the dared contacts of the dark  oh truly i have often since this voyage began told the books to go hang  and yet the books are at the back of the racelife of me  i am what i am out of ten thousand generations of my kind  of that there is no discussion  and yet my midnight philosophy stands the test of my breed  i must have selected my books out of the ten thousand generations that compose me  i have killed a mansteve roberts  as a perishing blond without an alphabet i should have done this unwaveringly  as a perishing blond with an alphabet plus the contents in my brain of the philosophizing of all philosophers i have killed this same man with the same unwaveringness  culture has not emasculated me  i am quite unaffected  it was in the days work and my kind have always been day workers doing the days work whatever it might be in high adventure or dull ploddingness and always doing it  never would i ask to set back the dial of time or event  i would kill steve roberts again under the same circumstances as a matter of course when i say i am unaffected by this happening i do not quite mean it  i am affected  i am aware that the spirit of me is informed with a sober elation of efficiency  i have done something that had to be done as any man will do what has to be done in the course of the days work  yes i am a perishing blond and a man and i sit in the high place and bend the stupid ones to my will and i am a lover loving a royal woman of my own perishing breed and together we occupy and shall occupy the high place of government and command until our kind perish from the earth     chapter xlvii   margaret was right  the mutiny is not violating standards and precedents  we have had our hands full for days and nights  ditman olansen the crankeyed berserker has been killed by wada and the trainingship boy the one lone cadet of our breed has gone overside with the regulation sack of coal at his feet  the poop has been rushed my illuminating invention has proved a success  the men are getting hungry and we still sit in command in the high place  first of all the attack on the poop two nights ago in margarets watch no first i have made another invention  assisted by the old steward who knows as a chinese ought a deal about fireworks and getting my materials from our signal rockets and roman candles i manufactured half a dozen bombs  i dont really think they are very deadly and i know our extemporized fuses are slower than our voyage is at the present time but nevertheless the bombs have served the purpose as you shall see  and now to the attempt to rush the poop  it was in margarets watch from midnight till four in the morning when the attack was made sleeping on the deck by the cabin skylight i was very close to her when her revolver went off and continued to go off  my first spring was to the trippinglines on my illuminators  the igniting and releasing devices worked cleverly  i pulled two of the trippinglines and two of the contraptions exploded into light and noise and at the same time ran automatically down the jiggertrysailstays and automatically fetched up at the ends of their lines  the illumination was instantaneous and gorgeous  henry the two sailmakers and the stewardat least three of them awakened from sound sleep i am sureran to join us along the break of the poop  all the advantage lay with us for we were in the dark while our foes were outlined against the light behind them  but such light  the powder crackled fizzed and spluttered and spilled out the excess of gasolene from the flaming oakum balls so that streams of fire dripped down on the main deck beneath  and the stuff of the signalflares dripped red light and blue and green  there was not much of a fight for the mutineers were shocked by our fireworks  margaret fired her revolver haphazardly while i held my rifle for any that gained the poop  but the attack faded away as quickly as it had come  i did see margaret overshoot some man scaling the poop from the portrail and the next moment i saw wada charging like a buffalo jab him in the chest with the spear he had made and thrust the boarder back and down  that was all  the rest retreated forard on the dead run while the three trysails furled at the foot of the stays next to the mizzen and set on fire by the dripping gasolene went up in flame and burned entirely away and out without setting the rest of the ship on fire  that is one of the virtues of a ship steelmasted and steelstayed  and on the deck beneath us crumpled twisted face hidden so that we could not identify him lay the man whom wada had speared  and now i come to a phase of adventure that is new to me  i have never found it in the books  in short it is carelessness coupled with laziness or vice versa  i had used two of my illuminators  only one remained  an hour later convinced of the movement aft of men along the deck i let go the third and last and with its brightness sent them scurrying forard  whether they were attacking the poop tentatively to learn whether or not i had exhausted my illuminators or whether or not they were trying to rescue ditman olansen we shall never know  the point is they did come aft they were compelled to retreat by my illuminator and it was my last illuminator  and yet i did not start in there and then to manufacture fresh ones  this was carelessness  it was laziness  and i hazarded our lives perhaps if you please on a psychological guess that i had convinced our mutineers that we had an inexhaustible stock of illuminators in reserve  the rest of margarets watch which i shared with her was undisturbed at four i insisted that she go below and turn in but she compromised by taking my own bed behind the skylight  at break of day i was able to make out the body still lying as last i had seen it  at seven oclock before breakfast and while margaret still slept i sent the two boys henry and buckwheat down to the body i stood above them at the rail rifle in hand and ready  but from forard came no signs of life and the lads between them rolled the crankeyed norwegian over so that we could recognize him carried him to the rail and shoved him stiffly across and into the sea  wadas spear thrust had gone clear through him  but before twentyfour hours were up the mutineers evened the score handsomely  they more than evened it for we are so few that we cannot so well afford the loss of one as they can  to begin withand a thing i had anticipated and for which i had prepared my bombswhile margaret and i ate a deckbreakfast in the shelter of the jiggermast a number of the men sneaked aft and got under the overhang of the poop  buckwheat saw them coming and yelled the alarm but it was too late  there was no direct way to get them out  the moment i put my head over the rail to fire at them i knew they would fire up at me with all the advantage in their favour  they were hidden  i had to expose myself  two steel doors tightfastened and caulked against the cape horn seas opened under the overhang of the poop from the cabin on to the main deck these doors the men proceeded to attack with sledgehammers while the rest of the gang sheltered by the midshiphouse showed that it stood ready for the rush when the doors were battered down  inside the steward guarded one door with his hacking knife while with his spear wada guarded the other door  nor while i had dispatched them to this duty was i idle  behind the jiggermast i lighted the fuse of one of my extemporized bombs  when it was sputtering nicely i ran across the poop to the break and dropped the bomb to the main deck beneath at the same time making an effort to toss it in under the overhang where the men battered at the portdoor  but this effort was distracted and made futile by a popping of several revolver shots from the gangways amidships  one is jumpy when softnosed bullets puttputt around him as a result the bomb rolled about on the open deck  nevertheless the illuminators had earned the respect of the mutineers for my fireworks  the sputtering and fizzling of the fuse were too much for them and from under the poop they ran forard like so many scuttling rabbits  i know i could have got a couple with my rifle had i not been occupied with lighting the fuse of a second bomb  margaret managed three wild shots with her revolver and the poop was immediately peppered by a scattering revolver fire from forard  being provident and lazy for i have learned that it takes time and labour to manufacture homemade bombs i pinched off the live end of the fuse in my hand  but the fuse of the first bomb rolling about on the main deck merely fizzled on and as i waited i resolved to shorten my remaining fuses  any of the men who fled had he had the courage could have pinched off the fuse or tossed the bomb overboard or better yet he could have tossed it up amongst us on the poop  it took fully five minutes for that blessed fuse to burn its slow length and when the bomb did go off it was a sad disappointment  i swear it could have been sat upon with nothing more than a jar to ones nerves and yet in so far as the intimidation goes it did its work  the men have not since ventured under the overhang of the poop  that the mutineers were getting short of food was patent  the elsinore sailless drifted about that morning the sport of wind and wave and the gang put many lines overboard for the catching of mollyhawks and albatrosses  oh i worried the hungry fishers with my rifle  no man could show himself forard without having a bullet whop against the ironwork perilously near him  and still they caught birdsnot however without danger to themselves and not without numerous losses of birds due to my rifle  their procedure was to toss their hooks and bait over the rail from shelter and slowly to pay the lines out as the slight windage of the elsinores hull spars and rigging drifted her through the water  when a bird was hooked they hauled in the line still from shelter till it was alongside  this was the ticklish moment  the hook merely a hollow and acuteangled triangle of sheetcopper floating on a piece of board at the end of the line held the bird by pinching its curved beak into the acute angle  the moment the line slacked the bird was released  so when alongside this was the problem to lift the bird out of the water straight up the side of the ship without once jamming and easing and slacking  when they tried to do this from shelter invariably they lost the bird  they worked out a method  when the bird was alongside the several men with revolvers turned loose on me while one man overhauling and keeping the line taut leaped to the rail and quickly hove the bird up and over and inboard  i know this longdistance revolver fire seriously bothered me  one cannot help jumping when death in the form of a piece of flying lead hits the rail beside him or the mast over his head or whines away in a ricochet from the steel shrouds  nevertheless i managed with my rifle to bother the exposed men on the rail to the extent that they lost one hooked bird out of two  and twentysix men require a quantity of albatrosses and mollyhawks every twentyfour hours while they can fish only in the daylight  as the day wore along i improved on my obstructive tactics  when the elsinore was up in the eye of the wind and making sternway i found that by putting the wheel sharply over one way or the other i could swing her bow off  then when she had paid off till the wind was abeam by reversing the wheel hard across to the opposite hardover i could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work her off squarely before it  this made all the woodfloated triangles of birdsnares tow aft along her sides  the first time i was ready for them  with hooks and sinkers on our own lines aft we tossed out grappled captured and broke off nine of their lines  but the next time so slow is the movement of so large a ship the mutineers hauled all their lines safely inboard ere they towed aft within striking distance of my grapnels  still i improved  as long as i kept the elsinore before the wind they could not fish  i experimented  once before it by means of a winged out spanker coupled with patient and careful steering i could keep her before it  this i did hour by hour one of my men relieving another at the wheel  as a result all fishing ceased  margaret was holding the first dogwatch four to six  henry was at the wheel steering  wada and louis were below cooking the evening meal over the big coalstove and the oilburners  i had just come up from below and was standing beside the soundingmachine not half a dozen feet from henry at the wheel  some obscure sound from the ventilator must have attracted me for i was gazing at it when the thing happened  but first the ventilator  this is a steel shaft that leads up from the coalcarrying bowels of the ship beneath the lazarette and that wins to the outsideworld via the afterwall of the charthouse  in fact it occupies the hollow inside of the double walls of the afterwall of the charthouse  its opening at the height of a mans head is screened with iron bars so closely set that no maturebodied rat can squeeze between  also this opening commands the wheel which is a scant fifteen feet away and directly across the boobyhatch  some mutineer crawling along the space between the coal and the deck of the lower hold had climbed the ventilator shaft and was able to take aim through the slits between the bars  practically simultaneously i saw the outrush of smoke and heard the report  i heard a grunt from henry and turning my head saw him cling to the spokes and turn the wheel half a revolution as he sank to the deck  it must have been a lucky shot  the boy was perforated through the heart or very near to the heartwe have no time for postmortems on the elsinore  tom spink and the second sailmaker uchino sprang to henrys side  the revolver continued to go off through the ventilator slits and the bullets thudded into the front of the half wheelhouse all about them fortunately they were not hit and they immediately scrambled out of range  the boy quivered for the space of a few seconds and ceased to move and one more cadet of the perishing breed perished as he did his days work at the wheel of the elsinore off the west coast of south america bound from baltimore to seattle with a cargo of coal     chapter xlviii   the situation is hopelessly grotesque  we in the high place command the food of the elsinore but the mutineers have captured her steeringgear  that is to say they have captured it without coming into possession of it  they cannot steer neither can we  the poop which is the high place is ours  the wheel is on the poop yet we cannot touch the wheel  from that slitted opening in the ventilatorshaft they are able to shoot down any man who approaches the wheel  and with that steel wall of the charthouse as a shield they laugh at us as from a conning tower  i have a plan but it is not worth while putting into execution unless its need becomes imperative  in the darkness of night it would be an easy trick to disconnect the steeringgear from the short tiller on the rudderhead and then by rerigging the preventer tackles steer from both sides of the poop well enough forard to be out of the range of the ventilator  in the meantime in this fine weather the elsinore drifts as she lists or as the windage of her lists and the seamovement of waves lists  and she can well drift  let the mutineers starve  they can best be brought to their senses through their stomachs        and what are wits for if not for use  i am breaking the mens hungry hearts  it is great fun in its way  the mollyhawks and albatrosses after their fashion have followed the elsinore up out of their own latitudes  this means that there are only so many of them and that their numbers are not recruited  syllogism major premise a definite and limited amount of birdmeat minor premise the only food the mutineers now have is birdmeat conclusion destroy the available food and the mutineers will be compelled to come back to duty  i have acted on this bit of logic  i began experimentally by tossing small chunks of fat pork and crusts of stale bread overside  when the birds descended for the feast i shot them  every carcass thus left floating on the surface of the sea was so much less meat for the mutineers  but i bettered the method  yesterday i overhauled the medicinechest and i dosed my chunks of fat pork and bread with the contents of every bottle that bore a label of skull and crossbones  i even added roughon rats to the deadliness of the mixturethis on the suggestion of the steward  and today behold there is no bird left in the sky  true while i played my game yesterday the mutineers hooked a few of the birds but now the rest are gone and that is bound to be the last food for the men forard until they resume duty  yes it is grotesque  it is a boys game  it reads like midshipman easy like frank mildmay like frank reade jr and yet i faith life and deaths in the issue  i have just gone over the toll of our dead since the voyage began  first was christian jespersen killed by osullivan when that maniac aspired to throw overboard andy fays seaboots then osullivan because he interfered with charles davis sleep brained by that worthy with a steel marlinspike next petro marinkovich just ere we began the passage of the horn murdered undoubtedly by the gangster clique his life cut out of him with knives his carcass left lying on deck to be found by us and be buried by us and the samurai captain west a sudden though not a violent death albeit occurring in the midst of all elemental violence as mr pike clawed the elsinore off the leeshore of the horn and boney the splinter following washed overboard to drown as we cleared the sea gashing rocktooth where the southern tip of the continent bit into the stormwrath of the antarctic and the bigfooted clumsy youth of a finnish carpenter hove overside as a jonah by his fellows who believed that finns control the winds and mike cipriani and bill quigley rome and ireland shot down on the poop and flung overboard alive by mr pike still alive and clinging to the logline cut adrift by the steward to be eaten alive by greatbeaked albatrosses mollyhawks and sootyplumaged cape hens steve roberts onetime cowboy shot by me as he tried to shoot me herman lunkenheimer his throat cut before all of us by the hound bombini as kid twist stretched the throat taut from behind the two mates mr pike and mr mellaire mutually destroying each other in what must have been an unwitnessed epic combat ditman olansen speared by wada as he charged berserk at the head of the mutineers in the attempt to rush the poop and last henry the cadet of the perishing house shot at the wheel from the ventilatorshaft in the course of his days work  no as i contemplate this rollcall of the dead which i have just made i see that we are not playing a boys game  why we have lost a third of us and the bloodiest battles of history have rarely achieved such a percentage of mortality  fourteen of us have gone overside and who can tell the end  nevertheless here we are masters of matter adventurers in the micro organic planetweighers sunanalysers starrovers goddreamers equipped with the human wisdom of all the ages and yet quoting mr pike to come down to brass tacks we are a lot of primitive beasts fighting bestially slaying bestially pursuing bestially food and water air for our lungs a dry space above the deep and carcasses skincovered and intact  and over this menagerie of beasts margaret and i with our asiatics under us rule topdog  we are all dogsthere is no getting away from it  and we the fairpigmented ones by the seed of our ancestry rulers in the high place shall remain topdog over the rest of the dogs  oh there is material in plenty for the cogitation of any philosopher on a windjammer in mutiny in this year of our lord 1913        henry was the fourteenth of us to go overside into the dark and salty disintegration of the sea  and in one day he has been well avenged for two of the mutineers have followed him  the steward called my attention to what was taking place  he touched my arm half beyond his servants self as he gloated forard at the men heaving two corpses overside weighted with coal they sank immediately so that we could not identify them  they have been fighting i said  it is good that they should fight among themselves  but the old chinese merely grinned and shook his head  you dont think they have been fighting i queried  no fight  they eatm mollyhawk and albatross mollyhawk and albatross eatm fat pork two men he die plenty men much sick you bet damn to hell me very much glad  i savve  and i think he was right  while i was busy baiting the seabirds the mutineers were catching them and of a surety they must have caught some that had eaten of my various poisons  the two poisoned ones went over the side yesterday  since then we have taken the census  two men only have not appeared and they are bob the fat and overgrown feebling youth and of all creatures the faun  it seems my fate that i had to destroy the faunthe poor tortured faun always willing and eager ever desirous to please  there is a madness of ill luck in all this  why couldnt the two dead men have been charles davis and tony the greek  or bert rhine and kid twist or bombini and andy fay  yes and in my heart i know i should have felt better had it been isaac chantz and arthur deacon or nancy and sundry buyers or shorty and larry        the steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice  next time we chuckm overboard like henry much better we use old iron  getting short of coal i asked  he nodded affirmation  we use a great deal of coal in our cooking and when the present supply gives out we shall have to cut through a bulkhead to get at the cargo     chapter xlix   the situation grows tense  there are no more seabirds and the mutineers are starving  yesterday i talked with bert rhine  today i talked with him again and he will never forget i am certain the little talk we had this morning  to begin with last evening at five oclock i heard his voice issuing from between the slits of the ventilator in the afterwall of the chart house  standing at the corner of the house quite out of range i answered him  getting hungry i jeered  let me tell you what we are going to have for dinner  i have just been down and seen the preparations  now listen first caviare on toast then clam bouillon and creamed lobster and tinned lamb chops with french peasyou know the peas that melt in ones mouth and california asparagus with mayonnaise andoh i forgot to mention fried potatoes and cold pork and beans and peach pie and coffee real coffee  doesnt it make you hungry for your east side and say think of the free lunch going to waste right now in a thousand saloons in good old new york  i had told him the truth  the dinner i described principally coming out of tins and bottles to be sure was the dinner we were to eat  cut that he snarled  i want to talk business with you  right down to brass tacks i gibed  very well when are you and the rest of your rats going to turn to  cut that he reiterated  ive got you where 1 want you now  take it from me im givin it straight  im not tellin you how but ive got you under my thumb  when i come down on you youll crack  hell is full of cocksure rats like you i retorted although i never dreamed how soon he would be writhing in the particular hell preparing for him  forget it he sneered back  ive got you where i want you  im just tellin you thats all  pardon me i replied when i tell you that im from missouri  youll have to show me  and as i thus talked the thought went through my mind of how i naturally sought out the phrases of his own vocabulary in order to make myself intelligible to him  the situation was bestial with sixteen of our complement already gone into the dark and the terms i employed perforce were terms of bestiality  and i thought also of i who was thus compelled to dismiss the dreams of the utopians the visions of the poets the kingthoughts of the kingthinkers in a discussion with this ripened product of the new york city inferno  to him i must talk in the elemental terms of life and death of food and water of brutality and cruelty  i give you your choice he went on  give in now an you wont be hurt none of you  and if we dont i dared airily  youll be sorry you was ever born  you aint a mushhead youve got a girl there thats stuck on you  its about time you think of her  you aint altogether a mutt  you get my drive  ay i did get it and somehow across my brain flashed a vision of all i had ever read and heard of the siege of the legations at peking and of the plans of the white men for their womenkind in the event of the yellow hordes breaking through the last lines of defence  ay and the old steward got it for i saw his black eyes glint murderously in their narrow tilted slits  he knew the drift of the gangsters meaning  you get my drive the gangster repeated  and i knew anger  not ordinary anger but cold anger  and i caught a vision of the high place in which we had sat and ruled down the ages in all lands on all seas  i saw my kind our women with us in forlorn hopes and lost endeavours pent in hill fortresses rotted in jungle fastnesses cut down to the last one on the decks of rocking ships  and always our women with us had we ruled the beasts  we might die our women with us but living we had ruled  it was a royal vision i glimpsed  ay and in the purple of it i grasped the ethic which was the stuff of the fabric of which it was builded  it was the sacred trust of the seed the bequest of duty handed down from all ancestors  and i flamed more coldly  it was not redbrute anger  it was intellectual  it was based on concept and history it was the philosophy of action of the strong and the pride of the strong in their own strength  now at last i knew nietzsche  i knew the rightness of the books the relation of high thinking to highconduct the transmutation of midnight thought into action in the high place on the poop of a coal carrier in the year nineteenthirteen my woman beside me my ancestors behind me my slanteyed servitors under me the beasts beneath me and beneath the heel of me  god  i felt kingly  i knew at last the meaning of kingship  my anger was white and cold  this subterranean rat of a miserable human crawling through the bowels of the ship to threaten me and mine  a rat in the shelter of a knothole making a noise as beastlike as any rat ever made  and it was in this spirit that i answered the gangster  when you crawl on your belly along the open deck in the broad light of day like a yellow cur that has been licked to obedience and when you show by your every action that you like it and are glad to do it then and not until then will i talk with you  thereafter for the next ten minutes he shouted all the billingsgate of his kind at me through the slits in the ventilator  but i made no reply i listened and i listened coldly and as i listened i knew why the english had blown their mutinous sepoys from the mouths of cannon in india long years ago        and when this morning i saw the steward struggling with a fivegallon carboy of sulphuric acid i never dreamed the use he intended for it  in the meantime i was devising another way to overcome that deadly ventilator shaft  the scheme was so simple that i was shamed in that it had not occurred to me at the very beginning  the slitted opening was small  two sacks of flour in a wooden frame suspended by ropes from the edge of the charthouse roof directly above would effectually cover the opening and block all revolver fire  no sooner thought than done  tom spink and louis were on top the chart house with me and preparing to lower the flour when we heard a voice issuing from the shaft  whos in there now i demanded  speak up  im givin you a last chance bert rhine answered  and just then around the corner of the house stepped the steward  in his hand he carried a large galvanized pail and my casual thought was that he had come to get rainwater from the barrels  even as i thought it he made a sweeping halfcircle with the pail and sloshed its contents into the ventilatoropening  and even as the liquid flew through the air i knew it for what it wasundiluted sulphuric acid two gallons of it from the carboy  the gangster must have received the liquid fire in the face and eyes and in the shock of pain he must have released all holds and fallen upon the coal at the bottom of the shaft  his cries and shrieks of anguish were terrible and i was reminded of the starving rats which had squealed up that same shaft during the first months of the voyage  the thing was sickening  i prefer that men be killed cleanly and easily  the agony of the wretch i did not fully realize until the steward his bare forearms sprayed by the splash from the ventilator slats suddenly felt the bite of the acid through his tight whole skin and made a mad rush for the waterbarrel at the corner of the house  and bert rhine the silent man of soundless laughter screaming below there on the coal was enduring the bite of the acid in his eyes  we covered the ventilator opening with our flourdevice the screams from below ceased as the victim was evidently dragged forard across the coal by his mates and yet i confess to a miserable forenoon  as carlyle has said death is easy all men must die but to receive two gallons of fullstrength sulphuric acid full in the face is a vastly different and vastly more horrible thing than merely to die  fortunately margaret was below at the time and after a few minutes in which i recovered my balance i bullied and swore all our hands into keeping the happening from her        oh well and we have got ours in retaliation  off and on through all of yesterday after the ventilator tragedy there were noises beneath the cabin floor or deck  we heard them under the diningtable under the stewards pantry under margarets stateroom  this deck is overlaid with wood but under the wood is iron or steel rather such as of which the whole elsinore is builded  margaret and i followed by louis wada and the steward walked about from place to place wherever the sounds arose of tappings and of cold chisels against iron  the tappings seemed to come from everywhere but we concluded that the concentration necessary on any spot to make an opening large enough for a mans body would inevitably draw our attention to that spot  and as margaret said  if they do manage to cut through they must come up headfirst and in such emergence what chance would they have against us  so i relieved buckwheat from deck duty placed him on watch over the cabin floor to be relieved by the steward in margarets watches  in the late afternoon after prodigious hammerings and clangings in a score of places all noises ceased  neither in the first and second dog watches nor in the first watch of the night were the noises resumed when i took charge of the poop at midnight buckwheat relieved the steward in the vigil over the cabin floor and as i leaned on the rail at the break of the poop while my four hours dragged slowly by least of all did i apprehend danger from the cabinespecially when i considered the twogallon pail of raw sulphuric acid ready to hand for the first head that might arise through an opening in the floor not yet made  our rascals forard might scale the poop or cross aloft from mizzenmast to jigger and descend upon our heads but how they could invade us through the floor was beyond me  but they did invade  a modern ship is a complex affair  how was i to guess the manner of the invasion  it was two in the morning and for an hour i had been puzzling my head with watching the smoke arise from the afterdivision of the forardhouse and with wondering why the mutineers should have up steam in the donkeyengine at such an ungodly hour  not on the whole voyage had the donkeyengine been used  four bells had just struck and i was leaning on the rail at the break of the poop when i heard a prodigious coughing and choking from aft  next wada ran across the deck to me  big trouble with buckwheat he blurted at me  you go quick  i shoved him my rifle and left him on guard while i raced around the charthouse  a lighted match in the hands of tom spink directed me between the boobyhatch and the wheel sitting up and rocking back and forth with wringings of hands and wavings of arms tears of agony bursting from his eyes was buckwheat  my first thought was that in some stupid way he had got the acid into his own eyes  but the terrible fashion in which he coughed and strangled would quickly have undeceived me had not louis bending over the boobycompanion uttered a startled exclamation  i joined him and one whiff of the air that came up from below made me catch my breath and gasp  i had inhaled sulphur  on the instant i forgot the elsinore the mutineers forard everything save one thing  the next i know i was down the boobyladder and reeling dizzily about the big afterroom as the sulphur fumes bit my lungs and strangled me  by the dim light of a sealantern i saw the old steward on hands and knees coughing and gasping the while he shook awake yatsuda the first sail maker  uchino the second sailmaker still strangled in his sleep  it struck me that the air might be better nearer the floor and i proved it when i dropped on my hands and knees  i rolled uchino out of his blankets with a quick jerk wrapped the blankets about my head face and mouth arose to my feet and dashed forard into the hall  after a couple of collisions with the woodwork i again dropped to the floor and rearranged the blankets so that while my mouth remained covered i could draw or withdraw a thickness across my eyes  the pain of the fumes was bad enough but the real hardship was the dizziness i suffered  i blundered into the stewards pantry and out of it missed the crosshall stumbled through the next starboard opening in the long hall and found myself bent double by violent collision with the diningroom table  but i had my bearings  feeling my way around the table and bumping most of the poisoned breath out of me against the rotundbellied stove i emerged in the crosshall and made my way to starboard  here at the base of the chartroom stairway i gained the hall that led aft  by this time my own situation seemed so serious that careless of any collision i went aft in long leaps  margarets door was open  i plunged into her room  the moment i drew the blanketthickness from my eyes i knew blindness and a modicum of what bert rhine must have suffered  oh the intolerable bite of the sulphur in my lungs nostrils eyes and brain  no light burned in the room  i could only strangle and stumble forard to margarets bed upon which i collapsed  she was not there  i felt about and i felt only the warm hollow her body had left in the undersheet  even in my agony and helplessness the intimacy of that warmth her body had left was very dear to me  between the lack of oxygen in my lungs due to the blankets the pain of the sulphur and the mortal dizziness in my brain i felt that i might well cease there where the linen warmed my hand  perhaps i should have ceased had i not heard a terrible coughing from along the hall  it was new life to me  i fell from bed to floor and managed to get upright until i gained the hall where again i fell thereafter i crawled on hands and knees to the foot of the stairway  by means of the newelpost i drew myself upright and listened  near me something moved and strangled  i fell upon it and found in my arms all the softness of margaret  how describe that battle up the stairway  it was a crucifixion of struggle an agelong nightmare of agony  time after time as my consciousness blurred the temptation was upon me to cease all effort and let myself blur down into the ultimate dark  i fought my way step by step  margaret was now quite unconscious and i lifted her body step by step or dragged it several steps at a time and fell with it and back with it and lost much that had been so hardly gained  and yet out of it all this i remember that warm soft body of hers was the dearest thing in the worldvastly more dear than the pleasant land i remotely remembered than all the books and all the humans i had ever known than the deck above with its sweet pure air softly blowing under the cool starry sky  as i look back upon it i am aware of one thing the thought of leaving her there and saving myself never crossed my mind  the one place for me was where she was  truly this which i write seems absurd and purple yet it was not absurd during those long minutes on the chartroom stairway  one must taste death for a few centuries of such agony ere he can receive sanction for purple passages  and as i fought my screaming flesh my reeling brain and climbed that upward way i prayed one prayer that the charthouse doors out upon the poop might not be shut  life and death lay right there in that one point of the issue  was there any creature of my creatures aft with common sense and anticipation sufficient to make him think to open those doors how i yearned for one man for one proved henchman such as mr pike to be on the poop  as it was with the sole exception of tom spink and buckwheat my men were asiatics  i gained the top of the stairway but was too far gone to rise to my feet  nor could i rise upright on my knees  i crawled like any four legged animalnay i wormed my way like a snake prone to the deck  it was a matter of several feet to the doorway  i died a score of times in those several feet but ever i endured the agony of resurrection and dragged margaret with me  sometimes the full strength i could exert did not move her and i lay with her and coughed and strangled my way through to another resurrection  and the door was open  the doors to starboard and to port were both open and as the elsinore rolled a draught through the charthouse hall my lungs filled with pure cool air  as i drew myself across the high threshold and pulled margaret after me from very far away i heard the cries of men and the reports of rifle and revolver  and ere i fainted into the blackness on my side staring my pain gone so beyond endurance that it had achieved its own anaesthesia i glimpsed dreamlike and distant the sharply silhouetted pooprail dark forms that cut and thrust and smote and beyond the mizzenmast brightly lighted by our illuminators        well the mutineers failed to take the poop  my five asiatics and two white men had held the citadel while margaret and i lay unconscious side by side  the whole affair was very simple  modern maritime quarantine demands that ships shall not carry vermin that are themselves plaguecarriers  in the donkeyengine section of the forard house is a complete fumigating apparatus  the mutineers had merely to lay and fasten the pipes aft across the coal to chisel a hole through the doubledeck of steel and wood under the cabin and to connect up and begin to pump  buckwheat had fallen asleep and been awakened by the strangling sulphur fumes  we in the high place had been smoked out by our rascals like so many rats  it was wada who had opened one of the doors  the old steward had opened the other  together they had attempted the descent of the stairway and been driven back by the fumes  then they had engaged in the struggle to repel the rush from forard  margaret and i are agreed that sulphur excessively inhaled leaves the lungs sore  only now after a lapse of a dozen hours can we draw breath in anything that resembles comfort  but still my lungs were not so sore as to prevent my telling her what i had learned she meant to me  and yet she is only a womani tell her so i tell her that there are at least seven hundred and fifty millions of twolegged longhaired gentlevoiced softbodied female humans like her on the planet and that she is really swamped by the immensity of numbers of her sex and kind  but i tell her something more  i tell her that of all of them she is the only one  and better yet to myself and for myself i believe it  i know it  the last least part of me and all of me proclaims it  love is wonderful  it is the everlasting and miraculous amazement  oh trust me i know the old hard scientific method of weighing and calculating and classifying love  it is a profound foolishness a cosmic trick and quip to the contemplative eye of the philosopheryes and of the futurist  but when one forsakes such intellectual fleshpots and becomes mere human and male human in short a lover then all he may do and which is what he cannot help doing is to yield to the compulsions of being and throw both his arms around love and hold it closer to him than is his own heart close to him  this is the summit of his life and of mans life  higher than this no man may rise  the philosophers toil and struggle on molehill peaks far below  he who has not loved has not tasted the ultimate sweet of living  i know  i love margaret a woman she is desirable     chapter l   in the past twentyfour hours many things have happened  to begin with we nearly lost the steward in the second dogwatch last evening  through the slits in the ventilator some man thrust a knife into the sacks of flour and cut them wide open from top to bottom  in the dark the flour poured to the deck unobserved  of course the man behind could not see through the screen of empty sacks but he took a blind potshot at pointblank range when the steward went by slipsloppily dragging the heels of his slippers  fortunately it was a miss but so close a miss was it that his cheek and neck were burned with powder grains  at six bells in the first watch came another surprise  tom spink came to me where i stood guard at the forard end of the poop  his voice shook as he spoke  for the love of god sir theyve come he said  who i asked sharply  them he chattered  the ones that come aboard off the horn sir the three drownded sailors  theyre there aft sir the three of em standin in a row by the wheel  how did they get there  bein warlocks they flew sir  you didnt see m go by you did you sir  no i admitted  they never went by me  poor tom spink groaned  but there are lines aloft there on which they could cross over from mizzen to jigger i added  send wada to me  when the latter relieved me i went aft  and there in a row were our three palehaired stormwaifs with the topaz eyes  in the light of a bullseye held on them by louis their eyes never seemed more like the eyes of great cats  and heavens they purred  at least the inarticulate noises they made sounded more like purring than anything else  that these sounds meant friendliness was very evident  also they held out their hands palms upward in unmistakable sign of peace  each in turn doffed his cap and placed my hand for a moment on his head without doubt this meant their offer of fealty their acceptance of me as master  i nodded my head  there was nothing to be said to men who purred like cats while signlanguage in the light of the bullseye was rather difficult  tom spink groaned protest when i told louis to take them below and give them blankets  i made the sleepsign to them and they nodded gratefully hesitated then pointed to their mouths and rubbed their stomachs  drowned men do not eat i laughed to tom spink  go down and watch them  feed them up louis all they want  its a good sign of short rations forard  at the end of half an hour tom spink was back  well did they eat i challenged him  but he was unconvinced  the very quantity they had eaten was a suspicious thing and further he had heard of a kind of ghost that devoured dead bodies in graveyards  therefore he concluded mere non eating was no test for a ghost  the third event of moment occurred this morning at seven oclock  the mutineers called for a truce and when nosey murphy the maltese cockney and the inevitable charles davis stood beneath me on the main deck their faces showed lean and drawn  famine had been my great ally  and in truth with margaret beside me in that high place of the break of the poop as i looked down on the hungry wretches i felt very strong  never had the inequality of numbers fore and aft been less than now  the three deserters added to our own nine made twelve of us while the mutineers after subtracting ditman olansen bob and the faun totalled only an even score  and of these bert rhine must certainly be in a bad way while there were many weaklings such as sundry buyers nancy larry and lars jacobsen  well what do you want i demanded  i havent much time to waste breakfast is ready and waiting  charles davis started to speak but i shut him off  ill have nothing out of you davis  at least not now  later on when im in that court of law youve bothered me with for half the voyage youll get your turn at talking  and when that time comes dont forget that i shall have a few words to say  again he began but this time was stopped by nosey murphy  aw shut your trap davis the gangster snarled or ill shut it for you  he glanced up to me  we want to go back to work thats what we want  which is not the way to ask for it i answered  sir he added hastily  thats better i commented  oh my god sir dont let m come aft  tom spink muttered hurriedly in my ear  thatd be the end of all of us  and even if they didnt get you an the rest theyd heave me over some dark night  they aint never goin to forgive me sir for joinin in with the afterguard  i ignored the interruption and addressed the gangster  theres nothing like going to work when you want to as badly as you seem to  suppose all hands get sail on her just to show good intention  wed like to eat first sir he objected  id like to see you setting sail first was my reply  and you may as well get it from me straight that what i like goes aboard this shipi almost said hooker  nosey murphy hesitated and looked to the maltese cockney for counsel  the latter debated as if gauging the measure of his weakness while he stared aloft at the work involved  finally he nodded  all right sir the gangster spoke up  well do it    but cant something be cookin in the galley while were doin it  i shook my head  i didnt have that in mind and i dont care to change my mind now  when every sail is stretched and every yard braced and all that mess of gear cleared up food for a good meal will be served out  you neednt bother about the spanker nor the mizzenbraces  well make your work lighter by that much  in truth as they climbed aloft they showed how miserably weak they were there were some too feeble to go aloft  poor sundry buyers continually pressed his abdomen as he toiled around the deckcapstans and never was nancys face quite so forlorn as when he obeyed the maltese cockneys command and went up to loose the mizzenskysail  in passing i must note one delicious miracle that was worked before our eyes  they were hoisting the mizzenuppertopsailyard by means of one of the patent deckcapstans  although they had reversed the gear so as to double the purchase they were having a hard time of it  lars jacobsen was limping on his twicebroken leg and with him were sundry buyers tony the greek bombini and mulligan jacobs  nosey murphy held the turn  when they stopped from sheer exhaustion murphys glance chanced to fall on charles davis the one man who had not worked since the outset of the voyage and who was not working now  bear a hand davis the gangster called  margaret gurgled low laughter in my ear as she caught the drift of the episode  the sealawyer looked at the other in amazement ere he answered  i guess not  after nodding sundry buyers over to him to take the turn murphy straightened his back and walked close to davis then said very quietly  i guess yes  that was all  for a space neither spoke  davis seemed to be giving the matter judicial consideration  the men at the capstan panted rested and looked onall save bombini who slunk across the deck until he stood at murphys shoulder  under such circumstances the decision charles davis gave was eminently the right one although even then he offered a compromise  ill hold the turn he volunteered  youll lump around one of them capstanbars murphy said  the sealawyer made no mistake  he knew in all absoluteness that he was choosing between life and death and he limped over to the capstan and found his place  and as the work started and as he toiled around and around the narrow circle margaret and i shamelessly and loudly laughed our approval  and our own men stole forard along the poop to peer down at the spectacle of charles davis at work  all of which must have pleased nosey murphy for as he continued to hold the turn and coil down he kept a critical eye on davis  more juice davis he commanded with abrupt sharpness  and davis with a startle visibly increased his efforts  this was too much for our fellows who asiatics and all applauded with laughter and handclapping  and what could i do  it was a gala day and our faithful ones deserved some little recompense of amusement  so i ignored the breach of discipline and of poop etiquette by strolling away aft with margaret  at the wheel was one of our stormwaifs  i set the course due east for valparaiso and sent the steward below to bring up sufficient food for one substantial meal for the mutineers  when do we get our next grub sir nosey murphy asked as the steward served the supplies down to him from the poop  at midday i answered  and as long as you and your gang are good youll get your grub three times each day  you can choose your own watches any way you please  but the ships work must be done and done properly  if it isnt then the grub stops  that will do  now go forard  one thing more sir he said quickly  bert rhine is awful bad  he cant see sir  it looks like hes going to lose his face  he cant sleep  he groans all the time        it was a busy day  i made a selection of things from the medicinechest for the acidburned gangster and finding that murphy knew how to manipulate a hypodermic syringe entrusted him with one  then too i practised with the sextant and think i fairly caught the sun at noon and correctly worked up the observation  but this is latitude and is comparatively easy  longitude is more difficult  but i am reading up on it  all afternoon a gentle northerly fan of air snored the elsinore through the water at a fiveknot clip and our course lay east for land for the habitations of men for the law and order that men institute whenever they organize into groups  once in valparaiso with police flag flying our mutineers will be taken care of by the shore authorities  another thing i did was to rearrange our watches aft so as to split up the three stormvisitors  margaret took one in her watch along with the two sailmakers tom spink and louis  louis is half white and all trustworthy so that at all times on deck or below he is told off to the task of never letting the topazeyed one out of his sight  in my watch are the steward buckwheat wada and the other two topaz eyed ones  and to one of them wada is told off and to the other is assigned the steward  we are not taking any chances  always night and day on duty or off these stormstrangers will have one of our proved men watching them        yes and i tried the stranger men out last evening  it was after a council with margaret  she was sure and i agreed with her that the men forard are not blindly yielding to our bringing them in to be prisoners in valparaiso  as we tried to forecast it their plan is to desert the elsinore in the boats as soon as we fetch up with the land  also considering some of the bitter lunatic spirits forard there would be a large chance of their drilling the elsinores steel sides and scuttling her ere they took to the boats  for scuttling a ship is surely as ancient a practice as mutiny on the high seas  so it was at one in the morning that i tried out our strangers  two of them i took forard with me in the raid on the small boats  one i left beside margaret who kept charge of the poop  on the other side of him stood the steward with his big hacking knife  by signs i had made it clear to him and to his two comrades who were to accompany me forard that at the first sign of treachery he would be killed  and not only did the old steward with signs emphatic and unmistakable pledge himself to perform the execution but we were all convinced that he was eager for the task  with margaret i also left buckwheat and tom spink  wada the two sail makers louis and the two topazeyed ones accompanied me  in addition to fighting weapons we were armed with axes  we crossed the main deck unobserved gained the bridge by way of the midshiphouse and by way of the bridge gained the top of the forardhouse  here were the first boats we began work on but first of all i called in the lookout from the forecastlehead  he was mulligan jacobs and he picked his way back across the wreck of the bridge where the foretopgallantyard still lay and came up to me unafraid as implacable and bitter as ever  jacobs i whispered you are to stay here beside me until we finish the job of smashing the boats  do you get that  as though it could fright me he growled all too loudly  go ahead for all i care  i know your game  and i know the game of the hells maggots under our feet this minute  tis they thatd desert in the boats  tis you thatll smash the boats an jail m kit an crew  sssh i vainly interpolated  what of it he went on as loudly as ever  theyre sleepin with full bellies  the only night watch we keep is the lookout  even rhines asleep  a few jolts of the needle has put a clapper to his eternal moanin  go on with your work  smash the boats  tis nothin i care tis well i know my own crooked back is worth more to me than the necks of the scum of the world below there  if you felt that way why didnt you join us i queried  because i like you no better than them an not half so well  they are what you an your fathers have made em  an who in hell are you an your fathers  robbers of the toil of men  i like them little  i like you and your fathers not at all  only i like myself and me crooked back thats a livin proof there aint no god and makes browning a liar  join us now i urged meeting him in his mood  it will be easier for your back  to hell with you was his answer  go ahead an smash the boats  you can hang some of them  but you cant touch me with the law  tis me thats a crippled creature of circumstance too weak to raise a hand against any mana feather blown about by the windy contention of men strong in their back an brainless in their heads  as you please i said  as i cant help pleasin he retorted bein what i am an so made for the little flash between the darknesses which men call life  now why couldnt i aben a butterfly or a fat pig in a full trough or a mere mortal man with a straight back an women to love me  go on an smash the boats  play hell to the top of your bent  like me youll end in the darkness  and your darknessll beas dark as mine  a full belly puts the spunk back into you i sneered  tis on an empty belly that the juice of my dislike turns to acid  go on an smash the boats  whose idea was the sulphur i asked  im not tellin you the man but i envied him until it showed failure an whose idea was itto douse the sulphuric into rhines face  hell lose that same face from the way its shedding  nor will i tell you i said  though i will tell you that i am glad the idea was not mine  oh well he muttered cryptically different customs on different ships as the cook said when he went forard to cast off the spanker sheet  not until the job was done and i was back on the poop did i have time to work out the drift of that last figure in its terms of the sea  mulligan jacobs might have been an artist a philosophic poet had he not been born crooked with a crooked back  and we smashed the boats  with axes and sledges it was an easier task than i had imagined  on top of both houses we left the boats masses of splintered wreckage the topazeyed ones working most energetically and we regained the poop without a shot being fired  the forecastle turned out of course at our noise but made no attempt to interfere with us  and right here i register another complaint against the seanovelists  a score of men forard desperate all with desperate deeds behind them and jail and the gallows facing them not many days away should have only begun to fight  and yet this score of men did nothing while we destroyed their last chance for escape  but where did they get the grub the steward asked me afterwards  this question he has asked me every day since the first day mr pike began cudgelling his brains over it  i wonder had i asked mulligan jacobs the question if he would have told me  at any rate in court at valparaiso that question will be answered  in the meantime i suppose i shall submit to having the steward ask me it daily  it is murder and mutiny on the high seas i told them this morning when they came aft in a body to complain about the destruction of the boats and to demand my intentions  and as i looked down upon the poor wretches from the break of the poop standing there in the high place the vision of my kind down all its mad violent and masterful past was strong upon me  already since our departure from baltimore three other men masters had occupied this high place and gone their waythe samurai mr pike and mr mellaire  i stood here fourth no seaman merely a master by the blood of my ancestors and the work of the elsinore in the world went on  bert rhine his head and face swathed in bandages stood there beneath me and i felt for him a tingle of respect  he too in a subterranean ghetto way was master over his rats  nosey murphy and kid twist stood shoulder to shoulder with their stricken gangster leader  it was his will because of his terrible injury to get in to land and doctors as quickly as possible  he preferred taking his chance in court against the chance of losing his life or perhaps his eyesight  the crew was divided against itself and isaac chantz the jew his wounded shoulder with a hunch to it seemed to lead the revolt against the gangsters  his wound was enough to convict him in any court and well he knew it  beside him and at his shoulders clustered the maltese cockney andy fay arthur deacon frank fitzgibbon richard giller and john hackey  in another group still allegiant to the gangsters were men such as shorty sorensen lars jacobsen and larry  charles davis was prominently in the gangster group  a fourth group was composed of sundry buyers nancy and tony the greek  this group was distinctly neutral and finally unaffiliated quite by himself stood mulligan jacobslistening i fancy to far echoes of ancient wrongs and feeling i doubt not the bite of the ironhot hooks in his brain  what are you going to do with us sir isaac chantz demanded of me in defiance to the gangsters who were expected to do the talking  bert rhine lurched angrily toward the sound of the jews voice  chantzs partisans drew closer to him  jail you i answered from above  and it shall go as hard with all of you as i can make it hard  maybe you will an maybe you wont the jew retorted  shut up chantz bert rhine commanded  and youll get yours you wop chantz snarled if i have to do it myself  i am afraid that i am not so successfully the man of action that i have been priding myself on being for so curious and interested was i in observing the moving drama beneath me that for the moment i failed to glimpse the tragedy into which it was culminating  bombini bert rhine said  his voice was imperative  it was the order of a master to the dog at heel  bombini responded  he drew his knife and started to advance upon the jew  but a deep rumbling animallike in its sound and menace arose in the throats of those about the jew  bombini hesitated and glanced back across his shoulder at the leader whose face he could not see for bandages and who he knew could not see  tis a good deeddo it bombini charles davis encouraged  shut your face davis came out from bert rhines bandages  kid twist drew a revolver shoved the muzzle of it first into bombinis side then covered the men about the jew  really i felt a momentary twinge of pity for the italian  he was caught between the millstones bombini stick that jew bert rhine commanded  the italian advanced a step and shoulder to shoulder on either side kid twist and nosey murphy advanced with him  i cannot see him bert rhine went on but by god i will see him  and so speaking with one single virile movement he tore away the bandages  the toll of pain he must have paid is beyond measurement  i saw the horror of his face but the description of it is beyond the limits of any english i possess  i was aware that margaret at my shoulder gasped and shuddered  bombinistick him the gangster repeated  and stick any man that raises a yap  murphy  see that bombini does his work  murphys knife was out and at the bravos back  kid twist covered the jews group with his revolver  and the three advanced  it was at this moment that i suddenly recollected myself and passed from dream to action  bombini i said sharply  he paused and looked up  stand where you are i ordered till i do some talkingchantz  make no mistake  rhine is boss forard  you take his orders    until we get into valparaiso then youll take your chances along with him in jail  in the meantime what rhine says goes  get that and get it straight  i am behind rhine until the police come on boardbombini do whatever rhine tells you  ill shoot the man who tries to stop youdeacon  stand away from chantz  go over to the fiferail  all hands knew the stream of lead my automatic rifle could throw and arthur deacon knew it  he hesitated barely a moment then obeyed  fitzgibbongillerhackey i called in turn and was obeyed  fay i called twice ere the response came  isaac chantz stood alone and bombini now showed eagerness  chantz i said dont you think it would be healthier to go over to the fiferail and be good  he debated the matter not many seconds resheathed his knife and complied  the tang of power  i was minded to let literature get the better of me and read the rascals a lecture but thank heaven i had sufficient proportion and balance to refrain  rhine i said  he turned his corroded face up to me and blinked in an effort to see  as long as chantz takes your orders leave him alone  well need every hand to work the ship in  as for yourself send murphy aft in half an hour and ill give him the best the medicinechest affords  that is all go forard  and they shambled away beaten and dispirited  but that manhis facewhat happened to him margaret asked of me  sad it is to end love with lies  sadder still is it to begin love with lies  i had tried to hide this one happening from margaret and i had failed  it could no longer be hidden save by lying and so i told her the truth told her how and why the gangster had had his face dashed with sulphuric acid by the old steward who knew white men and their ways        there is little more to write  the mutiny of the elsinore is over  the divided crew is ruled by the gangsters who are as intent on getting their leader into port as i am intent on getting all of them into jail the first lap of the voyage of the elsinore draws to a close  two days at most with our present sailing will bring us into valparaiso and then as beginning a new voyage the elsinore will depart for seattle        one thing more remains for me to write and then this strange log of a strange cruise will be complete  it happened only last night  i am yet fresh from it and athrill with it and with the promise of it  margaret and i spent the last hour of the second dogwatch together at the break of the poop  it was good again to feel the elsinore yielding to the windpressure on her canvas to feel her again slipping and sliding through the water in an easy sea  hidden by the darkness clasped in each others arms we talked love and love plans  nor am i shamed to confess that i was all for immediacy once in valparaiso i contended we would fit out the elsinore with fresh crew and officers and send her on her way  as for us steamers and rapid travelling would fetch us quickly home  furthermore valparaiso being a place where such things as licences and ministers obtained we would be married ere we caught the fast steamers for home  but margaret was obdurate  the wests had always stood by their ships she urged had always brought their ships in to the ports intended or had gone down with their ships in the effort  the elsinore had cleared from baltimore for seattle with the wests in the high place  the elsinore would reequip with officers and men in valparaiso and the elsinore would arrive in seattle with a west still on board  but think dear heart i objected  the voyage will require months remember what henley has said every kiss we take or give leaves us less of life to live  she pressed her lips to mine  we kiss she said  but i was stupid        oh the weary weary months i complained  you dear silly she gurgled  dont you understand  i understand only that it is many a thousand miles from valparaiso to seattle i answered  you wont understand she challenged  i am a fool i admitted  i am aware of only one thing i want you  i want you  you are a dear but you are very very stupid she said and as she spoke she caught my hand and pressed the palm of it against her cheek what do you feel she asked  hot cheekscheeks most hot  i am blushing for what your stupidity compels me to say she explained you have already said that such things as licences and ministers obtain in valparaiso    and    and well      you mean     i stammered  just that she confirmed  the honeymoon shall be on the elsinore from valparaiso all the way to seattle i rattled on  the many thousands of miles the weary weary months she teased in my own intonations until i stifled her teasing with my lips
